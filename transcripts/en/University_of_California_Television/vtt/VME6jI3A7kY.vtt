00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.113
(gentle music)

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.330
- So my lab is interested
in the development of

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.590
new high speed volumetric
imaging techniques

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.489
with the goal of understanding
how neural circuits

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.710
give rise to behavior.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.320
You have heard already a number
of fascinating talks today

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.180
and also the motivations
for why we need these tools.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.660
For us, I just want to
briefly summarize also

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.380
why, from a biological point of view,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.026
we are developing these techniques.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:41.100
This basically comes down to what has been

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.760
already mentioned previously
which is related to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.110
the incredible density
of the interconnectedness

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.180
of the neurons in the brain.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.390
So if we think about the human brain,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.110
it has about 80 billion
neurons and we take out

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.650
two of the neurons randomly,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.864
they are only connected
over two or three synapses.

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:02.960
So this alone shows us that in many cases

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.070
information may be not represented by

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.045
the individual elements of these systems

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:10.830
but rather by space of the network.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.930
Therefore we intrinsically
need to move forward

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.790
and record from many
neurons at the same time.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.480
So these are some of the questions

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.890
that we are interested in approaching

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.460
by developing these
technologies in the lab.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.530
You have heard also about parallel efforts

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.583
that are going on on
the level of connectomes

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.350
that are related to the understanding

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.190
the wiring diagram or the connectivity.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.830
But I think connectome will not be

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.510
answering us these questions.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.520
It may be, so the
connectome may be putting us

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.110
a constrain on how we can
approach this question

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.200
but it will be not
sufficient to answer them,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.470
and the best example comes from C. Elegans

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.080
that we also heard about.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.660
The C. Elegans have only 300 neurons.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.410
The connectome is mapped out
already for over 30 years.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.320
Nevertheless, we still cannot predict

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.960
the behavior of C. Elegans.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.850
So that is really the motivation for us,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.172
why we want to move forward and develop,

00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:06.410
move towards functional
maps of neural circuits

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.660
and particular what is
necessary is we need

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.890
to have tools that allow
us to do two things.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.220
On one hand, we want to
be able to do stimulation

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.110
of defined spatial temporal
patterns effectivity

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.129
on a genetically identical set of neurons

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.310
and combined it with a
parallel and unbiased recording

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.950
from an entire population
while we are doing that.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.410
And you can also think about
if you had these tools,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.150
how we would be going conceptually

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.865
about approaching some of these questions

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:35.240
and what we would like
to do is we would like

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.624
to use methods from machine
learning, graph theory,

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:41.460
and information theory to approach them,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.700
so in this example you can imagine that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.520
the first set of tools could allow us to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.960
position ourself in each
of these individual states

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.810
of this abstract space
that are state space

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.500
and then by having the ability
to observe how these points

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.470
evolve to other points,
we could build over time

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.300
transition probability
maps that could inform us

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.350
about the probability of the transitions

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.750
and use them to inform models

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.700
that could be generative of
the dynamics of the brain.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.929
And ultimately what we are interested in

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:17.570
to work towards the discovery
of the underlying algorithms.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.410
So about seven, eight years ago

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.640
when we started with this project

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.510
we first focused on the first topic

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.360
and developed basically
based on optigenetics

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.360
methods that allow us to sculpt
the distribution of light

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.630
and thereby stimulating individual neurons

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.090
at high speed and resolution.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.690
And more over the last few years,

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.510
we have focused on the second topic

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.930
which is the parallel
and unbiased recording

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.830
and here we have developed a portfolio

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.960
of different techniques that
are addressing this question

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.580
from the level of small
organisms and C. Elegans

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.320
and more recently in the more
scattering brain of rodents

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.210
and we are moving also
towards the primate imaging.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.850
So and today I would like basically

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.340
to give you a vignette
of some of the techniques

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.020
that we have developed,
mainly around the idea

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.810
of light sculpting that
has found application

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.110
both in the smaller,
semi-transparent C. Elegans

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.680
but as I will show you also
could be useful technique

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.460
for imaging the rodent brain.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.810
So I would like to introduce

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.880
the basic idea of light sculpting

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.660
and those of you who
are familiar with optics

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.760
and microscopy techniques quickly realize

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.690
that in any kind of microscope basically,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.810
the two parameters that are describing

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.460
the confinement of the light in our sample

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.040
are given by two things.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.750
One is the spot size of the beam

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.120
that we choose to
illuminate the sample with

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.920
and the other one is the depth of field

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.500
or the axle confinement.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.760
And you have heard this also in many talks

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.653
and with the problems that we are facing

00:04:54.653 --> 00:04:58.050
in some sense is the fact
that these two parameters

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.470
that are fundamentally defining
the properties of light

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.820
in the sample are both given

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.100
by the wavelength of light, lamda,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.330
and the numerical aperture of the optics

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.070
which is basically the ratio between

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.070
the diameter of the lens
and the focal length.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.681
So it's as such the two
are inherently coupled

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:19.650
and so whenever we choose our spot size

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.030
to be a certain size, we inevitably end up

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.820
with a certain axle
confinement or depth of field.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.380
And what we are basically asking

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.670
is how can we go beyond that and come up

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.930
with a technique that
can allow us to create

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.340
more arbitrary distributions
of light within the sample.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.900
Now as you have heard,
the lamda is the basic

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.970
the wavelength of light, so if we set also

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.010
our wavelength fix then there is no way

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.760
around this coupling, so we will end up

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.150
inevitably for every given spot size

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.270
with given depth of field.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.700
However if we go to a different situation,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.940
you have heard also about
two photon microscopy

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.480
and in two photon microscopy
it's typically based

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.230
on the use of femtosecond pulses of light,

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.230
and use the so-called
uncertainty ration shape

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.550
which says that if you
choose the time very short,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.150
you end up with an uncertainty and energy

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.140
which translates in an
uncertainty into colors

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.470
means that if we use femtosecond pulses,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.300
we are no longer dealing
with a single wavelength

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.280
but with a spectrum.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.560
As you can see at least by

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.200
exploiting that spectrum effectively,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.390
this constraint that I was

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.730
mentioning before could be relaxed.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.770
And so one way how this can be done

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.410
has been shown to be through the technique

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.190
of so-called temporal focusing

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.090
that I'd like to introduce to you briefly.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.720
So the basic idea is we use

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.300
these femtosecond pulses of light.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.620
We send them to disperse development,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.160
for instance a gradient.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.440
And what the gradient does
it sends the different

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.600
spectral component within the pulse,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.070
along different spatial directions.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.100
So as the pulse is propagating
away from the gradient,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.270
the peak intensity drops off
as a function of propagation

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.980
and this leads basically to a dilution

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.430
of the photons in space,
so a pulse like that

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.280
is not very effective in
exciting the molecules,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.380
so we reduce the two photon
excitation probability

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.310
as a function of propagation.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.793
Now we reverse the process
by using a telescope

00:07:17.793 --> 00:07:22.460
that is consisting of a lens
and our microscope objective,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.130
and what that telescope
does is forms an image here

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.410
in the sample of our originally
short pulse on the gradient.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.810
So what it means is that there will be

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.900
only one plane in the axle location

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.790
where all these spectral components

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.300
will be again co-localized
both in time and space,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.330
leading to this high energetic pulse

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.920
that is very effective in
exciting the molecules,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.351
but outside of that
region we are basically

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:50.090
dealing with a dispersed pulse

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.880
and such pulses are not very effective

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.070
in exciting the molecules.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.040
So what we can achieve in this way,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.870
we can achieve the localization

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.340
of excitation in the axle direction

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.365
by manipulating the spectral
properties of the pulse

00:08:04.365 --> 00:08:06.530
and thereby basically decouple it

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.940
from the lateral confinement and have the,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.220
reserve the lateral
confinement to basically

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.560
choose the spot size that we are

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.130
interested in in the sample

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.710
by basically illuminating the pulse

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.080
and decorating with a different size.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.050
Just to draw the
comparison to the standard

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.120
two photon microscope that
we are more familiar with,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.000
in the standard two photon microscope,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.620
both the localization
laterally and axially are,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.450
are generated by the focusing in space

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.370
and in the temporal focusing,

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.490
the axle localization is
generated by manipulating

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.550
the spectral properties of the pulse

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.220
and laterally we can focus in space.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.620
So going to the problem of
large scale volumetric imaging,

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.170
we thought instead of now
exciting each of the neurons

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.650
at once and scanning it,

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.170
we could use that to
create a sheet of light

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.580
similar to Philipp's
light sheet microscopy,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.270
in this case we can create a sheet

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.530
that is spanning about over 75 microns,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.530
but still be axially confined
to about two microns.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.840
So the main difference is that it is

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.170
a two photon excitation and it
doesn't require the geometry

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.820
that you saw before where
you have the two objectives

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.260
being orthogonal to each other.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.000
So the idea was exciting a
field of view of that size

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.320
and then scanning that
sheet axially quickly

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.670
to capture the volume, and
we wanted to use GCaMP again

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.550
as our calcium indicator.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.030
And the reason why we chose that size

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.820
was that we were interested in looking

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.379
at the brain of C. Elegans that is roughly

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:39.050
would fit in that volume.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.210
So now if you want to
do two photon excitation

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.440
of a sheet of that size, this doesn't work

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.370
with the conventional laser sources

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.810
that people have been using

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.990
for two photon scanning microscopy.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.530
You need significantly
higher pulse energies.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.457
And for that, we used so-called
regenerative amplifier

00:09:55.457 --> 00:09:56.880
that is shown here.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.959
Basically it is seated by a conventional

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:03.230
two photon laser, and
what it does it creates

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.550
a significantly higher pulse energies

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.980
but at the lower repetition rates.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.967
And so the pulses are
now send to the gradient

00:10:10.967 --> 00:10:14.300
and here you have the
temporally focusing set up

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.720
that I was describing and the fluorescence

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.570
is now excited here and then collected,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.580
separated by a dichloric and sent

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.850
to a detector that we have designed

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.090
based on so-called image
intensifier and a camera.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.550
So overall you can see
that we can create now

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.616
a sheet that is about 75 microns

00:10:32.616 --> 00:10:35.790
and being axially confined to two.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.460
And what this allows us basically

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.470
is to go at very high speeds,

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.430
about 200 frames per second

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.640
or video rate of volumetric imaging.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.650
So I said earlier we wanted to apply it

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.200
to the brain of C. Elegans and in neurons

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.500
we wanted to record from here

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.650
are located in so-called head
gamene and are shown here.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.440
And this was done in a collaboration

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.330
with my former colleague, Manuel Zimmer

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.520
who is at INP.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.180
So when we first expressed
GCaMP into all of these

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.370
head ganglion neurons, we saw that

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.420
due to the incredible
density of the neurons

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.670
and the small size, we couldn't

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.713
distinguish them individually.

00:11:15.713 --> 00:11:18.060
So we came up with the idea of using

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.000
a nuclear localized version of GCaMP.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.780
Basically it has a nuclear
localization sequence

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.710
that drove the expression
of GCaMP into the nuclei

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.230
and then we could nicely see that

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.200
the neurons were localized
in all dimensions.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.322
So we could apply our wide
field imaging technique

00:11:34.322 --> 00:11:37.227
and what I'm showing you here
is now a three dimensional

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:41.300
maximum intensity projection
of about 120 neurons

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.520
of the worm, and during
spontaneous activity.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.990
So you see significant
spontaneous activity.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.240
Certain neurons are correlated,
others are anti-correlated

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.630
to each other, and this is all recorded

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.610
at about five volumes per second.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.940
Our method can go about
four or five times faster,

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.380
but neurons in C. Elegans
have intrinsically

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.620
low responding or slow
responding time scales,

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.790
so we chose to image them
at the lower frame rates.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.250
Now if you have such a
high dimensional system,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.463
and you want to make sense out of it

00:12:16.463 --> 00:12:18.690
so one simple way of asking

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.470
what are these neurons telling us

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.680
and what are they doing is to
do dimensionality reduction.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.000
And one simple way of doing it is to

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.140
doing principle component analysis,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.020
which is like asking what
are the most components

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.350
in this system that it
can rise to the variance

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.180
that we are observing here?

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.840
So when we do PCA,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.470
we observe that about 70%
of the variance of this data

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.710
was explainable by the first
three principle components

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.870
that are now shown here, and here you see

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.780
the color is not encoding for the time.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.580
Now again, the great
advantage of C. Elegans

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.150
comes from the fact that
we have the connectome,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.324
so we can map these principle components

00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:04.150
back to the known
connectome and what we found

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.032
was that the first principle components

00:13:06.032 --> 00:13:09.060
was basically an antagonism
between different

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.083
interneurons and head motor neurons.

00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:12.930
The second principle component

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.790
was a class of head motor neurons

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.396
and the third principle component

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:21.110
was antagonism between
different head motor neurons.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.988
And we could now display
these principle components

00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:26.600
in the face space and what we observed

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.865
was an interesting behavior which showed

00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:32.670
sort of trajectory that was reproducible

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.060
and also was characterized by regions

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.060
that resembled attractors,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.063
which you can see now in
this movie much better

00:13:39.063 --> 00:13:42.710
as the states of the brain are evolving,

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.860
you see that the brain
seems to be spending time

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.350
in one of these attractors

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.030
and then it's switching back and going

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.984
to another attractor coming back again

00:13:49.984 --> 00:13:52.670
and going on and on and so on.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.410
So this was an interesting observation

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.233
and now we have increasing evidence,

00:13:57.233 --> 00:13:59.460
mainly from the lab of Manuel

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.800
who has been looking also in these animals

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.017
during free behavior, and what we know is

00:14:04.017 --> 00:14:07.440
these attractors correspond
now to unique motor programs

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.790
such as forwards crawling,
backward crawling,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.810
left and right movement and so on.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.400
So it seems that during
spontaneous activity,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.090
the brain is randomly switching

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.040
between these possible motor programs,

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.950
and in the presence of the stimulus

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.210
this landscape could be tilted such

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.120
that the probability of one of them

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.620
being assumed over the
other could be modulated.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.060
So we are following up
on this biologically

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.293
and interested in developing techniques

00:14:32.293 --> 00:14:35.280
that allow us to observe this behavior

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.520
during free navigation as the animal

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.720
is making left right type of decisions

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.180
and see what kind of
things can we observe here?

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.570
So while working on
this, we have been also

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.793
trying to push these methods further

00:14:49.793 --> 00:14:53.210
and I would like to give you an overview

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.480
of another technique,
and this is related to

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.870
how can we extend these
techniques into the mouse brain

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.490
and look at the larger
scale in scattering tissue.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.880
So since many of you are
familiar with conventional

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.890
two photon scanning microscopy,

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.100
I just want to briefly take a moment

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.700
and outline the limitations,

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.000
the fundamental limitations
of two photon microscopy.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.290
Let's assume that we were interested

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:21.640
in recording from a volume
that is about 500 micron cubed

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.270
and this would be about the size

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.160
of our diffraction limited spot

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.270
and we want to record from this
volume at about five hertz.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.680
Now if we do the simple math,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.090
this is our 500 million voxels

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.800
and recording them at five hertz requires

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.870
a 2.5 gigahertz acquisition rate

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.850
and therefore if you want to at least

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.660
excite each pixel with one pulse

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.770
we would need to have a laser

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.050
that runs at that repetition rate.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.910
So lasers are conventionally
not available at this rate,

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.800
but even if they would be we
are facing another problem

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.020
that is that each individual voxel

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.410
we will be spending only .4 nanoseconds

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.780
which is about an order
of magnitude shorter

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.450
than the fluorescent's lifetime.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.200
It means we will not be able to collect

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.510
any fluorescence out of these voxels.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.520
So one conceptual
solution that we need to,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.650
that we could employ here

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.520
is to minimize the spatial resolution

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.456
or the sampling grate

00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:20.830
to the limit of the structure of interest.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.400
So if we are interested for instance

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.320
in recording from individual cell bodies

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.240
or for individual neurons,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.770
this resolution in some
way may be too good

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.811
and we are paying the price for that

00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:34.890
by having a reduced
volumetric acquisition rate.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.560
So the question becomes in some way

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.220
how can we relax the spatial resolution

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.420
in a meaningful manner?

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.260
So cortical neurons are a new order

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.420
of about 10 to 15 microns

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.350
and this is the size of
the point split function,

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.560
and in some ways people
are mainly using that

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.080
at least for this kind of imaging

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.500
because they are mainly interested

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.840
in the axle sectioning capability.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.960
So we could in principle relax

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.220
the spatial resolution
laterally by for instance

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.400
underfilling the microscope objective,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.800
but if we do that then we will end up

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.120
with a beam that is going
axially about 70 microns

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.638
for the reasons I mentioned before,

00:17:10.638 --> 00:17:13.890
so what we really want
is to be able to sculpt

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.890
and isotropically sculpted
point split function

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.720
naturally and axially,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.070
and so and thereby we would also need

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:25.440
to be able to decouple again the lateral

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.770
from the axial confinement,
and this is again

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.880
where light sculpting comes in.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.390
So the idea here is now
instead of sculpting

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.700
our point split function
to be a large sheet,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.102
as I was showing you before, in this case

00:17:37.102 --> 00:17:40.285
we sculpt it to be an isotropically shaped

00:17:40.285 --> 00:17:44.240
five micron sphere which shown here

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.550
and then we can scan
this by various methods.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.240
This is in conventional
way, laterally and axially

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.650
to cover the volume.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.730
So going back to the
example that I showed you,

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.769
so the one million pixels
are now translating

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:03.769
at five hertz to about five
megahertz acquisition rate

00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:08.496
which is more realistically possible

00:18:08.496 --> 00:18:13.230
with laser technology, and
also we get a much higher pixel

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.470
time at each of them so we can collect

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.920
significantly more fluorescence.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.400
So nevertheless, if you look at the size

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.640
of this point split function

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.573
it's still 130 times larger
than the conventional

00:18:24.573 --> 00:18:27.150
diffraction limited point split function,

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.310
so lasers that were
developed for that excitation

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.068
wouldn't work here because
they lack again the sufficient

00:18:34.068 --> 00:18:36.090
laser pulse energies.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.539
So we built a laser in our own lab

00:18:38.539 --> 00:18:41.950
that was running at about 4.1 megahertz

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.420
and delivered .5 microjule
pulses that are enough

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.214
to excited these sized
point split functions

00:18:48.214 --> 00:18:51.540
and this was integrated
into a scanned version

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.610
of the temporal focusing setup

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.720
which is consisting basically of mirrors

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.770
that are then scanning the beam

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.480
that is illuminating the grating

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.530
and the grating together with the lens

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.149
and the objective is performing
the temporal focusing

00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:09.500
and we are scanning it up
and down with an objective.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.570
So we collect now in fluorescence

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.910
instead of on camera from each of these

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.990
point split functions on a PMT

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.340
and the acquisition is also synchronized

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.420
with the excitation, so we are running

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.320
in the domain that we're having
one pulse per pixel only.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.286
So this is just an impression
of the home built laser

00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:31.000
and its integration to the

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.370
scanned temporal focusing microscope.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.410
Next we were interested
in recording the activity

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.850
from en vivo in the mouse brain,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.270
so we used mice where we expressed GCaMP

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.680
in the motor cortical areas and the PBC

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.770
while they were awake and were running.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.382
So with this we can now go deep

00:19:48.382 --> 00:19:51.210
and look at the layer two three neurons

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.800
and record from them as you can see here

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.550
at about 200 microns depth

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.170
from about 110 neurons or so.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.720
We can go also deeper
to lay out five neurons

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.200
at about 470 microns,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.087
record from a similar number of neurons

00:20:06.087 --> 00:20:09.050
and what is important here now to realize

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.940
is we are now looking at a field of view

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.870
that is about 500 by 500 and
can capture that at 160 hertz.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.640
So this is way too fast for a single plane

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.990
given the slow response time of calcium,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.450
so what we could do is
to use the time instead

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.570
and look at two planes for
instance at the same time,

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.550
which is now shown here.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.240
One at 150, the other one at 350 microns

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.150
recorded simultaneously,

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.020
or going back to the example
that I was outlining,

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.317
we can now go here and
record from a volume

00:20:39.317 --> 00:20:42.390
that is now about 500 micron cubed,

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.750
encompassing about 4,000 neurons

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.340
and record all of that at about
three hertz volumetric rate.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.139
So here you start also to see this

00:20:50.139 --> 00:20:52.170
layered structure of the cortex,

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.290
the layered two three neurons
and the layer four neurons

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.090
that try to, that seem to coming out here

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.950
and one of the things that we are now

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.819
collaborating with with other labs

00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:04.880
is trying to understand basically

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.110
how the cortex performs computation.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:09.030
So we know that computation arises

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.920
from complicated interactions

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.740
between different layers
of the cortical neurons,

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.790
but how that is exactly
done is not very clear.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.995
So just to show you what

00:21:20.995 --> 00:21:24.950
we can also observe if you
do some simple data analysis.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.760
This is basically looking at
the top .1% cross correlation

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.630
within a given time window,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.630
what do we observe?

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.310
Interesting functional
connectivities or networks

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.670
that are forming
transiently then also then

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.470
changing over time.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.930
Here the strength of
these lines are indicating

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.070
the degree of the correlation.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.180
So one could look at
these things in principle

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.520
and ask how do they change

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.584
under different behavioral states

00:21:49.584 --> 00:21:54.460
on the diseased states and so on.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.885
So just want to briefly summarize,

00:21:57.885 --> 00:22:00.066
so we saw that this idea of
light sculpting is possible

00:22:00.066 --> 00:22:01.780
by decoupling the lateral

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.920
from the axial parameters of the beam

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.045
and this allows us in the
wide field configuration

00:22:07.045 --> 00:22:09.920
is useful for quoting at high speed

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.020
in semi-transparent
organisms like C. Elegans

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.610
and in combination with
scanning it can be a method

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.350
that allows us to record on
the single cell resolution

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.470
from a large number of neurons
in the scattering brain.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.180
Finally I just want to thank the people

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.914
in the lab who have been
involved in doing the work

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:31.010
and our collaborators

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.660
as well as our funding sources, thank you.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.910
(applause)

00:22:38.703 --> 00:22:41.453
(pleasant music)
