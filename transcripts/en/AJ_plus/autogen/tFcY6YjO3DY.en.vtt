00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.800
the Explorer become a human and we want

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810
the Explorer become a human and we want
 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:38.770
the Explorer become a human and we want
at all we hope we can send the

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780
at all we hope we can send the
 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.110
at all we hope we can send the
spacecraft to visit another object way

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120
spacecraft to visit another object way
 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.840
spacecraft to visit another object way
out there in the solar system and even

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850
out there in the solar system and even
 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.389
out there in the solar system and even
after that you know we may have 10 20 or

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399
after that you know we may have 10 20 or
 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.670
after that you know we may have 10 20 or
30 years hopefully that we can track the

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680
30 years hopefully that we can track the
 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.740
30 years hopefully that we can track the
spacecraft and learn something about the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750
spacecraft and learn something about the
 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:01:03.569
spacecraft and learn something about the
very distant solar system

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579
 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.640
you
