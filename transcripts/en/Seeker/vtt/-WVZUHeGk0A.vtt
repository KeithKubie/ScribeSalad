00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:09.850
Bunny kisses might sound really cute until
you find out that rabbits eat their own poop.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.860
Hey dedicated defecators, Jules here for DNews!

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.980
If you own a dog, or a rabbit, or a dung beetle
(no judgment), then you might have noticed

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.919
that unlike most humans, they love to eat
poop.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.169
Their own poop, the poop of other animals,
it’s like the world is their poop buffet.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.180
And as a responsible pet owner, you may be
inclined to put a stop to this behavior, but

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.169
it turns out: that would make YOU the poopy-head.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.410
The term for when animals eat excrement is
“Coprophagia”, “kopros” coming from

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.140
the greek term for ‘poop’, and “phagia”
being the greek suffix for ‘eating’.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.140
Poop-eating.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.500
And plenty of animals do this, the most common
being rodents, and lagomorphs, which are rabbits,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.730
hares, and pika.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.109
Interestingly, both rodents and lagomorphs
share a common ancestor, which may explain

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.320
their similar habits.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.460
In fact, this poop-eating habit is necessary
for these animals to survive.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.809
See, rodents and lagomorphs have really inefficient
digestive systems; the absorption of food

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.940
happens in the lower gastrointestinal tract,
and very little is actually absorbed.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.470
So, to make sure the necessary nutrients get
into their system, these animals simply run

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.300
them through the digestive system again, by
eating what they excrete.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.650
Interestingly, lagomorphs produce two different
types of poop, one that is hard and inedible

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.520
(they leave that alone), and the other is
soft and nutrient rich, called “cecotropes”

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.930
or “night feces”.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.250
Cecotropes are produced in a different part
of the digestive tract, and are coated with

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.420
mucus so they survive the trip.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.880
And even though it still exits the anus, it
is not technically considered “feces”,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.630
and so technically it’s not coprophagia.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
Either way, these animals are eating something
that came out of their butt.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.390
But rabbits, rodents, and hares are not the
only ones ordering poop for pickup.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.560
The dung beetle, as you can probably imagine,
also eat, well, dung.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.450
They actually extract nutrients, specifically
nitrogen, from animal excrement, and sometimes

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690
use the pile as a nest for their offspring.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.750
Piglets, foals, nonhuman primates and dogs
also eat poop, although less regularly.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.590
The young of some of these mammals, foals
and dogs for example, eat their mother’s

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.630
poop in order to populate their gut bacteria,
which is necessary for breaking down food

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.780
in the stomach.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.470
Moreover, mother dogs will often lick their
puppies anus and genitals to stimulate defecation.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.090
Then, for quick cleanup, the mother dog will
just eat whatever comes out.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.620
I mean, it’s faster than carrying one of
those poop bag dispensers.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.900
This habit of eating mom’s poop, or having
mom eat your poop tends to end after the animal

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.110
is weaned, but some animals seems to acquire
a taste for it, and they keep up the habit.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.910
According to veterinarians, dogs eating poop,
whether it is their own, or a stranger’s,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.290
is natural and generally not harmful.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.750
In rare cases, it can potentially transmit
a disease or cause vomiting and diarrhea.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.200
And, if they jump up to give you a kiss, it’s
a definitely gross.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.010
Now, as for humans, eating poop isn’t quite
so carefree.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.690
Coprophagia is usually associated with mental
illness, and human poop, especially someone

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.690
else’s, can contain bacteria such as shigella,
campylobacter, salmonella and E.coli.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.900
Those can make you VERY sick.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.270
Long story short: rabbits, rats, and dogs
eating poop: usually fine and healthy.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.340
Humans eating poop: Nope.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.100
Nope nope nope.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.660
If you’re into animal poop or just animals that start with P,  you might like the
show Panda Republic.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.510
Now you can watch that and all the other Animal
Planet shows on Animal Planet Go.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.720
So if your dog eats poop, should you let your
dog lick your face?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.440
Or will you get a whole bunch of weird diseases?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.490
You can find out right here.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.200
And what other weird animal habits do you
want to know about?
