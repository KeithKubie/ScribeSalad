Well, I can read it off the graph.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.420
15 hours, I go up to it,
looks like the graph is 150.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.550
So I would make $150.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.330
Of course, I could have gotten that
from my equation y equals 10x, but

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.660
the graph was a better way for
me to visualize this.
