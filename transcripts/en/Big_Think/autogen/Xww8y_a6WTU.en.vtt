my primary goal is a scientist has been

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859
my primary goal is a scientist has been
 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.099
my primary goal is a scientist has been
to just learn as much as we can first

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
to just learn as much as we can first
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.560
to just learn as much as we can first
about the elements of the system and now

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570
about the elements of the system and now
 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.390
about the elements of the system and now
that we know some of the elements how it

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
that we know some of the elements how it
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.999
that we know some of the elements how it
works I mean of course there's interest

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
works I mean of course there's interest
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.250
works I mean of course there's interest
in using this information to develop new

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
in using this information to develop new
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.840
in using this information to develop new
therapeutics and that can happen any

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
therapeutics and that can happen any
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.769
therapeutics and that can happen any
number of ways

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
number of ways
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.380
number of ways
one would be to inject leptin and see if

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
one would be to inject leptin and see if
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.779
one would be to inject leptin and see if
it has biological effects what's been

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
it has biological effects what's been
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.240
it has biological effects what's been
evident over the last decade or so is

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
evident over the last decade or so is
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.640
evident over the last decade or so is
that in some circumstances leptin has

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
that in some circumstances leptin has
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.950
that in some circumstances leptin has
very powerful biological effects but in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
very powerful biological effects but in
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.049
very powerful biological effects but in
others less so

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059
others less so
 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.560
others less so
and so leptin is a single therapy for

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
and so leptin is a single therapy for
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.200
and so leptin is a single therapy for
obesity is proven to be a variable

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
obesity is proven to be a variable
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.080
obesity is proven to be a variable
benefit more recently there's however

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
benefit more recently there's however
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.520
benefit more recently there's however
been some evidence that if you pair

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
been some evidence that if you pair
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.090
been some evidence that if you pair
leptin with other agents you can

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100
leptin with other agents you can
 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.709
leptin with other agents you can
substantially reduce weight and so there

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
substantially reduce weight and so there
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.750
substantially reduce weight and so there
are clinical studies ongoing to test

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
are clinical studies ongoing to test
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850
are clinical studies ongoing to test
whether leptin might be part of a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
whether leptin might be part of a
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.920
whether leptin might be part of a
therapeutic regimen to treat obesity I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
therapeutic regimen to treat obesity I
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.080
therapeutic regimen to treat obesity I
think in the longer term however the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
think in the longer term however the
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450
think in the longer term however the
more we learn about how this system

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
more we learn about how this system
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729
more we learn about how this system
works the more a better the better able

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
works the more a better the better able
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.590
works the more a better the better able
we're going to be to intervene in the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
we're going to be to intervene in the
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660
we're going to be to intervene in the
form of drugs that modulate the behavior

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
form of drugs that modulate the behavior
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940
form of drugs that modulate the behavior
of neural pathways that regulate weight

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
of neural pathways that regulate weight
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.390
of neural pathways that regulate weight
and so I think the future you know does

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
and so I think the future you know does
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219
and so I think the future you know does
put forth the promise of new treatments

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
put forth the promise of new treatments
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.140
put forth the promise of new treatments
for obesity but I think there's an

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
for obesity but I think there's an
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749
for obesity but I think there's an
important caveat here which is to ask

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
important caveat here which is to ask
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.080
important caveat here which is to ask
what is it are we treating I think

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
what is it are we treating I think
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030
what is it are we treating I think
there's a disconnect in fact between the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
there's a disconnect in fact between the
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.219
there's a disconnect in fact between the
way I think about this problem and the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
way I think about this problem and the
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.119
way I think about this problem and the
way the public might think about it
