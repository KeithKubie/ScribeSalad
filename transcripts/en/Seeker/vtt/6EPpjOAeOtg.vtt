00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:05.120
One of the exciting and mysterious properties
of human genetic information is that your

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.540
DNA doesn't just store who you are, it stores
who you could be.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.269
More than a simple “fingerprint” that
encodes a unique identity, your genome provides

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.880
a spectrum of probable personal futures but
this knowledge could be used against you.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.800
As individuals, increased knowledge of our
genetic makeup has helped us to better understand

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.390
our heritage and ethnic origins, revealed
family members we never knew, and helped personalize

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.390
medicine.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.550
But our genetic identities don’t share the
same legal protections as our medical records

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.590
and there has been a lot of buzz lately about
an individual’s right to keep their genetic

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.660
information to themselves.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.650
Of course you’d want your doctor to know
what diseases you may be at risk for but what

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.970
about your insurance company?

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.480
Giving your health insurance company access
to your genetic information could drastically

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.430
change how much you pay and life insurance
companies may just not cover you at all.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.899
Basically, one gene could change the fate
of your coverage.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.960
In this doomsday scenario, let's hope you
are genetically well suited for a high paying

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.760
job, because genetic composition could be
used to help determine your eligibility for

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.350
a job, promotion, or raise.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.860
Think that’s crazy?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.290
Genetic traits, such as color blindness and
height, are already being used as selection

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.299
criteria for some jobs, for instance military
pilots.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.280
So it’s not that much of a stretch to expect
that knowledge of traits such as intelligence

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.780
could mean that one candidate for a promotion
a raise is selected over another based on

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.480
their genetic potential and not necessarily
demonstrated ability.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.689
This could also affect private education with
things like college acceptance or scholarships.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.890
Consider this: You have a decision making
position on a major sports team and it’s

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.890
draft season.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.280
In addition to all of the players’ performance
statistics and personal records, you also

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.410
have their genetic information.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.580
You can now see which players have beneficial
mutations like the R577X mutation in the ACTN3

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.470
gene that helps fast-twitch muscle increase
running speed, would you even consider drafting

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.940
athletes without that mutation?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.950
You can see also that this year’s most promising
player has a moderate risk factor for cardiac

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.950
arrhythmia.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.340
Do you draft him knowing he might have heart
problems a few years into his contract?

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.670
Would this type of knowledge affect the salaries
your team would offer?

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.580
Giving others access to explicit information
about our genetic potential could limit the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.720
opportunities they make available to us because
they’d know more about whether or not an

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.220
investment in us is a good bet.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.470
In the future, genetic data may influence
who we date, who we vote for, or even how

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.129
we design our genetically modified babies
and refusing to share our information with

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.900
employers or insurance companies could mean
higher costs or penalties for keeping them

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.900
in the dark.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.190
Currently, there are some government protections
designed to mitigate damage resulting from

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.520
discrimination on the basis of genetic identity
or failure to disclose such information, but

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.370
those protections are far from comprehensive.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.260
For instance, the US Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act (GINA) does not address life insurance,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.819
disability insurance, or long-term care insurance,
and even though knowledge of what is hidden

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.020
in your genetic code could have an enormous
impact on you *and* your family, there is

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.340
currently no federal law preventing the surreptitious
testing of your genetic material without your

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.610
permission.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.650
In this digital age where companies are profiting
from all kinds of our information, data clearly

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.370
has monetary value.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.420
So maybe we should consider protecting and
limiting access to our personal data the way

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.060
we do with our money and financial information.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.880
