00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:33.000
For the quick answer to your question: no
and sometimes.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.270
While not all molds are bad for you to eat,
many are, and unless you want to whip out

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.150
a microscope and meticulously identify the
mold present on your food (note: there are

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.850
300,000 known types and counting), as a general
rule it’s better to avoid moldy foods.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.229
Not all molds that are bad for you will cause
apparent symptoms right away either.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.530
For instance, many molds produce Aflatoxin
which is a substance that will up your chances

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.801
of getting cancer and may cause a variety
of other health problems for you, though not

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:02.710
necessarily right away.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.120
That being said, sometimes it is OK to cut
off the mold and eat what’s underneath.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.830
As to when it’s OK to eat moldy foods and
when it’s not, it depends on the food item.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.549
With respect to bread and cheese, it’s important
to understand that the visible mold you see

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.360
on the surface of bread and cheese also sends
root threads down into the food.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.350
In molds that are bad for you, these threads
often have poisonous substances in and around

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.380
these ‘roots’.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.659
With hard cheeses, the mold has trouble penetrating
deeply into the cheese.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.340
As such, you can cut an inch of cheese off
of each side and discard the moldy slices

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.380
and it should be safe to eat (note: just scraping
the visible mold off isn’t good enough,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.880
you must cut deeply in, to make sure you’re
getting rid of the runners).

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.579
Thus, hard or semi-hard cheeses like Cheddar,
Colby, Gorgonzola, Gruyere, Parmesan, Romano,

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.590
Stilton, and Swiss, among others, are completely
fine to cut the moldy part away and eat what’s

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.590
underneath.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.039
Soft cheese like Brie, Camembert, Cottage
cheese, Cream cheese, Neufchatel, or Ricotta

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.569
you should throw out if you notice mold on
them.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.799
In addition to that, any shredded or crumbled
cheese, regardless of type, should always

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.149
be discarded if you discover mold.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.240
All that being said, some cheese is made with
mold, such as the aforementioned Brie, Roquefort,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240
and Camembert.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.210
Obviously the mold that the cheese is made
with is safe to eat.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.590
But if you notice other mold growing on the
cheese, cut it off or throw it out depending

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.920
on whether it’s hard or soft cheese.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.560
Now with breads, you should always throw away
the bread when you discover mold on it.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.300
Even though in a solid loaf you could easily
cut off a couple inches of the moldy part,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.390
unfortunately because bread is so porous,
the mold has no trouble spreading its runner

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.280
threads throughout the bread’s innards,
unlike with hard cheeses.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.220
In the case of sliced bread, you also usually
should throw away the whole loaf.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.420
Mold spreads amazingly fast, so if you see
one spot of mold, it’s likely that the other

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.410
bread in a package also has mold on it, even
if you can’t see it yet.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.950
The same goes for shredded cheese, one spot
of mold visible likely means that it has also

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.890
spread to the entire package of shredded cheese.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.530
So, as a general rule, if the food item is
hard (hard cheese, hard fruits and vegetables,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.200
etc.) and has mold, it’s usually alright
to cut off some of the food item and eat what’s

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.970
underneath, particularly when there is a low
moisture content in the food item.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.010
Soft fruits and vegetables, like strawberries,
oranges (note: the outer rind is easily penetrated

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.460
by mold), green beans, etc. should be thrown
out when mold is discovered.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.270
For semi-soft food items or hard items with
high moisture content, as a general rule when

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.520
these items turn moldy, “when in doubt,
throw it out”.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.410
Pro Tip: when cutting moldy cheese away, be
particularly carefully to keep the knife blade

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.640
from touching the mold spots.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:42.530
This will reduce the likelihood of spreading
the mold to the uncontaminated innards.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:57.500
Once you’re done cutting the moldy cheese
away, putting it in a new package will also

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:09.880
help significantly towards keeping it mold
free for longer.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.490
Also, never sniff mold, this can result in
respiratory problems.
