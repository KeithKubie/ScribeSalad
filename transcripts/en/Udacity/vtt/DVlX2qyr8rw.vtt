00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.399
Okay. Let's see how you did. Let's start here in the center with mutations. The

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.138
subject of lesson six. There are five main types. There are duplications,

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:15.800
deletions. There are insertions. There are SNVs and there

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.230
are chromosomal translocations. Now, I knew to put them

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.040
in this order, not because they were the right

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.800
size for the boxes. But because of the arrows

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.140
pointing to them from down here. We know the mutations

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.380
can be either spontaneous or induced. And the spontaneous mutations are

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.690
from things like replication errors which

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.610
are causes of duplications, insertions, deletions

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.325
and single nucleotide variations or SNVs. Induced mutations are from things like

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:51.640
x-rays and UV rays. UV rays can typically cause SNVs whereas x-rays

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.660
cause double stranded DNA breaks and eventually

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.580
chromosomal translocations. Mutations themselves are just changes in

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.342
the non-coding DNA or the coding DNA. For

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:06.094
refreshers on these topics you can review concepts

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:07.822
of coding DNA in lesson three and

00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:10.620
non-coding DNA in lesson four. Mutations in the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.630
coding region of DNA can lead to four

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.800
different kinds of mutations. Silent mutations which don't

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.936
change the amino acids. Missense mutations which

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:23.838
change the amino acid. Nonsense mutations which change

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:25.954
an amino acid to a stop codon.

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:29.190
Or frameshift mutations which completely throw off the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.440
entire reading frame of a ribosome so that you change many amino acids. Now germ

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.340
cells also undergo miosis which we learned

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.400
about in the last lesson. And an abnormal

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.140
division at miosis can cause aneuploidy, which is

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.220
the addition or loss of chromosomes. And again, you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.010
learned about chromosomes in lesson two. Now, the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.840
mutations in germ cells are the major source for

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.797
new alleles in the following generations. We've learned

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:02.002
about alleles in lessons three, four and really five

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:05.440
as well. And alleles cause traits which we've

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.640
sort of generally talked about in lesson one and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.970
more specifically in lesson five. But

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.240
alleles and traits have changes in population

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.910
frequencies due to natural selection and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.520
random selection. Hopefully this concept map helps

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.510
organize your thoughts on the lesson so keep it handy because you might

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.760
want to come back to it as we keep moving along in the course.
