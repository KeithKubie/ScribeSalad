00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] And the answer is 5 factorial.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And you can see that because there's 5 different houses that you could assign red to,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and then for each of those 5 assignments there would be 4 that you could assign green to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of the remaining unpainted houses and then 3 for blue and 2 for yellow

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and then only 1 left for ivory.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's 5 factorial.
