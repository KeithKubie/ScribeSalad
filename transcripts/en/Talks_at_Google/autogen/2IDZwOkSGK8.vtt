[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.970
SPEAKER: This is Katie Cantrell
with Factory Farming Awareness

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.080
Coalition.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.470
She's here to speak today
about the impact of animal

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.329
agriculture on the environment.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.395
And so I hope everybody
enjoys the presentation.

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:19.020
KATIE CANTRELL:

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.290
OK.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.840
SPEAKER 1: So here's Katie.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.340
KATIE CANTRELL:
Thank you so much.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.840
And thank you,
everyone, for coming.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.410
So again, my name
is Katie Cantrell.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.220
I'm the founder and
executive director

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.320
of the Factory Farming
Awareness Coalition.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.720
We're a local nonprofit, based
in the Bay Area, dedicated

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.614
to talking to people about the
impact of our food choices.

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:36.780
Here's an outline of what
we'll be discussing today.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.654
The basics of factory
farming, what that term

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:42.360
means, an overview of the
environmental impacts,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990
and we'll conclude by talking
about potential solutions.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.942
So while some of
this information

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:48.900
is disturbing and
depressing, I promise that we

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.487
will end on an upbeat note.

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.320
And there'll be little
"cuteness interludes"

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.030
in between each section to give
you a chance to ask questions.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.530
Now how many of you sang "Old
MacDonald" when you were kids,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.370
or maybe you're singing
it with your own children?

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.890
So when we walk
into the supermarket

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.540
and look around
pictures on products,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.685
it looks like Old MacDonald's
farm is still around today.

00:01:05.685 --> 00:01:07.440
We see all these
rolling green hillsides,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.000
all those happy cows.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.080
But unfortunately, this is not
what farming is like anymore

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.520
in the United States.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.340
Rather than old MacDonald,
this is what we have today.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.310
Factory farms are technically
known as Concentrated Animal

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.810
Feeding Operations, or CAFOs.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.540
It's a practice of keeping
thousands-- tens of thousands,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.900
hundreds of thousands--
of animals in confinement

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.520
for their entire lives.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.750
This is done to produce the most
product for the most profit.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.340
Before we go any
further, does anyone

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.890
want to guess how many
animals are bred and killed

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.615
for food every year
in the United States.

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.490
If you don't already
know the answer-- anyone

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.790
want to take a guess?

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.966
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.340
KATIE CANTRELL: OK, so
pretty close-- so yeah,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130
there's actually nine billion.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.550
There between nine
and 10 billion animals

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.830
raised and killed for
food every single year

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.150
in the United States, alone.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.880
This is just land animals,
not even counting fish.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.340
So there are more farmed
animals in the United States

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.460
than there are people
on the entire planet.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.290
Now of these nine
billion animals,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.790
what percentage of
them do you think

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.350
are raised on
factory farms rather

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.190
than on those nice, small,
Old MacDonald type farms?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.950
AUDIENCE: 80%.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.120
KATIE CANTRELL: 80%?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.710
About 99%-- so 99% of
meat that you see nowadays

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.570
in restaurants or
supermarkets is

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.480
going to be coming from
these factory farms.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.640
Now if we've heard the
term factory farming,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.912
it's usually in the
context of animal welfare.

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:28.870
And that's not what we'll
be focusing on today,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.540
but I do briefly want to
discuss what conditions

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.899
look like on factory
farms, because that's also

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.190
what contributes to most of
the environmental problems,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.084
as well.

00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:38.500
And I think it
helps to understand

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.210
the mindset of
factory farming, which

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.480
is really summed up best by
"National Hog Farmer Magazine."

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.940
They said, "the breeding
sow"-- which is a mother pig--

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.530
"should be thought
of and treated

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.020
as a valuable piece of
machinery whose function

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.200
is to pump out baby pigs
like a sausage machine."

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.450
So these are no longer
thought of as living,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.790
sentient creatures.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.010
They're thought of as
units of production.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.450
It is this mindset
that allows us

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.940
to treat farmed animals in
ways that we would never dream

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.742
of treating our dogs or cats.

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:07.450
So again, the hallmark
of factory farming

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.670
is this intensive confinement.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.370
The animals spend their entire
lives, sometimes confined

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.920
in cages or crates so small that
they can't even turn around.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.960
Other industries, like
the turkey industry,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.530
they're kept by the thousands
inside of these sheds.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.350
So this, obviously,
causes extreme problems

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.700
for animal welfare.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.700
They can't engage in even the
most basic of natural behavior.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.410
But it is also this
overcrowding that

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.460
causes the environmental
issues, as well.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.100
So for the rest of
the presentation,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.558
you have to keep
in mind that these

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:39.750
are what conditions look
like on factory farms,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.740
where 99 percent of
meat is coming from.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.930
Now one question that
frequently comes up

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.430
is what about the
labels that we see

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.870
on products that seem
to indicate they're

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.010
coming from better places?

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.500
So I want to quickly go
through what those mean.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.120
I'll start with cage-free.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.460
This is a picture of
a cage-free egg farm.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.710
Now, it's true, these
hens aren't in cages,

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.200
but it's not exactly what we
imagine when we see the term

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.390
cage-free, when we see
those happy-looking chickens

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.920
on the front of the carton.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.210
So it really means just that.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.470
They're not in cages,
but they're still

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.240
kept by the tens
of thousands inside

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.330
of these industrial sheds
for their entire lives.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.270
Unfortunately, conditions
on free-range farms

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.110
are very similar.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.700
So technically, it
means the animals

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.980
must have "access
to the outdoors,"

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.530
but there are no real
enforced specifications

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.739
for what that means.

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:26.280
And there are a lot of loopholes
as well, that a lot of farms

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.530
get away with, keeping
their animals confined

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.870
by the tens of thousands
inside of the sheds.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.940
But if there is "access
to the outdoors,"

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.906
like a tiny little door that
opens onto a dirt patch,

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:37.530
it can technically
count as free-range,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.120
even if not a single animal ever
actually steps foot outside.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.340
Now to give you a
real world example,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.070
the wording on the left is from
a package of Judy's Eggs, which

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.280
is a popular organic,
free-range brand from right here

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.570
in northern California.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.790
It says these hens are
raised in wide open spaces

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.400
in Sonoma Valley, where they
are free to roam, scratch,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.290
and play.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.280
Well, on the right, you
can see an aerial photo

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.009
of what Judy's Farm
actually looks like.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.300
Those are those industrial
sheds with tens of thousands

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.140
of chickens.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.432
There aren't any birds outside.

00:05:05.432 --> 00:05:07.181
And the purple that
you see in front there

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.390
is a manure pit, which
we'll be talking about much

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.000
more in a few minutes.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.004
Now, Judy's actually
settled a lawsuit

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:15.420
with the Animal
Legal Defense Fund

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.510
for misleading consumers with
the claims on their packaging.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.100
So they have
changed the wording,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.680
but they're still certified
free-range and organic.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.875
And in fact, they re-brand under
several different brand names,

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:28.500
which is a very common practice
to make consumers think they're

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.290
coming from these nice, little,
individual family farms,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.451
when they're coming from the
same source-- these factory

00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:34.950
farms.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.158
So they sell under Judy's,
Uncle Eddy's, Rock Island,

00:05:37.158 --> 00:05:38.010
Gold Circle.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.710
They're also a leading
supplier for Whole Foods 365

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.390
brand and Organic Valley.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.730
So unfortunately, even
some of the most respected

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.770
organic, free-range
brands are, in fact,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.145
sourcing from factory farms.

00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:52.020
The final term that you
might see is 'humane,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.120
and this has no legal
meaning whatsoever.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.030
The USDA does not regulate
the term 'humane,' nor do they

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.610
regulate the term 'natural,'
so any company can put these

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.640
on any product.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.520
It's really just a
marketing gimmick.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.560
And it's unfortunate
because these companies

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.604
are taking advantage
of consumers' desire

00:06:06.604 --> 00:06:08.770
to buy products that are
coming from a better place.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.680
We don't want animals
to be mistreated.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.160
We don't want to impact the
environment in negative ways.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.380
But unfortunately,
this is usually

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.600
just used as a mechanism
to increase the price

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.880
when they're still coming
from factory farms.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.730
Animal agriculture is one of
the single most destructive

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.560
industries on the planet.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.730
I know this can seem a
little bizarre if we're still

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.980
imagining Old McDonald's farm.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.350
What could be so bad
about Old McDonald, right?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.965
So I'm going to
walk you through it.

00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:36.340
So again, keep in
mind that there

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.814
are nine billion animals raised
and killed for food every year.

00:06:39.814 --> 00:06:41.980
And this is where most of
the environmental problems

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.350
stem from-- it's the sheer
number of animals that

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.070
are required to make enough meat
for 300 million plus Americans

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.232
to eat meat every single
day, often with every meal.

00:06:51.232 --> 00:06:52.690
And the problems
come from the fact

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.780
that these are nine billion
living, breathing, eating,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.370
pooping animals.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.120
Now, they're eating
primarily corn and soy.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.680
When we imagine farmers
and farmland in the US,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.860
we, I think, imagine growing
crops to feed to people, right?

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.260
But in the United States,
over half of all farmland

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.720
is planted with corn and
soy, and most of that

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.660
is going to feed not people,
but to animals on factory farms.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.150
This is a problem for
several different reasons.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.470
One is that animals are actually
a very inefficient source

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.440
of food.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.640
So imagine that you are
raising an animal for food.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.355
From the day that
that animal is born,

00:07:30.355 --> 00:07:32.980
till the day that you slaughter
it, you have to feed it, right?

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.360
So that's days, weeks, months,
potentially even years,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.550
that you're giving this
animal food every single day.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.160
So if you add up all
the food that you

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.740
give to that animal over
the course of its lifetime,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.800
it ends up being anywhere
from 2 to 15 times more

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.770
food than the amount of food you
get from eating that animal's

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.910
flesh.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.370
The latest studies have found
that if we cut global meat

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.300
consumption in
half, and we use all

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.570
that farmland to grow fruits
and veggies for people

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.430
to eat directly,
rather than growing

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.130
that corn and soy to feed
to animals on factory farms,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.630
we could feed
every single person

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.590
on earth today, plus an
extra two billion people.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.420
So we hear a lot of
talk about how are we

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.770
going to feed the growing
global population?

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.320
And in fact, we
could do it easily

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.390
if we were using our
land more efficiently,

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.510
but eating lower
on the food chain.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.700
This land use is a huge
problem globally, as well.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.510
Meat production is actually
the leading cause of the Amazon

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.320
rain forest being cut down.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.800
We can see that here in this
infographic from the Center

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.450
for Biological Diversity.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.179
Every minute, there are
two acres of rain forest

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.730
clear cut to make grazing
land for beef cattle

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.620
or land to grow
corn and soy to feed

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.710
to animals on factory farms.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.526
This is also a problem in
the United States, as well.

00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:45.150
Oftentimes, people think I don't
want to support factory farms,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.020
so I'm going to buy
free-range beef.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.870
Now there are a couple of
different problems with this.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.090
One is that actually,
most beef cattle

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.640
are free-range for the first
8 to 10 months of their lives.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.980
So if you drive--

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.200
especially in Marin,
Petaluma, that area--

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.970
you might see these
bucolic-looking cattle

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.020
grazing on hillsides,
and it looks very nice.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.570
But most of those
cattle are then

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.580
shipped to industrial
feedlots, where they're

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.490
fed corn and soy intensively
for the last few months

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.880
of their lives to fatten them
up to reach market weight.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.800
The other big problem
is that while there

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.050
are certain ecosystems
that do benefit

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.440
from having grazing
ruminant animals,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.250
there is a limit
to how many animals

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.160
that land can sustain-- it's
called a carrying capacity.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.080
And when you exceed
that, you start

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.330
to have these very serious
ecological problems,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.060
and that's what we're
seeing across the West, now.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.720
So cattle are being
grazed on public land,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.580
so the government is basically,
subsidizing this grass in order

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.344
to graze these
free-range cattle,

00:09:41.344 --> 00:09:42.760
but the Bureau of
Land Management,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.100
which manages this
land, is not ensuring

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.800
that it's being managed
properly to prevent

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.190
these environmental problems.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.196
So you have too many
cattle on this land,

00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:52.570
so they're eating
everything that

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.695
comes up out of the ground.

00:09:53.695 --> 00:09:56.260
They're eating what would
grow into shrubs and trees

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.410
to provide habitat
for native animals,

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.360
this also causes soil
erosion, impacts waterways--

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.750
so a lot of different
devastating impacts

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.080
of overgrazing.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.420
And to make matters worse, there
is a very secretive government

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.510
agency called Wildlife Services.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.200
They're a part of the USDA.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.620
And in 2015, they killed
over three million animals,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.080
mostly at the
request of ranchers.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.620
So they're killing off predators
like wolves, bears, coyotes,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.530
foxes, mountain lions that
could kill the livestock.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.280
They're killing off prairie
dogs and ground squirrels that

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.960
could dig holes that the
cattle could fall into,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.030
even rounding up and
killing buffalo--

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.250
so native ruminant animals,
because they're competing

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.720
with the cattle for feed.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.630
So we're destroying these
entire native ecosystems

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:45.510
in order to make them suitable
for free-range cattle.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.760
Now another big problem
with all of these animals

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.499
and all of these crops is that
they're very water intensive.

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:52.290
Now when we think about
ways to save water,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.250
what are some things
that come to mind?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.590
What are ways we're told
we can help save water?

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.540
AUDIENCE: Less
water in the shower.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.331
KATIE CANTRELL: Yeah,
take shorter showers,

00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:01.547
right-- that's a classic one.

00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:03.630
Turn off the tap when you
brush your teeth, right?

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.520
Water your lawn less.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.440
So all of these suggestions
focus on our direct water

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.250
usage.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.830
In this next video clip
from the movie "Cowspiracy,"

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.380
we'll see how this compares to
the water impact of our food

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.880
choices.

00:11:14.814 --> 00:11:15.480
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.250
- I found out that
one quarter pound

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.360
hamburger requires over 660
gallons of water to produce.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.985
Here I've been taking short
showers trying to save water,

00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:26.940
and to find out just eating
one hamburger is the equivalent

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.970
of showering two entire months.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.700
So much attention is given to
lowering our home water use,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.890
yet domestic water
use is only 5%

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.630
of what is consumed
in the US, versus

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.970
55% for animal agriculture.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.910
That's because it takes upwards
of 2,500 gallons of water

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.857
to produce one pound of beef.

00:11:43.857 --> 00:11:44.690
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:45.740
KATIE CANTRELL:
The single best way

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.540
that we can help save
water on a daily basis

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.720
is through our food choices.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.066
So the numbers they use
there are on the high end,

00:11:51.066 --> 00:11:52.940
but even the more
conservative estimates show

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.700
that switching from a hamburger
to a veggie burger, just one

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.000
single time opting for a veggie
burger instead of a hamburger,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.130
you save as much water as not
showering for one entire month.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.510
So all that water, all of
this corn and soy, also

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.840
a lot of hormones,
pesticides, antibiotics--

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.730
are fed to these
nine billion animals.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.430
It goes through their
system and then what happens

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.170
to food after we digest it?

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.066
It comes out as poop.

00:12:20.066 --> 00:12:21.440
Farm animals in
the United States

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.980
produce 130 times as much
poop as the entire US

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.240
human population.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.730
And there is very little
waste infrastructure

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.850
for factory farms.

- [WHISPERS] Follow me.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.270
One of America's biggest secrets
is that farms practically

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.290
don't exist anymore.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:45.210
The animals we eat are grown
inside giant hidden factories.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.300
Since 2012, I've been
secretly planning a project

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.500
to expose these factory farms
using the highest tech spy

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.630
equipment available--

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.860
drones.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.020
This video provides
just a sample

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.720
of what I saw during only
a few days of filming.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.160
[BUZZING]

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.300
You're looking at a
lake of toxic feces

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.110
and urine, the size of
four football fields.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.990
That's because thousands
upon thousands of pigs

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.260
are inside of these buildings.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.080
Their waste falls through
slats in the concrete floor

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.500
and it's flushed directly into
this giant open-air cesspool.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.000
How many of these kinds
of factories are there?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.260
In North Carolina alone,
there are over 2,000

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.020
and the consequences
are disastrous.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.760
- The waste falls
through the floors.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.000
It's flushed out into an
open pit, like a cesspool.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.570
It's easy for a
big hog operation

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.060
to have as much waste
as a medium-sized city.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.720
Of course, the pit will fill
up, so it has to be emptied,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.330
and they're emptied by
spraying the liquid waste.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.040
- Yes, you heard that right.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.550
- If you're familiar
with a garden sprayer,

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.050
they are gigantic
versions of that.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.500
So they're making
droplets, fine mists,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:18.530
out of this liquid waste,
and that can drift down wind

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.360
into the neighboring
communities.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.030
- I shut my hog operation
down and I got out of it.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.220
And I couldn't--

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.060
I just couldn't do
another person that way,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.720
to make them smell that.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.050
It is a cesspool that you
put feces and urine in,

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.090
a hole in the ground that
you dump toxic waste in.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.110
And I've seen dead hogs in
them, and stuff like that.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.040
- People can't open their
windows, they can't go outside.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.360
- I've seen it.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.470
I've talked to the people.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.250
I've seen the little children.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.730
They say, mom and daddy, why
we got to smell this stuff?

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.620
You get stories like, I
can't hang my clothes out.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.050
Feces and urine odor comes
by and attaches itself it

00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.846
to your clothes.

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:01.220
And then people
are saying, we're

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.210
scared to invite neighbors.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.410
- It can, I think, very
correctly be called

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.680
environmental racism or
environmental injustice--

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.360
that people of color,
low income people,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.654
bear the brunt of
these practices.

00:15:16.654 --> 00:15:18.570
- This is where they
spray animal waste on us.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.470
This is about eight feet
from my mother's house.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.920
- What is it like
when the mist--

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.861
- It's like you
think it's raining.

00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:25.360
- Really?

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:27.690
- You think it's raining.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.660
We don't open the
doors or the windows,

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.020
but the odor still comes in.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.540
It takes your breath away.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.340
Then you start gagging,
you get headaches.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.180
- There are a number of studies
of asthma and asthma symptoms,

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.700
particularly in children,
near these facilities.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.200
Among adults, there are
reports of several types

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.140
of upper respiratory symptoms.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:51.560
These pollutants are affecting
people's blood pressure.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.390
- Who's responsible
for all this?

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.620
Smithfield Foods,
specifically, the subdivision

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.240
Murphy Brown, which
controls the factory

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.900
farms shown in all of the
drone footage in this video.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.140
Smithfield is by far,
the largest pork producer

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.700
in the entire world.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.710
And inside these
buildings, there

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.620
is something else entirely.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.220
- Pigs are really
intelligent animals.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.020
They are more
intelligent than dogs,

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.700
they are more
intelligent than cats.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.650
In the average pig
barn, there could

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.040
be hundreds, if not thousands,
of pigs crammed into this

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.440
one sprawling indoor space.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.310
Their entire life is spent
standing on concrete floors.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.230
Mother pigs are locked in
metal cages so small that they

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.100
literally cannot even turn
around for months at a time.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.170
- This is not a partisan issue.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.230
We are all opposed to
children being made sick,

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.530
to animals being abused, and to
everyday people's lives being

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.010
ruined by the stench of
cesspools in their backyards.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.100
These thousands of
lakes of toxic waste

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.800
must be among the most
bizarre and disturbing

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.900
environmental phenomenon that
have ever confronted America.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.730
And they've been
kept well-hidden

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.747
from the public for long enough.

00:17:01.747 --> 00:17:03.244

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.650
KATIE CANTRELL: So
you've just seen

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.316
what happens to all
of this waste-- it's

00:17:20.316 --> 00:17:21.530
fairly shocking, right?

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.227
And for urban consumers, meat
starts at the supermarket,

00:17:24.227 --> 00:17:25.310
it starts at a restaurant.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.190
We don't ever have
to see or experience

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.150
the real impacts of it.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.580
So it's usually these rural,
low-income communities,

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.470
often communities
of color, that bear

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.600
the brunt of the rest
of our meat consumption.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.225
They're the ones who
have to be exposed

00:17:37.225 --> 00:17:39.930
to this environmental
pollution on a daily basis.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.020
The other huge problem
with all of these animals

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.860
and all of this waste
is climate change.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.800
A report from the United Nations
found that animal agriculture

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.280
creates more greenhouse gas
emissions than all the planes,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.910
trains, and cars in the entire
world all added up together.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.690
Part of the reason for this is
that ruminant animals like cows

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.850
and sheep, lambs--

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.670
actually burp methane,
which is 20 times worse

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.879
for climate change
than carbon dioxide.

00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:09.170
The poop from all of these
different types of animals--

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.780
chickens, pigs, all the
ones that we've seen--

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.870
releases nitrous oxide,
which is 300 times worse

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.750
for climate change
than carbon dioxide.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.300
And there are also all of the
impacts of that deforestation.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.716
When you consider the whole
lifecycle of everything that's

00:18:22.716 --> 00:18:24.726
required to produce the
meat, the deforestation

00:18:24.726 --> 00:18:26.350
also plays a large
role because they're

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.510
cutting down forests that would
otherwise be absorbing CO2.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.660
So when you factor in all
of these things together,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.104
you see that our food choices
are also the single best way

00:18:36.104 --> 00:18:37.520
that we can help
shrink our carbon

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.430
footprint on a daily basis,
just like our water footprint.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.460
So one study found that not
eating meat just one day a week

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.650
saves some more greenhouse
gas emissions than buying

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.610
local food 100% of the time.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.640
A different study found that if
everyone in the United States

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.520
ate no meat or cheese
just one day a week,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.460
it would be like not
driving 91 billion miles,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.790
or taking 7.6 million
cars off the road.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.040
So we can think about, what
are the chances that we're

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.860
going to convince seven million
people to sell their cars

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.330
and never drive again--

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.320
probably not going
to happen, right?

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.180
Whereas getting people to not
eat meat just one day a week--

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.310
choosing a PB&amp;J instead
of a turkey sandwich

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.560
and a veggie burrito
instead of a beef burrito--

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.870
it's one of the easiest
and most effective ways

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.620
that we can help
stop climate change.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.610
And in fact, there's more
and more scientific evidence

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.510
showing that we cannot keep
climate change to a level

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.540
that's conducive to human
civilization without addressing

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.000
the carbon footprint
of agriculture.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.180
So this study found that the
agriculture-related emissions

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.092
alone, if we continue
our current practices,

00:19:44.092 --> 00:19:45.800
especially as the
global population grows

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.080
and demand for meat
goes up worldwide,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.960
then agriculture alone
will take up almost all

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.600
of the global carbon
budget by 2050.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.980
So this means that even if we
got every other industry down

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.190
to carbon neutral, but we
left agriculture the same,

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.640
we would still be hitting
that two-degree target.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.970
So the only scenario that
would reduce emissions in 2050

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.690
compared to 2009 levels is
what they call the healthy diet

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.190
scenario, which is switching
to significantly more

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.160
plant-based protein.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.220
And as an added benefit,
eating more plant-based protein

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.480
also has positive impacts
on the health of citizens

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.470
and on health care costs.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.760
So if Americans transition
to a plant-based diet,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.980
not only would it reduce
food-related greenhouse gas

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.930
emissions by 79%, we could
also avoid 460,000 deaths

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.040
and save $289 billion in health
care costs and climate change

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.180
costs.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.940
So one of the reasons that
people eat so much meat

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.400
is that it seems
cheap, but that's

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.330
because the true costs
of it are externalized.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.410
So we don't have to see the
environmental costs, the health

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.180
care costs, when
we go to the store,

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.470
when we go to the restaurant.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:58.280
But as taxpayers, we are
actually paying the true cost.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.500
And the most effective
way to reverse that

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.980
is to transition to a
more plant-based diet.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.180
The basic solution
is very simple.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.280
We have to eat less meat--

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.290
that's really what
it boils down to.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.170
And different organizations,
world leaders,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.390
are starting to catch
on to this and starting

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.680
to encourage people to switch
to plant-based protein.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.864
So the United Nations
Environmental Program

00:21:18.864 --> 00:21:20.780
has urged first world
citizens to cut our meat

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.910
consumption in half, become
what they call "demitarians."

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.850
The Stockholm International
Water Institute

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.740
has gone even further
and said that we

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.230
need to limit animal-based
foods to just 5%

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.820
of our total daily calories.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.530
Right now, they
make up about 30%

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:34.850
of the standard American diet.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.330
So they said we need to
eat just 1/6 as much meat

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.620
as we currently are.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.820
And they've warned that
if we do not do this,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.120
then we will be faced with
food and water shortages

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.550
worldwide that could
lead to civil war.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.230
So the stakes are
about as high as they

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.688
get when we're
talking about things

00:21:49.688 --> 00:21:52.370
like climate change,
global famine,

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.830
and all this can be
impacted directly

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.080
through our food choices.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.750
Now a big challenge is
how do you get people

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.939
interested in eating less meat?

00:22:01.939 --> 00:22:03.980
There are a lot of reasons
that people eat meat--

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.839
it tastes good, it's
cheap, it's convenient,

00:22:05.839 --> 00:22:07.880
it's part of our culture,
it's part of our habit.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.040
And so now, different
organizations,

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.770
nonprofits, as well as many
different food start-ups,

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.230
especially in the Bay
Area, are working on ways

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.000
to get people
excited about eating

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.340
more plant-based protein.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.340
One initiative that's been very
successful is Meatless Mondays.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.710
This was actually started
by Johns Hopkins University

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.480
as a public health initiative.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.970
As we saw a few slides
ago, health care costs

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.790
are hugely impacted by the
amount of animal protein

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.530
that Americans
currently consume.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.480
Many of the leading causes of
death-- cancer, heart disease,

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.730
diabetes, stroke--

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.910
are directly related to eating
too much animal protein.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.565
So they figured if people
eat even 1/7 less meat--

00:22:44.565 --> 00:22:46.862
if people are not eating
meat one day a week--

00:22:46.862 --> 00:22:48.570
then it will really
help people's health.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.600
And many other organizations
have jumped on board

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.641
and said it's a great way
to help the environment

00:22:52.641 --> 00:22:53.720
and animals, as well.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.340
And even for
die-hard meat lovers,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.310
the idea of not eating
meat just one day a week

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.380
is something that
seems very doable.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.000
And currently, a
third of Americans

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.150
report trying to participate.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.890
Green Monday is also another
really successful program

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.400
that is similar to Meatless
Monday, but really focused

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.190
on those environmental
impacts, emphasizing the fact

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.040
that the best way to
go green is by eating

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.426
more plant-based protein.

00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:18.800
It's actually
based in Hong Kong,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.720
and they've had
tremendous success

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.770
in shifting the entire
city's eating habits

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.560
by having a really positive,
empowering campaign,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.010
emphasizing that eating
green, choosing veg options,

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.620
is a very effective
step to take.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.780
And Green Monday emphasizes that
it's not a one-size-fits-all.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.124
So oftentimes, people are
deterred from taking a step

00:23:40.124 --> 00:23:41.540
because they think
that they won't

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.600
be able to be perfectly
100% vegetarian or vegan,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.740
and so people get
dissuaded and they give up.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.575
But as a Green
Monday shows, there

00:23:48.575 --> 00:23:50.950
are a number of different ways
that we can go about this.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.050
So whether that's routine-based,
one day a week-- so

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.730
Green Monday or Meatless Monday.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.320
You can do every day for lunch.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.560
Eat a vegetarian
or vegan lunch--

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.927
just one meal a day, it's
pretty doable for most people.

00:24:02.927 --> 00:24:04.760
But if you do that,
then a third of the time

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.260
you'll be eating veg.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.470
It can also be portion-based,
so decreasing the amount of meat

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.580
they're eating, increasing the
amount of plant-based protein,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.830
vegetarian foods on your plate.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.800
Or it can be impact-based,
so pledging to only order

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.620
veggie burgers instead of
hamburgers from now on.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.020
There are many different
ways that we can play around

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.790
with our food
choices and increase

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.040
the amount of plant-based
foods that we're eating.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.400
And it, again, is one of the
single most effective actions

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.230
that we can take.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.800
There are also some very
exciting tech solutions

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.970
that are in the works right
now, namely, clean meat.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.770
So clean meat involves
extracting stem cells

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.460
from animal tissue, culturing
those, and then, basically,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.950
growing meat tissue in the lab.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.710
And then layering that to
produce hamburgers, chicken

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.370
nuggets.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.660
So it is actually meat.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.670
I mean, it is animal
tissue and it's

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.790
based on medical technology
used to grow human skin cells

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.050
to graph on to burn victims.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.420
But they're actually
growing meat.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.580
And this is successful.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.320
Memphis Meats has produced--

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.540
I think just about a month ago--

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.104
they had the first tastings of
clean chicken and duck meat.

00:25:11.104 --> 00:25:12.770
And there are a few
other companies that

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.690
are working on beef, as well.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.020
And this is extremely more
efficient than factory farming.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.850
So clean meat uses
99% less land,

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:25.670
produces 96% less
greenhouse gas emissions,

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.610
and uses 96% less water.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:29.912
And there's a really
great organization

00:25:29.912 --> 00:25:31.370
called the Good
Food Institute that

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.940
is working to help encourage
the science behind clean meat

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.070
and policy around
clean meat, as well.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.717
So according to
latest estimates,

00:25:38.717 --> 00:25:40.550
it should be on the
market within about four

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.330
to five years.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.620
Again, the technology
is there, it's

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.286
just a matter of
scaling it so that it's

00:25:44.286 --> 00:25:47.000
cost-competitive with
factory farm meat.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.400
But I think this is one of
the most hopeful developments.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.550
If we can replace fast
food meat with clean meat,

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.370
then we will see drastic
impacts on the environment,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.750
and obviously, for
animals, as well.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.442
But the good news
is that you don't

00:26:01.442 --> 00:26:03.650
have to wait four or five
years to make a difference.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.900
There are a number
of other start-ups,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.930
all based right around
here, that are working

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.660
on creating foods that have
the same taste textures that we

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.570
love, but they are made
from more sustainable

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:15.600
plant-based sources.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.997
So as Biz Stone
said, "these guys

00:26:17.997 --> 00:26:20.330
are coming at the meat analog
industry not as a novelty.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.371
They're coming at it from
the big science angle."

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.840
These products are not made for
vegetarian markets, anymore,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.340
they're not made
for a niche market.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.040
They're getting the top
chefs, top food scientists,

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.290
to create products that
are really delicious

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.500
and satisfying for
die-hard meat lovers.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.600
So you have companies like
Beyond Meat, Impossible

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.160
Foods, which makes the burger--

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.810
"the burger that
bleeds," as it's

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.726
been getting a lot of
attention in the press--

00:26:43.726 --> 00:26:45.984
Hampton Creek Foods, which
makes Just Mayo, cookies,

00:26:45.984 --> 00:26:47.900
salad dressings, and all
of these products you

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.480
can read articles,
see interviews online.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.980
They do blind taste
tests and people

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.570
can't tell the difference.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.050
So if the main reason
that we're eating meat

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.050
is because it tastes
good, it's fantastic

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.800
news that there are
now products available

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.810
that have that same
taste, the same texture,

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.726
but they're better for
us, better for animals,

00:27:04.726 --> 00:27:08.510
better for the environment,
so it's really a win-win.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.060
And this is a top-growing trend.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.160
This is really the direction
that the market is moving.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.170
So "Food Navigator Magazine,"
Mintel, "The Nutrition Business

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:18.800
Journal"--

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.140
I mean, they've all
documented that Americans

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.046
are eating more and
more plant-based foods,

00:27:23.046 --> 00:27:24.920
they're interested in
it from a health angle,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.410
from an environmental angle,
and this is consistently

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.680
one of the fastest growing
sectors of the food system.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.200
As a result, an even
more exciting trend,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.360
is that meat and dairy
companies are actually

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.980
starting to jump on board.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.640
So even Tyson Chicken-- their
CEO, the CEO of Tyson Chicken--

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.150
said the plant-based protein
is the way of the future.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.130
And dairy companies are also
investing in plant-based dairy.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.300
So Dannon Yogurt, the parent
company that makes Dannon,

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.934
bought White Wave, which makes
Silk soy milk and almond milk.

00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:55.100
And they're shifting a lot
of their marketing budget

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.890
away from marketing dairy
foods towards marketing

00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.120
plant-based foods.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.490
So we see this very
positive feedback cycle,

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.280
where the more that we
vote with our dollars

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.160
and we buy these products,
the more appealing

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.210
that food sector becomes to
businesses, they invest in it.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.302
Then those products are
more widely available,

00:28:12.302 --> 00:28:14.510
they're cheaper, they're
more accessible, and so more

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.130
and more people
start buying them.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.490
And as we've seen, especially
with products like almond milk,

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.200
then they start to take up a
larger and larger market share,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.980
and as a result, there are
fewer animals bred and killed

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.390
for food every year.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.060
So often times, people say,
but I'm just one person.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.160
What difference do my
food choices really make?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.090
But we really can have a very
direct impact on this industry.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.120
And especially at a
time when federal policy

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.940
is increasingly
frustrating and alarming--

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.910
there's zero chance of federal
action on climate change

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.540
within these next few years--

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.440
so this is even more
important, that we can really

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.390
directly impact this
industry, and have

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:55.640
a real impact on climate change
through our daily food choices.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.129
And it's really never been
easier or at least tastier

00:28:58.129 --> 00:28:59.420
to eat these plant-based foods.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.210
So Gardien products are
probably my favorite.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.832
They have these
great, crispy tenders.

00:29:03.832 --> 00:29:05.540
And they're actually
owned by the company

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.730
that makes Hungry Man dinners.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.271
So again, we see
these meat companies

00:29:08.271 --> 00:29:10.340
starting to invest in
plant-based products.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.800
Almond milk is available
at every supermarket.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.660
Ben and Jerry's now
has seven flavors

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.100
of almond milk-based ice cream.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.820
So we see, again, it's
a growing trend, which

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.990
is great for all of us because
it makes it so easy to do.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.500
And again, you don't have
to be 100% vegetarian

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.442
to order a veggie burger
or a veggie burrito.

00:29:29.442 --> 00:29:31.400
You don't have to be
totally vegan all the time

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.100
to put almond milk in your
cereal instead of cow milk.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.400
It's not about being
all-or-nothing, 100% perfect.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.950
It's about looking at the
impacts of our food choices

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.170
and deciding what we want
our money to support.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.130
And the other good news is
that, again, this really

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.300
has a direct impact.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:53.860
So supply and demand applies,
demand has been going down--

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.230
since 2007, demand has dropped.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.850
And as a result,
there are 400 million

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.680
fewer animals bred
and killed for food

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.690
now than there
were back in 2007,

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.940
as a direct result of people
like you and me deciding

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.630
to eat less meat.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.410
So remember that every time
you decide not to eat an animal

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.240
product, you are taking
action against one

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.430
of the most destructive
industries on the planet.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.100
We'd love to get your feedback
on the presentation, so just

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:17.837
a quick survey.

00:30:17.837 --> 00:30:19.920
And if you'd like to sign
up for our mailing list,

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.920
we send out just once a month
newsletter with recipes,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.350
national news about factory
farming, petitions to sign,

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.460
things like that.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.424
And while also sending
you some recipes

00:30:28.424 --> 00:30:30.840
and some further resources,
but you can also fill this out

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.430
anonymously.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.260
So is there-- the
question was is there

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.650
a good place to find the sources
for the studies that I cited,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.640
and more information.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.370
Yeah, so we have all of the
citations for our presentation

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.825
available on our website.

00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:44.700
And we actually have
a-- and unfortunately, I

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.241
don't have any with
me today-- but we

00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:48.000
have a new leaflet
that's focused

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.230
on the environmental impacts.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.320
And there's a page
with citations for that

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.640
also available on our web site.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.190
So those have all of
the original studies

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.200
that we're citing from.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.437
The movie "Cowspiracy"
is also a good resource.

00:31:00.437 --> 00:31:02.520
And they have a website
with a lot of information,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.610
as well, specifically about
the environmental studies.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.270
For more information about
food sources and what to eat,

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.800
nutrition, all
that-- chooseveg.com

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.540
is a really fantastic resource.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.180
They've got meal plans,
tips for eating out,

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.370
all the nutritional
info that you need.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:18.870
Yeah?

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:19.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.396
KATIE CANTRELL:
So the question is

00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:24.480
what's the relationship between
the animal products consumed

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.710
in the US and what is
consumed around the world?

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.670
So, I mean, it's a pretty
complicated relationship.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:34.320
It depends on the industry,
but roughly 15% of products

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.830
here are exported.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.799
So Americans do hav-- now we
have the second highest meat

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:39.840
consumption in the world.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.900
We were actually
passed by Australia.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.210
But we do eat most of
those products here.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.890
Some of it is exported.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.020
We do import some
products, as well.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.814
And a lot of these
companies are now--

00:31:50.814 --> 00:31:52.230
they started in
the United States,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.270
but they're now
multinational corporations.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.630
And actually, Smithfield, which
is the largest pork producer,

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.600
was bought, basically--
a majority stake--

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.680
was bought by a Chinese company.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.750
And so now, we are starting to
see an increase in pork exports

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:07.290
to China.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.140
So now Americans
are having to deal

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.420
with the environmental
pollution,

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.220
and these products are exported.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.190
Another huge issue
is alfalfa feed.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:20.670
Alfalfa is the most intensive
crop, in terms of water.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.580
And Saudi Arabia and
other countries are now--

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.090
they're importing alfalfa
from the United States.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.960
So they're basically
importing water.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.250
So this is a huge problem,
because a lot of that alfalfa

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.800
is grown in Southern
California and Arizona,

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.350
and parts of the country that
are facing these droughts.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.080
And our water is actually being
exported to support the dairy

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.870
industry in the Middle East.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.480
And the US is also--

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.290
we have set this example
that if you're well-off,

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:50.730
the lifestyle that we've--

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:54.150
that other people want to
emulate as their income grows,

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.850
is that meat is an
integral part of living.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.920
Well, eating meat
every day shows

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.560
that you are middle
class or upper class.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.800
And so there's a
cultural impact, as well.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.020
And I'm hopeful
that we can change

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.480
that, if we can show the United
States is saying, actually,

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.200
now plant-based protein
is the way to go.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.050
This is the really
exciting way of the future.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.520
Then, hopefully, countries
that are starting

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.290
to ramp up their
meat production will

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.909
shift to plant these
protein, as well.

00:33:18.909 --> 00:33:21.450
I also have some resources here
for you that we can pass out.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.199
So this is a guide to
cruelty-free eating.

00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:25.305
It's got some great
recipes, nutritional info.

00:33:25.305 --> 00:33:27.180
And then if we have any
athletes in the room,

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.710
this is "The
Compassionate Athlete."

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:33.210
So there's this idea that eating
veg is feminine or it's hard

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.430
to get enough protein,
but this is David Carter,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.990
they call him 'the
300-pound vegan.'

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.370
He was an NFL
player, he actually

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.600
played for the Raiders.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.232
And he's totally vegan, so
good info in there, as well.

00:33:42.232 --> 00:33:44.440
Again, we're the Factory
Farming Awareness Coalition,

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.600
this is our web site.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.180
And we give presentations,
this is really what we do.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.870
We're focused on
grassroots education.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:53.412
So if you know of any other
schools, community groups,

00:33:53.412 --> 00:33:54.870
businesses, faith
communities, that

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.120
might be interested in
learning more about this issue,

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.546
we're always happy to come
out and speak for free.

00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:00.420
All right, thank you.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.170
SPEAKER: Great.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.010
Thanks, everybody,
for attending.
