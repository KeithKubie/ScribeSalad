00:00:00.694 --> 00:00:03.441
- [Narrator] The population
P of T of bacteria

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:06.159
in a petry dish satisfies the logistic

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:07.760
differential equation.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.360
The rate of change of
population with respect to time

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.299
is equal to two times the population times

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.513
the difference between six

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:18.125
and the population divided by 8000,

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.205
where T is measured in hours
and the initial population

00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:22.538
is 700 bacteria.

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:27.470
What is the carrying
capacity of the population;

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.074
and what is the population's size

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.574
when it's growing the fastest?

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:36.563
So in order to even attempt
to answer these questions

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:39.214
at any point if you're inspired,
definitely pause the video

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:41.503
and try to answer it by yourself.

00:00:41.503 --> 00:00:43.942
Let's just remind ourselves
what we're talking about

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:44.990
or what they're talking about

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.024
with the logistic differential equation

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:49.882
and the carrying capacity.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.312
So in general a logistic
differential equation

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:54.604
is one where we seeing
the rate of change of,

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:56.252
and it's often referring to population,

00:00:56.252 --> 00:00:58.047
so let's just stick with population.

00:00:58.047 --> 00:01:01.546
So the rate of change of our
population with respect to time

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:05.977
is proportional to the
product of the population

00:01:05.977 --> 00:01:07.990
and the difference between what's known

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.590
as the carrying capacity
and the population.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.866
Now why is this a model
that you'll see a lot,

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.512
especially why is it useful

00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:18.757
for studying things like populations.

00:01:18.757 --> 00:01:21.674
When a population is small

00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:24.590
the environment really isn't limiting it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.842
and so assuming it starts
from some none zero value,

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:31.493
this thing grows, this
thing is not going to get

00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:35.122
much smaller and so
our population is going

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:38.894
to a rate of change is going to increase.

00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:41.651
And so let me just draw
a little graph here

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:43.761
to show the typical solution

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:45.857
to a logistic differential equation.

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:47.997
So this is our population, this is time,

00:01:47.997 --> 00:01:50.620
so when our population is low,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.500
let's say it's gonna start
from some non zero value,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.963
if it was zero what would happen,

00:01:53.963 --> 00:01:55.943
well then our rate of
change would just be zero

00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:57.811
and our population would never
grow and that makes sense.

00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:00.073
If you have no bunnies on your island

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:02.424
then there never will be
any bunnies on your island

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:05.340
but if you have a few
bunnies well initially,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.609
their rate of change,

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.383
the rate of population is
gonna keep accelerating

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:13.581
as this thing grows, it's
gonna keep accelerating

00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.321
but then at some point your
environment is going to

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:20.764
limit how many bunnies
for example or bacteria

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:22.390
can grow in your environment.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.504
Because once the
population gets close to A,

00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:28.090
this thing right over here
is going to approach zero

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.945
and its going to make our rate of change

00:02:29.945 --> 00:02:31.806
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:34.742
And so you can imagine
in the limiting case

00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:36.909
as P gets very close to A,

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:44.108
you can imagine as T approaches infinity,

00:02:44.108 --> 00:02:46.771
our rate of change is
going to approach zero.

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.629
So one way to think about it is,

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.796
our population would acemtote
towards the carrying capacity.

00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:58.544
That is A right over here,
that is our carrying capacity.

00:02:58.544 --> 00:02:59.942
So there's a couple of ways

00:02:59.942 --> 00:03:02.927
of answering this first question; one way

00:03:02.927 --> 00:03:05.456
is we can actually put our
logistic differential equation

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:08.047
in this form and then we can recognize

00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:10.083
what the carrying capacity is.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.224
The other way is to think
about, well what happens

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.893
as T approaches infinity.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:17.828
As T approaches infinity,
this thing approaches zero

00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:20.611
and so we can think from this
logistic differential equation

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.194
what P values would
make this thing be zero

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:26.598
based on this differential equation

00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:28.711
or when this thing approaches zero,

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:31.719
what P values would this approach.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.515
So let's do it both ways.

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:37.130
So one way, let me write it
in this form right over here,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.670
so it's close, this is
six minus P over 8000,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.477
can we make it in the form
where we just have some number

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:43.770
minus P.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.670
Well if we multiply this times 8000

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.664
and then we divided this by 8000

00:03:48.664 --> 00:03:50.885
we wouldn't be changing the
value of that expression

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:52.038
so let's do that.

00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:54.610
If we divide this by 8000 you have

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.777
DP DT is equal to 2P over
8000 is P over 4000 times

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:07.787
and now let's multiply
this expression by 8000.

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:11.954
So six times 8000 is 48,000
minus P over 8000 times 8000

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.070
is minus P and there you have it.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.502
We've written it down
to somewhat classic form

00:04:19.502 --> 00:04:21.793
and we can see that the carrying capacity

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:25.293
is 48,000, I guess we say 48,000 bacteria.

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:31.367
So this thing right over here is 48,000.

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:33.317
Another way we could think about it is,

00:04:33.317 --> 00:04:35.384
well the carrying capacity is what happens

00:04:35.384 --> 00:04:37.068
as T approaches infinity.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.813
So as T approaches infinity,
this thing right over here

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:41.646
approaches zero, you can
see the rate of change

00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:43.369
approaches zero.

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:47.252
So when that approaches
zero what does P approach?

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:51.419
So we can just solve for
this; six minus P over 8000.

00:04:53.128 --> 00:04:55.038
Well there's two situations, two Ps

00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:57.385
for which our derivative is equal to zero.

00:04:57.385 --> 00:04:59.923
There's one case when
this is equal to zero,

00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:01.892
in which case our population is to zero

00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:04.975
or the other case is when
this is equal to zero.

00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:09.740
So let's do that; six minus
P over 8000 is equal to zero

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.323
or we could say P over
8000 is equal to six

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:17.811
and so we can say multiply
both sides by 8000,

00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:19.478
P is equal to 48000.

00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:24.348
Which is exactly what
we had right over there.

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:26.173
So now let's answer the second part.

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:30.176
What is the population's size
when it's growing the fastest?

00:05:30.176 --> 00:05:33.302
So intuitively you can see
when that is right over here,

00:05:33.302 --> 00:05:36.381
the rate of change is gonna grow

00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:39.041
but then as we approach
the carrying capacity,

00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:40.842
the rate of change is
gonna start slowing down.

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:43.741
So your maximum rate of change,
it's growing the fastest,

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:47.908
is right about there but how
do we figure out it exactly.

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:50.978
Well you could go back to the logistic

00:05:50.978 --> 00:05:52.493
differential equation.

00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:54.931
You can see that it's
really our rate of change

00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:57.142
is a function, you could view it as

00:05:57.142 --> 00:06:00.090
a function of our
population right over here.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.674
And this is actually a
quadratic expression,

00:06:02.674 --> 00:06:05.470
this is a concave downward
quadratic expression,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.373
it would look like this,

00:06:06.373 --> 00:06:10.354
if you were graphing rate
of change, let me do that,

00:06:10.354 --> 00:06:13.354
if you were to graph rate of change,

00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:17.188
DP DT as a function of population,

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:22.563
well when the population is
small, so when the population

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.350
is, say 700 or that's
where we're starting.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.480
I'll just speak in generalities,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.916
when your population is
small DPT, your rate is small

00:06:34.916 --> 00:06:39.083
but then it increases and
then some point around there

00:06:40.604 --> 00:06:45.018
the rate of change starts to
decrease and it approaches zero

00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:49.702
as our population is approaching
the carrying capacity.

00:06:49.702 --> 00:06:52.730
So this right over here for
example, would actually be

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.829
our carrying capacity.

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:59.132
What is this maximum point right over here

00:06:59.132 --> 00:07:01.018
and there's a couple of
ways you could approach it

00:07:01.018 --> 00:07:03.421
with calculus and even
algebra, we have many tools

00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:04.854
for identifying this maximum point

00:07:04.854 --> 00:07:07.665
which is really just a vertex
of this downward opening,

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:09.909
this concave downward parabola.

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:13.017
So let's just do that and
let's find this vertex

00:07:13.017 --> 00:07:16.459
and the vertex is just
half way between the zeros

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.411
of this quadratic.

00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:22.229
So let's find the P values
that make this equal to zero

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.146
which we actually just figured out,

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:30.584
the vertex is just gonna
be half way between that.

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:34.411
So when the population is zero
our rate of change is zero

00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:38.315
when the population is A,
which we know is 48,000,

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:42.482
our rate of change is zero and
so our maximum rate of change

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.538
is gonna happen half way
between those two points

00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:48.788
which is 24,000

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.150
So it is a population of 24,000.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.833
When we got that by really just saying

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.802
well at one point does this quadratic,

00:07:56.802 --> 00:07:58.634
quadratic is a function of P,

00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:01.121
when does that hit a maximum point.

00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:03.607
Well that's going to be
half way between the zeros,

00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:07.398
the zeros happen when P equals
zero and P is equal to 48,000

00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:11.218
so that's gonna happen when
the population is 24,000.

00:08:11.218 --> 00:08:14.673
So this type of problem seems
very intimidating at first,

00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:16.318
logistic differential equation,

00:08:16.318 --> 00:08:18.905
how do I actually solve
this and then analyze it

00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:20.619
but the key is to; one,

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:23.035
recognize a logistic
differential equation,

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.287
see what it's talking about

00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:28.847
and then maybe think of this
in terms of our rate of change

00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:30.781
as a function of our population.

00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:33.758
And remember that the carrying
capacity is what happens

00:08:33.758 --> 00:08:38.337
as T approaches infinity
and as T approaches infinity

00:08:38.337 --> 00:08:42.074
our rate of change approaches zero.

00:08:42.074 --> 00:08:43.645
And so if that's approaching zero,

00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:46.625
what must our population be approaching.
