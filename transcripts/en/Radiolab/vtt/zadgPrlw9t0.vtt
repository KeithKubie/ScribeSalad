1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.320
Oh, here we go. Okay. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today, uh,

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.210
with me is Simon Adler. That's me.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.130
He's a reporter and producer here and he's got us a tale. I do, uh,

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.620
it's an American tale and a kind of timely one, I think.

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.640
How would you describe it?

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.910
I think it's one of those classic us versus them tails or back,

7
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.840
or maybe it's an US versus us story in it. It's w

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.660
<v 1>totally. I liked that more because I, in fact,</v>

9
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:26.300
it takes place right in America's heartland.

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.910
We're in the heartland, Nebraska, Seneca, Nebraska,

11
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.040
this tiny little town in central West Nebraska. Okay.

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.340
It's near the town of mole in Nebraska, which, you know,

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.080
obviously also don't know. Yeah, no, that doesn't help me at all. So a,

14
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:50.030
this is Matthew Hanson. He is a reporter with the, with the Omaha World Herald.

15
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.240
And a couple months back he got in touch with us, uh, because he,

16
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.100
he had a story about this town, right?

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.540
So I got an email from a woman who lives a couple miles outside of town.

18
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.720
She was really upset because back in 2014, uh,

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.430
the town was split in half and in fact there was a group of people in the town

20
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:08.990
who were circulating a petition,

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500
a petition that would end the town w circulate a petition to end the town.

22
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.680
Yeah. They didn't want to be a town anymore. Right. Really? Yeah. You know,

23
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.160
by law, if you have enough signatures on a petition,

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.600
you can get things on the ballot,

25
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.020
and the question that ended up on the ballot was,

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.480
should Seneca cease to exist

27
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.890
<v 0>and this split, but let a group of people to try to end their own town.</v>

28
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.000
It got us thinking about the split. That seems to be this election right now.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.410
It occurred to us that maybe just maybe this tiny little town in the middle of

30
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.620
Nebraska might have something to say about the rest of us.

31
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.680
<v 1>Well, let's back up then. So when,</v>

32
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.640
when did all was well in Seneca until what?

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.100
It started with the horses. The horses. Okay. What,

34
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.750
what are these stories there? There were six horses. Actually, let me step back.

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.650
There were a lot of horses in Seneca. Most people in Seneca ride horses,

36
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.690
mini owned them. Um,

37
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.230
but there were these six particular horses right in the middle of town.

38
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.800
And you know, the, the split sort of started,

39
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.273
<v 2>uh, right there.</v>

40
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.600
So I got so curious about what went down in Seneca that I flew to Denver.

41
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.300
One, two, three, four, five,

42
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690
drove five and a half hours into the sand hills of west Central Nebraska.

43
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.670
Let's see if we can get anything on the radio here.

44
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.280
These rolling sand dunes covered in grass that they ranch catalog.

45
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.720
There's another ranch. What's this one say?

46
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.360
And Smack Dab in the middle of the sandhills

47
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.920
is Seneca. After many hours and many miles we are here. Okay.

48
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.600
So uh, got these rolling hills that are

49
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.730
<v 1>green dotted with these yellow flowers.</v>

50
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.320
A junction 86, eight Seneca. Okay. We've got kind of an old,

51
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:03.430
bigger red sign that says welcome Seneca with a big red line. Okay.

52
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.400
And you get there. It looks like starting to drive through town,

53
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.540
a picture postcard, small town from yesteryear

54
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.493
<v 2>down like railroad</v>

55
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.970
<v 1>tracks to our [inaudible] who's got the railroad. I'm taking a left,</v>

56
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.400
I mean really pretty to my right,

57
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.870
an abandoned house to my left, another boarded up house,

58
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.920
another street with absolutely nothing on it. An old gas station.

59
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.850
It's all boarded up.

60
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.290
Another rundown house that says no trespassing and just really tiny,

61
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:35.430
I think went into the other is one eighth of a mile and we're done. Uh,

62
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.780
so there you go. At 30 miles per hour, it takes 10 seconds.

63
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.350
Okay. Turning around and wow. Okay. Um,

64
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.280
the house to the left here has a giant board over one of the windows that and

65
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:51.420
spray painted on it is sandy h is a big fat liar.

66
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.423
<v 3>Interesting.</v>

67
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.780
<v 2>And so I ended up just walking through this tiny town of Seneca.</v>

68
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.490
You're like knocking on every door.

69
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.720
I think I may have knocked on every single door in the town. Oh yeah. Yeah.

70
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.730
And of course I ended up talking to some folks who wanted to end the town,

71
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.400
others who wanted to save it and, and uh,

72
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.270
first up Judith Brown's house and she told

73
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.650
<v 1>her notes to me were come down hill.</v>

74
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.380
First House is nice.

75
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.540
That's not me burnt up yard. I don't know if this is it.

76
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.030
<v 2>How are you this morning? Well, now that it's morning,</v>

77
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.980
now you're here in New York City and how do you do it?

78
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:39.940
Very good to meet you. Everyone told me I can't let you into my house,

79
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:43.450
but I don't have any other way to cope with it. I'm not worried about.

80
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.020
And you want to plug in? No, I'm good. I'm all set here.

81
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.420
<v 3>Oh good. Tell me who else you're going to talk to. Larry ISOM.</v>

82
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.370
Oh, okay. Well, ELLs and Jackie. Severe.

83
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.250
Okay. I'm the sanest person you're going to talk to today.

84
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.700
Just so you know. That's what I,

85
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.000
the terrible thing to say.

86
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.500
I'm sorry about the cigarettes.

87
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.150
<v 1>I want to get into more a contemporary things,</v>

88
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:17.470
but real quickly to set the stage,

89
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.350
<v 3>when did Seneca pop up on the map? Well,</v>

90
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.330
all I know is when I was a little kid. It was a booming town. What would you do?

91
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.030
Well,

92
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.030
I mean they had great dances and wonderful bands and beer and there was no place

93
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:35.930
else to go. I mean, Santa Fe used to be really,

94
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.940
really fun, but okay. Well, so let me tell you the story.

95
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.500
Some people had come and they bought a house in Seneca.

96
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.730
Okay. This would have been fine. Except they have all these animals.

97
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.970
Nobody knows these people and there is a big fuss about them and their abusive.

98
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.670
These animals, there's sure animals are being abused.

99
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.010
<v 4>See, I was under the impression that this was all about horses in a front yard.</v>

100
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:02.750
Is that true?

101
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.500
<v 3>They had horses. They had six horses in their backyard.</v>

102
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.580
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

103
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.413
<v 4>that's the yard.</v>

104
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.590
So we're talking like six horses in this size of a one car garage. Exactly.

105
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.940
Do you remember the first time you saw the horses here was all him or smelled?

106
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.550
Yeah, both at the same time. Larry Eisen,

107
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.360
former member of the town board.

108
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.370
I mean it's pretty hard to miss when you drive down the street when there's six

109
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:36.110
blocks to the town, you know that's, it's easy to to hear about things.

110
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.400
You, you'll be on the list also tomorrow. Oh really?

111
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:42.620
Am I going to be in Midland? Probably all have.

112
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.330
I'll have five phone calls on my phone at home by the time I get there.

113
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.500
And how did you decide that you were going to take this up as a cause?

114
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:55.580
As a member of the town board because of the complaints that were called to my

115
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.670
house. What are you going to do about the horses? Their,

116
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.060
they're up to their knees in excrement. What are you going to do about it?

117
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.460
And so you pass, you wrote an ordinance or, yeah. And what,

118
00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:10.100
what did the ordinance set? I don't remember. It was two pages but,

119
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.480
but in any case it,

120
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.510
it stipulated a certain amount of square footage per horse as well as shelter

121
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.790
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.550
<v 3>well that was part of it.</v>

123
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.540
The thing about Seneca is there's always a war in Seneca

124
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.500
again. Judith Brown. Okay.

125
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.490
Six horses in the front yard where the most concrete thing,

126
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.870
but Larry ICM and the bats you're going to go see?

127
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.710
They have always wanted us to look more like a cute little Colorado tourist

128
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:54.290
town. Wait, are we talking like beautification? Like less? Yes.

129
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.410
They wanted to create rules to create growth and I think they wanted to keep us

130
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:02.090
lower class people in line.

131
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.300
And so they were out here telling us what to do and they'll tell you things

132
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:08.984
about me.

133
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.740
<v 2>Judah, she did the 60s in New York,</v>

134
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.390
you've lived in a commune for time and Brenda brain down to save Seneca three

135
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.520
isom again. No, go. Nancy Isom, his wife and here Jackie. Severe.

136
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.440
So we don't want to defend, we don't want to bicker. No,

137
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.370
we don't want to open that up.

138
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.260
<v 4>The ordinances were,</v>

139
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:34.580
were necessary because of the situation that we were presented with.

140
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.290
There was no elite TISM.

141
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.390
<v 2>They weren't on that board to dictate to anybody in this town.</v>

142
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.430
They needed cabinets for the horses.

143
00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:46.230
That's where you started and then you had people that was trying to say,

144
00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:47.250
you're not going to tell me.

145
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.330
If you look around the little town,

146
00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:54.480
you'll see the ones that take pride in what they have. I'm sorry,

147
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.140
but you that the debate.

148
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.680
<v 0>So the town was split into,</v>

149
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.610
I mean we could have liked each other,

150
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.220
but we've had nothing but constant, constant fighting.

151
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.090
Hello. Hi. Okay. She Ron, are you well, what's, what's the dogs name? Yes.

152
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.230
Presley. I'm Simon. I it that come on in also wanted to save the town up.

153
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.960
Asked her last name, not be used. Excited.

154
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.560
I mean I've heard so much about you and I want to, I have to ask,

155
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.620
where did you hear about me from who? Oh Lord. This is a small town.

156
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.630
I mean it just all over.

157
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.560
The telephones are ringing with my name pretty much. Okay. I gotta be nice.

158
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:43.390
Right? You're recording all this. I'm recording. You don't have to be nicer.

159
00:09:43.391 --> 00:09:48.390
You can. Yeah. Oh, I'll be honest. I have no use for those people.

160
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.050
I didn't want them to take our tan. How long have you lived in Seneca?

161
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.300
Oh Gosh. About 36 37 years now.

162
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.850
And how many people live here? These guys, right in town maybe.

163
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.150
I don't know if even 22 yeah.

164
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.850
And we get talked about a lot.

165
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.560
I made wicked job put down a lot. Like what do you, excuse me.

166
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.730
Hi honey. I can't talk. Listen Simon's here.

167
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.680
Do you have anything you want me to ask him? Okay, bye. Bye. She,

168
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:29.980
I've been playing phone tag all day long. Okay. So you were saying they,

169
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.300
that people making fun of Seneca, what they do? They,

170
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.180
they make fun of Seneca quite a bit outside, you know,

171
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:39.990
unlike Authentica doesn't have anything, what are you still doing here?

172
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.610
And it's not like it used to be, I mean years and years ago,

173
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:49.140
this used to be at the neatest little town you'd everyone live in and then it

174
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:51.960
just, I dunno, it just went downhill.

175
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.493
<v 6>Mm.</v>

176
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.740
<v 2>Yeah. Almost dying. I mean that's, that's the only way you can say it.</v>

177
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.700
Sandy Hanson wanted to save the town, unofficial town historian.

178
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.720
This started back in 73,

179
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.680
I believe it was when it stopped being a division point.

180
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.720
So the trains no longer stopped here. So that did away with the three hotels,

181
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.280
the 24 hour cafe,

182
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.350
the man that had filling station pulled out in front of a semi at Mullen at

183
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.820
ended that business.

184
00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:28.990
His brother had the shoe shop and he died of a heart attack setting.

185
00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:33.991
They're working on is choose the lady that had the variety store tripped on a

186
00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:37.950
kitten and broke her hip. That closed that

187
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:39.950
<v 0>and uh,</v>

188
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.280
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

189
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.690
<v 0>do you mind if we just wait until the train goes by? No.</v>

190
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.433
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

191
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.580
<v 0>anyhow, Seneca really started dying.</v>

192
00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.450
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

193
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.430
<v 0>Presley get away from them. Okay. Well,</v>

194
00:11:58.431 --> 00:12:02.270
so I guess I'm here because I'm trying to talk to as many people as I can to

195
00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:05.360
understand what happened with the whole vote to unincorporated

196
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.810
again, Savor Milli. It started out there was six horses.

197
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.940
They were up in mud up to their probably belly and I think,

198
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.570
um, one of them had to be put down because it was kicked.

199
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.950
This is how close they were together anyway. I mean, I'm an animal lover.

200
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.810
I wanted something done about it. Several of us did. So we had a meeting.

201
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.000
<v 3>The board tried to tell him that's not sanitary,</v>

202
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.170
Nancy Eisen and the rest of the safe Seneca three. We did discuss it. You know,

203
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:42.190
we've got to get the horses gone. That's the purpose of the, the ordinance.

204
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.840
But ed was not just that Judith Brown [inaudible] they wanted to get rid of all

205
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:50.920
the horses, all the cattle, all the chickens. That is ridiculous.

206
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.910
Happy chickens. But do you fly your chickens to, they run around town.

207
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.540
People are so afraid that their animals who were going to be taken away from

208
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.790
them and then eventually

209
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.180
<v 0>the board members forbid people to have animals.</v>

210
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.000
That was the just of it and so

211
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.060
<v 3>more and more and more. The town got split.</v>

212
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.980
There's a group of people here and a group of people here. Nobody gets along.

213
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.060
Nobody on the town board would speak anybody, which of course then that just,

214
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.860
man, I just yell at him louder.

215
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.220
There's certain people that I just get hand gesture.

216
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.110
One finger at hand gesture. Pretty much. Yeah. People said things like,

217
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.690
my dog doesn't want to be friends with your dog. It was awful.

218
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.150
You Terry, by chance, you know, can I have 20 minutes of your time?

219
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:42.010
I saw Terry Hartman who wanted to end the town. Yeah, this just got ugly.

220
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:47.070
They started taking pictures of people's places and put it on Facebook and say

221
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:50.710
how they didn't clean up their property and just public shaming people.

222
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.910
This was the same Seneca people that were posting this supposedly, you know,

223
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:58.450
there were aggressive comments. We did have the sheriff come up.

224
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.710
Did anyone tell you that it was just out of control? I mean,

225
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.790
what about a Xanax? You know, I took a lot of them during those years.

226
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:12.090
It was a very unhappy time and so finally people started going around with a

227
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:17.560
petition to get the unincorporated [inaudible] on the ballot.

228
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.920
We thought we will just unincorporated and even corporate unincorporated,

229
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.330
I'm incorporate our village and incorporate.

230
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.160
There are agitators in every grew.

231
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:35.570
<v 5>Oh Wow.</v>

232
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.610
<v 0>Okay. That's me. That seems kind of like the nuclear option here, right?</v>

233
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:42.850
Like we're just going to blow the whole thing up. Oh yes, absolutely.

234
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.743
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

235
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.900
<v 0>I think that sense of shared community was just slowly dissolving</v>

236
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.150
<v 1>year by year. Again, Matthew Hanson of the Omaha World Herald,</v>

237
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.360
and it didn't have, it had probably to do with what was happening in Seneca,

238
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:02.090
but I also believe that I had to do what was happening in the United States.

239
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:07.390
So where did the idea that winning the argument is more important than the much

240
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:14.660
harder job of coming together and saying, okay, we disagree on this.

241
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.530
Let's find a, a solution to our problem.

242
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.823
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

243
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.820
<v 2>I'm having a little trouble figuring out what's about to happen.</v>

244
00:15:27.821 --> 00:15:29.100
Like how close is this?

245
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.420
<v 1>The sense in the town was certainly that this thing was just a dead heat.</v>

246
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.830
Really split right down the middle. Oh yeah, that's that close. And so, uh,

247
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.760
when we come back from break, Seneca goes to the voting booth and decides

248
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.620
<v 8>this is Kim Eslinger calling from Bismark North Dakota.</v>

270
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.800
<v 1>hello. Hello. My name is Simon. I think I sent you a letter a week.</v>

271
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.360
We're not going to talk even even for five minutes. Nope, I don't want to.

272
00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:29.340
You'll probably talk to the haters, but I'm done. Let the line dogs like,

273
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.920
okay. Thank you so much. Alright, bye. Goodbye.

274
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.910
All right, so that was a, that was Jacqueline licking,

275
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.510
who is the woman who circulated the petition and she a just refused to talk to

276
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:44.594
me.

277
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.740
I'm Robert Krulwich and I'm Simon Adler's is radio lab and Simon is with me.

278
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.070
Just

279
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.390
<v 2>before the break you were saying Simon, the town is in Scott. Awful trouble.</v>

280
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.170
Trouble.

281
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.860
Half the town was so upset with the town and the government and the people of

282
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:01.380
the town that they were circulating a petition

283
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.900
<v 1>that would end the town itself. I mean, I got where they were upset,</v>

284
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.140
but I certainly don't get the idea that the solution is to end this place that

285
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.150
has existed since 1888 this again is Matthew Hanson reporter for the Omaha World

286
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.480
Herald and it bugged me. W and y. Why did that bother you?

287
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.920
Because I'm from a small town.

288
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.390
I could imagine it happening to my town and I,

289
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:32.391
I can also empathize with the frustration of the people who wanted to keep it a

290
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:34.940
town. I mean you have to meet Sandy Hanson.

291
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.950
<v 2>Will you show me a couple of your favorite artifacts you've got here?</v>

292
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.860
Who operates a museum of Seneca History?

293
00:18:41.861 --> 00:18:45.460
I want other people to know just how nice this place is.

294
00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.410
You cannot go to her museum and not say, wait a second. This place has value.

295
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.840
This one I wish could talk. What?

296
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:57.520
We've got baseball jerseys here with the Asana, the Seneca baseball teams.

297
00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.490
I got the uniforms. Even the socks, one pair of pants. Don't have the cap.

298
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.890
Santa Canada baseball team. Oh yes. Nolan all over the country.

299
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.340
Now this is the newspaper cutouts,

300
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.150
1860 these are pictures of family that lived here.

301
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.540
These are advertisements of people of the area.

302
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.150
You've gotta Send Seneca Centennial Hat? Yes.

303
00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.830
And so people just send you stuff we went to. Is part of the concern here that

304
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.450
<v 1>the history will be forgotten?</v>

305
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:28.220
<v 8>Yes, it is.</v>

306
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.790
Because we have been a town for 120 some years.

307
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.570
So what is it? What does it mean to be a town?

308
00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.130
What does it mean?

309
00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:44.210
It means neighbors coming together for the good of each other.

310
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.750
When my husband died, he died in Texas. I brought his by a,

311
00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:54.751
she's back at play and I'm just having a graveside service out there at cemetery

312
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.540
where all the time people wouldn't hear that they had a big meal prepared.

313
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.230
My Yard was mowed, the water was turned on,

314
00:20:03.231 --> 00:20:08.231
everything was ready to go and it became a full service or what did that feel

315
00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:12.590
like? It felt like home,

316
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.530
like the way you're supposed to feel, you know, warm and wanted

317
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.443
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

318
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.530
<v 2>You see they're talking about something that used to be, again,</v>

319
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.240
Judith Brown who wanted to end the town.

320
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.260
They wanted to preserve it the way it was and I agree.

321
00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:34.300
It used to be a lot of fun,

322
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:39.620
but that's true of any town up and down. This railroad will, if they,

323
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.570
if they're trying to preserve it, but then what are you trying to do?

324
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:48.130
You're just accepting that we're going downhill here. Know

325
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.010
<v 3>I'm accepting that for I myself.</v>

326
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.040
I can't do any better than this for myself as an aging woman.

327
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.720
I've only lived here 20 years, but I'm from here. My Mom,

328
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:02.450
my dad,

329
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.450
my cousins are all strung all over these hills and this grass,

330
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.820
you know. Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is to me it's heaven.

331
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.440
Like I don't care about my house falling down.

332
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.480
I'm 70 years old and I'm going to finish up my art supplies and die at the

333
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:26.860
respectable age of 96 and I do have enough art supplies

334
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.300
that putting up for years to do.

335
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:34.120
That was that the nerve that was being touched.

336
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.170
You're bad because you want to live this way. Yes.

337
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.200
These people saying we can be proud of our town,

338
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:45.970
we can make it hustle and bustle. So if they're saying that, then you're saying,

339
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.120
no, we can be proud of just the way it is now. Yeah. See.

340
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:58.420
Okay. So how, when did you first hear about the petition going around?

341
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.550
Oh Gosh. Um, again, Millie from the safe Seneca side,

342
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.010
<v 8>I think the same day it was going around, I heard about it. And how,</v>

343
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:14.720
how did you feel in that moment? It was horrible. It really was. It was just,

344
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.000
it was more than frustrating.

345
00:22:17.001 --> 00:22:22.001
It was just like somebody punches you in the gut and she lets all the air out,

346
00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:23.690
you know? It's just,

347
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.070
<v 3>it's just sad.</v>

348
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:31.490
Mostly it just seemed like if we could get rid of this unbelievable piece of

349
00:22:31.861 --> 00:22:35.340
bureaucracy, then we could just live here.

350
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.550
So finally, if the unincorporated,

351
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.590
it got on the ballot at the regular election where you do the senators and all

352
00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:48.330
that, we add a special ballot for Seneca where we voted for the town.

353
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.900
And would it or would it not be unincorporated?

354
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.700
What did you feel when you were going to that to vote for you?

355
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.560
I don't remember feeling anything except I've got to get in there and vote.

356
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.320
If you don't mind just telling me how you voted. Oh, I voted to unincorporated.

357
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.320
<v 8>I voted to keep the town incorporated. I have loaded ton incorporate.</v>

358
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.430
I voted to keep the town and then she said, okay,

359
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.310
<v 3>okay, that's the last Seneca ballot shoes on or she's that she's on</v>

360
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.980
Jackie. Severe Sabre.

361
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.390
So just because I don't think I've had anybody explained this to me yet.

362
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.780
Can you explain the night of the election and what actually happened?

363
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.530
<v 8>Well, you know we have Internet access,</v>

364
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:36.580
so we were watching the election results on the Internet to see how it came out

365
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.480
and who is we are there were, I don't remember, four or five of us,

366
00:23:40.481 --> 00:23:43.000
six of us maybe. I'm not sure who all was there.

367
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.040
So what would you like refreshing the page over and over again?

368
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.370
<v 2>How did that work? No, we knew about what time they'd be on. You know,</v>

369
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.660
we gave them an hour or so and we logged on and saw it.

370
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.560
We saw that the village was unincorporated.

371
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.530
It was by one vote.

372
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.180
[inaudible] it was 15 to 16 we lost our town.

373
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.940
Sandy Hanson again. Hello. What was that looking like?

374
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.810
I can't say it on the radio. So what was lost?

375
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.100
Well, the day after they decided to abolish a town,

376
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.750
the sheriff come down with them.

377
00:24:22.751 --> 00:24:26.200
I don't know what they thought we were going to shoot them off but guns or what?

378
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.350
But the sheriff came down, they took the grater,

379
00:24:29.351 --> 00:24:34.351
they took the tractor that for took our snowplow and we no longer have our

380
00:24:35.171 --> 00:24:40.000
street maintenance, our lights, maybe our identity. I don't know.

381
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:45.250
We never had much here, but we didn't ask for much. I mean we lost,

382
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.390
we lost.

383
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.700
So will be taken off at the map and if it isn't on the map where they can look

384
00:24:51.701 --> 00:24:55.030
it up, there ain't nobody knows it's there.

385
00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.110
I cried. But I mean it hurts.

386
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.260
Dancey ice him again cause I've been here since my third grade year.

387
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.860
People are moving away and Jackie's severe. I'm myself, I'm ready to go.

388
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.750
We're all ready to leave. We don't have anybody. There's been,

389
00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:13.300
nobody moved here since nobody.

390
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.380
It sounds like you're saying the future is gone. I wouldn't say it's gone,

391
00:25:17.381 --> 00:25:21.790
but I would say it's very, very limited and unlikely. Yes,

392
00:25:21.791 --> 00:25:23.320
I have voted done incorporate

393
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.320
<v 8>again, Terry Hartman,</v>

394
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:32.350
but I love this town and I think the people who voted to unincorporated are the

395
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:38.540
people who wanted to keep things the way they were. We didn't want to change.

396
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.300
I know everything has to change, but,

397
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.870
but I didn't know what else to stop dividing. You know,

398
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.490
this is my hometown too. I don't know how to explain it. It,

399
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.910
it just got so ugly and out of hand and some of the members of the village board

400
00:25:55.251 --> 00:26:00.230
were just crazy, but the town board was just three members.

401
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.070
Millie,

402
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.070
<v 0>they have to do really what the majority of the town wants to do.</v>

403
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:12.030
Otherwise we can get rid of them. So you believe in the democracy of Seneca,

404
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.390
I believe in democracy. Does that make me an idiot?

405
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.340
I mean, I live in hope, you know,

406
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.730
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

407
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.390
<v 2>it just,</v>

408
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:33.390
it really felt like Seneca had lost something essential when we're talking about

409
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:41.950
basic American democracy again, Matthew Hanson of the Omaha World Herald.

410
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.980
And it worried me to that and part

411
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
<v 1>because I could feel that and still feel that happening on a national level that</v>

412
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.560
the kind of a just complete lack of conversation around shared values or a

413
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.410
compromise.

414
00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:06.860
<v 3>I've got a smoke mourn and drink more and one that's time.</v>

415
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:12.680
Okay. Judith Brown. So, um,

416
00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.760
<v 1>okay. Can I, can I tell you what I, what I hear here,</v>

417
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.970
maybe the strongest argument for keeping Seneca a town on the books is that then

418
00:27:22.991 --> 00:27:27.991
there was some sort of framework to force those two communities within the town

419
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:33.460
to be together and to think together. And with that now gone,

420
00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.530
there is now no communication, no compromise, nope.

421
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.850
<v 3>So none of those people had anything to do with this before except it</v>

422
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.540
continually criticized how we were.

423
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:52.450
So we couldn't compromise with these people. They were not rational.

424
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.270
All rationality was gone by then.

425
00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.620
And what's going to happen with this next election.

426
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.410
<v 1>But America is full of diverse opinions and it has managed to work.</v>

427
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:06.630
And I guess if we take what happened here,

428
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.670
and if we apply that model to the rest of the United States, like if not a town,

429
00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:12.504
then what?

430
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.010
<v 3>Um, we have the county,</v>

431
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.040
we have the state and the little town without those hateful people in it is

432
00:28:19.311 --> 00:28:23.460
really quite lovely. But it's not a town anymore.

433
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.480
I don't know why you think that officially. Right.

434
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.520
But it is a town. Here we are.

435
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.920
I'm going to live here until I die.

436
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:38.910
And so it was rose and Harry until some woman lands him.

437
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.300
<v 1>So you would say that even though on the books, Seneca no longer exists.</v>

438
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.310
<v 3>Seneca is still exists. Yest and we're still two tribes.</v>
