00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.299
According to google dictionary,

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.348
Intuition is the ability to understand something immediately without the need for conscious reasoning. In other words,

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:26.639
it's the gut feeling people are accustomed to experiencing that influences their actions that doesn't require logic. Ever since the Age of Enlightenment,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.320
people are prone to dismiss ideas without some sort of scientific research to support them.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.279
Although science has opened the world to a plethora of possibilities,

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.609
conveniences, and truths, ultimately, it still serves as only one type of perspective within the big picture.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.039
Intuition has been given a bad rep for being too otherworldly due to its psychic inclination.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.480
However, the mysterious power of intuition is still undeniably

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.230
beneficial that the US Navy began a program in 2012 to

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.779
investigate how members of the military can be trained to use their sixth sense to help them during combat and other missions.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.469
The goal of the program is to determine whether or not there are techniques that can improve people's intuition. Don Tucker,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.140
Psychology professor at the University of Oregon, said the research could improve training not only in the military,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.150
but also in sports and many job settings. Tucker also adds, "Spider Man had powers,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.620
but maybe the rest of us can learn to use the experience of the intuitive cognition, we have."

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.910
We want to remind you not to underestimate the great capacities of intuition. Here's seven things highly intuitive people do differently:

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.940
Number one: You listen to your inner voice. Gut feelings are experienced by many,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.439
but what sets highly intuitive people apart from others is that they actually listen to them.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.560
Sophy Burnham, author of "The Art of Intuition, writes, "Everybody's connected to their intuition,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.290
but some people don't pay attention to it as intuition.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.870
I have yet to meet a successful businessman that didn't say, 'I don't know why I did that. It was just a hunch.' "

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.820
Due to cultural bias, intuition is commonly regarded as pseudoscience and hocus-pocus,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.349
which can cause the majority of us to ignore our own instincts that may have come in handy.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.589
You don't have to abandon logic altogether to rely on intuition,

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.329
but it can be incredibly beneficial to learn how to achieve a balance between using both.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.130
Number two: You practice mindfulness.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.609
Highly intuitive people have a great knack for being self-aware.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.929
This is nurtured from their habit of practicing mindfulness on a daily basis.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.079
When you meditate, you're able to alleviate yourself from mental fog that leaves you clear minded and focused on your inner voice.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.400
The purpose of mindfulness is to declutter your mind from worry and any loud,

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.550
distracting thoughts that make it hard for you to tap into your inner self.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.100
This boosts your knowledge of how to operate, and as a result, you can recognize and use your intuition

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.980
without having to attach the "whys" behind your actions.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.850
Number three: You have a creative outlet that you often use.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.740
Musicians, writers, artists, entrepreneurs, and dancers are able to sustain their creativity because they follow their intuition.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.670
Instead of being swept by fear and wondering how they will achieve their dreams,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.679
they never stop believing in themselves, nor do they question whether or not it makes sense to go after them.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.369
It's only natural for them to follow their heart. It may sound incredibly naive and overly simple to some people, but perhaps

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.520
It's because it's been a long time since they listen to their own intuition.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.049
Intuitive people follow their creative endeavors, regardless of the judgments they receive. Because of them, it feels more foolish to hold themselves back.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.259
Where there is intuition, there is also the will to create.

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.989
Number four: You enjoy solitude.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.509
Highly intuitive people don't mind finding a quiet corner away from the busy world. In fact,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.889
they enjoy their solitude because it gives them an opportunity to listen to their intuition.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.790
It's hard to locate it when you're stifled by traffic, stress, and everyday

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.749
responsibilities that make it hard for your intuition to roam free and simply be.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.230
This is why highly intuitive people also have a tendency to

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.469
daydream. It releases everyday tensions and clears your mind so that you can connect with yourself on a more authentic level.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.850
Number five: You are observant of your immediate environment and those around you. As a result, you are able to connect deeply with others.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.649
When you pay attention to the small details in your environment and of the people in your life,

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.439
you can learn to understand how and why things work.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.239
This is how your empathy grows when you see how other people are affected by different situations

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.219
and you can learn to take on more than one perspective when considering why people are prone to acting a certain way.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.500
It's helpful to you because in turn you understand how to tune in to your own emotions.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.589
As a result, you can form deep connections with others. Some people may get the impression that you can read their mind.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.749
But in truth, you have allowed your empathy to help you use your intuitions that lets you know exactly what they need.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.070
Number six: You pay attention to your dreams and subtle messages from the universe.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.190
Your dreams and intuition come from the same place,

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.060
which is your unconscious mind.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.479
When you're highly intuitive, you may often pay attention to calm the themes of your dreams that can be telling you something.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:59.019
In addition, you also notice subtle messages the universe may be giving you from songs that play every time you turn on the radio,

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.949
quotes that you come across in books, or the notes you receive in fortune cookies.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.210
They can all be incredibly nuanced the more you can make sense of these situations.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.639
Number seven: You don't overwork yourself, nor do you attach yourself to negative emotions

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.959
or situations. When you experience strong, negative emotions, they can cloud your

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:24.370
intuition. In fact, according to Burnham, when you find yourself feeling depressed or highly angry this may cause your intuition to fail you.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.739
This is why highly intuitive individuals,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.650
don't overwork

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.929
themselves because they understand that they need to feel at peace, in order to nurture that special trait. As a result, people with good intuition

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.039
form healthy habits when they learn how to find balance both in their lives and within themselves.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.979
