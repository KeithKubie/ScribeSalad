00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.820
- [Instructor] So let's write
down a differential equation,

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.880
the derivative of y with respect to x

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.580
is equal to four y over x.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.100
And what we'll see in
this video is the solution

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.210
to a differential equation isn't a value

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.700
or a set of values.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.520
It's a function or a set of functions.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.020
But before we go about
actually trying to solve this

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.840
or figure out all of the solutions,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080
let's test whether certain equations,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.120
certain functions,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.280
are solutions to this
differential equation.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.030
So for example,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.370
if I have y is equal to four x,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.020
is this a solution to this
differential equation?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.010
Pause the video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.940
Well to see if this is a solution,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.770
what we have to do is figure
out the derivative of y

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400
with respect to x and
see is that truly equal

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.540
to four times y over x.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.530
And I'm gonna try to express
everything in terms of x

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.670
to see if I really have an equality there.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.240
So first let's figure
out the derivative of y

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.890
with respect to x.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.000
Well that's just going
to be equal to four.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150
We've seen that many times before.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.820
And so what we need to test is,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.880
is four, the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.550
equal to four times, I could write y,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.140
but instead of y let's write four x.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.620
I'm gonna put everything in terms of x.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.960
So y is equal to four x,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.660
so instead of four y I could
write four times four x,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.390
all of that over x.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.900
Is this true?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.790
Well that x cancels with
that and I'm gonna get

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.480
four is equal to 16,
which it clearly is not.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.170
And so this is not a solution.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.140
Not a solution

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.330
to our differential equation.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.780
Let's look at another equation.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.890
What about y is equal to
x to the fourth power?

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.010
Pause this video and see
if this is a solution

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.307
to our original differential equation.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.650
Well we're going to do the same thing.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.150
What's the derivative
of y with respect to x?

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.210
This is equal to, just
using the power rule,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.030
four x to the third power.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.420
And so what we have to test is,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.070
is four x to the third power,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.790
that's the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.010
equal to four times y,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.230
instead of writing a y I'm gonna
write it all in terms of x,

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.280
so is that equal to four
times x to the fourth,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.810
because x to the fourth
is the same thing as y,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.600
divided by x?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.470
And so let's see, x to
the fourth divided by x,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.660
that is going to be x to the third.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.790
And so you will indeed
get four x to the third

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.500
is equal to four x to the third.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.150
So check, this is a solution.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.310
So is a solution.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.950
It's not necessarily the only solution,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.940
but it is a solution to
that differential equation.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.190
Let's look at another
differential equation.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.650
Let's say that I had,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.040
and I'm gonna write it
with different notation,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.580
f prime of x is equal to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.550
f of x minus x.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.100
And the first function that I wanna test,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.620
let's say I have f of x is equal to two x.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.900
Is this a solution to this
differential equation?

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900
Pause the video again and
see if you can figure it out.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.850
Well to figure that out,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.620
you have to say well what is f prime of x?

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.220
f prime of x is just
going to be equal to two.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.300
And then test the equality.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.740
Is two, is f prime of x, equal to f of x,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.500
which is two x, minus x,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.160
minus x?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.160
And so let's see we are going
to get two is equal to x.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.840
So you might be tempted to say oh hey

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.600
I just solved for x or
something like that.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.670
But this would tell you
that this is not a solution

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.853
because this needs to be true for any x

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.970
that is in the domain of this function.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.790
And so this is, I'll just put an x there,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.320
or I'll put a incorrect there to say not,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.320
not a, not a solution.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.930
Just to be clear again,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.130
this needs, in order for a
function to be a solution

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.610
of this differential equation,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.490
it needs to work for any x

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.510
that you can put into the function.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.940
Let's look at another one.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.940
Let's say that we have f of
x is equal to x plus one.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.140
Pause the video and
see, is this a solution

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.280
to our differential equation?

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.520
Well same drill.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.500
f prime of x is going to be equal to one.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.460
And so we have to see is f prime of x,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.240
which is equal to one,
is it equal to f of x,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.220
which is x plus one, x plus one, minus x?

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.940
And so here, you see no matter what x is,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.080
this equation is going to be true.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.530
So this is a solution,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.223
is a solution.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.160
Let's do a few more of these.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.000
Let me scroll down little bit
so I have a little bit more,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.797
a little bit more space,

00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:50.480
but make sure we see our
original differential equation.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.480
Let's test whether, I'm
gonna do it in a red color,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.100
let's test whether f of x

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.060
equals e to the x plus x plus one

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.970
is a solution to this
differential equation.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.320
Pause the video again and
see if you can figure it out.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.210
All right well let's figure
out the derivative here.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.520
f prime of x is going to be equal to,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.910
derivative of e to the x with
respect to x is e to the x,

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.560
which I always find amazing.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.200
And so and then plus one
and the derivative of this

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.830
with respect to x is just zero.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.250
And then let's substitute this

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.810
into our original differential equation.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.330
So f prime of x is e to the x plus one.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.080
Is that equal to f of x,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.080
which is e to the x plus x
plus one, minus x, minus x?

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.130
And if that x cancels out with that x,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.880
it is indeed, they are indeed equal.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.170
So this is also a solution.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.943
So this, this is a solution.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.013
And we're done.
