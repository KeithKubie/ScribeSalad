00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.140
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Kahn Academy

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.830
and today I'm learning
about the 10th Amendment

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.954
to the Constitution, the last amendment

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.620
in the Bill of Rights.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.555
The Bill of Rights was
added in order to calm

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:12.991
some of the fears held
by those who felt that

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:16.748
the new, stronger central
government under the Constitution

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:19.524
might infringe upon the
powers of the states

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:22.100
or on individual liberties.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.453
The 10th amendment was
specifically designed

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:26.620
to allay those fears.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.160
It reads, the powers not
delegated to the United States

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.780
by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.500
are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.360
So what does this actually mean?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.100
To learn more, I sought out
the help of some experts.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.140
Randy Barnett is the
Carmack Waterhouse professor

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.240
of legal theory at the
Georgetown University Law Center

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.557
and director of the Georgetown
Center for the Constitution.

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:55.441
Robert Schapiro is the Asa
Griggs Candler professor of law

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.490
and dean of Emory Law School.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.900
So, Professor Barnett, can
you tell us a little bit

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.720
just about what that means?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.810
It's a little dense.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.880
- [Prof. Barnett] During
the ratification debates

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.210
there was lots of opposition
to the Constitution.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.647
In fact, the Constitution
only was ratified after

00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:15.401
the proponents of the Constitution,

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.229
who called themselves Federalists,

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.714
promised that amendments would
be made to the Constitution.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.127
Because it was the lack
of a Bill of Rights

00:01:23.127 --> 00:01:27.260
and other changes that
caused people to oppose it.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.300
And so they said they would
put a bill of rights on

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.771
afterwards and at that
point in these ratification

00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:37.356
conventions, conventions
started proposing amendments

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:40.830
to Congress that accompanied
their ratification.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.730
So they ratified it and
they said, but here are some

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.090
changes we want to see made.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.949
And one of the changes that
several states asked for

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:50.900
was wording that was very
much like what became

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.220
the 10th amendment.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.260
A reaffirmation of the fact
that the federal government

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.650
was going to be one of
limited and enumerated powers.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.440
- [Prof. Schapiro] And the 10th amendment

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.327
is an expression of the idea
that while there are more

00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:06.755
powers given to the central
government of the United States

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:10.720
it's still the case that the
only power that the central

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.090
government, the national
government, can exercise

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.625
are powers specifically given
to it by the Constitution.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.847
So the 10th amendment is an
embodiment of the structural

00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:24.800
principle that the only
powers that the national

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.140
government has are those
that are delegated to it

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.008
in the Constitution.

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:34.106
As opposed to the states
who have general powers

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:35.910
within their boundaries.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.630
- [Kim] One of the things
that I think we see

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.630
in the Bill of Rights is
many examples of the framers

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:47.917
responding to particular historical evils

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.140
that they had witnessed in England

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.950
or in Europe, more generally.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.594
So was there something in
particular they had in mind

00:02:54.594 --> 00:02:57.410
they were trying to prevent
with the 10th amendment?

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.710
- [Prof. Schapiro] I
think the particular evil

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.365
they were concerned with was
the concern of a distant,

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:06.770
powerful, centralized government.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.210
That had been the
government of King George.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.930
They wanted to make sure
that wasn't the government

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.860
of President George Washington
and the 10th amendment

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.124
states that the national
government is not an all powerful

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:24.447
body with general authority
to do whatever it wants.

00:03:24.447 --> 00:03:27.180
It's in line with the
structure of the Constitution

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.045
which says there are certain
powers given to the national

00:03:30.045 --> 00:03:33.095
government, there certainly
are definite powers

00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:36.730
given to them but only some powers.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.730
And that idea of being
concerned of a distant, strong

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.810
government far away from the
people is really what underlies

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.570
the principle of the Constitution.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.980
And that's what we see
in the 10th amendment,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.300
specifying that the powers not delegated

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.160
to the United States by the Constitution

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.342
are reserved to the states.

00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.220
- [Kim] So what would you say is important

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.780
about the 10th amendment?

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.430
- [Prof. Barnett] It reaffirms
that the basic structure

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.052
of the Constitution is one of
limited and enumerated powers.

00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:11.450
How limited, of course,
is a matter of debate.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.956
But the fact that they are
limited and that all other powers

00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:17.480
are reserved to the states
respectively or to the people

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.850
is now a matter of Constitutional law,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.590
it's a matter of the text.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.220
The other thing that's
interesting about the 10th

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.790
amendment is that in Congress
they added the phrase,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.535
or to the people at the end.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.640
The states did not propose that language.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.700
The states proposed the
wording of the 10th amendment

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.652
and it just would have
stopped where it said

00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:36.370
are reserved to the states.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.240
And so that made the ninth
amendment less a states' rights

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.320
provision than the states
had wanted and less

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.470
a states' rights provision
than people read it today.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.520
So the people have rights.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.670
In fact, nowhere in the
Constitution does it say

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.340
anyone except individuals
or persons have rights.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.130
It doesn't say states have rights.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.030
The 10th amendment is
about reserved powers

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.040
and those are the powers
that the people have

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.180
to govern themselves
as well as other powers

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.870
and what this shows is that
the people not only have rights

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.390
they also have powers.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.045
Perhaps the most important
thing, however, is to note

00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:08.346
that these two are separate provisions.

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:11.402
That the Supreme Court has
sometimes read the 10th

00:05:11.402 --> 00:05:14.360
amendment, or the ninth
amendment, as meaning basically

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.520
the 10th amendment that the
people have reserved powers.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.620
But we know they're different
because they are put

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.778
in there separately and
in fact Madison placed

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:23.720
a much higher premium on
the importance of the ninth

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.310
amendment as opposed to the 10th.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.680
- [Prof. Schapiro] The 10th
amendment and the ninth

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.950
amendment really speak to the structure

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.889
of the Constitutional
system, what it means to have

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.454
a Constitution setting
up a national government,

00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:39.100
The 10th amendment is really
a statement of the overall

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.470
structure of what we call Federalism.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.349
Certain powers given to
the national government

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.616
and then powers reserved to the states.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:48.201
The ninth amendment
speaks more to the rights

00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:51.890
side of things, that is,
we have certain rights

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.150
which are set forth in the Bill of Rights.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.350
The first amendment about
freedom of speech and religion,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.840
the fourth amendment about
protection against unreasonable

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.830
searches and seizures,
and there was some concern

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.260
expressed in the late
1700s that if you specified

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.910
those rights, did that
somehow mean that the national

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.750
government could do
whatever else it wanted?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.502
And so the ninth amendment
says, the enumeration

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:21.150
of certain rights shall
not be construed to deny

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.910
or disparage others
retained by the people.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.749
So it's in line with the
idea that national government

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:30.197
has certain powers but they are limited

00:06:30.197 --> 00:06:32.954
because other powers are
reserved to the states.

00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:35.710
And the power of the
national government may also

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.229
be limited because there are rights

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.220
that are reserved to the people.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.729
- [Kim] How do you think
the 10th amendment tells us

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.757
that the framers intended
the federal government

00:06:44.757 --> 00:06:47.431
and the state governments
to relate to each other?

00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:49.172
- [Prof. Schapiro] The
10th amendment really is

00:06:49.172 --> 00:06:53.210
a little more about structure
than about specific content.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.510
So I think the 10th
amendment embodies the idea

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.623
that we should think carefully
about what are the powers

00:06:58.623 --> 00:07:02.300
given to the national
government, understanding that

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.965
whatever's given to the national
government may take powers

00:07:05.965 --> 00:07:07.760
away from the states.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.853
And so the 10th amendment is really a text

00:07:10.853 --> 00:07:14.970
that embodies the overall
principle of Federalism

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.385
that is implicit throughout
the United States Constitution.

00:07:18.385 --> 00:07:19.880
- [Prof. Barnett] In
fact, the 10th amendment

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.183
is in some respects kind of a
replay of the first sentence

00:07:23.183 --> 00:07:27.540
of Article One that says
that Congress only has

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.620
the powers herein granted.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.670
States have the powers,
by contrast, and the 10th

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.720
amendment affirms, the
states have the powers

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.428
that are not granted to
the federal government

00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:40.530
but are granted to them
under state constitutions.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.680
So just as the federal
government has the powers it has

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.155
under the US Constitution, state
governments have the powers

00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:49.129
they have under state
constitutions and the people

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:52.760
reserve all other powers to themselves.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.610
- [Kim] So how has the 10th amendment been

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.150
interpreted by the
Supreme Court over time?

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.810
I imagine there have been
some cases about this

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.580
as the federal government
has gotten more powerful.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.250
- [Prof. Schapiro] Exactly,
so the 10th amendment,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.950
which really is just about
the structure of government,

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.740
saying some power is given
to the national government

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.520
and there's a concern about the power

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.130
reserved to the states,
the understanding of that

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.900
has really evolved with the understanding

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.250
of the breadth, of the power
of the national government.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.900
And what we've seen over
the course of history

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.120
in the United States is
that there's been a broader

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.800
understanding of the
power of the government

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.260
of the United States.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.795
That expansion has really
come mainly in two forms.

00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:38.059
One is with regard to the
government's power to regulate

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.419
interstate commerce and
the broad interpretation

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.640
of the national government's
power to regulate commerce.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.080
We saw that particularly
in the context of the

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.120
great depression when there
was viewed to be tremendous

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.500
social dislocation,
tremendous economic problems

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.652
in the United States to the
point at which some feared

00:08:59.652 --> 00:09:03.370
that the American
democracy might collapse.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.881
And the national
government then was allowed

00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.350
to exercise more authority
over the economy.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.310
- [Prof. Barnett] The Supreme
Court, in the New Deal,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.550
declared the 10th amendment as a truism,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.820
meaning as long as you
find a power then you can't

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.470
have a 10th amendment
objection to that power.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.935
That's right, as a logical
matter, except that

00:09:21.935 --> 00:09:25.530
if you continue to expand
your interpretation

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.420
of those powers then you
are basically violating

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.420
the spirit, if not the
letter, of the 10th amendment.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.456
And finally then, during
the Rehnquist Court,

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:36.870
until today the Supreme
Courts started using

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.051
the 10th amendment to enforce the spirit

00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:42.398
of the Constitution which
preserved the existence

00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:46.510
of states even when
Congress was claiming powers

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.564
that went far beyond
those that were originally

00:09:48.564 --> 00:09:52.070
mentioned in the Constitution's text.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.010
- [Prof. Schapiro] So, in
some cases in the early

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.607
20th century you did see the
United States Supreme Court

00:09:57.607 --> 00:10:01.692
interpreting the 10th amendment
to limit, to some extent,

00:10:01.692 --> 00:10:04.492
what the national government
could do if, say, the issue

00:10:04.492 --> 00:10:09.150
were child labor or minimum
wage laws, things like that.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.300
A question is, is that really
something that the national

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.554
government can do?

00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:17.554
But in the wake of, we say,
the New Deal legislation

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.160
that was put forward by
Congress in the great depression

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.090
of the 1930s and approved
by the Supreme Court,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.918
we've seen the Supreme
Court take a much narrower

00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:32.010
understanding of the 10th amendment.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.070
Or, again, we can really
see the 10th amendment

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.600
in balance with the power
of the national government.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.340
And as we've understood a
broader role for the national

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:44.340
government the role reserved
to the states has shrunk.

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:45.268
- [Kim] This is fascinating.

00:10:45.268 --> 00:10:48.167
So one thing that interests me about this

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:52.544
in terms of US history
is the way that later on

00:10:52.544 --> 00:10:56.113
the 14th amendment is
interpreted to incorporate

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:58.630
the Bill of Rights in to the states.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.750
So how does the 14th
amendment's protection

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.174
of equal citizenship rights
then intersect with the idea

00:11:06.174 --> 00:11:10.000
that states have certain
individual powers?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.910
- [Prof. Schapiro] So certainly
in the wake of the Civil War

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.220
we saw the 13th, 14th,
and 15th amendments.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.058
The 13th amendment banning slavery,

00:11:17.058 --> 00:11:19.510
the 14th amendment guaranteeing rights

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.460
of national citizenship and
equal protection and due process

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.140
and the 15th amendment
guaranteeing the right to vote,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.220
all of which expanded the power
of the national government

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.330
and particularly the 14th
amendment and its guarantee

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.647
of equal protection of laws
and due process of laws

00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:41.544
were really new national
restrictions on state authority,

00:11:41.544 --> 00:11:46.240
a new empowerment of the
national government to protect

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.010
individuals no matter
what state they were.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.135
So since the structure
of the 10th amendment

00:11:51.135 --> 00:11:55.620
is not about protecting a
particular body of power,

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.540
it would be natural that as
the 14th amendment expands

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.927
the role of the national
government that there'd be

00:12:01.927 --> 00:12:04.930
less for the states to
do completely immune

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.440
from federal intrusion.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.110
- [Prof. Barnett] The
14th amendment represents

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.250
a fundamental change to
our system of Federalism.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.260
Precisely because it has
a section five in the 14th

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.590
amendment which empowers Congress
to enforce the provisions

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.490
of the previous four sections
including section one

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.660
which has the citizenship
clause and the privileges

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.430
or immunities clause and
the due process clause

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.810
and the equal protection clause.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.820
So Congress is given an
enumerated power to protect

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.042
individuals from their own
state governments violating

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:39.570
their fundamental rights under
those section one provisions.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.080
That's a change in our
Federalism that is consistent

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.990
with the 10th amendment
because it's a power

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.790
that is delegated to
Congress by the Constitution,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.100
by section five of the 14th amendment.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.107
What happened to that,
however, immediately after

00:12:53.107 --> 00:12:55.768
it was enacted is the
Supreme Court decided,

00:12:55.768 --> 00:12:58.781
and I think quite consciously
in their minds decided,

00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:01.500
that this change in our
system of Federalism

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.510
was objectionable.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.510
In fact it was the product
of radical republicans

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.690
in Congress and it really
needed to be undone.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.840
And so in one of the earliest
examples of what I would call

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.488
living Constitutionalism,
in a series of cases

00:13:13.488 --> 00:13:17.987
the Supreme Court cut back
on the powers of Congress

00:13:17.987 --> 00:13:21.850
to protect individuals from
the rights of their citizens

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.770
in cases like the
Slaughterhouse cases or United

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.680
States versus Crookshank,
or Plessy versus Ferguson.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.350
These are cases, the civil
rights cases are more

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.648
in which the Supreme
Court actually cut back

00:13:33.648 --> 00:13:37.240
on the scope in order to
restore the Federalism

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.260
that existed prior to the Civil War

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.930
that the justices preferred.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.850
- [Prof. Schapiro] I
think based on its text

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.640
and its interpretation
over time we see the 10th

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.250
amendment really being a
recognition of the Federalist

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.410
structure of the United
States Constitution,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.457
meaning there will be
a national government

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:54.908
and there will be states.

00:13:54.908 --> 00:13:57.850
And that has not changed over time.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.578
What has changed over time
is an understanding about

00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:03.744
the scope of the role of
the national government.

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:06.127
How much power the
national government needs

00:14:06.127 --> 00:14:08.528
either to regulate the national economy

00:14:08.528 --> 00:14:11.010
or to protect individual rights.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.297
Certainly the interpretation
of the interstate

00:14:13.297 --> 00:14:17.088
commerce clause and the
enactment of the 14th amendment

00:14:17.088 --> 00:14:19.906
have been key elements
in expanding the role

00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:21.590
of national power.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.160
- [Prof. Barnett] But
all of this expansion

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.870
of national power is completely
consistent with the language

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.330
of the 10th amendment which
again does not specify

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.983
any particular kind of power
reserved to the states.

00:14:32.983 --> 00:14:35.479
It just recognizes that
there will be a national

00:14:35.479 --> 00:14:37.930
government and there will be states.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.920
- [Kim] So how have the
courts been utilizing

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.040
the 10th amendment in recent years?

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.310
- [Prof. Barnett] In
recent years the courts

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.710
have been using the 10th
amendment not so much

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.310
for what it says but for its spirit.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.150
The idea that it reaffirms
the importance of states

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.010
in our Constitutional structure.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.340
What's happened since the
New Deal is the powers

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.950
of Congress under its
enumerated powers have been

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.170
so broadly or expansively interpreted

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.543
that if they were all
to be applied to states

00:15:03.543 --> 00:15:06.130
they way they are applied
to private individuals

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.410
and private companies essentially
Congress could basically

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.592
run all the states using
it's commerce power

00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:15.210
combined with its
necessary and proper clause

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.523
power, et cetera.

00:15:16.523 --> 00:15:19.460
What the Supreme Court
has done in recent years

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.475
is said this violates the first principles

00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:24.740
of our Constitutional
order which says states

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.320
are important, the 10th
amendment affirms that.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.880
And therefore they've
created certain carve out

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.693
or special protections for
states from these broadly

00:15:33.693 --> 00:15:37.410
or expansively read Congressional powers.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.420
None of this is really
stemming from the original

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.410
meaning of the 10th amendment
because what's already

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.446
happened is the original
meaning of the enumerated powers

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:47.100
has already been exceeded.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.170
But what it's attempting
to do is to keep in place

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.560
the balance between
federal and state powers

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.500
that the 10th amendment represented.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.840
But doing so in a way
that's basically modern.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.562
It's adding the states to a
list of protected entities,

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:04.188
protected from expansive federal power.

00:16:04.188 --> 00:16:06.720
- [Kim] So we've learned
that the 10th amendment

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.670
reaffirms that the federal
government of the United States

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.880
will be a limited government
with enumerated powers.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.504
But as the scope of the
federal government has grown

00:16:16.504 --> 00:16:19.600
so has debate over the interpretation

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.830
of the 10th amendment.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.933
Which actions of the states
can the federal government

00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:26.890
regulate and which exceed federal power?

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.816

10th amendment visit
