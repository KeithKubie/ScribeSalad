00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.830
First appearing in 1986 on a highway between
the city of Caracas and its airport, La Mancha

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.430
Negra, meaning literally a black stain, began
as an approximately 50-yard (46 meter) long

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.849
smudge, seen by highway workers who were resurfacing
the road with asphalt concrete.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.140
Ultimately the spot grew to cover about an
8 mile (13 km) stretch.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.100
In 1991 it was widely reported that the slippery
goo had caused over 1,800 deaths and countless

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.100
other injuries.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.640
So what is it and is it still there today?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.239
Many hypotheses have been proposed over the
years as to the cause of La Mancha Negra,

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.570
such as that it’s the result of raw sewage
from slums that line the road, with the idea

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.930
being the sewage runs downhill and under the
asphalt where it mixes with the compounds

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.790
in the road, breaking it down and producing
the slippery, chewing gum like substance.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.380
Another popular theory is that oil and other
fluids from old, rickety cars produce the

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.860
goo when mixed with the dust of the roadway.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.360
Conspiracy theorists proposed it’s an intentional,
regular sabotage by certain political powers

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.399
to turn the public against the government
leaders.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.100
Authorities reportedly tried a number of remedies
in the mid-1990s to remove the goo, including

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.259
pressure washing it with detergents and simply
scraping the goo off in layers.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.570
All attempts to get rid of the substance were
reportedly in vain, though it’s noted that

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.000
each attempt made a hefty profit for the company
in charge of the removal of the substance

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.340
and there was some question as to how hard
they were actually trying.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.119
As a last ditch effort, authorities finally
decided to dump pulverized limestone on the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.780
goo to “dry it up”.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.170
It seemed to work for a while, although it
produced an unwanted consequence – the limestone

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.500
was so dusty that it supposedly severely hurt
the air quality along the road for local residents

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.970
for a while after application.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.110
So what’s the real cause of La Mancha Negra?

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.899
It was widely reported at the time that authorities
spent “millions” trying to figure out

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.130
what the substance was, but this doesn’t
seem credible.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.520
While it is possible that millions of government
funds disappeared in the name of solving the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.290
problem (given the rampant corruption in the
Venezuelan government at the time), no direct

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.610
evidence of any such studies seems to exist
anywhere.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.720
Further, if any studies were done, it would
not have been expensive or difficult to determine

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.250
if the substance was the result of some sort
of asphalt / human excrement mixing.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.880
It likewise would have been equally simple
and cheap to determine if it was car oil mixed

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.090
with dust or the like or any number of other
likely substances.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.639
The widespread report of “1,800 deaths”
caused by the slippery road have also never

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.470
been substantiated by a credible, direct source.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.010
One would think that an eight mile stretch
of road covered in a slippery substance would

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.590
have a higher rate of car accidents than a
normal road, but 1,800 deaths between 1986

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.260
and 1991 over that short stretch of road that
everyone knows is extremely slippery?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.850
That’s an average of about one death per
day.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.780
Even if the road was literally covered with
ice, this would still be a questionably high

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.250
number.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.590
Lacking any actual evidence to support the
claim, and the news media wont to exaggerate

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.730
such figures, color me skeptical.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.380
Further lacking anyone bothering to study
the substance, the two most plausible causes

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.960
of La Mancha Negra are, first, that it’s
just natural asphalt/bitumen seepage.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.600
You see, Caracas lies next to the Orinoco
Belt, which contains one of the world’s

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.790
largest deposits of petroleum.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.100
Such seepages are not unheard of in the region-
for instance at the asphalt lake, Lake Bermudez,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.760
in Venezuela, where oil seeps to the surface
and becomes asphaltic thanks to good conditions

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.130
for oil-metabolizing bacteria to thrive.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.120
The second, perhaps even more plausible, hypothesis
is that the La Mancha Negra phenomenon is

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.010
simply the result of using poorly mixed asphalt
concrete when constructing the road.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.530
This second hypothesis is supported by the
fact that the goo in question seems to have

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.110
the properties of tar (chewing gum consistency,
but quite slick in certain conditions) and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.880
that the problem gets much worse on hot days
and goes the other way on cool days.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.440
This same phenomenon is commonly seen with
improperly mixed asphalt, generally when too

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.840
much asphalt is mixed in with the aggregate.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.639
It’s also noted that the seepage only occurs
directly along that narrow stretch of road

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.610
(making the natural seepage hypothesis less
likely) and that the road was resurfaced with

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.230
asphalt concrete immediately before the problem
first appeared…

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.270
Putting two and two together here doesn’t
exactly seem like rocket surgery, but news

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.230
reports with titles like “Mysterious, Deadly
Goo Kills 1,800 in Venezuela” sound a lot

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.910
better than “Road Crew in Venezuela Do Crappy
Job on Eight Mile Stretch of Road.”

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.380
Further, although the phenomenon of La Mancha
Negra is widely reported as still existing

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.680
today and reported as still being very much
a mystery, all such modern reports I could

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.510
find use the original news stories from the
early 1990s as their sources.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.150
There seem to be no further direct reports
after this or other indication that La Mancha

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.550
Negra still exists along the road in question
today.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.540
(For what it’s worth, a simple Google Maps
satellite view of the strip in question also

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.870
seems to indicate the road has been replaced
sometime since then and there is no visual

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.710
sign that any part of the highway is different
than the highway before or after the supposed

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.710
“black stain” stretch.)

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.940
Given the lack of news reports of this still
being an issue (at least that I could find;

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.830
if you happen to be from Caracas and can provide
more insight please do in the comments below;

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.560
Google Translate can only get you so far when
looking for news reports in a language you

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.560
don’t speak :-)), it seems likely from the
limited data we have that improperly mixed

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.360
asphalt used in resurfacing the road in 1986
caused the problem.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.780
And as for the fantastical claims of that
it’s a “substance humans can’t identify,”

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:25.620
this is more than likely simply because humans
never tried.
