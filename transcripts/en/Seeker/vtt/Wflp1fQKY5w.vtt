00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.100
Just over a year ago, on October 19, 2017
astronomers saw an object from interstellar

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.610
space flying through our solar system for
the first time.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.800
It was dubbed Oumuamua -- Hawaiian for “scout”
-- and almost as suddenly as it had appeared,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.320
it was out of sight again.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.070
Of course we at Seeker covered it and reported
that based on what scientists saw they concluded

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.669
it was an asteroid.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.710
Now though, they’re not so sure.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.000
There are a few things we can be certain about.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.310
We know it must have come from outside our
solar system because it was traveling so dang

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.310
fast.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.420
Oumuamua shot past us at almost 88 kilometers
per second.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.830
That sort of speed couldn’t have come from
the sun’s gravity alone, so it must have

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.130
been fired at us from somewhere beyond.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.120
We also know it’s shape, size and.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120
Color.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.480
It’s likely very elongated, like a stubby
cigar, and it’s tumbling through space.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.330
We also know it’s about 400 to 800 meters
long and stained dark red, possibly from it’s

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.640
interstellar journey.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.610
Everything else about Oumuamua is basically
a question mark.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.530
We still don’t know exactly where it came
from, but new research just narrowed down

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.619
new candidates as Oumuamua’s potential home.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.100
Using data from the European Space Agency's
Gaia spacecraft, astronomers identified four

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.039
dwarf stars, two that have been identified
and two unnamed ones, that Oumuamua might

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.340
hail from.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.700
Scientists aren’t convinced yet, because
there’s still so much that’s unknown about

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
it.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.069
But the biggest topic of debate around Oumuamua
is what the heck this thing actually is.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.001
Astronomers originally thought it was an asteroid
but now they can’t agree because it’s

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.999
done some things a comet would do, and there
are plenty of reasons to believe it could

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.479
be either.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.479
Comets are icy balls of dust, and when they
swing past the sun that frozen volatile material

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.999
turns into gasses that carry away the dust
and give them that distinct tail as well as

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.689
a haze, or coma, around their nucleus.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.310
Oumuamua didn’t have that, so scientists
concluded it was an asteroid.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.829
But recently, upon a closer examination, they
noticed something odd.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.850
Oumuamua had accelerated ever so slightly
on its journey out of the solar system, more

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.479
than the Sun’s gravity could account for.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.829
The only way they could explain it would be
if it was jetting off material, but if it

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.409
was outgassing volatile material than that
would make it more like a comet than an asteroid.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.019
So it could be a comet.

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.840
But it’s long and tumbling, and if it were
a ball of dust instead of a rocky and metallic

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.230
asteroid, some astronomers believe it’s
should have torn itself apart.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.370
It’d have to be something more solid, like,
you guessed it, an asteroid.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.830
But comets are more common and can be ejected
from star systems much more easily than asteroids,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.700
so for the first interstellar visitor to be
an asteroid would be unlikely.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.840
The debate probably won’t be settled any
time soon.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.060
Because of Oumuamua’s speed we only had
a couple of weeks to observe it, and it didn’t

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.040
help that Hurricane Maria took Puerto Rico’s
Arecibo Observatory out of commission.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.569
All we can do is sit and wait for the next
object like Oumuamua to come by and hope we’re

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.800
lucky enough to spot it.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.230
In the meantime we’ll just pore over what
we know and hope something definitive emerges,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.680
or we’ll have to come up with something
of an in between category to put Oumuamua

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680
in.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.819
I know some of you are sitting at home screaming
that if it defies explanation, then it must

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.530
be extraterrestrial in origin.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.159
Well we thought of that too.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.560
Even though it was only observable for a couple
of months, which left astronomers scrambling

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.140
for telescope time, SETI managed to scan it
to see if it was emitting radio signals.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.140
It was not.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.140
Darn.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.230
Trust us, no one wants to find signs of alien
life more than astronomers, but as Dr. Meech,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.359
an astronomer on the team that helped spot
oumumua told us last year, "if you were gonna

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.579
say it's something extraordinary, you better
have extraordinary proof.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.360
"
And as of now, we still don't have that proof.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.609
So Oumuamua probably isn’t aliens, but that
hasn’t stopped scientists from looking for

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.030
alien messages elsewhere, check out this video
to learn more.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.361
And fun fact, a new telescope set to start
scanning the skies in 2021 is expected to

00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:54.550
find as many as 10 new interstellar objects
in a decade.
