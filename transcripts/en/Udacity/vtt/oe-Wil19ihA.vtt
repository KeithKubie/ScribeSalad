00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.240
So, I decided to take a look at cnn.com, a popular news

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.573
site. To get started, I opened up dev tools by pressing Cmd

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.080
+ Opt + I. You can see the dev tools here, here

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.620
is the HTML. So we're in the timeline now. I want to see

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.053
what happens when the page loads. So, I'm going to press Cmd+ Shift+

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:19.030
R, reload the page and we can see all of the events of

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.740
the page load. Laid out in the timeline here. Well, this is

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.550
cool for desktop, but I wonder what it looks like on mobile. Luckily,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.180
Chrome gives us the option of seeing what it

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.480
looks like on mobile. I'm going to press this button

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.640
to open up the console, there we go, and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.590
we can see that there's a tab up here, emulation.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.140
So, I click on this, I see the Google

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.620
Nexus five, and I press emulate. So now, we're

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.560
looking at CNN.com from a mobile perspective. Bu,t this

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.191
looks weird. I'm going to fix the screen a little bit.

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.328
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:53.165
And, I'm going to refresh the page, by doing

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:56.077
command shift r. And now, we see the mobile

00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:58.301
version of CNN on the left. And our timeline

00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:00.630
on the right. Let me get rid of this

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.510
bottom part by pressing escape. And move the screen

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.450
over to give ourselves a little more room. And

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.440
let's take a look at the timeline. So, I've

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.360
selected about the first second or so of events.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.820
Let me see them in a little bit more detail.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.220
Alright, so we see the request here for

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.550
a page cnn.com/, so I'm going to click on

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.554
this and open up the details, click on

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.809
cnn.com, and we should see what this file is.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.820
Scrolling down. This should look pretty familiar. It's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.080
just an HTML document. Going back to the Timeline,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.490
let's get rid of some of these details. We can see a lot of events up here.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.430
We click on this Filter button, it let's us get rid of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.440
some of them so we can just look at what we want.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.160
I just want to see the loading events, so we'll get rid of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.340
scripting, rendering, and painting. And now, we can see the request for

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.720
the home page, and the response as we're receiving data. CNN.com finishes

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.290
loading, we get that HTML file, and then we start to parse

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.050
the HTML. And, it looks like in parsing it by opening up

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.300
this step, we see that we requested CSS and JavaScript. After that,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.340
scrolling down, we can see more requests for all of the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.220
scripts. Images and CSS files, that are needed to load the page.
