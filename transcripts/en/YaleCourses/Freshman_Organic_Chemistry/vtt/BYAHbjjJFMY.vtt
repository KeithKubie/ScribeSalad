WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.030
So we're going through the development of the theory and practice of organic

2
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:10.770
chemistry,
generation by generation.
We started with Lavoie,
ca and then,

3
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:13.350
but say alias and Galea sock and Davy.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.280
And last time we did do ma and Lebeck and Buller and now we're onto the next

5
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:22.710
generation.
People that were born around night,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.800
1830 and the new developments are going to be valence and benzene.

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.190
Remember in this list,

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.090
things that are in bold face or experimental and things that are theoretical or

9
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:40.890
in,
in normal face surveillance and,
and benzene is experimental.

10
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.240
But what we're interested in is the theory of benzene here and the people who

11
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.540
are associated with this are our goose Keka lay.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.440
And you've all heard of calculate structures and calculate benzene.

13
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:57.441
And he's memorialized on the front of the building here at born in 1829 but few

14
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:03.300
of you probably have heard of Archibald Cooper who was,

15
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.950
is not on the front of the building and was born two years later in 1831.

16
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.030
This is Cooper as a student.
Uh,

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.820
he lived to a reasonable age,

18
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.260
61 years old,
but everything he did,

19
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:22.800
he did early.
He was a sort of a dilettante's student.

20
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.650
He was a native of Scotland and studied in Edinburgh,

21
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.610
but also went to Berlin often and he studied classics and metaphysics logic,

22
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.350
moral philosophy,
went to a lot of concerts.

23
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.210
But while in Berlin he got fascinated by chemistry.

24
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.870
So in 1855,
he became a student chemist.

25
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.670
And in 1856,
he went to Paris to work with boards.

26
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.680
Who was the other leading,
uh,
uh,

27
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.920
French chemist and worked indeed on salycilic acid as you have done,

28
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.380
uh,
in 1858,
while in boards lab,

29
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:06.381
he got fired for reasons that you'll see and he went back to Scotland and tried

30
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:07.860
to make a career there,

31
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.360
but Sooni had a mental breakdown and the rest of his life he didn't do anything.

32
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.890
Okay.
But what he did in 1858 is really something.

33
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.890
Okay.
So he didn't get a stone on the front of our building.
But in this,

34
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:25.080
built in this,
on this building,
which,
uh,

35
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.590
is to ladder at least was a few years ago in Kirkintilloch,

36
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:32.160
which is about eight miles northeast of Glasgow in Scotland.

37
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.400
There's a stone and it says this black marks the birthplace of Archibald's Scott

38
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.851
Cooper,
who's brilliant,

39
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.390
pioneering contributions to chemical theory if one for him,

40
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.960
international renown and whose genius stifled by an early illness,

41
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:48.690
was denied the opportunity of consummation

42
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.560
when he was recovering from his first break down,
he went fishing on this,
uh,

43
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.680
Andrick water north of Glasgow and got sunstroke,

44
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.400
which even for the rest of his life,
and that's where he lived.

45
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:08.170
His mother nursed him for his final 33 years in this house in Kirkintilloch.

46
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.020
So this is the paper.
He tried to publish it in French.
He's,

47
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.490
he submitted it to,

48
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.350
to his boss vortex in the hopes that he would put it in the French journal,

49
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.740
but for its thought,
it was not such a,

50
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.000
there was a little a rash as a paper and put it in his desk to cool off for a

51
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:29.890
while.
And in the meantime,
calculate published,

52
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.540
which irritated Cooper no little.
And he,
uh,

53
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.950
he told a words what he thought about it,
which was why he got sacked.

54
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.230
Uh,
but he also published at an English and later it was published in French,

55
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.120
but this,
so this is the English version,

56
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:50.200
not the first version he wrote by Archibald's Scott Cooper.

57
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.180
And the first sentence already is,
is fascinating.
The end of chemistry.

58
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:57.670
That is the goal of chemistry is it's theory.

59
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.030
Not many people would have said that they would have had more practical

60
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.990
motivations for chemistry.
But,
uh,
Cooper was,
uh,
was,
uh,

61
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.540
a big thinker.
He said,
the Guide in chemical research is a theory.

62
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.860
It is therefore of the greatest importance to ascertain whether the theories at

63
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:19.720
present adopted by chemists are adequate to the explanation of chemical

64
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:24.430
phenomenon,
or at least based upon the true principles,

65
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.590
which ought to regulate scientific research.

66
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:31.591
So what were the theories that were prevalent at this time in eight by 1850

67
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.650
named one shine.
Dualism.
Okay.

68
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:43.180
The radical theory that was prevalent in Germany.
How about elsewhere?

69
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:44.014
Like France,

70
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.870
the substitution or tight or a unitary theory.
Okay.

71
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:53.560
So those were the big theories among those which have been lately developed.

72
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.450
There is one on account of it's apparent,

73
00:04:55.451 --> 00:05:00.040
numerous merits which particularly claims investigation and respecting which we

74
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:04.240
deem that it would not be unprofitable were either new proofs of its scientific

75
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:04.631
value,

76
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:09.150
furnish door on the contrary should the considerations be adduced establishing

77
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.900
not only its inadequacy to the explanation but it's ultimate detriment to the

78
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.940
progress of science.
I allude to the system of types as advocated by Gearhart.

79
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.800
So Gerhardt and Lauren who are a slightly second level,

80
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.850
uh,
French chemists were the ones who really came up with the idea of the type

81
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:32.050
theory,
but do ma,
uh,
adopted and advocated that and was the leader.

82
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.120
Uh,
so any of that.

83
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:37.750
So this was the theory that was going on in the lab where he was,
uh,

84
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.340
present in Paris.

85
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.070
So page one oh six of this paper on the French type theory,
he said,

86
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.360
should the principal,

87
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:49.630
which is there in adopted be applied to common events of life,

88
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.270
it will be found that it is simply absurd.

89
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.130
Suppose that someone were to systematize the formation of letters into words

90
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.020
that formed the contents of a book where he,

91
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:04.580
to begin by saying that he had discovered a certain word which would serve as a

92
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:09.200
type,
I remember there were four types,
right?
Water,
ammonia,
uh,

93
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.030
hcl and hydrogen,

94
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.020
and from which by substitution and double d composition,

95
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.920
all the others are to be derived that he by this means not only can form new

96
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.340
words,
but new books and books almost.
I didn't finite up.

97
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.880
He would state certainly an empirical truth that as you can take some words,

98
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:29.300
substitute letters are pairs of letters or sets of letters for other letters and

99
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:33.140
get any words you want.
Okay.
At the same time,
however,

100
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:37.160
this method would judge by the light of common sense be an absurdity.

101
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.481
But if principle,

102
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:42.590
which common sense brands with absurdity is philosophically false and the

103
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.910
scientific blunder.

104
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.990
So this was not likely to make him popular in Paris

105
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.950
at the same time.
However,
I would say,
so here's,

106
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.170
here's what he was doing actually,
right?

107
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:57.800
The emperor's new clothes is the new guy on the block,
right?

108
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.840
He's only been a chemist for two years,

109
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.800
only begun studying chemistry two years before and says what everybody is doing

110
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.700
is nonsense in Paris,
in France.
While how about in Germany?

111
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.070
That's where he was before in Berlin.

112
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.540
I can only remark that it does not merely an unprofitable figure of language,

113
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:19.541
but as injurious to science in as much as it tends to arrest to scientific

114
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:23.720
inquiry by adopting the notion that these cuase I elements,

115
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.430
what does he mean by the quasar elements?
What are they?
Compound radicals,

116
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:31.820
right?
Contain some unknown and ultimate power,

117
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:36.200
which it is impossible to explain.
That is,
okay,
so you've got radicals.

118
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:38.930
What holds the radicals together?
Right?

119
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.870
It stifles inquiry at the very point where an explanation is demanded by putting

120
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:48.650
the seal of elements of ultimate powers on bodies,

121
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.510
which are known to be anything but this.

122
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:54.380
They're definitely not elements cause you can burn them of course and get water

123
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:56.810
and CO2 and so on.
Okay,

124
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.050
so this was absolutely true on both counts,

125
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:04.970
both the French and the German theory,
but it was stated pretty undiplomatic Lee.

126
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.040
Right?
Especially for someone who'd only been studying chemistry for two years.

127
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:13.280
Maybe it took someone who was only studied in chemistry two years to see how

128
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.760
stupid it was.
Right?
But at any rate,

129
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.560
he got in trouble because of this.

130
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.360
What did he offer as an alternative to look at the properties of the elements

131
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.190
themselves,
not of radicals,

132
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.170
not of these planetary systems that were the types science demands,

133
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:33.800
the strict adherence to a principal in direct contradiction to this view,

134
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.750
that first principle without which research cannot advance a step,

135
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.990
dare not be ignored,

136
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.920
namely that a whole is simply the derivative of its parts.

137
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.520
So if you have to understand the elements and then you can understand assemblies

138
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.910
of elements from that,
that's not obviously true.
In fact,

139
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:52.580
I think you could make a pretty good argument that as you'd get things more

140
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:54.890
complicated,
they're not simply a sum of their parts.

141
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.320
But that's what he said as a consequence of this.

142
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:03.321
It follows that it is absolutely necessary to scientific unity in research to

143
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:08.190
consider these bodies as entirely derivative and as containing no secret

144
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:09.630
ultimate power,
whatever.

145
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.980
And that the properties which these so called quasars elements possess are a

146
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.850
direct consequence of the properties of the individual elements of which they

147
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.510
are made up.
So study the elements,
not the radicals.

148
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.440
And he began by saying he'll focus on carbon,

149
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.850
which is not surprising for an organic chemist and apply in this method.

150
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:32.880
I propose at present to consider the single element carbon.

151
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.560
This body is found to have two highly distinguishing characteristics.

152
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.980
One,
it combines with equal numbers of hydrogen,
chlorine,
oxygen,
sulfur,

153
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.590
etc. Would you agree with that?

154
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.910
How could he say so

155
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.230
it's because he wasn't dealing with the right atomic weights,
right?

156
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.650
It enters into chemical union with itself.

157
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.610
So those are the two things that it'll you unite with itself,

158
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.780
not just with other things.

159
00:10:11.781 --> 00:10:16.400
The way dualism would like you to do and it combines with it has a certain

160
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.020
combining power.
These two properties in my opinion,

161
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.710
explain all that is characteristic of organic chemistry.

162
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.640
So 1858 marks that a new frontier in organic chemistry,

163
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.440
completely new revelation,
the Tetra Valence and self linking of carbon.

164
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:38.120
That's points one and two right?

165
00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:41.600
That it combines with a certain number of other things and it can link to
itself.

166
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.560
Right now here he shows the formula of methane of co two and of carbon

167
00:10:48.261 --> 00:10:49.160
tetrachloride,

168
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.750
but those are the atomic weight sees using in order to get these formulas.

169
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.191
Notice he says,

170
00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:59.690
here are the whole four of hydrogen are not bound by a mutual affinity.

171
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.000
You know that they're not all collected together because you can substitute them

172
00:11:05.001 --> 00:11:06.240
one by one.
Clo,

173
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.490
one chlorine to chloramines three chlorines for each element of hydrogen can be

174
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:13.880
substituted for one of chlorine and regular series beginning with the first

175
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:17.810
ending with the last,
the atoms of oxygen are on the contrary,

176
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:21.290
United in Pairs.
What does he mean by that?

177
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.200
That the oxygens are United in Pairs.

178
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.980
Why are they United in pairs in his formulas drawn by those curly brackets like

179
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.580
they had in type theory?

180
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.283
<v 1>Yeah,
Angela,</v>

181
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:42.690
they're probably one oxygen is,
wait,
it's happened.

182
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.310
<v 0>Aha.
Because he had half of the atomic waste,
so they always came in pairs.
Right.</v>

183
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:50.340
Take to get oxygen.
16 if he thinks oxygen's eight,

184
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.230
the atoms of oxygen or in pairs,
which will be more,

185
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.730
which will be more fully developed here after,
not in this paper,

186
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:01.150
but there was no hereafter because of his breakdown.
Okay.

187
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.010
And only for two atoms of oxygen to chloramines can be substituted thus.

188
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.450
So you can start with CEO to get phosgene and carbon tetrachloride in the same

189
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:14.260
manner with bodies that contain multiples of c two United dihydrogen.

190
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.680
So carbon is the same deal.
It always comes in payers,
right?

191
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.150
Because it's atomic way to six instead of 12.
Okay.

192
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.760
Take the inverse of this.
If the four atoms of hydrogen,
we're bound together,

193
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.770
we could evidently expect to form such bodies as h for cl four.
Right?

194
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:36.580
If the four were all held together and could make four bonds,
right,

195
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:40.270
then you could get h for cl four or these other compounds.
Uh,

196
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.230
one would naturally expect to find carbon substitute for chlorine.

197
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.510
Find bodies like h for cl two c two and so on.

198
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.520
These bodies are not only unknown,

199
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:51.880
but the whole history of hydrogen might be investigated and not a single

200
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.900
instance be found in favor of the opinion that it has any affinity for itself

201
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.770
when in union with another element.
Okay,

202
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.900
so that member getting all the chlorine is together was uh,
was Schindler's idea.

203
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.390
Okay.
So here,
now,

204
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.050
now that he have the idea that these atoms associate together,

205
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:16.090
it makes sense to talk about a structure,
right?

206
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.550
What's connected to what's connected to what,
you know,

207
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:22.480
the toe bone in the ankle bone and all that stuff.
Okay.

208
00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:25.030
So now you could write structural formula.
So this was the,

209
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.650
these were the very first structural formula because before this there was no

210
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:32.560
such thing as structure.
Okay?
Thus,

211
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:36.520
mythic alcohol has this formula and [inaudible] alcohol has the other.

212
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:40.660
So now do you see the,
see the theme here,
what's he using to note bonds?

213
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.710
Three dots,
right?
Are a bond.

214
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.330
So he has a carbon bonded to three H's and also two o.
O.
H.

215
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.920
That's because oxygen is doubling,
right?
So we would write it this way,

216
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.400
or ethyl alcohol.
We would write that way

217
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.090
or this compound.
Now this one has a printer's error in it.

218
00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.840
What is it and what's the printer's error?

219
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.280
What's the substance?

220
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.110
Sam,
could you read it off to me?
Start from the left.
Bottom left.
What is it?

221
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.820
What's the first group?
There's a carbon.
That's the single carbon,

222
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:38.020
right?
Yeah.
Methyl ch three right?
He doesn't draw the three bonds,

223
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:41.620
the hydrogen separately,
but it's clearly been seed bonded to three hydrogens.

224
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:42.940
What's next?
Keep going.

225
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.670
It's a c bonded to what?
The top left.

226
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.380
It's bonded to the methyl of course.
What else?

227
00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:00.320
It's to the oxygen to a single oxygen.
All the we wrote to.
Right.

228
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.450
And what else is that carbon bonded to

229
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.240
<v 1>nitrogen.
How many?</v>

230
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.000
How many hydrogens are bonded to the top left?
Carbon?

231
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.210
<v 0>The two.
So let's see.
H Three C H,
two o.</v>

232
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.550
Now can someone help me out with the rest of it?
Ryan,

233
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.490
wouldn't that only just be one?
Cause it should be one old,

234
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.070
but he's got the different topic.
Wait,

235
00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:32.030
John [inaudible] is on the far right.
Should be bonded to one another.

236
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:36.740
The printer lashed that out.
So it's symmetrical.
It's die,
ethyl ether.

237
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.110
Okay.
And it's the correct structure for it except for the printers there.
Okay.

238
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:48.610
Now he says there is no reaction found where it is known that c two is divided

239
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:50.270
into two parts.

240
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.780
It is only consequent therefore to write as Gerhardt does C to simply as see it

241
00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:01.160
being understood that the equivalent of carbon is 12 so he changed it in this

242
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:04.790
paper to be 12 so now he's formulas are going to be more like ours,
right?

243
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:09.470
Without the c two so he has gliss a formula for glycerin and one for

244
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:14.270
glycyrrhizic acid.
So let's do Gleiss Eric acid.
What do you see up at the top?

245
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.090
What's the top carbon?

246
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:28.470
<v 1>Maxwell.
You say?
What's it bonded to?
The carbon at the top on the right</v>

247
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.470
one.
Hydrogen,
H

248
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.050
and o h group Barbie,

249
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.230
another two o h groups

250
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.230
<v 0>and the carbon below.
Right?
Because carbon can bond to carbon.</v>

251
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.810
That's the special thing about it.
Okay,

252
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.960
so here's the one on the left in a formula nowadays,

253
00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:54.961
and there's the one on the right and it turns out he gets a bit wrong because he

254
00:16:54.971 --> 00:16:57.910
put two o h is on the top carbon and none on the middle one,

255
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.090
and it should be the other way around.
So in truth,

256
00:17:01.091 --> 00:17:03.730
he should have changed those two.
Of course,
he had no way of knowing it.

257
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.440
And the same on the right.
Okay.
Somebody who's pretty close with his structure.

258
00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:12.610
But probably the most remarkable thing is,
is structure for glucose,

259
00:17:12.611 --> 00:17:17.320
which is shown here and which now he doesn't show the vertical bonds between

260
00:17:17.321 --> 00:17:19.420
carbons.
He uses this curly bracket.

261
00:17:19.421 --> 00:17:21.670
So that's a little reminiscent of type theory,

262
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.030
but clearly that's what he meant was the carbons to be bonded to carbon.

263
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.500
So that's the formula he wrote.

264
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.360
And that's the correct structure for glucose if it's hydrated.

265
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.480
Okay?
So you can add glucose is an Aldehyde Cho on the bottom,

266
00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:38.410
double Bondo.

267
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.740
So you can add water to the Aldehyde that actually happens and you get the,

268
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.790
the structure he wrote here.
So He eats right if the glucose is in water,

269
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.910
right.
So He'd try yourself,

270
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:54.150
this is a good exercise for reviewing what we've been doing.
Try,

271
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.740
it's depending on how you define it as a two or a three step sequence of Homo

272
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.740
Lumo interactions that take water plus an Aldehyde into a dial,

273
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.330
which is what you have here.
So try that one out.
Okay.

274
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.600
And then the French version of the same paper,

275
00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:12.970
which is we set up here in a little later,
he drew it this way.

276
00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:17.110
And what do you notice is different now?
The two things different actually.

277
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.840
Yeah.
Now he's drawing single lines,
straight lines for bonds.

278
00:18:22.841 --> 00:18:26.080
So this is the first time that was done.
None of these dotted lines anymore,

279
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.780
but there's a typo instead of drawing Oh,
h here and notice the uh,
yeah,

280
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:34.570
he's instead of drawing,
Ooh,
here for a second.
He's,
he,
he added,

281
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.000
he's got the wrong formula.
It's got h two there.

282
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.140
But this is really amazing that he got the correct structure for such a

283
00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:46.141
complicated molecule in the very first paper where the idea of structure of

284
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:50.920
bonds all together was proposed.
So this is really amazing.
And uh,

285
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.130
and we owe to Cooper the idea of bonds and the notation we use to do them.

286
00:18:57.041 --> 00:18:57.821
So here's old,

287
00:18:57.821 --> 00:19:02.821
I'll cemetery in Kirkintilloch in Scotland yesterday and there are,

288
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:08.170
you see that this is the gravestone of Archibald Scott Cooper.

289
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.980
And down here
is your thank you note.

290
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.780
And those were the flower.
That's the Heather,

291
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:20.460
you bought the foot on his tombstone.

292
00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.370
So that was our secret thank you note.
And we thank uh,

293
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.810
Susan through for,
for being our agent and delivering this yesterday.

294
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:39.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.460
<v 0>But on the front of the building,
Cooper doesn't get any notice at all.</v>

296
00:19:43.461 --> 00:19:47.360
It's only you guys that are in the know that can do that right on the front of

297
00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:48.680
the building.
They say calculate.

298
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.130
So let's talk about Calculi and we'll also talk about Hoffman,

299
00:19:52.131 --> 00:19:55.730
who we mentioned before is the guy in the top hat on the right end of that

300
00:19:55.731 --> 00:20:00.090
picture in liebig slab in Giessen and Cannizzaro.

301
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.370
Okay.

302
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.990
This is a drawing that calculate made at the age of 13 by my standards.

303
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:08.430
That's a pretty darn good drawing.

304
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.170
And here's one he made at the age of 18 and he was,

305
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.030
he went to Giessen University to study architecture.
Right.

306
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.000
But while he was there,

307
00:20:19.001 --> 00:20:22.500
or you went to [inaudible] lectures and got fascinated by chemistry and became a

308
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:27.420
chemist.
Okay.
He studied with that.
We can,

309
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:30.780
after he finished,
he wanted to go to Paris to study with the people there.

310
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.530
What do you think parent,

311
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.200
what do you think a liebig remember it's had worked with Gail Lewis socks,

312
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.390
so he knew from Paris.

313
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.750
What do you think he would tell leaving the young guy about to go off to Paris,

314
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.890
stay away from Doula perhaps.
Right?
What he said was there,

315
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.490
you will broaden your horizons there.

316
00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:57.680
You will learn a new language there.

317
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.070
You will learn to know the life of a great city,

318
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.000
but there you will not learn chemistry.
But he went anyhow.

319
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.480
He also went to England and became widely acquainted with all the leading canvas

320
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:11.703
of the day.

321
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:17.280
Then he got a job in Heidelberg where he was from 1856 to 58 and he did research

322
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:22.510
on CACA deal.
That's that free radical involving arsenic are remarkable.

323
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.220
His student who,
who,
uh,

324
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.030
worked with him on that was a buyer who will talk about a lot later.

325
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.770
Uh,
that was Bahnson who was the big cheese in Heidelberg was the one he was

326
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.350
calculated was associated with,
uh,
and he did the work,

327
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.330
not in a laboratory but in the kitchen,

328
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:42.250
in his apartment at this work on our snake.

329
00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.740
So in 1857 during while he was there,

330
00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:51.160
he proposed a new type right based on carbon.

331
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.370
So carbon could have four things attached to it,

332
00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:58.150
which you could substitute one for another.
Right?
So this was,

333
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.930
this was where he got the idea of carbon being something special,

334
00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:05.950
the basis of a new type and that it was Tetra Vaillant.
Uh,

335
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:10.000
and ultimately he got onto the idea a year later that carbon could link to

336
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:10.834
itself.

337
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:15.610
So he had proposed the marsh gas type before coopers paper,

338
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:19.450
but this other one was essentially simultaneous,
just slightly later written,

339
00:22:19.451 --> 00:22:20.710
but earlier published.

340
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.070
Here are his observations on Mr Cooper's new chemical theory.

341
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:33.360
In fact in two memoirs which have appeared in lead because the novel and I've

342
00:22:33.361 --> 00:22:37.600
put forward different views which in my opinion should furnish a clearer insight

343
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:41.170
into the constitution of chemical compounds clearer than coopers.

344
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.150
I may be allowed to indicate that my first paper lays down the principal,

345
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:48.280
which I have called the basis city of Adam's.

346
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:53.230
We'd say valence if Mr. Cooper thinks he has discovered the cause of this

347
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:56.950
difference of basis city in the existence of a special kind of affinity.

348
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.480
I am the first to admit that I have no right to contest his priority in this,

349
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:06.010
but he was quick to say that he was the one that had the idea first and he went

350
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:10.150
on to quite a successful career in contrast to Cooper.
Here he is in Ghent.

351
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.600
That period during which he proposed the structure for benzene with a bunch of

352
00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:15.130
people who we will talk about later,

353
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:18.940
or at least several of them we'll talk about later as the students and then he

354
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:23.470
became the leader in bond and a big new chemistry institute there.

355
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:28.060
Here he is in 1872 and we'll talk a lot about this,
this guy on the,

356
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.560
on the right here.

357
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.440
So he became a really a prime leader in chemistry.

358
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.700
Uh,
now facts,
ideas and words.

359
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.650
Words means nomenclature.

360
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:46.651
So these new ideas needed new words and not just the words written out with

361
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:51.770
letters,
but notation.
What symbols are you going to write for these things?

362
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.630
And,
uh,

363
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:57.800
a further development that is actual physical models that you could put together

364
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.820
right to d to show what you're talking about with molecules if they have

365
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:05.960
structure.
So Hoffman was great with language.

366
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:09.650
He actually went and became a leading professor in,
in,
uh,

367
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.640
the Royal College of chemistry in London because Prince Albert,
you know,

368
00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:17.300
Victoria and Albert Albert was a German.
So he,
he,
uh,

369
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.300
had a lot of connections with the German Chemistry and went to Lebeck leaving,

370
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.700
said,
Hoffman is a great guy.
You should get him.
So they got him.

371
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:25.040
So he came to London and it was,

372
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.390
was a completely fluent in English and very good at languages all together.

373
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.500
And he had the idea of systematizing the names of hydrocarbons.

374
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.920
Uh,
so,
uh,

375
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.210
he was going to base it on Latin roots.
So for will be court,

376
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.370
right?
We,
we,
what do we say for,
for butane,
right?
We talked about that last time.

377
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:49.130
So core Tane is his,

378
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:53.300
the start and then you can start pulling hydrogens off and have names for the

379
00:24:53.301 --> 00:24:57.170
radical.
So if you pull one hydrogen off its core teal cause eel,

380
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.240
remember is that root?
That means radical.

381
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.340
And then you can pull a second hydrogen.

382
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:05.390
Often you have core team and they pull a third agent office,
core,

383
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:09.520
teen eel and then core time Choriti Neil core tone,

384
00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:12.830
core Toneil for tune core Toneil what was this system?

385
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.810
How can you remember which one is core to yeah,

386
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.590
it's the vowels in order.
Aei,
Iou.
And we preserve the a,

387
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:28.820
the e and the eye.
Although we write why instead of Ifr.

388
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.150
Alcaide right.
That's where it came from,
from Hoffman.

389
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.770
But the court didn't stick because Butte was well established by then.

390
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.050
Okay.
Now how about calculators?
So that's words.
How about notation?

391
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.270
So in the paper where he proposed benzene in 1865 while he was in Ghent,
he says,

392
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:51.320
for in a footnote for glider for greater clarity,

393
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.510
I am presenting at the end of this note,

394
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.920
a table giving graphical formula for most of the substances mentioned.

395
00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.360
The idea that these formulas are designed to express is rather well known now,

396
00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:04.640
so it will not be necessary to dwell upon it.

397
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.530
I'm keeping the form that I adopted in 1859 when expressing for the first time

398
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.170
my views on the atomic constitution of molecules.

399
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.640
So 1859 is at the time he was proposing valence is on 1858 was that remember?

400
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.840
So this is now a five,
six years later and he's,

401
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:24.680
he's applying it to benzene.
This forum is nearly identical,

402
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.600
that which monsieur warts used in his beautiful lectures on chemical philosophy.

403
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.960
It seems to be preferable to the modifications proposed by Macy or low Schmidt

404
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:39.020
and crump Brown.
So let's first look at what low Schmidt Dude and from Brown.

405
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:41.790
So here's,
here's a,
here's what they said,

406
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.630
the witch calculate his superior.
Well first,
let's think,

407
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.630
what should a formula show,
right?

408
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.240
What's the very first thing a formula should show?

409
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.320
It has to correspond with the facts,
right?

410
00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.360
So what facts do you deduce about a molecule?
What should the formula show?

411
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.790
Kevin?
What elements are in,
what elements are there?
Carbon,

412
00:27:07.791 --> 00:27:12.570
hydrogen,
oxygen,
glory,
nitrogen,
whatever.
Okay,
what else?
Chai.

413
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.800
The ratio that elements like the ratio or the elements,
right?

414
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.310
The Burt's Eylea solver also had this,
but what's it going to be new?

415
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.470
I think I've got that there.
Right?
Composition,

416
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.710
the elements and the number of addicts.
What next?

417
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.670
Now with you've got the new theory,
the valence theory.
Sherwin,

418
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.730
the structure.
What do you mean by the structure?
[inaudible]
positioning.

419
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:39.320
You mean like x,
Y,
Z coordinates?
You could,
you could write,
you know,
numbers.

420
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.030
Here's the origin.
I'm going to give you these,
this 1.238 and so on.

421
00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:48.770
What then the which,
ah,
which ones are connected to one another,

422
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.570
right?
Not their positions in space,
but this is connected to this.

423
00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:55.910
This valence goes there and so on.
Okay.

424
00:27:55.911 --> 00:27:58.520
So Brett's alias was already fine for composition.

425
00:27:58.521 --> 00:28:03.080
But now we also need to show constitution.
That's the second C is constitution,

426
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.890
which means the nature and sequence of bonds.
Now sequences clear.

427
00:28:06.891 --> 00:28:10.320
This is bond to this bond or this.
What do I mean by the nature of the bond?

428
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.290
How could the bonds differ in their nature?
Single double.
Triple.

429
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.990
Right?
Okay,
so a man,

430
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.190
you need to be able to show isomers which presale?
Yes.
Couldn't show.

431
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.160
Okay.
So here's low Schmidt.

432
00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.630
This is low Schmidt's formula 1861 for a CDEC acid.

433
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.580
Can you understand it?

434
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.760
Andrew?
What do you say?
No hope.
What do you think?

435
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:42.840
And stuff on the left is

436
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.720
pardoning ch ch three right?

437
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.570
So the size is something about the weight,
right?

438
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:56.700
So see h three what's it bonded to see?
Same size.

439
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.140
What's it bonded to?

440
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:03.610
O H and what?

441
00:29:03.611 --> 00:29:07.800
Special double bonds.
So he's got a way of showing a double box,
right?

442
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:13.380
So we could easily understand it.
Okay.
Now here's from Brown.

443
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.980
Now that's benzoic acid and prompt Brown's paper.

444
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.110
So the Coh is even clearer than it was in low Schmidt,
right?

445
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.530
What's a double and single bought the same thing we use now.
Okay,

446
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:30.150
what's different is the c six part and five hydrogens attached to it,

447
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:33.090
but we don't really know how the c six is arranged all ago.

448
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.730
He also shows this one for a funnel,

449
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.690
which is a Benzie with a hydroxyl group on an Ooh.

450
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.520
So there you'll see a ring was double single,
double single,
double single,

451
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.600
and h is attached to all the carbons except for one,
which has always,

452
00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:47.950
so that's easy to understand,
shy,

453
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.010
because if you say carbon has four,

454
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.850
then you have to figure out where the fourth one is,
right?

455
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.720
If it's associated with three Adams,
but could make four bonds,

456
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:05.770
it must make due to one of them.
Let's the idea anyhow.
Or it could be,
you know,

457
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:08.260
that they all go to the center of the ring,
the fourth one and so on.

458
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:12.770
There are other ideas too.
Okay.
Or here is a reaction in a,

459
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.210
a crumb Brown's notation.
So it's an Aldehyde.

460
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.480
You add a homo of cyanide and a proton to the o and you get that compound,

461
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.790
a Cyan,
oh hydrogen as it's called.
So this is this.
It's almost identical.

462
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.490
What difference is it from our current,
how different is it?

463
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.960
We don't draw circles around the elements anymore that makes it faster to draw.

464
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.960
Otherwise it's essentially the same.
Okay.

465
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.670
Or here he says there are two kinds of alcohols,
true alcohol,

466
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.360
which can lose water and give an olefin or olefin hydrate,

467
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.310
which can lose water and given the same Olefin,

468
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:55.540
what's the difference between the true alcohol and the Olefin hydrate?

469
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.860
How are they isomers

470
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.323
<v 1>Russell,</v>

471
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:05.370
<v 0>right?
The position that Eoh relative to the AR,
right?</v>

472
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.880
So he's explaining isomers here too.
So those are pretty good.

473
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:13.000
But calculate says his is ever so much better.

474
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.350
This is calculated structure of benzene from that same paper.

475
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:22.070
Every says at the end,
I'm going to give my superior formula.

476
00:31:22.071 --> 00:31:22.870
So what in the heck

477
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.950
<v 1>is he talking about?</v>

478
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.580
<v 0>Eric,
you got any idea?
So what do you think that is,</v>

479
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.490
<v 1>Eric?
No idea.</v>

480
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.490
<v 0>Well,
you don't have much to work with in benzene.
What do you have it?</v>

481
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.880
C Six h six right,
so that's got to either be carbon or hydrogen.

482
00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:54.714
Which do you think

483
00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:58.190
<v 1>the top left there?</v>

484
00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.890
<v 0>No idea.
Anybody got an idea?
Why do you say carbon?
Kate?</v>

485
00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

486
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.570
<v 0>Ah,
it's showing up above here in the schematic when it's showing double bonds</v>

487
00:32:12.571 --> 00:32:15.660
between carbon and then the single bond and a double bond than a single bond

488
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.480
double bond and well,
let's go.

489
00:32:18.481 --> 00:32:22.800
That's open chain and this is closed chain.

490
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:26.140
What are these arrows on the end?
Ah,

491
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.190
those are the ones that look back then attached to one another somehow to make a

492
00:32:32.191 --> 00:32:34.200
ring.
Okay.

493
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.240
You think he's trying to give to imply Cartesian coordinates for the location of

494
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:45.230
every atom by worried draws these symbols,
right?
He's,
he's trying to show x,

495
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:46.280
Y,
Z coordinates.

496
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.280
<v 1>What do you think Nate?
They heave.</v>

497
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.650
<v 0>Thank you.
Thanks.
He's showing that are not</v>

498
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.230
either of you.
He's got a spot there and he's got x,
y.

499
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.590
I mean you can say,
right,
here's the x axis.
Here's the y axis.

500
00:33:06.591 --> 00:33:08.620
It says certain coordinates that that,
that,
that,

501
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.050
that you think he thinks that if he had a microscope and can see it,
that's the,

502
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:16.500
where those Adams would be.
In fact,
is it physical positioning showing

503
00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.020
Kelsey,
you got an idea,

504
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.120
you think he thinks he showing where,

505
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.570
where are these atoms are actually located in space?
What is he showing?

506
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.320
Yeah,
Sherwin.
The seek what?
What's bonded to water,

507
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:39.920
whether it's single bond or double bond.

508
00:33:39.921 --> 00:33:43.970
He showing constitution the nature and sequence of bonds,

509
00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:46.700
not positions of Adam's certainly not.
Okay.

510
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:48.980
And then the little ones are hydrogens,
right?

511
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:53.180
So you've got double the length of one of these things is how many beds,

512
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:57.470
how many valence is it has,
right.
For long for carbon,

513
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:02.480
only one long for hydrogen and Tangency then means a bond,
right?

514
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:07.130
So this is c h double bond,
c,
h,
single bond,

515
00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:10.700
c h,
double bond and so on.
And then you get to the end,

516
00:34:10.701 --> 00:34:11.780
you go back to the beginning.

517
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

518
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.720
<v 0>Now he then chose chlorinated benzene because chlorine is also monovalent,</v>

519
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.931
right?

520
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:25.220
So you can substitute for hydrogen and then you can have dye chloro benzene.

521
00:34:25.221 --> 00:34:30.221
Two or try or tetra or so right now is he showing isomers here?

522
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:34.040
That is in this case,

523
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.000
if you substituted this one or chlorine instead of that one,

524
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.060
same thing or different things.

525
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:49.510
If you believe,
what if you believed that this was a picture of things in space,

526
00:34:49.511 --> 00:34:51.130
they'd be different.
Right?

527
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:54.580
But if all you're interested in is what's connected to what buy single a double

528
00:34:54.581 --> 00:34:57.310
bonds,
then it's the same.
You have the same pattern either way.

529
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.620
How about for the dye chloro

530
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.440
would there be isomers of that?
Ah,
you could get different sequence,
right?

531
00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:10.370
They could be adjacent carbons that have fluorines are next to adjacent or or

532
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.830
beyond that.
Right?
So you could,

533
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.450
you could use this system to talk about isomers.
So how many isomers now,

534
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.010
what do you think?
Calculate thought.

535
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.560
What do you think you thought about how many isomers of Chloro benzene there
are?

536
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.280
Do you think you thought there were many?
Just what?
Yes.

537
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.433
<v 1>I'm going to show you.</v>

538
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.670
<v 0>Okay.
He thinks his,
his system is superior.</v>

539
00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:39.300
Now he also used his system in the same paper.
He did a lot of formulas,

540
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.490
but he showed these compounds like this one.

541
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.580
What's that group on the left?

542
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.180
What's the group here?

543
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.920
What is that?
What's this Adam

544
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.500
ch three what's this ch two

545
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:05.790
o.
H.
Two O is two units long,
right?
So ch three ch two ch two O.
H.

546
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:10.620
I'll.
Cool.
Proppy league.
Propyl alcohol.
Okay.
Now what's this one?

547
00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.870
C.
H Three
C H.

548
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:20.290
Three C.
H.
O.
H.

549
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.820
It's all cool.
Made Teal at the league.

550
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:29.100
Methyl ethyl alcohol.
So this would be ethyl alcohol,
the part on the top,

551
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:30.770
but we've got n methyl substitute and it,

552
00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:34.170
and notice he's having to change his formula,
right?

553
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:38.220
Because now these are horizontal tangent sees that are bonds,

554
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.250
but this vertical Tangency doesn't count as a bond.

555
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:45.240
So it's getting a little complicated to explain to students.
Right.

556
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.840
Okay.
What's the next one?
C h three

557
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.840
what's this c double bond.
O.
C.
H.

558
00:36:57.841 --> 00:37:02.670
Three.
So that's our old friend acetone.
And what's this one?

559
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.730
Ch Three ch Oh,
age,

560
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.840
right?
C H.
Three al.
Cool.
Our say Tony.

561
00:37:13.841 --> 00:37:18.030
So it's the alcohol you get by adding two hydrogens to acetone.

562
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.900
Now,
what do you think about this?
Do you see anything interesting?

563
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.790
This one is ch three c,
h.
O,
h.
C.
Three.

564
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:33.750
This one is ch three Ch,
ch,
three o h.

565
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.430
So okay,
what do you say?
Ah,

566
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:48.230
they're the same nature and sequence of bonds,
right?
That one's what we know of.

567
00:37:48.231 --> 00:37:51.360
That's that one,
that one,
that one.
But uh,

568
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.160
but the last and number 28 here are the same thing,

569
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:58.140
but he draws different formulas for them.

570
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.240
So his system is not showing isomerism properly.
Right.

571
00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:06.660
He drew these different,
he didn't say they were the same.
Right.

572
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:08.880
And they were thought to be different because when you do one,

573
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:10.560
when you prepare it one way and where are your parents?

574
00:38:10.561 --> 00:38:13.350
Another way you get a different boiling points say or something.

575
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:15.960
I actually don't know what the data was,
but there was some difference.

576
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:17.730
It said there were these two different compounds.

577
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.950
Did you ever get a wrong boiling point?

578
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:25.470
So did they write it just turned out the experiment was wrong.

579
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.880
But that shows that his system is not as good as these other systems.

580
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.390
But whatever.
He said.
Okay.

581
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:37.540
Now how about physical models of of uh,
molecules?

582
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.441
Well,

583
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:43.441
here's a great patent that was issued by the u s patent office to Samuel M Games

584
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:45.100
of Glasgow,

585
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:50.101
Kentucky in 1868 and we could read about his description of what so good about

586
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:51.041
this.

587
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:56.041
He says now if a class thus instructed be it the recitation bench.

588
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.000
So here's our recitation bench,
right,

589
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.320
and one of them has requested to form carbonic acid.

590
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:08.430
You will walk quickly to the table in front where the box is open and place on

591
00:39:08.801 --> 00:39:09.760
one of the shelves.

592
00:39:09.761 --> 00:39:14.761
A cube marked six and two marked eight carbon one oxygen too.

593
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.640
If requested to form Lyme,

594
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:24.300
he will place on the shelf a cube march 20 and another marked eight oxygen.

595
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.680
These being the elements of life,

596
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.740
these cubes being all placed in contact and the pupil being asked what have we

597
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:35.960
now answers carbonate of line.

598
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.490
All right.
Okay.

599
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:45.330
Another pupil may then be asked to give the proximate analysis for carbonate of

600
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:50.680
line and the cubes before him will indicate the answer and fix it in his memory.

601
00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:53.620
It is composed of one equivalent of carbonic acid,

602
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:57.290
22 and one of line 28 you just pull them apart.

603
00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.170
You see what the approximate analysis is.

604
00:39:59.171 --> 00:40:03.760
Another may be requested to give the ultimate analysis and by the same means he

605
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:05.170
is furnished with the answer.

606
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.850
Carbonic acid is composed of one out of of carbon to have oxygen and Lyme is

607
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:12.580
composed of one atom in calcium and one of oxygen.

608
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.470
The intelligent educator will see at a glance that this,

609
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.990
that in this chemical alphabet,

610
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:25.530
he has the means of at once arresting the attention of his class and converting

611
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:30.010
what had hitherto been an irksome task into a pleasant recreation.

612
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.940
The atomic theory,
the characteristics of affinity,

613
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:35.440
the law of multiple proportions,

614
00:40:35.441 --> 00:40:39.790
the nomenclature I saw Marizza et Cetera may all be learned in half the time

615
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:44.620
required here too far and learned so as not likely ever to be forgotten.

616
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.590
Now,
what do you think with this show?

617
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:51.730
The atomic theory that molecules are substances are composed of atoms.

618
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.780
Does it show it?
Yeah.
Okay.

619
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:59.050
How about the characteristics of affinity?
Single,
double,

620
00:40:59.051 --> 00:41:01.840
triple bond valence and so on show that

621
00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:09.310
not have any audience way that I can see.
So I doubt that one.

622
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.740
How about the law of multiple proportions?

623
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.980
Remember what the law of multiple proportions was?
Do you have the same elements?

624
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.760
If you have a parts of ADP,
parts of B and so on,

625
00:41:21.761 --> 00:41:25.150
all that stuff then what a d will be and so on.
Yeah.
Max,

626
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.790
<v 2>they only show one oxygen use notation.
Pardon me?</v>

627
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.680
Did quickly know what the exact um,

628
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.010
massive auction was because they only had one in,
isn't

629
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:38.630
<v 0>notate everything here is,
oh,
so it's okay.</v>

630
00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.680
They're right proportions,
right?

631
00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.310
But multiple proportions that you have to know something about.
Uh,
what,

632
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.040
how many of one associates with how many of another,
which isn't obvious here.

633
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.860
Okay.
Uh,
nomenclature,

634
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.970
well maybe calcium oxide and so on.
CO2,

635
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.410
I saw Marissa them that you can have the same things differently arranged.

636
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:04.551
Well,

637
00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:08.000
obviously you can put the blocks on top of one another or beside one another,

638
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:11.070
but how do you know how many you should do right then?

639
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.130
Not very clear to me that this system works well.

640
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:15.530
So those models are good for some things,

641
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:19.610
but not good for an awful lot of things.
Okay.
Now,

642
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:21.200
James Dewar in Scotland,

643
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:26.530
a student had the idea of using brass strips to show models and in fact he could

644
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.810
put these black balls on.
He said to make a combination look like an Adam,

645
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.340
a thin round disk of black and brass can be placed under the central nut.

646
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.620
I think that's really cute to look like an Adam as if he knew what an Adam

647
00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:47.090
looked like.
Right.
Okay,
so then he drew the,

648
00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:51.860
he made these models from his strips of Ben's a possible structures of benzene,

649
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:53.541
right.

650
00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:56.990
You can see where the atoms are and the four valence is on every carbon and what

651
00:42:56.991 --> 00:43:01.490
they,
which direction they go.
That particular one,
that compound,

652
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:05.060
that structure was actually prepared about a hundred years later and when it
was,

653
00:43:05.061 --> 00:43:09.290
it was called dewar benzene.
Right.
That one's interesting.

654
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:13.940
It's got a four center bond,
four carbons,
all sharing the same bond,
right?

655
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.750
Hoffman,
the guy remember who is good at language and was in London.
The,

656
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:25.190
his last lecture in London was at the royal institution.

657
00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:30.191
The place where Farah Day was and where a Davey had been and did the experiments

658
00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:31.611
that electrolysis.

659
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:36.611
So he gave this public lecture where he use croquet balls for model for Adam

660
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.620
models with,
with sticks stuck in him and he colored them.

661
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:43.720
And this system he chose is the one we still use for what color?

662
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.370
The atoms are white for hydrogen.
Red For oxygen,
blue for nitrogen,

663
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.260
black for carbon.
Okay.
So here's part of the lecture he gave.
So he,

664
00:43:53.261 --> 00:43:57.710
he would build molecules before your very eyes.
It start with a hydrogen,

665
00:43:57.711 --> 00:44:01.130
but an oxygen on and another hydrogen low.
He's made water.

666
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.440
Right.
Or he could make marsh gas methane

667
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:12.260
or he could show that,
uh,
the oxides of,
of Hcl.

668
00:44:12.261 --> 00:44:13.640
So you start with Hcl,

669
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.450
but he could take it apart and put an oxygen in between or put two oxygens or

670
00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:21.650
three or four oxygens in between to go from hydrochloric to Hypo.

671
00:44:21.651 --> 00:44:25.880
Cloris to Cloris to chloric to per caloric.
So this is like Lavoie Z,
right?

672
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.330
Going to different levels of oxidation.
Unfortunately,

673
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:31.040
those aren't the structures,
right?

674
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.740
What really happens is that the unshared pair of chlorine couldn't share with

675
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:37.140
oxygen to give that,
to give this,

676
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:40.380
which is the active ingredient in Clorox bleach.

677
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.030
Or you could use another unshared pair of chlorine to put another oxygen or

678
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:49.500
another for another and get the oxidase oxidizing agent that gay Lusaka used the

679
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:53.760
glory.
Or You could put a last one,
and this is an explosive,
in fact,

680
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:57.660
ammonium perchlorate.
AP is a component of the military explosives.

681
00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.940
Notice that in Hoffman's thing,

682
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:03.420
you could have put 15 oxygens in a row if you could have reached high enough,

683
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:08.010
but you can only go to four here because that's how many unshared bears chlorine

684
00:45:08.011 --> 00:45:11.970
has chloride as to use.
Okay,

685
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:13.590
but he,

686
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:17.670
then he showed the Clo the chlorination of marsh gas,

687
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:22.671
so mano chlorinated dechlorinated try chlorinated and Tetra chlorinated marsh

688
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:27.570
gas.
Now this is interesting because the,

689
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.040
for the dye chloro,
you could imagine having two isomers with these models,

690
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.000
right?
They could,

691
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.860
the chlorine's could be near one another or opposite one another.
Right?

692
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.050
Now,
some years later,
there was an exhibition in London and they,

693
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.670
and they showed molecular models.
By this time Hoffman was back in Germany,

694
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:52.830
but they got,
they got a guy in Spain to make some Hoffman style models.

695
00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:56.490
Manuel Gonzalez Rodriguez from Madrid made this set.

696
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.830
And here's,
uh,
Ma,
uh,

697
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:02.850
chloro methane made from that set.

698
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.280
What's the difference between these off he says,
according to Hoffman here,

699
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.670
so go an awl Hoffman,
right?
What's the difference?

700
00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.010
And Yeah,

701
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.280
they're not 90 degrees from one another there 109 and a half degrees from
wonder.

702
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:27.540
It's a tetrahedron,
not a square plane right.
Now,

703
00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:29.370
what does that say about isomers?

704
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:34.080
So supposedly substitute another chlorine and there's a dye chloro there's a

705
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:37.860
different diet chloro there's a different diet chloro how about it?

706
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.660
They're just rotated from one another.
They're not different.
Right?

707
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.980
So depending on whether it's square,
planar or tetrahedral,

708
00:46:46.981 --> 00:46:48.720
you'll get different numbers of isomers.

709
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:53.930
That's neat because it gives you a tool for telling whether it's Square Planar,

710
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.600
a tetrahedral,
right?

711
00:46:57.601 --> 00:47:02.550
So you can get structure from analysis.
So,

712
00:47:02.551 --> 00:47:05.700
but these are these constitutional models.

713
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:08.970
Try to show the nature and sequence of bonds for Hoffman,

714
00:47:08.971 --> 00:47:11.730
not the arrangement in space and not for Hoffman.

715
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.220
And not for the guy that made these models.

716
00:47:14.221 --> 00:47:16.890
They weren't trying to explain isomers in that way.

717
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.220
All they were trying to show was the same thing.
You draw in these pictures,

718
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:22.920
the nature and the sequence of bonds,
whether they're single or double,

719
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.960
triple and what's associated with what.

720
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.710
So that comes a little later trying to get to the arrangement space.

721
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.570
But the PS,
the raise,
the stance of Hoffman's lecture was this.

722
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:38.530
Then if you take these croquet ball models and make the Ola Fiat Gas,

723
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:42.530
which we talked about last time,
it's got to spare.
Valence is,

724
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.630
and if you add chlorine,
you can get the Dutch liquid,
the dyke chloro ethane.

725
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.760
But remember what we saw last time he called Ola find gas and unfinished or not

726
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:52.450
saturated.

727
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:56.830
We now call it unsaturated molecule and it's reactive because of these dangling

728
00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.910
valances and we now know why it's that way that he's got the wrong structure,

729
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:01.061
right?

730
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:06.061
It should be ch two ch two not ch ch three and we know about homos and Lumos

731
00:48:06.881 --> 00:48:07.121
now,

732
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:10.900
but that was what he really showed was that the model had something completely

733
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:15.550
new that no one anticipated.
It could explain what this new,

734
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:19.600
what new quality is he associated with the models,

735
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.120
what elements are there,
what ratio there in right.

736
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.960
How they're linked to one another,
single double,
triple bonds.
What's he adding?

737
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:33.600
<v 1>Reactivity.
Right?</v>

738
00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.290
<v 0>So it's something new.
So the whole history is adding new things,</v>

739
00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.050
new properties to the models,
and there are more to come.

740
00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:45.170
<v 1>Okay.
That's it.</v>
