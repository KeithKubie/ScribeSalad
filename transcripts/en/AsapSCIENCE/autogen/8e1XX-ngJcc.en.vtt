00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.399
 Science is everywhere. In the beauty of nature, in laughter between friends, buildings 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.880
 Which we build, and the societies that we form. She constantly wonders ... ask, why things 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.580
 They are what they are. How can we make things better? What we are in the grand scheme 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.369
 For the universe? It extends from the depths of space to the device that we are watching 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.099
 On this video, for now. 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.519
 During the Age of Enlightenment, the scientific revolution came with ideas on account (differentiation and integration), atomic theory, 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.390
 And gravity to our world. The Industrial Revolution, saw the importance of technology and the development of manufacturing industries 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.410
 Including the first cars. In the digital age, scientists urged 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 On the formation of the Internet as we know it, as a means of exchanging research and ideas. Today, 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.420
 Progress in medicine and agriculture saved more lives than lost in all 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.969
 Wars in history. 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.520
 But despite these achievements, science and society are often at odds. Scientific discoveries 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.369
 Like a spherical earth, that our planet revolves around the sun, or that diseases spread 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.979
 Through the germs that were every time ideas rejected by the community. So much so that Giordano 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.080
 Bruno Cad burned to suggest that Earth was not the center of the universe, 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.430
 Galileo even turned to house arrest to support this theory. Today we see 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.939
 Reject scientific evidence of vaccination - leading to the return of preventable diseases such as measles 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 After being eliminated in 2000; 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.780
 Or the rejection of scientific evidence for climate change, despite the great consensus between the views of scientists. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.930
 As Carl Sagan said, "We live in a wonderful society based on science and technology, 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.040
 Which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology. " 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.070
 But when we look at history, we see that science may ignore the collapse 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.200
 Of communities. Ancient Greece was a time of great knowledge about place and time ideas 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.619
 And during the later Roman period most of the empire adopted these ideas. However, 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.800
 The Romans were satisfied with the learning of the Greeks, little innovation or exploration 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.209
 New ideas about science and knowledge occurred during this era. With turning 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.459
 Governments and values, focus on reason, science and retreat away and Rome in the end 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.110
 Fell in the Dark Ages. 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.610
 Today, despite the many voices supporting logic and reason, this war continued on science. 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.239
 In the UK, investment in publicly funded research fell to less than 0.5% of GDP - for 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.459
 The lowest level was in two decades. This year, the United States cut at least $ 300 million 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.780
 Of NASA's Earth Science Budget - which happens just to include climate science. Not 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.860
 Only does this mean that the current climate studies will be ignored, but will not useful data 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.590
 Until they are collected in the future, all to serve ideological agendas. 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.819
 but why? To save banks in America costs more money than the entire NASA 50 years 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.319
 Operating Budget - A budget that evokes imagination and visions for the future of our world 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.180
 Universe. And the military budget? One month spending is equivalent to the entire NASA 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.080
 the annual budget. Here in our home of Canada, the war on science 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.790
 Is in full effect under Stephen Harper's conservative government. Libraries Our Science 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.700
 Dedicated to health, environment and fisheries the oceans are being shut down. Laws which 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.049
 Once to ensure the protection has been devoured endangered species, with 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.799
 80% of Canadian freshwater fish species 71 are currently at risk of extinction. And not only 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.750
 Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper dismissed the role of national science adviser, but some 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.819
 2,500 federal scientists lost their jobs. In a recent study, 90% of government scientists 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.450
 I felt they could not talk freely about their research and nearly 25% of those who said they were 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.849
 The government had to change their research for non-scientific reasons. 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.450
 We said that the remaining funds are oriented towards science which has a clear business 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.299
 The resulting. Which at first glance may seem fair - research that is not 'a waste of money' 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.319
 as it were. But, when Einstein constructed the theory of relativity, he knew that 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:21.000
 Would lead to the development of GPS, nuclear power, or original TV? this is 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.620
 Industries are billions, but the focus on commercial production is short-sighted, as science has learned 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.500
 It is often slow, sophisticated, and an iterative process. 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.240
 Science is much more than just a collection of knowledge and applications; it's a way of thinking. 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.750
 A way to uncover secrets in the world, we see it is beauty - where we can look at all 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.270
 The facts to make informed decisions, instead of relying on prejudices and prejudices'. 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.720
 No knowledge does not choose a political party - they simply adhere to the evidence. But only 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.930
 Good policy is also supported before science, science is supported by funding and advocacy 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.250
 From our Governments. So when you head to the polls to vote, wherever you are, remember 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.509
 That vote for science, is a vote of knowledge and progress based on reality. Look at your 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.470
 Policies of Parties to science, take a stand. 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.259
 If you believe in a successful science integration letter in our communities, please 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.330
 Share this video - on Facebook, on Twitter, through email and in person - to remind 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.289
 The importance of science.
