00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.870
MICHAEL CIMA: Chemistry is
not an abstract concept to me.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.320
It's the most important tool in my
toolkit to come up with new inventions.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.970
And that's what I do day
in and day out at MIT.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.450
I'm Michael Cima.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.820
I've been at MIT for 25 years.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.640
I'm an educator, researcher,
mentor, and an inventor.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.770
The course that I'm working
on at MIT is called 3091x.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.670
It's an introduction to
solid state chemistry.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.210
It's been taught at MIT as
a GIR for over 40 years.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.590
And it's an extremely unique course.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.340
You can't get this course
anywhere else in the world.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.610
Our goals for 3091x are a very simple.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.040
We want you, at the end of this
course, to know all the same, exactly

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.320
the same, chemical principles you would
in any university chemistry course,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.200
except that you've learned them from
the point of view of the solid state.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.820
The examples we use have to do
with the solids, the materials,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.450
that you work with every day.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.640
And that's important, because our
hypothesis is that it's easier for you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.400
to understand and to use
these chemical concepts

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.440
if you can relate them to
the materials around you.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.810
Understanding of solid state principles
has transformed all of our lives.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.930
I'm 53 years old.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.060
In my lifetime, I've
witnessed everything change,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.010
from communications,
transportation, energy, everything.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.760
And it all has been,
at its heart, centered

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.980
on discoveries in the
solid state sciences.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.390
If you think about
semiconductors, for instance,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.240
the basic concepts of what
makes semiconductors work

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.100
are the kind of thing we study in 3091.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.830
The chemical concepts
that make semiconductors

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.440
work that are at the heart of the
information age are what we study.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.470
Teaching a class at MIT is a little
bit different than anywhere else

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.060
in the world.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.940
And teaching it through 3091x
is going to be different also.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.520
But the most important rule that I use
is, we don't actually teach anything.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.960
We help you discover something.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.140
And so the rule that we'll have
in building the 3091x platform

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.900
is, how do we help students
discover solid state chemistry.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.340
Not teach them anything, but guide
them through their own discovery

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.470
of what, I think, is a
very important science.
