Remember, our goal in analyzing this Facebook user data is to

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.990
understand our users and their behavior. This question is just another

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
dimension where we're trying to understand which segment of our population

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.600
uses a certain feature on the website. In this case, we're

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.870
wondering whether or not males or females end up using likes

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.380
on the World Wide Web more often. So, first I'm just

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.612
going to remind myself of what variables are in my data set.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:25.430
I'm wanting to compare likes between the genders, so I'm going to

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.320
use www_likes. This code would give me a histogram which isn't

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.690
what I want. And remember I also need to subset my

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.812
data to remove any values for gender that are NA.

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.276
Now this bit of code is starting to look more like what

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.252
I want. But, I've only got one frequency polygon on here,

00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:44.380
and I need two. So I'm going to use the color

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.620
parameter, and pass a gender. That seems a little bit better.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.460
I'm also going to add scale x continuous, since I know that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.740
World Wide Web likes is on a continuous scale. Alright, now

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.220
we're looking at a reasonable plot. Zooming in, it looks like males

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.690
typically have more likes on the web. But I can't really make

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770
sense of the tail end of this graph. This is long tail

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.480
data, so let's use a log transformation to see if we can

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
get a better look at what's happening down here. I'm going to

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.940
go back to my code and add a scale x log 10.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.430
Running this code we get a different plot with much more information.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.620
It looks like males have more likes on the web

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.010
at first, but we can see that females overtake males

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.540
at this point in the graph. So this still leaves

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.410
me wondering who really has more likes, men or women?
