00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.450
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: -- and I'm going
to be the commentator for today.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.280
And I call this the nepotism
section because we're going to hear

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.110
from everybody who's ever held
Nathaniel's job before him.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.670
You're in for a treat today.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.530
But seriously, we're going to hear
from two wonderful astrobiologists.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.280
And the first is David Grinspoon
who is the Senior Scientist

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.470
at the Planetary Science
Institute and a tremendous writer.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.860
A lot of you would've been familiar
with his book, "Lonely Planets,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.560
The Natural Philosophy
of Alien Life",

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.390
which won the PEN Award
for Research Nonfiction.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.860 position:56%
And he's also-- he has a new book
coming out in December called "Earth

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.430
in Human Hands" and be
sure you all buy that,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.790
put that on your Amazon wish list.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.230
I'm really excited to hear
David speak because I remember

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.900
as a young boy, reading Cosmo--

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.880
"Cosmos" by Carl Sagan,
the illustrated version.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.450
And the one thing that always stuck
in my head were those pictures

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.990
of different forms of life that
could be found in the universe,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.980
the hypothetical forms of life.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.200
So, I think astrobiologist
have always been confronted

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.730
with that question, what is
life, when they begin to think

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.260
about what life could possibly be
like outside of our own planet.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.480
And for most of us, I think,
we would answer that question

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.540
by saying what the
judge once famously said

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.700
about pornography that, "I
don't know how to define it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.350
but I know it when I see it."

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.990
But I think an astrobiologist
would say that they would--

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.580
we might actually not be
able to use that definition.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.600 position:56%
We might not know it when we see it.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.150
It could be so different
that it makes the depictions

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.370
of hypothetical life that
Sagan once put forward,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.440
look rather mundane
and quite like our own.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.890
And I think David is going
to talk about some scenarios

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.410
in which life could
exist in ways that, well,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.980
we might not have even defined
it as life in ages past.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.760
So, now I hand it over.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: All right, thank
you very much Bill and thank you all

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.060
for making it back from lunch.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.110
I'll try to keep you
awake while you digest.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.410
And I just want to start
by saying it's a thrill

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.030 position:56%
to be back here at the Kluge Center.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.180
What a wonderful palace of
scholarly wonder this is

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.260
and my experience here was great.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.700
I'd like to think that it's
not just nepotism but heritage

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.630
that is responsible for the
inclusion of the past chairs.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.070
And who knows, in 20 years,
it might be pretty crowded

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.510
if there's a tradition here
of inviting them all back.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:42.620
I'm here I think to represent
the astro part of astrobiology.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.420
We've heard a lot of
bio and a lot of chem,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.660 position:56%
and I'm actually not someone the
traditional picture of an astronomer

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.000
that goes to a lonely called
mountain top and looks

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.270
through telescopes to try to figure
what's happening on distant orbs.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.350
But I do what I do as I work
with teams that build spacecraft

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.750
and send them to other
planets and try to figure

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.160
out what the environments and the
histories of those planets are,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.400
with the focus on the
question of habitability,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.950
where might there be good places
for life elsewhere in the universe.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.300
Which begs a lot of questions,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.770
some of the questions we've been
grappling with so far today,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.600
such as, as was mentioned in
that wonderful introduction,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.020
what do we mean when we say life?

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.440
We maybe will know it when we
see it but is that good enough.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.940
Now, as an astrobiologist,
of course,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.640
what I really want is what
Spock has here, a tricorder,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.640
so I could just point it at a
planet or a potential life form

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.110
and say, "It's alive, Jim.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.750
Or, it's dead, Jim.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.060 position:56%
I'm not getting life form readings."

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.360
Is this thing working?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.140
But we don't have one of those
yet and it's hard to even imagine

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.660
that we will have one of those
someday but maybe that's just

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.750
because our science of
astrobiology is in its infancy.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.360
We are in the pre-discovery,
the pre-contact phase.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.710
Maybe we'll always be in that phase
but obviously if we're ever not,

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.750
then our science will
be very different,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.840
the way we approach
questions like this.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.580
But as it is now, we
have a real paradox

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.880
with regard to this question.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.080
I'm not going to go into detail
on what is life because I think,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.670
actually, Steve-- Steven Dick
who follows me is going to talk

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.040
about this a little bit
more but I do want to point

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.920
out because it's relevant
to what I'm going to talk

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.640
about for a few minutes now
that which reminds me I need

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.230
to start my little timer here
because there isn't one otherwise.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.530
Excellent.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.050 position:56%
I want to point out that the paradox
at the heart of this question

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.690
for scientists and scholars
and just conscious beings

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.850 position:56%
in this pre-contact, pre-discovery
phase, which is that we're searching

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.390
for something that we
can't really define.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.840
How do we define something when
we only have one example of it?

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.060 position:56%
That's not really a very
scientifically credible thing to do.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.480
If you're going to put
something in a classification

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.490 position:56%
and say what its properties are then
hopefully you have multiple examples

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.790
of it.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.090
Well, maybe we will someday.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.000
But as of now, we're searching
for it and when we find it,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.740
we'll be able to define
it much better.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.870
But that's kind of weird,
searching for something

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.180
that you can't say what
it is until you find it.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.960
So there is a little bit of a
paradox here and we grasp at things

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.530
like we'll know it when we see it.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.030
But we're not completely stuck.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.850
There are useful things we can do.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.600
For example, we can
talk about searching

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.140
for habitable conditions elsewhere.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.950
We can't say exactly in an ironclad
way perhaps exactly what life is,

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.890
but we can give our
sense of what it needs.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.010
It seems like needing an energy
source is pretty safe, What--

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.080
however you define life, it's going
to have to eat or consume something

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.920
because if it's not doing
that, if it's not using energy

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.090
and metabolizing then, you know,
what good is it as a life form.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.390
I don't know.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.690
I think that's pretty
safe that it needs energy.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.370
And then you get more
towards life as we know it.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.010
It probably needs some liquid
medium, maybe it needs water, OK,

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.520
we're narrowing our
range of assumptions

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.830
but it still gives
us something concrete

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.180
and reasonable to search for.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.710
So, the conditions of life is
something we can try to define

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.130
and search for even if we
don't quite know what it is.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.440
We can also look for what
Spock would call life signs.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.100
But that is life-- again, whatever
it is, it must be something

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.550
that somehow perturbs
its environment.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.620
And there are more specific ideas
about this, not to get way into it,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.840
but the idea of chemical
disequilibrium

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.140
that life is something that messes

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.990
with the chemical balance
of its home planet.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.210
Certainly, Earth, the
one planet we know

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.820
of with life is flagrantly
disturbed by the presence of life

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.910
so that the atmosphere has
a composition that you--

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.410
as far as we could tell, I mean,

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.500
I'd put money on this even
while admittedly we're

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.440
in the pre-contact phase,
we don't know anything.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.440
I'd put money on that we will never
find a planet with an atmosphere

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.440
as weird as Earth's
that doesn't have life.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.780
That's a life sign, an
atmosphere with mixes of chemicals

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.570
that should not be there to
any other reasonable process.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.670
So, we can talk about life signs.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.150
And then-- And this is something
I'm barely going to scurred

00:08:54.150 --> 00:09:00.490
on in this talk but certainly if
there was an alien species looking

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.530
at our planet, they would notice
also something else is happening

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.830
to our planet.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.630
We can search for signs
of intelligent life.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.530
And that's another
thing I put in quotes

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.560
because do we really
know what we're talking

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.970
about when we use those words?

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.220
It's interesting question.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.070
But that's certainly something
I think in this whole spectrum

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.280
of things that we might find
elsewhere that betray the presence

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.800
of organisms we shouldn't
completely ignore.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.780
So, there is another paradox,
couple of paradoxes we encounter

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.050
with this question, and that
is when we go toward scales

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.330
that are very small or very large.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.910
We can come up with
reasonable definitions of life

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.250
but there's a strange
thing about life

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.340
when you go to different scales.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.990
For instance, in this
graphic I've shown here.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.380
This human being, I think we
would all agree, is alive.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.040
It's composed of cells that I
think we would all agree are alive.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.540
They're very similar
to living organisms

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.900 position:56%
that aren't part of large organisms.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.440
Those cells are composed
of molecules.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.240
Most molecules probably
aren't really alive and

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.000
yet this DNA molecule, you might
be able to argue, is alive and

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.390
yet it's composed of atoms
that aren't, I would say.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:30.980
Now, this paradox is often leads us
to the strange case of the viruses,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.020
which a lot of people would say a
virus is not alive even though it

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.370
has a lot of the properties
of a living organism

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:42.400
because it cannot exist without
hijacking a larger living system.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.730
But if you're going to
say that then you would--

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.030
I would submit, I have to
say human being is not alive

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.450
because we cannot exist
without a larger system

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.760
that we completely depend on.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.950
Put a human being naked on the
moon and see how long they survive.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.280
So, there's just some kind
of fun paradox as you get to.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.650
Now, that's at the small scale,
what about at the larger scale?

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.960
We've been talking about the
origin of living organisms

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.550
but there are properties of
living systems that are larger

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.710
than organisms and there
are some ideas about this.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.500
There's living systems
theory and Harold Morowitz

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.020
in the early '80s wrote
some interesting papers

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.250
about what he called
the-- what did he call it?

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.830
Basically the biological
properties of ecosystems that--

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.760
where he submitted that
life might be better defined

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.800
on that level rather than on
the individual organism level.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.380
And this-- then goes all the
way up to what you've heard

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.010
of as the Gaia hypothesis, a much
abused and much maligned idea,

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.840
which I think is also
very profoundly important,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.820
the idea that a planetary biosphere
has some properties similar

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.160
to those of living systems.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.840
So in this graphic, you
see this sort of bug

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.460
where they're obviously
living organisms,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.510
these birds and fish and things.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.740
But then there are these-- for
instance, the dead log is dead

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.110
but the-- some of these other
organisms are completely dependent

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.410
upon it for their life.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:16.490
So in some larger sense,
that decaying log is part

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:21.610
of this living entity,
this biosphere of the bug.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.440
And, of course, you have the
case of the coral reefs where the

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.470
"dead parts" form the
skeletal structure that the

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.870
"living parts" are
completely dependent upon,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.150
and so the whole thing
has a life fit

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.840
in a sense is larger
than the organisms.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.350
And then you take that
to the larger scale,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:45.370
this picture on the lower right,
reefs completely remake landscapes.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:50.020
And so there's the boundary
between living and dead even

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:55.630
on that geographic landscape
scale is not completely clear.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.460
And then you take that all the
way up to the planetary level,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.780
and again, you're left
with this Gaia picture.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.620
And the Gaia hypothesis, by the
way, as I said, it's been maligned

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.480
as the Earth is alive, the Earth
is a living organism in a sort

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.100
of new edgy way, which is nice
and poetic, I kind of like it.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.340
But there's actually a more
scientifically useful way

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.320
of thinking about it which is
that the totality of the "living"

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:24.670
and "nonliving" parts of the
Earth function in a way so as

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:30.750 position:56%
to achieve homeostasis that tend to
emphasize certain negative feedbacks

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:37.450
that keep the whole ball as it
were rolling in a way that keeps it

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.610
in that range of physical
conditions that are conducive

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.870
to the furtherance of life,
just as in your own body,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.580
there's homeostasis going in
with your temperature and the pH

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.360
of your blood and all these things.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.150
And it gives us a slightly
different picture of evolution.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.960
It's actually a modification of
Darwinism because you realize

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.000
that it's not the case where
the environment is just changing

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.750
and life is just adapting to it.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.930
But on a planetary scale,
life changes the environment

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.130
and so therefore it's a feedback
and a dance between the two

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.270
that can lead a planet to a very
different state than it would be

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.640
if it were not, in a certain
sense, taken over by life.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.390
And as my colleague,
Colin Goldblatt put this,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.190
the defining characteristic of
Earth is planetary scale life

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.650
and Earth teaches us
that habitability

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.620
and inhabitants are inseparable.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.600 position:56%
In other words, if you compare Earth
to other planets, which I'm going

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.520 position:56%
to do a little bit more in a minute,
it jumps out at you how the life

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.090
of Earth dominate so many of
its physical characteristic,

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.200
not just the composition of
the atmospheres I mentioned

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.820
but the mineral balance
of the planet that about--

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.860
more than half of the
minerals on Earth exist

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.710
because of living systems,
the composition

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.980
of the ocean, the climate.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:03.290
Even now, some people think the
composition of Earth's interior,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.680
which affects the material
properties and convection

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.690
of the planet more
speculatively and the heat flow

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.220
of the planet are influenced by

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.710
and potentially controlled
to some extent by life.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.500
So Earth is a planet
where habitability

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.700
and inhabitants have
become inseparable.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.980
And we're not really sure
how far that goes back.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.600
But when we compare
Earth to the neighbors,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.600
Venus and Mars, it's
a stark difference.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.520
Now, one other way to think about
life, I just want to mention.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.100
This comes from the field of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.940
and there's something called
a dissipative structure

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.210
that you've all seen because
you've seen "Dust Devils"

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.900
and at least films of tornados,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.310
hopefully you've not
seen one really up close.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.150
But you've also seen whirlpools
and vortices and not just on Earth.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:59.340
On the upper right here, this
is on Venus, this polar vortex.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.700
And a dissipate structure is a
structure that arises spontaneously

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.020
when you have the right kind
of flow of matter and energy

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.520
and matter organizes itself in
a way to facilitate that flow.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.170
It's sort of spontaneous
order that arises from flow.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.550
And you look at this
standing waves and this stream

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.880
on the bottom graphic here
and you can, if you want,

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.610
relate that to yourself
and think what am I?

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:34.180
Am I the atoms and molecules
that right now are part of me

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.110
but they're not going to
be part of me in the future

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.200
and they weren't always part
of me and yet I'm still me.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:46.500
So, there's a sense in which that a
standing wave, which is a structure

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.880
that persists even as the
matter flows through it,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.880
is an interesting model
for what a life form is.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.320
And if you think of life as that,
as something that arises from flows

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.790
of matter and energy,
structures that evolve from that,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.160
then again you can think of
the Earth and its biosphere

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.310
as the most complex dissipative
structure that we know.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:18.320
And another example
of such a structure

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.880 position:56%
that you're familiar with is a fire.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.800 position:56%
And this also has another--
captures another quality that I want

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.490
to mention because I think
it might be important

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.510
in how we think about
life on planets.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.870
And that is-- think about when you
build a campfire and you're trying

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.470 position:56%
to get it started, and at first it's
just sparks and it's really hard

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.530
to get it going, and
you have to keep--

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.630
stay there and keep
blowing on it and it does--

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.710
you know, you got sparks
and you've got your fuel

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.770
but it's quite disorganized
and it's really-- it's a pain.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.440
But then you get it to a
point where it's going enough

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.680
and the coals are hot and it's
creating its own convection pattern

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.440
by sucking in air and the hot air
rising and then it's fueling itself

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.760
by pulling in oxygen and then
it becomes self-sustaining,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.330
and it's a self-sustaining
dissipative structure

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.260
which is pulling in its own
fuel and taking advantage

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.960
of the cyclic motion of
nutrients through itself.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.800
And it's possible that that's
what a global biosphere is.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.290
And that I want to make the
distinction between the origin

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.240
of life that we've been discussing
which is, it seems to be discussed

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.440 position:56%
as a local phenomenon, something
that happens one place or one region

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.460
but doesn't simultaneously
happen all around the planet.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:38.330 position:56%
And the origin of a global biosphere
that is a self-sustaining part

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.500
of the way a planet is operating,
which is clearly what we have here.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.240
And when we look around
at other planets,

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.980
which is what I spend
my time doing and think

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.070 position:56%
of the properties we're looking for,
we're really looking for the latter.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.280
I think we're looking-- it's going
to be easier to find biospheres

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.810
or evidence of biospheres than
organisms or evidence probably

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.980
of organisms, although that
obviously depends on the case.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.440 position:56%
And it may be that life goes through
a stage initially where the origin

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.800
of life, that's like those
sparks that may fizzle

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.470
and die unless they're fed by
the right kind of cyclic flows.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.360
But life can get to a point in
its existence on the planet that's

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.340
like that self-sustaining fire.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.470 position:56%
And I'm interested in that potential
difference between the origin

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:27.720
of life, meaning there's some
physical system that is behaving

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.560
like an organism in the ways we've
been discussing and the origin

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.200
of a global biosphere that might be
a property that a planet takes on.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.550
In other words, in a sense,
maybe life is not just something

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.090
that happens on a planet but
something that happens to a planet

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.160
or something that a planet becomes.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:49.370
So, this leads me to the musical
question, can a planet be alive?

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.250
And it's something I've
thought about a lot especially

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.920
with reference to comparative
planetology

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.750
which is really my day job.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:05.000
And there's a growing field
among those who do study planets,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.640
where what we really are interested
in is comparing the life stories

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.490
and environments of planets
to try to understand them,

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:17.140
not just as points in
time but as pathways,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.990
as stories that collectively
illustrate properties

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.610
about what can happen to planets.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.790
And one thing that can
happen to planets clearly

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.230
because it has here
is becoming alive.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:34.870
So, how does this question of
whether a planet can be alive?

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.290
How is that illustrated or
what light can we shed on that

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.390
by looking around at the neighbors?

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.030
Well, we look at Mars
and never really--

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.730
ever since 1971, we've known
that Mars is a place that seems

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.860
to have been much more Earth-like.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.300
I say '71 because that's when
Mariner 9, the first orbiter got

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.980
to Mars and really started and we
saw that it was the older parts

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.590
of Mars are covered
by dried up riverbeds.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:05.850
And as we've explored Mars in depth
since then, we've learned much more

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.700 position:56%
that indicates that Mars, when it
was young, was much more Earth-like.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.230
And now, we're-- we have this
wonderful rover curiosity that's

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.990 position:56%
slowly crawling across this lakebed,
it turns out it is a lakebed

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.390
as we thought from orbit of Gale
crater and starting to climb

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.800
up this mountain, Mount Sharp
and finding copious evidence

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.240
of a more watery, more wet,
more benign in terms of climate,

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.970
more Earth-like path than--
and just one bit of evidence.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.000
You can see in this image
here, this rounded cobble,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.210
these are river rocks,
where you couldn't tell.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.680
But when you look at them up close
and you compare them to rocks

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.820
on Earth, these are rock-- this
is a place where water has flown.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.020
And I won't go into
more detail about Mars.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.950
Obviously, one can talk a
lot about this but, you know,

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.420
the punch line is that
Mars, when it was younger,

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.490
was a more Earth-like place.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:04.320
And precisely those qualities
that we think would be conducive

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.130
to an origin of life as we
are, you know, imperfectly

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.980
but increasingly seem to understand
the requirements for that.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.680
And there are some
problems with Mars.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.950
The climate models don't quite work
to make it warm when it was young

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.360
but the geology tells
us it was watery

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.880
so there's still something
we're missing about Mars

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.160
but things are pointing
in that direction.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.250
Now, when we go to the other
neighbor, Venus, as you know now,

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.770
Venus is hell on the surface.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.320
It's far too hot for
our kind of life.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.930
There's almost no water.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.860
It's not a place you
would want to live today.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:44.630
But in the past, our understanding
of Venus is more clouded, you know,

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.770
literally and metaphorically
than our understanding of Mars.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.720
But what we have learned
so far points us to Venus,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.420
being in the past, also a
much more Earth-like place.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.420
And we have some designs for new
missions which we're hoping to fly

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.960
in the near future,
which are really designed

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.740
to take the measurements
that'll help us pin

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.760
down whether that's
really true about Venus.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.510
But as far as we can tell, if
I had to draw you a picture

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.600
of the earliest environment
of Venus or not quite--

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.710 position:56%
the second environment of Venus
after it was a fiery pit of impacts,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.010
as all the planet started out.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.930
But then once that
quieted down, I would say,

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.750
it would be sort of
like this picture.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.150
And you notice this
picture is kind of murky

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.760
because our understanding is murky.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.070
But basically, this is what Venus
and Mars probably both looked

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.800
like around the time we think the
origin of life happened on Earth.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.120
They were water worlds and
they probably had black smokers

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.340
and things like that because the
heat flow was much higher then

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.920
and things point towards
origins that were conducive

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.960
to life on these planets.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:55.280
And this makes me think that
the lesson, the punch line

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.890
of comparative planetology
in our region of space

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.680
and increasingly further a field is

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.010
that rocky planets have similar
origins in early environments,

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:09.640
that is not uncommon for rocky
planets to have wet condition,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.710
not just wet but in places
where there are chemical flows

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.840
and interactions with
geothermal heat

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.860
and they all certainly
had organic molecules

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.160 position:56%
because we're learning more and more

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.480
that organic molecules are
basically everywhere falling

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.750
from the sky and being synthesized.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.930
And so, I would say that from what
we know about the origin of life

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.550
and its requirements, which
as you heard, are, you know,

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.370
still far from perfect knowledge.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.110 position:56%
But from what we know and from what
we know about the early environments

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.850
of these planets, there should've
been life on all three of them.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:51.470
Not only do I say that because it
seems like conditions were right

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.230
on those planets but even if
it was something more rare,

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.530
another thing we've learned is

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.760
that the planets were all
exchanging materials back then.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.310
There were bits getting blasted off
of one and landing on the other.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.560
And microbes being the
hardy beasts that they are,

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.280
life would have been
transported from one to another.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:13.160
So even if origin of life
is rare, you might not need

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.320
to have it indigenous to a planet.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.150
If it happened on one
of the neighbors,

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.960
it could've easily spread.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.080
So, similar origins
on early environments

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.000
and therefore what is rare
is not perhaps the conditions

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.810
for the origin of life but the
persistence of the conditions

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.130
to maintain life over
cosmological time scales.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.780
That is over billions of
years, the ages of planets.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.280
And that leads me back to
this question did the presence

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.620
of a global biosphere on Earth
help with that persistence?

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.050
So, maybe it's not-- we're
not just completely lucky.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:50.660
Maybe life itself had a hand
in keeping Earth habitable.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.000
Now, the very first
environment of all these planets,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.970
as I mentioned, was hellacious.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.790
We know they started off very
violently with a lot of collisions.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.740
And this is the period of time
on Earth we call the Hadean,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.800
which literally means hellish.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.120
That was the first eon of
Earth history lasting up until

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.850
about 4 billion years ago.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.520
And interestingly, I think
we can be pretty certain

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.420
that the Hadean was not a phase
unique to Earth, that Venus

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.540
and Mars had a Hadean around
the same time as Earth.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.500 position:56%
Now, did they also have an Archean ?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.140
That's a really interesting
question.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.470
So, here we have three
young terrestrial planets

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:38.260
and then something happened to
the middle one, to lead it to--

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.530
what we've been hearing about,
there was an origin of life

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.490 position:56%
and I leave the details to the bio
and chemistry parts of astrobiology.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.190
But clearly it happened in one
place and I have question marks

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.340
about whether it happened
in these other places.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.440
If it didn't, then I think we
have to figure out why not.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:59.130
But then, what I wonder is was
there another transition after that

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:04.320
to a global biosphere
on Earth, where the--

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.100
you could've have life
on all three planets

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.080
but it could've only
persisted on the one planet

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.700
where the geophysical conditions
were perhaps more friendly

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.820
for that continued set of
flows of nutrients and energy

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.890
on that stable surface environment
that allowed a global biosphere

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:25.220
to develop and take over and
then maintain its own existence.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.000
Now, you've all seen the
geological time scale

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.620
where we have these different
ages and famously, you know,

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.410
the Jurassic is famous
because it's a movie star.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.390
And after that, there's the
Cretaceous and the Tertiary

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.590
and all these are or now,
it's actually the Paleocene

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.940
and all these different ages.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:50.270
And over on the right side of this
chart are the little, you know,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.970 position:56%
I say little, they've lasts for, you
know, a few millions years, nothing.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.950
These are what we call the epochs.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.440
And the epochs are not major
events in the life of the Earth.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.290
They are important to the biota
who were alive at that time

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.380
because they're often
marked by extinction events,

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.200
climate changes, changes
in sea level.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.470
There fluctuations that
change what can leave, where.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.760
But they don't really
affect the planet that much.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.510
Far over on the left are the eons.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.580
There's only been four eons.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.310
And the eons are interesting
to me as an astrobiologist

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.380
because I'm interested
in the relationship

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.780
between life and a planet.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.940
And each of these eon
boundaries, I would suggest,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.160
is a time when the character of the
planet fundamentally changed and,

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.050
in particular, the
relationship between life

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.900
and the planet fundamentally
changed.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.640
The Hadean, it was dead
because it was just not a place

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.180
where you would want to live
or anything probably could

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:47.090
because it was-- there was
not a stable surface and now,

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:52.750
you were getting-- my colleague,
Kevin Zahnle refers to the Hadean

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:58.580
as an age of fire and brimstone
punctuated with blows to the head.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.290
So that's the Hadean.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.480
But the Archean is
roughly, and geologist

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.990
and geochemist will throw things
at me, you know, because I'm going

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.470
to make some crude statements.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:09.770
But that's basically the trend.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.150
The boundary between the Hadean
and the Archean is the origin

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.230 position:56%
of life more or less 4 billion
years ago some people put it at 3.8.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.870
That's when life-- when
the planet came alive.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.090
Clearly, the other planets had a
Hadean, did they have an Archean?

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.390
That's an interesting question.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.810
Now, I think the Proterozoic,
which is the next eon,

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:32.690
is arguably the time when
life took over the planet.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.340 position:56%
It's when we have the rise of oxygen

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.370
from the cyanobacteria
polluting the atmosphere

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.700
with all this nasty oxygen.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.860
They were the original
bad actors who,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.800
in the search for a
new energy source,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.020
polluted the entire atmosphere and
collapsed the climate in, you know,

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.180
and just for their
own selfish purposes.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.330
Anyway, so I think
the Proterozoic is

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.710
when the life perhaps
took over the planet.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:03.020
The Phanerozoic which
started basically

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:10.140
over 500 million years ago is
the time when life got complex,

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.300
and animals and plants form and
life was not just multicellular

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.290
and all the forms of life, the
macrolife we're familiar with

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:19.720 position:56%
and the fossils we're familiar with.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.220
There was a seemingly
rather abrupt transition

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.790
and that's what we
call the Phanerozoic.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.110
So each of these is sort of a
transition in the relationship

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.410
between life in the planet.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.880
And as an astrobiologist, as I
said, I'm interested in these

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.560
because I can imagine, you know,

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.680
all these little changes
on the right side.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.140
These epochs are unique to Earth.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.780
They're Earth's random evolution.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.480 position:56%
But as you go to this left side this
major transitions, I would submit

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.160
to you that each one
of these is something

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.480
that astrobiologist could look

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.420
for on other planet
that-- OK, OK, I hear you.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.690
That-- sorry, my phone is
telling me to hurry up.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.010
That-- It's probably good advice.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.990
That other planets
definitely had a Hadean.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.080
If they had an origin of life,
we could say they had an Archean.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.080
If life took over as it did on
Earth, that might be analogous

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.320
to our Proterozoic and if
life became complex then

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.680
that could be the Phanerozoic.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.720
So these are all things
that astrobiologist talk

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.020
about looking for on other planets.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.530
And so I think these eons
map into possibilities

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.390
for other planets whereas
the smaller boundaries,

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.250
the epochs stuff are clearly
just part of the Earth's story.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:29.310
So, I want to just
mention one last transition

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.570
which is something is happening
to Earth now that's new

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.870
if you had been watching Earth

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:38.080
over the eons or/and you're a
patient alien watching Earth

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.380
from space.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.220
You would notice suddenly things
had change that Earth lit up

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.860
and the atmosphere composition
and the ocean composition

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:49.450
or the ocean acidity is changing,
the land surfaces are changing,

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.880
these strange linear
clouds are striking

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.780
through the oceans
and across the sky.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.920
There's something up on this
planet that it wasn't up before.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:02.110
And the nature of that transition
is basically what I was studying

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.040
when I was here as the
astrobiology chair a few years ago,

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.170 position:56%
and it's something that people had
been calling the Anthropocene epoch.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:15.080
But I want to submit to you
that maybe it's not an epoch,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:20.000
it might be an epoch boundary but
it might also be an eon boundary,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.400
one of these major changes.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.700
Why would I say that?

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.710
I think it's a fundamental change
in the relationship between life

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:34.220
and the planet because cognitive
processes, making things, tool use,

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.960
are changing the planet
in profound ways.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.490
And life has changed the
planet many times in the past

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.340
but cognitive processes being
involved in the functioning

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.150
of the planet, that's
something new and very strange.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:50.400 position:56%
And if it persists, I think arguably
as significant even as the origin

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.060
of life and therefore
could be an eon boundary.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.450
We won't know for hundreds
of millions of years this--

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.630
my idea cannot be disproven
even by the remote,

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.810
remote descendants
from-- of anyone alive now

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.670
so I feel pretty confident
in making it.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:10.720 position:56%
But anyways, so here's dead planets,
here's planets with the origin

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.120
of life, here's planets
where some of them have gone

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.660
through a transition
to a global biosphere

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.840
and just maybe there's a
class of planets out there

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:26.610
where this transition to cognitive
function as a part and technology

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.920
as a part of the way the
planet functions has become

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.330
something long-term.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.600
And there's some fascinating
arguments that I don't have time

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.880
to go into now about whether that's
possible, whether intelligent--

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.980
"intelligence" is something
that always will limit itself

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.870
by giving itself the power to
wipe itself out or could we be

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.210
like the dinosaurs that
had a space program

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.880
and therefore survived
the extinction

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.810
by pushing the asteroid
out of the way.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.950
There are ways in which you
could imagine technology leads

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.360
to longevity.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.280
And that, by the way, I'm not
going to talk about that more now

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.710
but this allows me to make a plug
for the book "Earth in Human Hands"

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.890
which is in fact the project I
was working on when I was here

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.560
as the astrobiology chair and I
just wanted to show it off not just

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.620 position:56%
because I want to make a plug for it
but because my good colleagues here

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.290
at the Kluge Center, I think
they had a sneaking suspicion

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.640
that I wasn't really doing
anything because why did this take

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.600
so long so I want to say, "Aha!

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.450
See." It's a book.

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.970
"Earth in Human Hands", thank you.

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:26.310
It-- by the way, it's being
published this December,

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.820
it's being printed now,
this is an advanced galleon.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.980 position:56%
For those of you in town, I'm having
a lunch party at Busboys and Poets,

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.030
December 7th, please come join us.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:40.230
And getting back and I'm ending
now, but getting back quickly

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:45.690
to this geologic timescale with all
these transitions I talked about,

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.930
I would submit that this
new boundary we're going

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:53.080
through could be an eon boundary
and I propose the name Sapiezoic,

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.940
for what we're entering,
the phase of Earth

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.310
that is characterized by wisdom.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.100
Now, that seems sort of arrogant.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.460
In fact, it was arrogant of the
Neos to name us Homo sapiens

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.770
which means wise ape
because if you look

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.760
at our behavior now
we're not doing so well.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.680
But my point is that the only
way it wound become an eon is

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.390
if we get our acts
together and persist.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:17.670
And so it's an aspirational title.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.300
If we don't get our act
together then it's not going

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.900
to be the Sapiezoic, it is going

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.650
to be just a little
bleep of an Anthropocene.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:30.580
But I think our history, our long
history suggest that we are species

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.530
that when faced with extinction

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:37.880
which we have been before reinvents
itself and uses its innate gifts

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.350
for communication and
creativity and collaboration

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.260
to imagine new futures
and create them.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.740
And so, we certainly have
a rough century ahead of us

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.870
but when I take this
big picture view,

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:56.570
personally I'm not at
all devoid of hope.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.880
And finally coming back with
my last slide to astrobiology,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.400
the potential for Sapiezoic
transitions I think is one

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.970
that we also at least have to
consider on other planets along

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.860
with these other transitions
that I mentioned.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.830
And if that is the
case, then when we--

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.430
there's another way to think about
finding intelligent life out there.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.990
We don't have to assume they're
sending signals to us which I kind

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.060
of a weird assumption like,
why should they, right?

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.490
I mean there's one kind of
alien life you could imagine

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.790
that might want to.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.220
There are all kinds of alien life--

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.230
kinds of alien life
that you could imagine

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.970
that would have no interest
just like you have no interest

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.910
in discussing philosophy with
a frog-- or maybe you do, but.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.750
But what's cool about if
there are planets out there

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.150 position:56%
that where this transition is
happening then we can find them even

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.040 position:56%
if they're not trying to talk to us.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.810
It may be that there are three
types of exoplanets, dead ones,

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.460
living ones and sapien ones.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.510
And I'll stop there, thank you.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:37:00.480
[ Applause ]

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.780
Shall we?

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.080
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: Yeah.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.420
Oh, do you want your
questions now or?

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.720
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: No
I don't want questions.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:11.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: Why don't we do them
both afterwards, right, with the--

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:14.080
That was an amazing talk.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.820
And, you know, he's too
humble to mention this

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.510
but he has a new book
coming out in December.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.910
[ Laughter ]

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.750
"Earth in Human Hands".

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:32.430
Our next speaker is another
astrobiologist and a historian,

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:37.030
and he was the long time
Chief Historian at NASA.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.470
Before that he spend 20 years
at the US Naval Observatory

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:46.810 position:56%
and he probably knows more about the
development of exobiology as a field

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.900
than anybody else out there.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.630
He's going to talk about
that among other things.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.740
One of the things he's going
to speak about is something

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.930
that really caught my eye and
that is the idea of panspermia,

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:05.690
the idea that life on Earth
may have originated elsewhere.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.880
So he's going to become
the second speaker

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.470
after Steve Benner to
mention panspermia.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:16.130
And I think 30 years ago if you
were at a conference of the origin

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.360
of life and two people
had brought up panspermia,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.880
the next speaker would
have been in a sailor suit

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.460
and trying to sell you Dianetics.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.580
But now it has become-- once
again become a mainstream thing.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.220
And I'm not advocating
it or arguing against it

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.470
but I think it's fascinating
because it illustrates

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:41.760
that science doesn't really travel
in that straight diagonal line

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.320
that I think most of us imagine
when we think about science,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.840
this idea that we're going from
ignorance into illumination

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.230
and it's just this easy clear path.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:56.730 position:56%
I think sometimes science zigzags
and panspermia is one of those ideas

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:02.050
that a century ago or in the late
19th century it would have been a

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:06.410
widely accepted idea and it was
two of the proponents or two

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.680
of the most important
scientist at the time,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.820
Lord Kelvin and Svante Arrhenius.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:20.720
And it was so widespread because
the scientist had a hard time

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.230 position:56%
reconciling Darwinian evolution with
what they thought at that time was

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.250
in Earth that was only a
hundred million or even tens

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.320
of millions of years old.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.850
So panspermia fell into ill
repute but it's not come back

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:39.240
and I'm interested into
hearing more about that.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.510
So, here's Steven Dick.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:47.800
[ Applause ]

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.100
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Well
thanks a lot Bill.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.960 position:56%
And as with David and Nathaniel of
course I have to say how great it is

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:58.040
to be back at the Kluge Center
here at the Library of Congress

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.350
where I spend a fabulous
year a couple of years ago,

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:05.360
a very enjoyable year, so thanks
Nathaniel for having me back.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.720
And also thanks to Jim
Green and Mary Voytek

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.050
over at NASA Headquarters who
fund this great Blumberg Chair

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:17.380
in astrobiology which has
the purpose of looking

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.870
at the humanistic aspects of
astrobiology and I was very pleased

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:24.170
to see the latest astrobiology
strategy document that they

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:28.280
on appendix beyond the
natural sciences about the role

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:35.570
of the humanism-- or
humanities and social sciences.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:40.470
So, that subject is coming
into its own in astrobiology.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.820
I think it's really an
important role for the humanities

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:49.110
and social sciences to examine
the impacts of astrobiology just

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:53.080
that it's been for the Human
Genome Project these days.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.520
I think it's all part of the
larger need to relate science

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:03.310 position:56%
to society and-- which I think
especially we need to do these days.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:09.540
Well, when I proposed this title
for my talk, Nathaniel said,

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.170
"You can't do that in 20 minutes."

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.760
And he's right of course.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.900
If I were going to do this

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.710
in an hour long lecture I
would do something like this.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:24.860
With more time I would sort
of systematically layout some

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.970
of the metaphysical and ontological
and epistemological issues,

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:36.020
in the origin of life studies I
would clarify its central concepts

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.480
such as the meaning what is life
as we've been hearing about.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.290
I would talk about some of
the methodological issues

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:48.060
and how they limit our approaches
to the problem in the same way

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.680
that Martin Harwood has
recently written a book about--

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.360
arguing that what we know about
the universe really is shaped

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.310
by the tools that we
have for astronomy

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.390
and I think the same is true
about origins of life studies.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.420 position:56%
And I would examine the societal
impact, but I'm not going to be able

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:09.490
to do all that so let me focus on
just two or three of three briefly.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.380
Issues that really pop out of
me when I wrote the history

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.410 position:56%
of the extraterrestrial life debate
in my book "The Biological Universe"

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.610
and I think they're just as
relevant now as they were then

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:21.740
because these are general
philosophical issues.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.490
It's always been interest in me--
to me also I want to say that one

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:29.350
of the earliest goals of the
space program was exobiology

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.830
as it was called in those
days and the search for life

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:35.650
in the universe thanks to
pioneers like Joshua Lederberg

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:39.690
and Jerry Soffen and Carl
Sagan and many, many others.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:44.850
And I think we-- you cold easily
argue that the search for life

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.270
in the universe has
been an important driver

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.550 position:56%
of the space program certainly when
it comes to the exploration of Mars.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:57.120
Some of the ocean worlds that we're
now talking continue to be drivers

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.650
of the entire space program.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:02.080
Everybody, when I was at NASA
you got around giving talks.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.340
Everybody wants to know
about life on other worlds

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.970
so astrobiology really is at the
forefront not only in science

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.690
but also in the public
interest I would say.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.730
So, let me begin with a conceptual
issue that is really at the heart

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:17.250
of everything we've heard today.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.720
If we've going-- if we were
going to search for life on Mars,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.370
we had to have some
idea what to search for.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:27.180
So, the first of the
philosophical issues was raised

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.480
almost immediately.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.370
That is, what is life?

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.060
That's the question that's
been in the background

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.750 position:56%
of all the papers we've heard today.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.960
Many people have tried to answer
that question, and you'll be happy

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.040
to hear that I'm not going to try
to answer that question today.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.410
After all, my background is more
in astronomy than it is biology

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:49.090
but I do want to talk about the
controversy over the question

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.360
because it's similar to some of
the questions we have in astronomy.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.290
And in fact, all of these
historical and philosophical issues

00:43:55.290 --> 00:44:00.710
that you see here are ones that
you find in astronomy also.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:05.260
Someone recently quote that
life is what's leftover

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.420
after you eliminate
everything that's not alive.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.930
Somehow I don't think
that's really very helpful

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:17.040
but the question is an old one,
it's contemplated by biologist

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:23.290
and biochemist physicist like
Schrodinger over several centuries.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:28.400
That history reads like
a mirror of each period

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.720
when the question was
asked as biologist try

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.860
to determine the physical
basis for life

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.280
with the intention turning
successively to protoplasm,

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.570
the protein enzyme, the
virus, the gene and the cell.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:46.310
And by 1937 already the British
biologist Norman Pirie was arguing

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:50.220
that the terms life and
living were really meaningless

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.570
that he transition from
nonliving to living was comparable

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:57.200 position:56%
to the gradual transition from
green to yellow in the spectrum it's

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.030
like seeing a rainbow, you know,
when do you transition from one

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:07.310 position:56%
to the other or like going from
acid to alkaline in chemistry except

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:08.990
that life itself could
not be defined

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.850
in terms of only one variable.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:15.000
Well, today the debate about the
origins of life is at the level

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.320
of the molecular assembly of life.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.880
We often see this NASA
definition of life

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.770 position:56%
as a self-sustaining chemical system
capable of Darwinian evolution.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.440
But I think there's a consensus
that no single definition

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.050
of life is totally satisfactory,
some philosophers and scientist

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.520
like Carol Cleland
and Chris Chyba say

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:39.100
that they've argued repeatedly
beginning with a series of papers

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:43.810
in 2002 that all attempts to define
life were fundamentally misguided

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:48.110
in the absence of a general living,
general theory of living systems

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.900
which of course we don't have.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.600
Other philosopher such as Kelly
Smith call this stance the

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.230
definition of pessimism and
argue that you don't need

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:02.420
to have a universal definition of
life to have a working definition

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.720
for any given circumstance.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.420
In other words, there has to
be a balance between definition

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.280
of pessimism and pragmatism.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.560
And I really tend to
come down on that side

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.000
on Kelly Smith's side
for several reasons.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.170
First of all, because we
really can't help ourselves

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.910
from defining life, can we?

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:24.700
Just as we can't help ourselves
from defining a lot of other things

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.970
like say planet to take a
random example from astronomy.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.570
Secondly, institutions like NASA

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:35.630
of course need an operational
definition of life

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.210
if they're going to search for it.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:41.460
The latest astrobiology strategy
document specifically says the

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.490
definitions of life and
function and evidence all--

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.540
those kinds of things
shape our research

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.020
and therefore we need them even
though we don't need to obsess

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.430
over them and they
need to be elastic.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:56.850
We need to be able to adjust them.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.150
In astronomy, we think

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:05.040
of the controversy surrounding
the question, is Pluto a planet?

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.790 position:56%
You've seen the amazing images
coming from the New Horizons mission

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.470
which David is also
writing a book about.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:17.220
But of course whether or not
Pluto is a planet depends

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.520
on your definition.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:25.510
And the International Astronomical
Union 10 years ago last month

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.360
decided that the answer was no
that Pluto was not a planet based

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.420
on a rather arbitrary set

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.100
of conditions I think
some people would say.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.370
It was a compromise among
the astronomic communities

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:40.070
that define Pluto as a dwarf
planet and then declared

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.750
that a dwarf planet
was not a planet.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.730
Well I voted for the dwarf planet
part but I've always thought

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.240
that dwarf planet should
be a class of planet,

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.120
but it's not by definition.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:56.450
So, the point is though
that it was defined in a way

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:59.970 position:56%
that reflected these different
astronomical communities even though

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:04.640
it disappointed some scientist
like Alan Stern who's the PI

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.680
from the New Horizons
mission, not to mention a lot

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.520
of other school kid
who were disappointed.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.320
It was-- an interesting
cultural phenomenon really.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:17.490
But you'll notice that
arguments over definition

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:19.300 position:56%
of a planet didn't keep New Horizons

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.330
from having a spectacular
mission, right?

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.900
Alan likes to point out that Pluto
doesn't care if it's a planet

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.520
or a dwarf planet so we could
go on and study it anyway.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.200
And the same is true of
the definition of problems

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.880
with things like species.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.570
A common definition of species
is organisms that can interbreed,

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.750
belong to the same species.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.400
Well we now know that Homo sapiens
and Neanderthal interbreed, right?

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.540
So, most of us are
1 to 3% Neanderthal.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:51.830
So instead of throwing out the
concept of species we expand

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:53.570
or adjust the definition.

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.550
And the same isn't true--

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.460
is also true of intelligence
David mentioned intelligence

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.530
which a study people like to
scurred by talking about the search

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.580
for extraterrestrial technology,

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.090
not intelligence then they don't
have to define intelligence.

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:07.670
And I remember right
here at the Library

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.670
of Congress a few years ago
asking the philosopher John Searle

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:14.340
about the concept of intelligence.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.730
He said, "Forget intelligence.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.240
The big question is consciousness."

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.670
And of course nobody knows how to
define consciousness either, right?

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.820
There's no consensus definition.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.550
So, we all settle for
operational definitions that apply

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:28.960
to the specific task at hand.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.670
So, people like Carol Cleland

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:35.020 position:56%
and philosophers I think have a good
point when they say that, you know,

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.600
we can't have a universal
definition of life in the absence

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.080
of living systems theory.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:43.260
I certainly agree with that but we
do need operational definitions.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.620
Now of course those operational
definitions can get you into a lot

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.140
of trouble especially if you
choose the wrong definition

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:53.430
when you go off searching for say
life of Mars and that was the case

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:58.570 position:56%
with the Viking biology experiments,
all of which relied on a definition

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:00.040
of life based on metabolism.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.360
Gil Levin, one of the principal
investigators still believe

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.300
that he fond life on Mars,
claim that's no longer

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:12.320
so much completely dismissed as it
used to be given what we now know

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.140 position:56%
about the surface chemistry of Mars.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.320
For many years that result was
trumped by what's called the GC/MS,

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.280
the Gas Chromatograph Mass
Spectrometer experiment

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.740
because it show that there were
no organic molecules on Mars

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.380
at those two landing sites
where the Viking Landers landed.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.010 position:56%
So, if you have no organic molecules
you can't have life, right?

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:34.010
So that sort of wipes out all
the experiments on metabolism

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.980 position:56%
and in fact a biochemical definition

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.800 position:56%
of life trumped all the other
metabolic experiments until we found

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.620 position:56%
out more about the role of
perchlorates on the surface of Mars.

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:50.760
So the lesson of Viking seems to be
that experiments should be designed

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.910
with multiple definitions
of life in mind.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:56.970
Now the best way to define
life of course would be

00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:01.290
to actually find some on
Mars or your [inaudible] some

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.810
of these other places
and compare it to Earth.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:07.720
In that case if it was
truly a second genesis,

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.150
we might have the beginnings
of a universal biology similar

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:14.050
to a universal physics
that we think we have now.

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:17.270
And that's the second issue I
want to address the aspirations

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:20.490
for universality by
which I mean two things.

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:22.420
Is there a universal biology

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.440
as there is a universal
physics, and is life universal?

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.380
In other words, is it spread
throughout the universe?

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.440
So in this respect I
think there's no doubt

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.330
that the space program
really catalyzed aspirations

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.900
for universality in
both of these ways.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:44.140
Implicitly or explicitly those
at the intersection of exobiology

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.670
and origins of life expressed
interest in the desire

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.050
for a universal biology, one

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.970
that might be a more general
than terrestrial life.

00:51:54.970 --> 00:52:00.070
In the Soviet Union, Oparin
called exobiology and the origins

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:03.100
of life the inseparable connection.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.430
And Stanley Miller
did the same thing.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:10.210
And here we saw the Urey-Miller
experiment this morning.

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:13.400
Some of you may notice that I have
1952 whereas I forget who it was

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.250
who showed it this
morning, had 1953.

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:20.770
I think that's the difference
and this is an interesting thing

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:24.270
about when is the discover made, is
it made when the experiment is done

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:27.130
or is it made when the
publication comes out?

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:30.760 position:56%
Well in this case the experiment was
done in '52 but it's always cited

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.030
as '53 because that's
when the public--

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.560
that's an interesting thing

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.950
in science I've done
a whole book on that.

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:43.670
Anyway, both of these scientists
said that exobiology and origins

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:47.850
of life are the inseparable
connection.

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:52.180
Origins of life studies
quickly became a central focus

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:56.410
of exobiology bringing
into the field scientist

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.270
such as Melvin Calvin.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:04.590
Once interviewed Melvin Calvin in
his office at Berkeley best known

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:09.870
for his Nobel Prize and it
happen to do with photosynthesis.

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:13.340
But Calvin said in his
mind there was no question

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:17.250
about the Darwinian behavior of
molecules and if that were true,

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:21.380
that meant it must be true
in the entire universe.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.800
His student Cyril Ponnamperuma
said basically the same thing.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.600
If we can understand how it
began here we'll know something

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.900
about how it began and if it began
out there and if it's repeated

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.920
in a staggering number
of planetary systems

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:41.470
in our galaxy, or in
our universe even.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.640
Now that was written in 1972

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.420
when there were no other
solar systems known aside

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:48.950
from our own, right?

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.210
Of course now we know
that they're everywhere.

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:53.860
So in short this space program--

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.430
my point is the space program
catalyzed the integration of origin

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:01.730
of life and extraterrestrial life
studies as theories and experiments

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:04.680
that were previously viewed just
in the context of life beginning

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.030
on Earth were increasingly seen

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:11.190
in extraterrestrial context
integrating these two fields

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.140
of study.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:17.120
Now, these conclusions
about universality

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.610
of really hide a deep
metaphysical preconception

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:25.990 position:56%
and that is the question of chance
and necessity in the origin of life.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:29.750
I think it's a real tribute
to the scientist involved

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.290
that they recognize
their preconceptions.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:36.680 position:56%
In fact, the philosophical question
that dominated the problem of origin

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.850
of life beyond Earth was exactly
that, what was the role of chance

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:43.390
and necessity in the
formation of life?

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:47.050
After all that question hinge the
whole enterprise of exobiology,

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:49.300
what we now call astrobiology,

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.940
because if life was just a chance
occurrence and was very rare then,

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:57.150 position:56%
you know, it might never happen
again no matter how big the universe

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.930
was or how much time you had.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:03.360
In my mind the two prototypes
for the debate over chance

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:08.000
and necessity are Jacques
Monod and Christian de Duve

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.740
of here you see Jacques
Monod a French biologist.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:16.340
Monod and de Duve both
are Nobel Prize winners.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.630
Monod was awarded the
Nobel Price in 1965

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.870
for explaining the
genetic regulation

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.760
of protein synthesis in cells.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.340
And he drew on the latest
results on molecular biology

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.420
to illustrate how chance
predominated

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.940
in all aspects of life's
development.

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.860
And he wrote a classic
volume called "Chance

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.310
and Necessity" written in 1971.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:41.740
And he wrote this--
famously wrote this phrase

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.600 position:56%
which you often see quoted, the
universe was not pregnant with life,

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.180
nor the biosphere with man.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.780
Our number just came up
in a Monte Carlo game.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.030
So, he came to that view because
of what he called the revelation

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:57.470
and the disappointment that the
sequences composing the insulin

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:00.200
protein showed no general
law of assembly,

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.450
only the blind workings of chance.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:05.700
Many scientists since
that time have agreed

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:10.820
with him including some astronomers
like Fred Hoyle who famously argued

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.380
that the origin of life by
chance was about as likely

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:20.650
as a 747 aircraft being assembled
spontaneously from a junkyard,

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:22.690
pretty, pretty good image.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:24.900
He thought it was vastly
more probably

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.650
that life had been assembled
by a cosmic intelligence.

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:32.280
But before the religious people
could get to excited he emphasize

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.510
in his opinion it was not a
supernatural intelligence,

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:37.980
but that's another subject.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:41.950
And in his book "Advocating
Panspermia" of Francis Crick tended

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:45.420
to agree that life could not have
risen by chance here on Earth.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:50.440
Well, a quarter century after
that, here's Christian de Duve,

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:55.830
who just died last year, wrote
a book called "Vital Dust,

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:57.670
Life as a Cosmic Imperative".

00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:00.680
And he argued just the opposite

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:06.860
from his Nobel Prize
French colleague Monod.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:11.790
And he's a very well-known
biochemist also best known

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:14.250
for his discoveries related
to the structure and function

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:17.770
of organization of a cell.

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:21.670
And he was most impressed with
the organic molecules then being

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:23.030
discovered in space.

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:26.190
So it's interesting how these
two came through their ideas

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:28.710
about chance and necessity.

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:32.230
It was based on things that were
currently happening sometimes

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.650
on their own research.

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:38.690
So he wrote, as you see here,
done in the organic cloud

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:43.500
and here he's talking about these
organic molecules being discovered

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.830 position:56%
in space which we now know exist all

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:51.650
over in interstellar molecular
clouds that they were everywhere

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:54.070
and the conclusion
seem to him inescapable

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:56.920
that where the conditions are
similar to those that prevail

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.600
on our planet that
there would be life.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.750
And he went so far as to
say that those who claim

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:05.340
that it's highly improbable
just have a look closely enough

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:06.640
at the chemical realities.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.940
So there you have two, you know,

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.270
pretty smart guys both
a Nobel Prize winners

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:14.650
with totally different
points of view on that.

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:23.560
OK. I think it's one of
the hallmarks of exobiology

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:27.250
and now astrobiology that is
practitioners place their faith

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:31.730
in more in necessity than in chance
or at least a high probability

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:33.640
of the origin of life
under proper conditions.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:38.340
It was their most basic
metaphysical presupposition.

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:41.260 position:56%
Otherwise, they wouldn't waste their
time searching for like, right?

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.810
If you don't think it's
very likely you're not going

00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:45.290
to put much time into it.

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:48.650
I happen to agree that this
is a good supposition--

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:52.180
presupposition partly because
as we've heard life seems

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.340
to have risen so quickly
on the Earth.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.650
We've heard this morning
several times

00:58:56.650 --> 00:59:00.120
about the discoveries
just announced last week

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:06.230
about the life 3.7 billion years
old just after the Hadean period

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:10.580
that David was talking about the
heavy bombardment of the Earth,

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.260
those fossil and those were
fossilized stromatolites

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.500
like the ones that we're-- has
Steve passed around this morning

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.970
but these were from 3.7
billion years ago stromatolites

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:24.080
from the issue of rocks
southwest coast of Greenland.

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.220
So that's less than a billion
years after the Earth was formed

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:29.290
and you already had life beginning.

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:33.950
And that seems to be also to argue
for a role for panspermia maybe

00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:37.650
that the spreading of life
throughout the universe

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:39.810 position:56%
or at least giving life a head start

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.570
by spreading complex
organic molecules

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:46.310
which we know are ubiquitous in
these interstellar molecular clouds

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:50.250 position:56%
that so impressed Christian de Duve.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:55.090
Beyond a life's rapid origin on
Earth the idea of necessity seems

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:58.290
to be also to be reinforced by
the fact that the physical law

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:02.430
as we know now that the physical
laws of nature are universal

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:05.510
and that what happened here
opt to ought to happen there.

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:10.430 position:56%
That's certainly is a presupposition
but it's a recognized presupposition

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:11.800
that seems to work pretty well,

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.880
it certainly worked
for the planets, right?

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.970
I could remember prior to 1995,
people saying we don't know

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:22.710
of about any other planets outside
of our solar system and we didn't.

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:26.180
But with this presupposition
a lot of people, you know,

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:29.010
said the laws of physical
laws of nature universal,

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:33.140
what happens here happens there,
lo and behold, there they are.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.210
Not only-- I mean, they're
virtually everywhere even

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:41.750
around as we've heard recently
around red dwarf stars in fact

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:46.700
which is what Proxima Centauri is
the closest star to us as planets.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.800
Now of course they don't have life.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.680
Most of those don't have
life but some of them are

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.250
in their habitable zones
and could have life.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.290 position:56%
That's a metaphysical presupposition
and with the discovery of a stream

01:00:57.290 --> 01:01:01.020
of files that we've heard
about this morning in the form

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.260
of hydrothermal vents
and deep underground,

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:08.560
we know now that proper conditions
are much broader than we thought

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.050
in the past and we
also know that the idea

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:15.120
of a habitable zone
has been expanded.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.290
I mean, who would have thought
that the moons of Jupiter

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:20.170
and Saturn were in
the habitable zone?

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:21.470
Well, they are, right?

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.570
They're way out there,
don't get much solar light

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:26.210
but they have tidal
heating and they--

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.790
which allows them to
have liquidations

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:31.050
which means life could exist.

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:34.980
That's not to say that it will
be like ours, far from it,

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.110
there'll be diversity
just as there is diversity

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:40.090
in the planets that
we're finding now.

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:43.270
They are not, not all like ours
by any means, the gas giants

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:46.540
and orbiting near in their
stars and that sort of thing.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:52.090
So there is a lot-- there will be
a lot of diversity I would predict.

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:56.840
But this idea of universal law
is producing similar outcomes

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.170
with diversity has been
proven over and over again.

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:04.810
It remains a presupposition, it's
true, but I think it's a good one.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:08.980 position:56%
Some presuppositions are better than
others so that's the presupposition,

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:13.370
the metaphysical presupposition
behind astrobiology that's one

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:14.670
of them.

01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:18.680
Well, that gives rise to even
deeper of metaphysical questions,

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.650
why is the universe
Bio-friendly to start with.

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:27.400
Do we just happen to live in
a universe where the contents

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.530
of nature are such that
the galaxies, planets

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.730
and stars and life can form?

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:35.030
We could have life we don't
think unless we had the planets

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.330
and the starts.

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:39.340
But the conditions of the
universe have to be right.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.870
The contents-- physical
contents had to be right

01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:46.530
for those things to happen.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.060
Is life in some way one

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.900
of the fundamental
entities of the universe?

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.890
Here you get into what some people
call the anthropic principle

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:57.490
which I would rather call
the biocentric principle.

01:02:57.490 --> 01:03:01.980
And talking about that, people
ask is there some deep connection

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:06.110
between life and the very
structure of the universe.

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:10.120
The questions like this really
land all the more important I think

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.210
to astrobiology because
it's going to--

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:17.120
astrobiologists are going to
determine just how abundant life is

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.430
in the universe and whether
it is a basic principle

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.970
or whether we are a fluke.

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:26.790
Some argue that the biological
universe may not be the result

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:28.300
but the cause of the
physical universe

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:32.930
which is a pretty strong statement
but maybe life is more fundamental

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.230
than we've ever realized.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:37.650
Here's a quote from
Freeman Dyson who is known

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:39.040
for some ideal ideas that's true

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:44.790 position:56%
but also a very well-known physicist
saying that it almost seemed

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:46.380
as if the universal
knew we were coming

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:51.040
and he predicts a bright prospects
where a future-oriented science

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.110 position:56%
that would look to the future rather
than the past and would admit life

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:57.020
and intelligence on an equal
footing with general relativity

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:02.830
as factors influencing the
evolution of the universe OK.

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:06.020
So we've come quite of a
long way from the origins

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.630
of life we were talking about this
morning but I think this points

01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:12.930
up that origin of life could not
have occurred unless the universe

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:14.260
was Bio-friendly.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:19.120
So this takes you from one end
of the argument to the other.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.180 position:56%
So, I think my time is up but you'll
see that I have after all touch

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:30.140
on quite a few of these just in a
cursory way of these issues except

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:33.620
for the last one and I just want
to say a word or two about that.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.790
In the end we still
don't know whether

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:37.850
or not life is abundant
in the universe.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:43.530
It remains perhaps I would say
the greatest question in science

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:48.030
and in the history of
science but if there is life

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:51.580
out there it's I think it's prudent
that we prepare for that discovery

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.090
which in the long term could change
our world views in the same way

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:57.840
that we were changed
by the Copernican

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:02.280
and the Darwinian systems.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.820 position:56%
And I say that even if the universe
is only full of microbes which a lot

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.220
of people think might be the case.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.920
After all if you look at here
on Earth it took us a long time

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.130
to get microbes to
tillage a life, right?

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:18.830
So, the challenge of
the societal impact

01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:22.250
of astrobiology is a very
large topic and that's

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:26.470 position:56%
where I spent my year at the Library
of Congress studying and if you want

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:30.770
to know more about that, there
is the book that I edited

01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:34.290
on this subject based on
the Bloomberg symposium

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:37.030
that we had two years ago.

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:39.470
This is published by
Cambridge University Press

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:41.180
so you might think it's
out of reach in terms

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.910
of the price but actually it's not.

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:47.110
If you go on to Amazon right now
you can get it for $2 and 98 cents.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.460
So, that's a bargain.

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:54.840
And I think you'll find it
stimulating on a wide variety

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.670
of issues not just
argues life but a lot

01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:59.130
of these other societal
issues beyond.

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:02.240
It's one of the great things about
astrobiology that you can talk

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.840
about not just the chemistry and
the physics and the astronomy

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.730
but also the humanities, the
social sciences, theology all kinds

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:10.950
of things when you talk
about societal impact.

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:14.490
So thank you, I'll
think I'll stop there.

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:21.240
[ Applause ]

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.880
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: After you, oh.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.330
Do you guys want to sit?

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.090
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Yeah I guess.

01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:30.480
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: And we'll
move quickly in the questions

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.480
because you've heard
two wonderful talks

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.680
and I'm sure we're
going to have a lot.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.730
Anybody? Right there.

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.320
I think he is bringing
you a microphone.

01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:53.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My question is for Dr. Grinspoon.

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:58.450
And I was really intrigued
by your concept

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:05.880
of the cognitive intelligence for
not only Earth but the Galaxy?

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.540
And would you please
develop that a little more?

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:16.070
Does this mean that we create
life, true until action?

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:19.130
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Not necessarily
although it's interesting.

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:23.210
One twist of this transition

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:28.020
if there is a transition
towards cognitive life being part

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.480
of the planet which I would
I argue there could be.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.480
One interesting twist on that,
that I didn't have a chance

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.460
to mention is some of the
work we've been hearing

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:41.670
about here gives us the potential
to also become the engineers

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:46.980
of evolution and that's another
way in which a Sapiezoic eon

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:50.090
on a planet could be defined

01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:55.740
because you could argue the
natural selection is no longer,

01:07:55.740 --> 01:08:01.480 position:56%
is no longer full stop that even
the Darwinian evolution that's going

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.780
on in the planet now is

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.740
in an environment a global
environment that's perturbed

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:13.280
by the cognitive for better
or worst the technological

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.000
and industrial activities
of humanity.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.030
Now, that's always
true that evolution

01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:20.600
of species have affected the
evolution of other specie

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.920
but I would maintain there's
a fundamentally different kind

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.220
of process going on.

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:27.250
So what I was talking about
specifically was just looking

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:30.810
at the mechanisms of change on
the planet and what I was doing

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:33.330
when I was here as the
chair was trying to work

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:36.750 position:56%
from a planetological point of view
at this transition that is happening

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.980
to Earth now and try to define

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.710
that in a way that's not just
human beings are doing this

01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:44.980
but is there a more abstract
way that we could possibly map

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.660
into planetary history that might
obtain on other planets as well

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.810
and that's where I focus on this.

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.910
You know, you could
argue that cognitive,

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:55.650
that nervous systems are
something that will evolve

01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:58.340
on other planets if life evolves.

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.760
I won't go into now but there
is a good argument for that

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.160
and therefore even though
intelligence is hard

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.090
to define you could
argue that something

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.320 position:56%
like human-type intelligence in some

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.950
of this aliens aspects would
evolve elsewhere and technology

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:15.650
and therefore if it got to the
point where it was affecting its--

01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:18.500
the evolution of its planet
which I think it has here then

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.140
that might be a Sapiezoic
elsewhere and a sort

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.870
of not human centered
but more abstract sense.

01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:32.800
&gt;&gt; This is for Steve.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.280
I'm not an atrobiologist
so-- I'm a historian.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.920
And I want to raise two questions.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.630
Is there a slight possibility

01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:47.810
that we approach this
question from death?

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:56.650
In other words, we'll take death
as an opposite of life and see

01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:59.230 position:56%
that opens up, it'd be a discussion.

01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:00.530
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: That opens up what?

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:02.640
&gt;&gt; It'd be a discussion.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:09.460
If we approach life
from death, seen death,

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:16.050
maybe as an opposition understand
to which that response some

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:21.560
of this notions, I'm just trying
it I don't have any answer.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.570
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: That sounds like
the idea of the absence of life--

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:27.870
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Yeah.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:29.170
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: --
being as describe life.

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:30.470
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Yeah.

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:33.730
&gt;&gt; So with-- in terms of
that definition of life,

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:40.880
I don't think it's an exclusive
terrain of astrobiologist.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:48.130 position:56%
I think it's a fundamental question
that we'll have to face even outside

01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:56.950 position:56%
of the academy in which mythologies,
religion, spirituality, act--

01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:00.140
going to create their own
contestations in which--

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.350
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: So how is that a
challenge for astrobiology the fact

01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:12.320
that you are sharing a landscape
that is a metaphysical landscape,

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.260
not astrobiology but origin
of life and, you know,

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.980
in talking about what
is life I mean.

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.400
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Well, I
think it goes to the question

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.700
of our place in the universe.

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:25.350
The question about the death,

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:28.300
my view on that would be I
don't see how it helps that much

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.680
because if death is
the absence of life

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.370
and you don't know what
life is I don't see how it--

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:35.970
how that helps, unless
you're talking about it

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.660
in a more metaphysical
sort of a way.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.500
But in general, and not
in a scientific way,

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.890
but in general I would
say that you're talking

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:49.070
about an even broader definition
of life as the life that we live,

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:54.600
right, not the life that's
originated, the origins of life.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.560
So I think astrobiology
helps us in terms of figuring

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.950
out what our places in the universe

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:01.380
because it's a very
different universe.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:08.780
If we are the only life on this,
you know, in our solar system

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.480
and even in the entire universe.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.790 position:56%
We know that in our own solar system
that there's, you know, we're--

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:19.900
I would say almost certainly
the only intelligent life.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:24.320
But if we-- the only life and in
the galaxy of it is extremely rare.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.950
I guess it's a different sort
of view on life in general as,

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:32.780
you know, as you said as
sort of more metaphysical,

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:38.550
spiritual phenomenon
then if life is common.

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.430
We'll have to, you know, if life--

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:44.190 position:56%
intelligent life out there is
common we have to share the universe

01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:48.320 position:56%
with that intelligence and learn
how to interact with it whereas is--

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.530
if we are the only intelligent
in the universe then, you know,

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:59.880 position:56%
the universe is-- I wouldn't say--
I wouldn't want to put in a way of--

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.100 position:56%
we should exploit the universe then.

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.730
But the universe is, you
know, very different place

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:09.820
and I think it puts more emphasis
on our stewardship of this planet

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:14.150
and any other planets that we go
to and all the ethical questions

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:18.160
that arise if we're the only life.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.450
Either way it's a very
sobering thought.

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:23.780
There'll be lots of ethical
questions too if there's lots

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:26.610
of intelligence out there or even
if there are microbes out there.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:31.150
All kinds of ethical questions
about, you know, what do you--

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:34.300
how do you treat an alien microbe,

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.770
questions about forward
contamination

01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:38.070
and back contamination.

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:42.590
Of course NASA has robust
programs to deal with that

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:46.500
in a very short-term but they
have nothing to do with it

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.270
in the longer term about
what you do about even

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:51.590 position:56%
about microbes if you discover them.

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:52.890
Yup.

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:54.190
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: And David.

01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:55.490
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Yeah.

01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:58.930
Just quickly I would add that
there might actually be a pragmatic

01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:02.660
interpretation of your
question for astrobiology.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:06.820
I've actually thought about does it
make sense to think of the search

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.530
for death in the universe.

01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:10.880
We talk about a search for life
in the universe and it might--

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.510
in one way which is of
course you can have life

01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:17.410
without death I take
in our understanding.

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:22.140
And if you look at the chances
of life existing or having exist

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.750
in other worlds in the universe and
you do the math, there are a lot

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.800
of solutions that suggest there
are probably a lot more planets

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.540
where there was life
once than there are--

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.860
than planet where there
is life right now.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:38.420 position:56%
So if we thought about how do to
identify planets where life had died

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:42.530
out and not just where it exist
now, that would be maybe one way

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:44.840
to interpret a search
for death in the universe

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.870
and it might actually be
something that gives us a lot more,

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:50.390
a lot more to search for.

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:51.980
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: It might be more
difficult than a simple life.

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:53.280
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: Ladies first.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.580
I'll get you next.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.030
OK.

01:14:56.030 --> 01:15:02.000
&gt;&gt; Wasn't the [inaudible]
into the question of existence

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.820
of consciousness without body
molecules and is that life?

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.980
And where is that connection?

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:16.210
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: You mean his
idea of planetary intelligence?

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.360
&gt;&gt; I'm talking about consciousness.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:27.060
As we know it, it exist within our
lives, our molecule structure but--

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.890
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon:
That's a tough one.

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:31.850
As Steve mention I think you
were quoting John Searle?

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:33.150
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Yah, so.

01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:34.890
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: You
know, forget intelligence,

01:15:34.890 --> 01:15:36.340 position:56%
so he wants to go for consciousness.

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:38.720
I mean, the fact is we
don't know what it is.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.250
We sense, we experience it, we have
some ideas that we might be able

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:44.910
to induce it in computers.

01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:49.760
And so, is it something we
can talk about searching for?

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.060
I mean, I scurred that one.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.660
I said intelligence
I put it in quotes

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.140
because these are problematical
terms

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:58.040
if you really want to get into it.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.700
Is it something that could exist
beyond a physical body, I mean,

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.060
as Bones might say on
Star Trek, you know,

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:10.630
"I'm a doctor damn it not a
philosopher or a theologian."

01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:12.770
I haven't the foggiest.

01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:15.320
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Or Fred
Hoyle's Black Cloud

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.700
which was probably conscious.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.000
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Right, right.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.300
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: It can communicate.

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.600
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Yeah.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.900
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:25.240
&gt;&gt; -- planets without
bodies, or lives,

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.080
or molecules as we know
them, just consciousness.

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.700
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Well, that's
thinking out of the box.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.750
&gt;&gt; And would that be life?

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:37.360
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: And right here.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:44.700
I want to ask David about the large
synoptic telescope and whether

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.540 position:56%
or not we could imagine elsewhere in
the galaxy a more advanced version

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.680
of this telescope and whether

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.630
or not they could detect
life in this solar system.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:58.750
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Absolutely.

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:01.890
Some-- you know, we're
just at the beginning

01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:04.870
of the exoplanet revolution
where we can know something

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:08.140
about the planets in
other solar systems.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:12.140 position:56%
And just the fact that we know there
are planets on other solar systems,

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:16.530
that alone is a revolutionary bid
of information that we didn't have,

01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:19.940
you know, and I think
anybody in this room was born.

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:21.440
It's brand new.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.180
Now we're at the stage where
we're starting to learn something

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.460
about those planets, but
we're in early stage of that

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.680
and we can imagine
massive space telescopes

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.890
with massive occultation structures
that allow us to, you know,

01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:38.480
and do direct imaging of
other planets and, yeah.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:42.670
I think there are quite
possibly civilizations out there

01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:47.070 position:56%
that have telescopes that can see
things like the lights on our planet

01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:48.480
at night and can--

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.050
with spectrometers notice that
there are changes happening

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:53.350
in our atmosphere.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:59.980
I wouldn't put it pass them.

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.280
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: Right there.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.630
&gt;&gt; Today we discussed the
chemistry of life, biology of life

01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:08.340
and they want to comment
on astrophysics of life.

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:12.890
So we leave next to an
active star called the Sun.

01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:18.610
And the Sun, yup, it causes the
profound effects on our planet.

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:23.380 position:56%
And if we want to find life we want
to find life through the interaction

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:26.810
of solar effects or solar
winds, solar flares,

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:31.830 position:56%
coronal mass ejections [inaudible]
was the atmosphere was the chemicals

01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:34.360
produced by life in the atmosphere.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:40.480 position:56%
So-- and instead of probably looking
for life itself which is represented

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.250
by pretty complex molecules, we
want to look for the signatures

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:47.910
of prolife, or probiotic chemistry
that we talked about without

01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:49.740
which life is impossible.

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:54.430
So might be it's our best bet to go
after the strongest signal possible

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:58.630
to go-- to look for the-- to
use our telescopes intelligently

01:18:58.630 --> 01:19:03.620 position:56%
to find those environments that have
a pretty strong signal was a nearby

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:08.220
host stars that interact with those
atmospheres that pregnant was life

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.170
and basically to go after
pregnancy relative for life.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.140
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Yeah.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.440
That's a burgeoning
field in astrobiology.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.180 position:56%
It's the next big thing I would say
what they call biosignatures looking

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:24.040
for, you know, James Webb Space
Telescope, the successor or sort

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:29.560
of the successor to Hubble will
be able to look at the atmospheres

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.980
of planets and see if they
have oxygen or methane or some

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.560
of these other things that
might be indication of life.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.920
But you're right also in the sense
that astrobiology differs from--

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.620
exobiology when it was founded was
almost entirely origins of life.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.710
Astrobiology deals not
just with origins of life

01:19:46.710 --> 01:19:52.110 position:56%
but with the entire system, the
entire environment, the Sun and the,

01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:55.830
you know, and the planets and
how they interact and what's

01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:58.140
in equilibrium and
what's in disequilibrium

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:02.410
and then this whole idea of
biosignatures stems from that too.

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:06.160
So that's-- you're going to hear
lot more about that in the future.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.410
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: We have time
for just one more question.

01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:12.710
Yeah?

01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:14.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:17.450
So you could sort of-- in
the discussions you're having

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:22.590
about detecting life elsewhere you
could substitute life with life

01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:25.590
as we know it, you know, base
on carbon with DNA, you know,

01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:29.060
we're going to go look a planet
that would have the signatures

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:31.460
of the kind of life that we are.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:35.850
And I'm just wondering
how you-- is that--

01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:39.410
do you think that that's a good
idea because you really doubt

01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:41.420
that there could be
weird alternatives based

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.130
on other chemical systems?

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:45.660
And the people talked about
silicon and other things

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.970
or are you comfortable with
that because what-- how--

01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:51.540
we don't even know how to look
for those other forms of life

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:54.560
or do you think we
should broaden our search

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.590
for more general principles
of life than just saying,

01:20:57.590 --> 01:21:00.520
oh look there's some oxygen
that's some carbon-based life form

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.820
gave off.

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.150
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: I want
to choose all of the above.

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:08.170
We can make the statement that--

01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:13.700
we can make the statement
that no one can really imagine

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:20.280
that we can't imagine a life
form say that it's not based

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.860 position:56%
on chemistry, and you might say
more specifically we can imagine one

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:30.920
that's not-- it doesn't function
in water and use carbon molecules.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:35.580
And I think that's-- I mean we
can fantasize about it but as far

01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.870
as really defining it
what it might be like,

01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:40.530
I think that's a true
statement, but is that a statement

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.270
about the limitations of our
own intellect and imagination

01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:46.050
or it is a statement
about nature's ability

01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:48.800
to invent given the materials
at hand and environments

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.720
that we haven't investigated?

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:55.820
So I would-- I support
the current approach,

01:21:55.820 --> 01:22:02.740 position:56%
which is sort of terrestrial centric
and that we are looking for water

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:06.520
and we're looking for
carbon-based life.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.860
And I support it kind of because
it's what we know how to look for

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.860
and it's pragmatic and kind

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:17.500
of because I'm not convinced
there is other life that's really

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:18.800
very different.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.860
But we have to always
remember our ignorance

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.480
and keep our blinders wide open.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.910
And that's why I also favor
this approach of just looking

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:30.080
for atmospheric dysequilibrium
or looking for anomalous,

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:35.240
just aspects of planets that seem
out of joint, don't seem to be--

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:40.150
you know, consistent with
"natural" or "abiotic processes"

01:22:40.150 --> 01:22:42.040
and prepare ourselves
to be surprised.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.890
So I think that we're
doing the right thing,

01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:49.770
but we are fooling
ourselves if we trust

01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:51.920
that that's the really
the only way to search

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.970
and we should always
be open to the universe

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:56.620
for throwing us curve balls.

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.920
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Yeah.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.220
I would just agree with that.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.930
It's-- I think it's a matter
of priorities now, you know,

01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:04.210
a little of-- resources are limited
and you can always, you know,

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:06.140
there are three things,
the scaffolding of life,

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.760
the genetics of life and the
solvents involved in life,

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:12.630
you can mix and match all of those
things, you know, carbon, silicon

01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:16.380
and RNA and DNA and protein
and water and something else,

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:20.510 position:56%
but I think right now, the
resources is just part of resources,

01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:24.050
but you have to keep
that open mind, right.

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:25.350
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: OK.

01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:26.650
Thank you.

01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:27.950
If you had anymore
questions there's going

01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:30.380
to be another Q&amp;A session,
is that right?

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.420
For-- with everybody
from the conference.

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.260
&gt;&gt; And I'll ask you guys to
stay on stage for just a second.

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.160
Hi, Jason from the Kluge
Center, just a quick word

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.620
about what's going to happen next.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:40.720
So our final session of the day
is going be a audience discussion

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.020
with all of the panelists.

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.130
So if you did not get a chance to
ask a question earlier or you want

01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:47.290
to ask more questions, you
have a chance to engage

01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.590
with all of the panelists.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.960
It will be moderated by Nathaniel
Comfort, our astrobiology chair.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:55.500
In the next 10 minutes, we are
going to strike the stage and put

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:58.140
up a new stage arrangement,
so that we can ensure all

01:23:58.140 --> 01:23:59.940
of our panelists have seats.

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:02.610
And we are also going to be
putting out some food in the back.

01:24:02.610 --> 01:24:06.150
That food is for the reception
at the close of the day.

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:09.760
So hold tight, sit through
one more Q&amp;A session,

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.280
you get to enjoy the wine,
the cheese, the cookies.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.430
So please don't partake
of that food now.

01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:16.670
It will be open for
everyone at 4:30.

01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:19.120
So we're going to strike the
stage, we'll put out the food

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.510
and then we'll wrap
up with the group Q&amp;A.

01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:24.530
[ Applause ]

01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:25.830
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: OK.

01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:30.460
Well, throughout the day
we've been delightfully short

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.760
on time for questions.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.250
That's always a good sign when--

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:37.130
for a lively conference,
so that's really nice.

01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:41.190
But now is your chance to
ask some of those questions

01:24:41.190 --> 01:24:47.060
and any further questions that
you might have for any of us.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.920
And I hope that a lot of this
discussion can start to bounce

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.700
around the different
levels of expertise

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.070
that we've got up here on stage.

01:24:57.070 --> 01:25:01.670
This-- I just want to say you
should feel that what a privilege

01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:07.030
and treat this is to have this kind
of range and quality and caliber

01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:09.890
of expertise all in one
stage, it's just a phenomenon.

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:12.540
So, I'm just delighted
to have you all here.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:18.150
I want to ask-- so please if you
have a question, come up to one

01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:23.070
of the mics that we have here
and ask it, and I would only ask

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:29.500
that you try to keep your
questions concise and so

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.980
that we have enough time
for everybody to ask.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:36.800
So, you know, no long
expositions and specious please.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.680
We can save those for
the one in [inaudible].

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.990
All right, so you can just go
ahead and you can line up if you

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:45.440
like if there is somebody
at the mic,

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.010
and you want to go next just
go and stand behind them.

01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:52.880
And I'm going to moderate this
in a very light handed way.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.020
We'll see who wants to chime in
and if there is anything I can do

01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.890
to kind of direct things,
I will do that.

01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:07.260
So please by all means come
on up and we can get started.

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:08.560
&gt;&gt; Linda Billings: Hi.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.630
I'm Linda Billings, I work
with the Astrobiology Program

01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:12.190
at NASA with Mary Voytek.

01:26:12.190 --> 01:26:16.140
I had a question for the writers,
the journalists on the panel,

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:20.450
I would love hear what you thought
about the proceedings of the day.

01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:23.530
I'm a social scientist myself and
much of this went over my head,

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:33.720
but it's all fascinating but I
would really like to hear from you.

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.600
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: Ah well,
I mean this is stuff

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.760
that I write about all the time.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.990
And so, it's a really great
opportunity for me to kind

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:48.350
to step back and kind of get an
overview of the big questions

01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:50.820
that are driving the field.

01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:57.200
Certainly-- I mean it was sort
of interesting that every now

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:03.390
and then you would see-- you would
see, you know, headlines, you know,

01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:09.610
from slide to slide,
and, you know, clearly,

01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:15.480
that's a sign of just how
important the origin of life is

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.870
and the creation of
life is to the public.

01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:22.580
You know, those are fears,
fears appetite for it.

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.680
Now, when you get into the details
of ribose, that's, you know,

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:27.490
where the ribose hits the road
and you have to, you know,

01:27:27.490 --> 01:27:30.390 position:56%
try to be a good science writer and
find a way to keep people's interest

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:35.140
if they don't have a PhD in
chemistry, but it's worth it.

01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:40.570
And I think it's also useful to
have that historical perspective

01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:47.100
and see that, you know, just
how tempting it is to kind

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.780
of draw too much out of the
latest research, you know.

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:57.240 position:56%
And, you know, I don't know if I
have been writing about things like,

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.150
you know, like those
radium creatures, you know,

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:03.320
if I have been guilty of that
but that was New York Times.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.620
So, anyway.

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:06.100
[ Laughter ]

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.400
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: You know,

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.700
I would just say Carl
does have great job

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.000
of bringing in the history.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.210
He had a story just this
last week and had a really--

01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:16.920
really did a great job and actually
got tweeted out by the History

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.900
of Science Society, so you
know you're doing a good job.

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:22.200
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: Yeah.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.190
I got to say it's an honor
to be here with Carl Zimmer

01:28:24.190 --> 01:28:27.680
because he is the best science
writer in the subject of the origin

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.690
of life in the country for sure.

01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:34.150
I am always struck by-- whenever
I'm at a conference on the origin

01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:39.040
of life, I think I'm humbled and
reminded that there is a lot of--

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:45.710
there isn't a lot of the unity on
the answers for these questions,

01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:50.000
and it sort of reminds you that I
think as someone who observes it,

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.530
I want to be able to say, oh
it's right around the corner

01:28:52.530 --> 01:29:01.740
and perhaps it is, but when I
see the divisions among different

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.620
scientists in this
field, it strikes me

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:08.680
that perhaps we don't,
we aren't as close yet.

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:16.870
Sorry, Steve, you and me on one
side or the other would you?

01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:19.160
But, yeah, I'm always
reminded of that.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.990
And so, it is-- it's
a question that--

01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:24.000
it's one of the most
important questions in science,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.870 position:56%
if not the most important but it's--

01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:30.060
and it's one that I hope I
see answered in my lifetime

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:34.250
but I don't know if I will.

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:36.140
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: And I think--

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:41.140
when I took out the day was
just the ability to sort

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.440
of track all of these things.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:45.270
I would love the fact that we
covered so many different topics

01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:49.520
across sort of like the whole
scope of the origins of science.

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.510
You know, I'm a journalist who
doesn't necessarily only focus

01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:55.150
on the origins of science.

01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:58.510
So, it's great to get sort
of like a refresher course.

01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:02.870 position:56%
Then the other thing I enjoyed was
the visuals and their presentations,

01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:05.410
you know, for television where
were always thinking of ways

01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:08.150
to tell stories visually,

01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:11.900 position:56%
so I'd never really thought everyone
did an exceptional job for that.

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:15.420
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Thanks.

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.990
OK, yes? Hi.

01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:20.080
&gt;&gt; So hi, I'm [inaudible].

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.710
It's a fabulous event.

01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:24.240
So my question is mainly
for Steven and David,

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.140
but of course anyone else
who wants to chime in.

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.480
I want to return this
idea of panspermia,

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.480
which Stevie mentioned that, you
know, possibly we're all Martians.

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.360
And David, you mentioned that,
you know, Mars and Venus,

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.800
both had these areas where they
might have been water worlds.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:41.220
So my question is, is there
any evidence we have to suggest

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:45.190
that panspermia originating
on Mars might be more likely

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:46.990
than Venus or vice versa?

01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:49.130
I'm partly asking from my
background as a climate modeler

01:30:49.130 --> 01:30:52.150
where we have a much easier
time getting Venus to be warm

01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:55.680
under faint young Sun than mars
to be warm under faint young Sun,

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:58.650 position:56%
but I'm not sure is there any reason
why we think one or the other.

01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:00.660
And actually I have a
quick question that might--

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:05.740
that Steven might answer is
can you conceive of a planet

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:09.230
that might be more conducive to the
origin of life than Earth and might

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:11.410
that had an implication
for panspermia?

01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:12.710
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: As far

01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:17.320
of your first question,
it's a great question.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:26.750 position:56%
There might be a slight bias towards
Mars in terms of celestial dynamics.

01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:31.870
I think it's probably a little
bit easier or more frequent

01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:36.070
to transport stuff from Mars to
Earth than from Venus to Earth just

01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:40.010
because Venus has a bigger gravity
well and so that for a given size

01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:44.070
of impact or you're going to
less likely to blow chips off

01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:46.720
that are going to go into the
orbit and end up at Earth.

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.570
However, that may not have
been the limiting factor,

01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:52.640
we're to talking early on
during heavy bombardment

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:56.330
that was probably conceived
whether it was a reasonable flocks

01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:58.630
of stuff going between all of them,

01:31:58.630 --> 01:32:01.840
so that difference might
not that be that important.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:07.040
As far as early environments,
you know, I'm tempted as of--

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.970
I am sort of a Venus guy and
I am tempted to say, you know,

01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:12.980
Venus is a tabula rasa,
we don't know anything

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:14.280
about this early environment.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:15.580
We have some hints.

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:19.860
And so, for all we know, it could
have been by far the best place,

01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:23.200
whereas with Mars, we know
of some potential problems

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:27.170
and that there is some weird
unsolved problems of the climate.

01:32:27.170 --> 01:32:32.130
But in reality, you know, there
is nothing we know about any

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:34.200
of the three that precludes
an origin of life.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.040
So I would have to
say it's, you know,

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.500
it's still pretty up in the air.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.800
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: Yeah.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.130
I'm wrecking my brain,
trying to figure out a plan

01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:45.040
that there might be more
conducive to the origins of life.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.700
The thing is that planets
evolve, you know?

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:53.010
So, you know, we had to go
through the late heavy bombardment,

01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:56.640
you know, which ended 3.8 billion
years ago or something like that.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:00.760
I think, most the planets
in the solar system

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.730
at least the inner ones all have
the late heavy bombardment, right?

01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:07.710
So I don't see anyway of doing
away with that is probably similar

01:33:07.710 --> 01:33:10.360
if the formation of
solar systems is similar

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.540
in other planets, on
other solar systems.

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:18.520
But, you know, as I say
planets evolve and, you know,

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:21.470
there was a time when there was
no oxygen on the Earth and oxygen

01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:24.330
when it evolved from photosynthesis
really was poisoned, right?

01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:27.160
So things had to revolve
based on that.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:31.880
So, I don't know, do you have
any ideas on that, David?

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.450
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: I was sort of
glad he directed that one at you.

01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:39.110
The fact is, you know, my
impression from listening

01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:41.930
to the talks today is, you know,
that is still fundamentally

01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:43.670
and unsolved problem
and once we know

01:33:43.670 --> 01:33:46.070
that those requirements really are,

01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:48.780
we could talk about the
planet that makes them better.

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:52.490
But at this point, I'm kind of bit
of lost to say what that would be.

01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:54.800
Steve probably has a better idea.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.240
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Yeah, I mean,
first, the gravity is less

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.790
to mechanics has all worked
out relatively reliably.

01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:02.840 position:56%
And you can go look it up, there's a
very minor contribution for the fact

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.610
that Mars is farther out
from the sun and the Earth.

01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:09.820 position:56%
And, of course, as David mention the
gravitation from Mars is much lower,

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:12.230
but, of course, remember
the atmospheric thickness

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.430
of atmospheric has to do
with the size of the impact.

01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:15.870
They're both coming
in and going out.

01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:19.030
Second, Titan is often
referred to as a place

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:21.910
where you might have
more prebiotic organics.

01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:23.850
We don't actually have
a clear understanding

01:34:23.850 --> 01:34:25.790
of whether we could
have a warm Titan

01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:27.420
that is something that's closer.

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:31.350 position:56%
If you have a problem with the faint
early sun, it's going to be worst

01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:32.650
in titan, which is

01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:34.450
like 10 astronomical units
compare to the earth.

01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:38.750
So-- But we would be perhaps
better if we have a warmer titan

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:40.050
with an organic richness,

01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:43.350
which would be more conducive
maybe to the origins of life.

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:45.470
But as you know that
foremost important words

01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:47.330
in science are, I do
not know, right?

01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:50.150
So that's where your
focus right know.

01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:52.360
There's an interesting possibility.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:56.090
And remember the argument for
going panspermia has nothing to do

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.810
with sort of just, hey,
let's go panspermia.

01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:01.670
Panspermia is invoked to
solve particular problems.

01:35:01.670 --> 01:35:04.940
So as was mentioned earlier
invoked to solve the problem

01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:07.480
that when Lord Kelvin was
talking about, he did not know

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.570
about radioactive decay,

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:14.040
he was saying that if the sun is
the best imaginable quality of coal

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.690
and we burn it for a
certain period of time,

01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:20.570
we know why the mass the sun that
we can't have had 100 of millions

01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:23.650
of years of-- and he was
working very hard to find ways

01:35:23.650 --> 01:35:26.790
and increasing the life
span of sun by having bodies

01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:31.810 position:56%
in near solar orbit following to the
sun can bring their kinetic energy.

01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:35.570
So, panspermia is invoked to
solve a particular problem

01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:38.350
in this particular case
about inadequate physics.

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.540
Here, where-- we suggest a
life might have come from Mars

01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.970
to solve a particular problem
which comes from inadequacy

01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:47.120
of early modeling, but
it's water modeling,

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:51.150 position:56%
it's the notion the Earth having
had so much of an inventory of water

01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:55.970
and so little plate tectonics
that you were not able

01:35:55.970 --> 01:36:00.230
to get dry land necessary to
solve the intrinsic instability

01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:03.800
of your early biopolymers with
respect to hydrolysis by water.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.830
But, you know, I just talk
to you what was-- where's--

01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:08.900
N2O and there's the nitrogen oxide.

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:10.200
Oh there you are.

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.710
OK. Yeah. I mean there's a
whole story that you can get

01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:16.330
if you solve the earlier,
faint early sun problem

01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:17.860
by better greenhouse effects.

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:21.350
It's certainly easier to
do on Earth than in Mars.

01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:24.610
And the facts are that
I find it more likely

01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:28.660
that as we understand the early
Earth, we get more and more

01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:33.300
of an understanding of an
earlier start to plate tectonics

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:36.660
than we have thought about
it 10 years or 20 years ago,

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.230
which means an earlier continents.

01:36:38.230 --> 01:36:40.560
And so Steve Mojzsis [assumed
spelling], for example,

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:45.910
is wanting to give us roughly
two California size land areas

01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:49.820
of dry land at 4.2 billion years,
which will be more than enough

01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:57.980
to not need to go to mars.

01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.710
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes?

01:36:59.710 --> 01:37:01.010
&gt;&gt; Anthony Weston: Yeah.

01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:02.310
I don't know.

01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:03.610
I'm Anthony Weston.

01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:06.300
I'm a independent philosopher
and just like to say it's lovely

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.370
to be here with you
folks, some of them--

01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:10.860
may of whom I've read and
taught in a few occasions

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:12.450
and even reviewed in one case.

01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:15.470
But here's the thing, I went--
panspermia came up, I thought,

01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:20.850
this is an opportunity to speak to
folks who are all over this field

01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:22.790 position:56%
but central to it in different ways.

01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:25.910
To-- just ask you question about
this, does anybody else bugged

01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:29.210
by the sexism of it,
this panspermia?

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:32.410
Like seriously, so yeah, we
don't have to talk to this way,

01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:34.620
we can talk other ways
for example, panovular,

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:35.920
why don't we try that for a while.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:41.110
I'm totally serious or let's
say pandermia where at least

01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:46.210
so panspermia or panovular
or animalist, right?

01:37:46.210 --> 01:37:49.080
So-- but we could have-- it
might be more sensible to have--

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:54.060
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: I just have to
say as a feminist to write a book

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.600
about the history of this subject.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.770
It's needless to say, it's
a very, very male dominated.

01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:03.340
&gt;&gt; Anthony Weston: This
image of event going out

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:04.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: It made me feel bad.

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.980
&gt;&gt; Anthony Weston: Yeah.

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.280
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: It made
me feel bad to do that.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.580
&gt;&gt; Anthony Weston:
Well, we can change it.

01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:09.880
And you folks could change it.

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.990
And I'm-- that isn't just that,
you know, this isn't just politics.

01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:16.030
I mean people are talking
here about the conceptual--

01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:18.300
well, tools of variety of
sorts including different kind

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:21.440
of telescopes, and all, but also
the conceptual tools that we use

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.100
to think of all these through.

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.630
And so, this is the concept, right?

01:38:25.630 --> 01:38:28.050
It inclines us in certain
directions and closes us off

01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:29.350
from other ways of thinking.

01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:33.810
For example, if you think of
like the panspermias or maybe us

01:38:33.810 --> 01:38:37.690
down the road spitting our sperm
all over the universe then you have

01:38:37.690 --> 01:38:41.360
to think of other things like
planet is being impregnable--

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.920
not impregnable, but yeah, what
I mean is pregnable, right,

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.910
the possibility of
making them pregnant.

01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:48.770
So there's whole kind
of conceptual frame

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:51.680
that inclines towards certain kind
of space exploration and others.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.940
So what I felt was something that
didn't have to do with seeding

01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:57.250
at all, but something
more like invitation.

01:38:57.250 --> 01:38:58.720
So paninvitationism [phonetic],

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.770
so like the Stephen Hawking
project, what is it called?

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:06.390
Sending out a little chips with--

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:07.690
&gt;&gt; Nano spacecraft.

01:39:07.690 --> 01:39:08.990
&gt;&gt; Anthony Weston: Yeah.

01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:10.290
There's a name.

01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:11.590
Yeah. There's a name for that.

01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:12.890
&gt;&gt; Starshot.

01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:14.190
&gt;&gt; Anthony Weston: Yeah, Starshot.

01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:15.490
So is that-- what kind of--
that's not a spermia of any kind

01:39:15.490 --> 01:39:17.760
or an ovular or dermia or
anything that's ascending out of--

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.120
kind of an announcement or
sort of invitation to respond.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.980
So it matters what
we call this, right?

01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:26.440
It doesn't just-- it's
offensive to certain people.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.670
So I'd like to put that
out there as a plea as well

01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:30.890
as something people might want
to response to in the pleas.

01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:32.870
Let's change it, you can change it.

01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:34.170
You can change it.

01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:35.470
And we should.

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:37.750
&gt;&gt; Steven Dick: When you
started your comments,

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:43.490
I thought you were referring
to what to me is a little bit

01:39:43.490 --> 01:39:47.130
of a mostly white male elephant
in the room, which is the fact

01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:48.720
that they make up--
the gender balance

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:53.640
of our panel is not
reflective of the gender balance

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.670
of the gender population or even

01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:58.420
that of professionals
in the field, which--

01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:59.720
&gt;&gt; Anthony Weston: It's partly--

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.120
That's partly reflection
of budget, I have to say.

01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:03.420
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Yes.

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.940
And, you know, not to be too
hard on anyone but it is--

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.570
and it's a longer conversation.

01:40:07.570 --> 01:40:10.230
But it's noticeable and
I personally want to--

01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:11.950
when it come to that that we all--

01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:15.660
professionals have to try to do
a little bit better with that.

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:18.430
A lot better.

01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:25.080
And not to diss any individual
or institution-- I love you guys.

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:30.350
And-- But that it's interesting
that the point you did make

01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:34.450
about language is one-- you
know, I've heard that in critique

01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:37.070
and I've always, in my
mind, thought, well,

01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:42.380
but the root of panspermia just
means seed, and seeds are the way

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:46.050
that physically life spreads
form place to place, you know,

01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:49.000
and that moves from--
you know, gets--

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.750
finds its way to desert
isles on earth, you know?

01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:57.810
And so, is it-- if you look at that
root, is that really a gender thing

01:40:57.810 --> 01:41:00.840 position:56%
or is that just a mechanistic thing.

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.610
But then, you know,
maybe there's a deep--

01:41:02.610 --> 01:41:06.040
deeper level in which I'm
fooling myself, and we do need

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.090
to look at that, I don't know.

01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:11.390
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
I would just note

01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:17.180
that there's a longstanding
metaphor in science and especially

01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:23.490
in medicine of seed and soil, as
an idea for conception of disease

01:41:23.490 --> 01:41:24.790
and the spread of disease.

01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:29.740 position:56%
This was used extensively
throughout the 19th century and well

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:36.220
into the 20th century, the
notion of disease having

01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:39.850
to fall upon fertile
soil in order to take.

01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:45.980
And sometimes it falls on barren
soil and then you can be exposed

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:48.830
to the disease but not get it.

01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:52.120
So, I think it's a really
interesting point to think

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:57.220
about the gender dynamics of this.

01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.520
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: Nathaniel,
if I could elaborate

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.140
on what you're saying just a bit.

01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.440
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yup.

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.740
Please, by all means.

01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.500
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: I think this
question of to what extent rhetoric

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.030
or discourse is important
to the way we think

01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:09.480
about sciences is something worth
contemplating further beyond just

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:10.940
changing the name for something.

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:13.020
Of course, what we're
trying to do today is talk

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:16.730
about what are the conditions
of life, what makes life emerge.

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:19.520
And the fact to the matter
is that the word sperm,

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.360
as we've already discussed,
means seed.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.220
But this goes back to Plato.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:27.050
And when Plato talks about
where new organisms come from,

01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:31.320
he says that the form is
provided by the sperm or the seed,

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.730
and then the nutritive environment
where the soil is provided

01:42:34.730 --> 01:42:37.740
by the matrix which is where
we get the word mother.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.520
So these are deeply gendered words

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.400
but they also inflect
the way we think

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.910
about what counts as
meaningful to life.

01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:47.540 position:56%
Is it the material substance or are
we talking about something like form

01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:49.560
or pattern that can be simulated?

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.860
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Mm-hmm, nice.

01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.160
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: I believe

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.980
that ma is an Indo-European
word meaning mother.

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.240
And matrix is derived from
mother, not the other way

01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.540
around but maybe I'm mistaken.

01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.510
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:03.560
[ Laughter ]

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.860
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Any further comments

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:06.570
on that one or should we move on?

01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:09.420
Yeah. OK, please.

01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:10.720
&gt;&gt; Vladimir Airapetian:
Vladimir Airapetian,

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.710
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

01:43:12.710 --> 01:43:19.620
Yes. So I want to throw a couple of
ideas about panspermia by itself.

01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:26.720
First, if a panspermia really
efficient way to seed life,

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.730
then we need certain
concentration of organic molecules

01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:33.730
of certain complexity to be of--

01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:39.930
to be accumulated in the
aqua and reservoirs on Earth.

01:43:39.930 --> 01:43:41.230
That's the first thing.

01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:44.150
The second thing that's more
important is the chirality of life.

01:43:44.150 --> 01:43:47.740
We know that amino
acids are left-handed.

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:51.390
So, do we know that the
left-handedness is the universal

01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:53.080
requirement for life?

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:57.700
And so, unless we've solve this
problem we can't say anything

01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:00.000
about panspermia.

01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:02.640
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Well, OK.

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:05.650 position:56%
The Burmese python comes to Florida.

01:44:05.650 --> 01:44:09.180
Mr. and Mrs. Python
are both necessary

01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:11.170
and they land in the Everglades.

01:44:11.170 --> 01:44:14.970
And this is a case where
the environment is suited

01:44:14.970 --> 01:44:17.440
for reproduction, and
therefore they take

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.170
over because they lack a
host-- predator rather.

01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:24.450
The other alternative, of course,
is they could land in Everglades

01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:27.270 position:56%
and find that they don't have any
food and that they could go extinct.

01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:30.850 position:56%
So, your problem with being in
Mars, right, you're sitting in Mars,

01:44:30.850 --> 01:44:35.180
you are, say evolving, originating
on Mars because you enjoy,

01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:38.100
at least your molecules can survive

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:40.140
in a relatively water-poor
environment.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.610
But at some point you might regard
water as a limiting resource just

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:46.960
like many bags here in
the ocean regarding iron

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.660
as a limiting resource or
plants regarding nitrogen

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.960
as a limiting resource.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.850
So you're sitting in your room
Sunday morning doing the crossword,

01:44:53.850 --> 01:44:56.760
you got hit by a meteorite
and got kicked to Earth.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.400
You splashed down on an ocean.

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.070
Now, your first possibility
is that you will say, "Hey,

01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:05.480
the scare resource, water, which
I have been harboring, conserving,

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:09.700
working very hard to maintain
as a scarce item on Mars,

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:11.180
is all of a sudden
now abundant to me.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:14.110
I would then burst out like
the Burmese python has done

01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:15.410
in the Everglades.

01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:17.790
The other possibility, of course,
is that you have adapted to be

01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:21.370
at a water-sparing environment,
using whatever water you have.

01:45:21.370 --> 01:45:23.330
And when you landed in
an ocean, you just drown.

01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:25.740
So, your first question will
be, we don't have a clue

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:28.000
in general as to how that works.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.300
What's your second question?

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.600
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.900
All right.

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:33.490 position:56%
No. We don't know the L-amino acids.

01:45:33.490 --> 01:45:38.530
In fact we can make DNA out
of L, which is the opposite

01:45:38.530 --> 01:45:39.830
of its natural structure.

01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:42.980 position:56%
We can make proteins out of
D-amino acids and there's no reason,

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.840
I think to believe it was.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:47.220
Yeah, or now there's a lot
of theories on that, right?

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:52.780
So, the set parity
violations of nuclear decay,

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.850
the optical polarization

01:45:54.850 --> 01:45:56.720
of circularly-polarized
ultraviolet light,

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.950
these have all been
involved but we don't know.

01:45:59.950 --> 01:46:02.390
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: I actually have a
reaction to the chirality question

01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:03.790
that I sort of want
to bounce off some

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:06.980
of the more chemically
literate people here,

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:10.480
like Steve for instance, which
is that it always seemed to me

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.370
like something that people
work really hard on a solution

01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:17.260
for that's not really a problem,
and that, I mean, I understand why

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:21.260 position:56%
like having a chirality is necessary
for stereochemistry but it seems

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:22.560 position:56%
to me like that it's just being sort

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.430
of an arbitrary random
thing that happened.

01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:29.780
And it-- you know, when this
origin of life thing was happening

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:31.550
and then could have been either way

01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:34.070
and then once it started,
it self-perpetuates.

01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:37.380
And so, it seems sort of very
unprofound to me, the left

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:41.620
or the right, if-- I mean,
stereochemistry makes sense

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:45.740
and if there's organic life, other
places probably uses a chirality.

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:50.010
But it seems to me likely to just
be sort of random and not that hard

01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.770
to sort of pick one and
then get perpetuated.

01:46:53.770 --> 01:46:56.370
Is there really-- Does
there have to be more to it?

01:46:56.370 --> 01:46:57.950
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: What
Francis Crick would have called a

01:46:57.950 --> 01:47:00.430
frozen accident.

01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:01.730
&gt;&gt; Bill Mesler: Yeah.

01:47:01.730 --> 01:47:03.030
&gt;&gt; Vladimir Airapetian:
Yeah, as far as I understand,

01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:05.250
the number of meteorites, the
chemical analysis shows that number

01:47:05.250 --> 01:47:10.040
of meteorites show excess
in L. That's really--

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.340
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Well, it depends.

01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.640
I mean, what the meteorite
show excess--

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.310
or, I mean, Sandra Pizzarello,
George Cooper, NASA Ames,

01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:21.280
these people have found asymmetric
excesses of one over the other.

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:24.310
And the question-- the problem that
most of the times that they find

01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:26.840
and they have what they call
alpha-methyl amino acids,

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.490
which are amino acids
that are not able

01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:31.350
to lose their chirality
quite so easily.

01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:33.830
But yeah, I mean, I
agree with you, David.

01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:39.550
I mean, basically homochirality is
essential for biopolymer evolution.

01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:43.030
And that's because when you
evolve and replace amino acid,

01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:44.440
you really don't want to do a--

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.600
you wanted to do a
side-chain replacement.

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:48.700
You don't want to do a side-chain
replacement the same time

01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:50.310
as you do an orientation change.

01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:52.160
And so, homochirality is important.

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.080
But I suspect, again, the
words are I don't know.

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:58.450
But I suspect that you
pick one or the other,

01:47:58.450 --> 01:48:02.690 position:56%
homochirality being important and
then which you pick is going to be--

01:48:02.690 --> 01:48:05.560
and, of course, we'll be very
fortunate when we discover life

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.400
on Mars that it's the
other chirality just--

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.070 position:56%
that will show that we're not
necessarily contaminating the sample

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:16.460
that we looked at on Mars
with something from Earth.

01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:18.130
&gt;&gt; Vladimir Airapetian: Well,
my proposition would be might be

01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:21.490
that there is a certain isotropy,
you know, that for instance related

01:48:21.490 --> 01:48:24.180
to the magnetic field to
the polarized electrons

01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:27.410
to some environment that
creates certain predisposition,

01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:28.710
certain excess.

01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:30.010
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: OK.

01:48:30.010 --> 01:48:31.310
Well, there's-- I mean,
there's between 10

01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:33.470
and 100,000 paper literature
on this particular subject.

01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:36.240
So, circularly polarizing
the ultraviolet light

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.680
in the Sagittarius nebula is
preferencing one over the other.

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:42.440
And that could be an
intrinsic source

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.300
for chirality in that location.

01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:46.600
&gt;&gt; OK.

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:49.520
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: People-- 10, 000
papers might be an underestimate.

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.500
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Let's
get onto another question here.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.760
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] which were
formed in a Supernova explosions

01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.840
in a series of, you
know, generations.

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:07.800
The universe formed about
15 billion years ago.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:10.510
It takes a few billion
years for a star to form,

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:13.030
go through its life
cycle and finally explode

01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:15.770
in its several generations.

01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:19.550
Before you get to atoms
that are heavy enough

01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:23.010
to perhaps support life,
do we have any estimates

01:49:23.010 --> 01:49:27.050
of when life could first have been
formed from that point of view?

01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:31.960
Is it possible we are the first
life because of that limitation?

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: I'm totally
unqualified to answer your question.

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:43.280
But one thing I will
note is that there's--

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:46.870
I think his name's
Abraham Loeb at Harvard,

01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:51.840 position:56%
has come out with a neat paper
actually suggesting that if you look

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:58.270 position:56%
at these processes and you look at
sort of the lifetime of the universe

01:49:58.270 --> 01:50:03.860 position:56%
that you'd really expect life to
originate a lot far of in the future

01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:06.110
from now, like billions
of years in the future.

01:50:06.110 --> 01:50:09.660
So, the suggestion being,
like, "Why is it so hard for us

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:12.380
to find life on other planets?"

01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:15.280
Well, we're like that person who
showed up at the party too early

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:17.810
and you're like, "Oh, there's
nobody here," you know?

01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:19.110
We showed up too early.

01:50:19.110 --> 01:50:23.580
Let's say this is a paper that's on
archive that you can probably muck

01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.100
around and find that, so.

01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:27.210
&gt;&gt; Vladimir Airapetian:
So we could be the first?

01:50:27.210 --> 01:50:28.510
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: Yeah.

01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:31.090
No, this is like-- this is actually
a statistical argument that,

01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:33.450
yes, we are the first.

01:50:33.450 --> 01:50:34.750
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Yeah.

01:50:34.750 --> 01:50:37.090
You're-- The paper that
I've seen is that your--

01:50:37.090 --> 01:50:40.930
everyone of your interesting
atoms, your molybdenum and so on,

01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:43.920
you are the product on average
of three to the fourth supernova

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.390
that you have been through
so you are a star child,

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:48.650
three or four times.

01:50:48.650 --> 01:50:51.950
And, yeah, I mean, of course the
only thing is at the metallicity,

01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:53.330
as we like to talk about,

01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:56.830
is asymmetrically distributed
in the galaxy.

01:50:56.830 --> 01:51:00.250 position:56%
And so, you know, we should be
looking-- And people do that, right?

01:51:00.250 --> 01:51:02.790
People look for high
metallicity stars

01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:05.120
which have presumably
had more generations

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.420
to create the heavy elements.

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:09.780
But you are the products
of three or four supernova

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:12.040
and of-- I mean, how-- 25?

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.340
What's the story?

01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:14.660
Twenty-five light years away,

01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:17.640
four and a half billion years
ago, a supernova exploded.

01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:19.780
The shockwave is what
caused the collapse

01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:23.000
of the solar nebula to produce you.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.030
Congratulations.

01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:26.330
&gt;&gt; You too.

01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:28.010
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
All right, yes.

01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:32.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes. My question is about the
news article which appeared recently

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:35.930
on the earliest form of
fossils ever discovered.

01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:37.860
I think David showed a picture.

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:43.680
In that article, they had a photo
from Shark Bay in Australia.

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:47.130
So I'm looking at this
thinking I'm to believe

01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:51.230
that the oldest form
of life is still here.

01:51:51.230 --> 01:51:55.620
It's gone through all the eons
of change and it's still here,

01:51:55.620 --> 01:52:00.310
looking just like it used
to 3.7 billion years ago.

01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:02.480
I'm thinking that seems
pretty unlikely.

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:08.720
Or it does say that life
is extraordinarily stable,

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:12.070
or I'm misunderstanding something.

01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:15.030
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Well, this
was really biosignature of the--

01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:20.450
you know, these aren't even
actually fossils right there.

01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:22.020
They're the remains of fossils.

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:23.320
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: No, no.

01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:24.940
Well, maybe they showed
the picture just

01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:29.170
to show you what a modern
stromatolite looks like.

01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:31.180
Because there are still
stromatolites around.

01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:33.780
And so this was a stromatolite
back then.

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:39.870
So, you know, I mean, like
it's a "If it ain't broke,

01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:41.230
don't fix it" kind of situation.

01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:44.320
I mean, it works pretty
well and it's still around.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.220
They're not as common
as they used to be.

01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.990 position:56%
Mostly because like animals showed
up and just ruined the neighborhood.

01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:51.620
I mean, they're used
to be much more common.

01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.920
And so actually you have to go--

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:55.190
you have to look harder for
stromatolites than you used to.

01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:56.490
But, you know, it--

01:52:56.490 --> 01:53:00.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It doesn't strike to as a
meaningful that stromatolite happens

01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:04.490
to be very first form of life--

01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:06.040
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: No, it's not
the very first form of life.

01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:08.650
It's the oldest form of
life that we have found.

01:53:08.650 --> 01:53:13.470
And, you know, and that does
speak to the fact that there had

01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:17.170
to be hundred of millions of years
of evolution to get to that point

01:53:17.170 --> 01:53:21.160
of cell-- those are presumably
cells, DNA, and protein in them

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:22.900
and that-- and with communities

01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:25.800
of different species
interacting, cooperating.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:27.450
Yeah, that's no small feat.

01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:30.220
But, you know, it was-- there
could've been hundreds of millions

01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:32.220
of years of evolution
leading up to that point.

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:36.650
This is just the oldest sign of
life that people have found so far,

01:53:36.650 --> 01:53:39.040
3.7 billion years ago,
the Earth had been

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.680
around for 800 million
years already, so.

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:42.980
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon:
And when we say--

01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:45.480
when you say the earliest form
of life, I mean, there's a truth

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:49.640 position:56%
to that but it's different from like
finding a giraffe that's 3.7 billion

01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:50.970
years old and saying,
"Oh, wow, those are--

01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:52.520
that's a long standing
form of life."

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:56.980
Because the stromatolite is not
an organism, it's a microbial mat.

01:53:56.980 --> 01:54:03.620
It's a way of a community of
microbes deciding to live together

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:07.280 position:56%
in sort of a horizontal arrangement.

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:11.360
So, there's, potentially,
an argument from biophysics

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.010 position:56%
for as kind of universality of that.

01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:15.890
In fact, people talk about
looking for stromatolites on Mars.

01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:17.530
Actually, maybe that's a stretch.

01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:20.270
But it's less of a stretch in
talking about looking for a giraffe

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:24.980
on Mars because there's sort of a
basic almost physics or, you know,

01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:29.350
basic sort of geometry to why a
simple life might arrange itself

01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:30.650
in that way on a planet.

01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:37.540
&gt;&gt; Which is not a preserved
life form, it's just a bunch

01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:41.710
of physical way in which
microbial that's formed.

01:54:41.710 --> 01:54:45.240
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon:
It's an architecture.

01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:46.540
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yeah.

01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:47.840
&gt;&gt; That's a very nice picture.

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:50.420
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Well, I want to
encourage your sense of skepticism.

01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:55.620
Because I passed the stromatolite
around and I got it back

01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:59.330
and nobody remarked me and says,

01:54:59.330 --> 01:55:03.280
"What the hell do you think you're
doing trying to tell me this is

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.100
as a remnant of a life form?

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:13.290
But it is a rock and it's a rock
with precipitated material in it."

01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:18.380
So what's you're observing here
is the precipitated inorganic,

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:20.210
insoluble material.

01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:24.400
And we want to encourage
you to ask the question

01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:29.940
when you encounter somebody like
me saying as you [inaudible],

01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:33.350
how could you possibly know that?

01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:34.760
Now, they know it, right?

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.250
There's a lot of work
that goes in that,

01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:40.610
and many, many PhD dissertations.

01:55:40.610 --> 01:55:43.830
But, yeah, I mean that's a
good sentiment to have, right?

01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:46.990
When someone tells you
[inaudible], for example,

01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:52.000
how do you know whether
it's 3.7 billion years?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.500
And the answer is, well, there's
an answer to that question.

01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:00.470
I think it was actually
on the paper.

01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:04.760
But, yeah, these are the kinds
of questions that you should ask.

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.930
And, of course, that's where the--

01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:12.700
we try to train the students
to go deeper so that we can--

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:16.530
we'd love asking PhD
candidates, you know, yeah,

01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:17.830
do you think water is H2O?

01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:20.330
What's the primary
data that say that--

01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:23.630
what are the primary data
that say that water is H2O?

01:56:23.630 --> 01:56:25.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: And those-- And
there are some "fossils" from almost

01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:28.750
that old that people don't
think are fossils anymore,

01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:30.780
that they were just-- they
looked a lot a like them.

01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:32.430
It gets very tricky with things
like microbial mats that old.

01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:33.730
It gets really hard to
figure out what's living

01:56:33.730 --> 01:56:35.160
and what just this rocks that
look like what you'd expect.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.460
But, yeah, it seems like
this new one, I don't know,

01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:37.890
people seemed to be pretty solid
on it although-- You think so?

01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:39.190
All right, he thinks so.

01:56:39.190 --> 01:56:40.490
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: I don't know.

01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:41.790
No. Don't listen to me.

01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:43.090
I don't know.

01:56:43.090 --> 01:56:44.390
I mean--

01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:45.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: If I had written
the article I would have called you.

01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:46.990
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: If you go
over the Smithsonian today and go

01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:48.290
into National History Museum,
you still see those shops--

01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:49.590
carbon specs, which we thought
used to be cyanobacteria

01:56:49.590 --> 01:56:50.890
which we don't think are there.

01:56:50.890 --> 01:56:52.190
They're still in the
Smithsonian as example of life.

01:56:52.190 --> 01:56:53.490
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yeah, yeah.

01:56:53.490 --> 01:56:54.790
OK.

01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:56.090
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Right
by that big elephant.

01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:57.390
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes.

01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:58.690
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

01:56:58.690 --> 01:56:59.990
I'm with the Richard
Dawkins Foundation

01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:01.290
and the Center for Inquiry.

01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:02.590
My question is to you, scientists
and science communicators,

01:57:02.590 --> 01:57:03.890
you still have to operate
within a political environment,

01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:05.190
and it determines what
resources you have,

01:57:05.190 --> 01:57:06.490
it determines whether you
have freedom of inquiry.

01:57:06.490 --> 01:57:07.790
So I'm asking you, what
is the current status

01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:09.090
of the political environment
in which you operate?

01:57:09.090 --> 01:57:10.390
And are there any danger signs

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.690
that you're concerned
about down the road?

01:57:11.690 --> 01:57:12.990
[ Laughter ]

01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:14.290
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Let's
keep this nonpartisan.

01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:15.590
Everybody is passing.

01:57:15.590 --> 01:57:16.890
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: I don't
know why people are handing me

01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:18.190
the microphone.

01:57:18.190 --> 01:57:19.490
[ Laughter ]

01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:20.790
I--

01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:22.090
&gt;&gt; You're not going to
have equal opportunities.

01:57:22.090 --> 01:57:23.390
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon:
Yeah, that's right.

01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:24.830
Personally, I mean, I'm
hesitating because I don't feel

01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:26.520
like I have a really profound--

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.500
I mean, it's an important
question you asked.

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:33.270
With this particular area of
inquiry I don't feel a lot

01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:35.170
of political pressure.

01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:40.600 position:56%
I mean, out there in our society
there are the forces that, you know,

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:45.200
want to teach-- you know, that are
concerned about teaching evolution

01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.870
in the schools and, you know, the
stuff that you guys at the Center

01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:49.380
for Inquiry are very well aware of.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:52.750
And, you know, those are things
we're aware of but they're not--

01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:54.730
you know, it's not affecting
our ability right now

01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:57.300
to do the research we do.

01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:02.310
It's certainly, you know, affecting
our ability to, in a larger sense,

01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:07.420
communicate and have a
science literate society,

01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:09.110
which is a wider concern.

01:58:09.110 --> 01:58:13.500 position:56%
And, of course, you know, in my
area of astrobiology which has to do

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:19.480
with climate modeling, I'm,
you know, working with people

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:23.720
who are feeling the effects of
some of the slight, you know,

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:28.120
inquisition like aspects
of some corners

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:31.380
of our government's approach
to climate [inaudible].

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:35.040
And so, you know, there
are some danger signs

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.950
on the dashboard, some
lights flashing.

01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:40.880
But, you know, as far as
there's nobody telling us not

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:45.470
to research the origin of life or
anything like that, there's no sort

01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:48.450
of acute political constraint
on this area of inquiry.

01:58:48.450 --> 01:58:51.950
But I think you know as
members of a society at large,

01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:53.750
the concern of science
and education,

01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:56.510
there are certainly some things
we need to pay attention to.

01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:59.560
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Can I turn
the question back to you?

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:01.660
Although you seem to
have disappeared, what--

01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:04.870
I mean you work at something with
the Richard Dawkins in the name.

01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:08.010
So, what is your experience?

01:59:08.010 --> 01:59:12.370
&gt;&gt; Well, I run the Richard Dawkins
Foundation for Reason and Science.

01:59:12.370 --> 01:59:17.320
And we promote atheism
and scientific literacy.

01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:18.950
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: So you
have a more direct contact

01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:20.950
to the public than--
I mean, I talk--

01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:22.250
&gt;&gt; And, you know, we--

01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:24.090
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: -- Richmond
society I talk creations all the

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:27.490
time, but you have a more
closer contact to this.

01:59:27.490 --> 01:59:28.790
And what's your experience?

01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:33.560
&gt;&gt; Well, I work in a realm where
I'm trying to debunk mythologies.

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:38.440
And people cling to those
ideas and are very hostile

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.820
to anyone who challenges them.

01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:43.270
I would say when you're
dealing with pure science,

01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:50.870
it's easier to put forth ideas
often-- to be perfectly frank,

01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:55.670
they're a little over the head of
most average people, laypeople.

01:59:55.670 --> 02:00:00.040
So, they're not going to be
challenging you directly.

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.480
But we run a program, for
instance, the Teacher Institute

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:04.860
for Evolutionary Science School,

02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:09.490
where we teach middle school
teachers how to teach evolution.

02:00:09.490 --> 02:00:14.950
And we receive, on a daily
basis, responses from teachers

02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:17.860
that say they can't
teach the subject.

02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:23.530
The kids will turn their chair
to the wall rather than listen

02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:27.360 position:56%
to something that defies what
they've been taught by their pastor,

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:32.270
their priest, their minister,
their imam, the rabbi.

02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:33.670
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Would
you say that's increasing?

02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:34.970
Decreasing?

02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:36.770
Do you have any reason
to make a statement?

02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:38.870
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.

02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:41.450
I mean, I do know that
43% of Americans say

02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:43.750
that human beings arrived
on this Earth fully formed

02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:46.390
within the last 10,000 years.

02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:47.900
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Because
I talk a lot

02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.250
to the Gainesville
creationist community.

02:00:50.250 --> 02:00:53.430
I just gave a talk, you know,
what religion is that science--

02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:55.850
what science is that
religion is not.

02:00:55.850 --> 02:01:00.850
The subtitle for that talk is, "Why
scientist do so very little of it?"

02:01:00.850 --> 02:01:03.490
But the bottom line is
that they're nice people.

02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:08.080
They don't seem to be--
not in kind of hostility.

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:09.380
They-- Of course, the public,

02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:12.220
even the creationists very
much values the technology.

02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:15.240
The new medicines, the new,
you know, therapies and stuff

02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:18.290
that is coming from
science as whatever that is.

02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:20.040
Many of them are more concerned

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.530
about whether their daughter
is going to come home pregnant

02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:23.960
or they're going to be--
you know, they're worried

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:26.310
about the social decay,
they're worried about all sorts

02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:28.530
of other things for
which origins of life,

02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:30.360
or evolution is a proxy, right?

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:32.850
It doesn't really say
it's a sort of authority.

02:01:32.850 --> 02:01:34.210
They don't actually much care.

02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:37.600
There's no constructive reason
to care one way or other

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.040
when the Earth was formed.

02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:41.580
I mean, how does that
influence their daily life,

02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:42.970
but it does influence
their daily life

02:01:42.970 --> 02:01:45.600
that their kid come home
drug addicted, for example,

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:48.460
and they're worried about the
laws of authority that would tend

02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:51.140
to prevent drug addiction, at
least that's how they view it among

02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:52.440
their children.

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.280
But-- So you actually think
that their-- I mean is it--

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.870
&gt;&gt; I think there are direct
societal consequences to that kind

02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:59.650
of scientific illiteracy
in the general population.

02:01:59.650 --> 02:02:00.950
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Well,
I agree with that, but--

02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:03.740
&gt;&gt; And I think that there are
consequences for resources

02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:07.310
for science and public policy.

02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:11.690
From stem cell research, to,
you know, abortion rights,

02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:16.400
to same sex marriage,
to climate change.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.240
So-- And I wish scientists
would get a little more engaged

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.190
in these battles, because
we need you.

02:02:24.190 --> 02:02:25.490
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: OK.

02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:27.580
We have a couple of
repeat questions.

02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:30.470
I want to get to people who
haven't asked a question first

02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:32.830
and then we'll get to you.

02:02:32.830 --> 02:02:34.130
So, OK.

02:02:34.130 --> 02:02:38.430
&gt;&gt; OK. And that is, you know, we've
spoken about the origins of life

02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:42.740
and the difficulties
of defining life.

02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:45.290
And, you know, we talked
about DNA, RNA.

02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:51.290
But it seems to me that what we--

02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:54.220
at least what I think is
what's really interesting,

02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:57.500
the really interesting life
on Earth, the people all

02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:01.400
around us are-- is eukaryotic life.

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:11.560
And can we imagine intelligent
life arising with life forms

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:15.630
that have not experienced
a eukaryotic threshold?

02:03:15.630 --> 02:03:23.500
Is there some other path that
people have at least thought about?

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:27.100
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Meaning is
a membrane-bound nucleus necessary

02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:28.720
for higher--

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.810
&gt;&gt; For most interesting
multicellular life.

02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:34.130
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
For a development

02:03:34.130 --> 02:03:37.150
of a neural system or
something like that?

02:03:37.150 --> 02:03:40.280
&gt;&gt; Yes. Because, I mean,
you know, we're thinking

02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:42.740
about the first step
we've got microbes.

02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:44.660
Hurray, we've got microbes.

02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:47.670
Which is most of what
we've had on Earth.

02:03:47.670 --> 02:03:51.530
But the part that makes
our heart beat is

02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:55.190
when you start getting
eukaryotes and multicellular life

02:03:55.190 --> 02:03:59.940
and complex life with
tissues and organs.

02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:03.370
And I'm wondering, has
there been any thought given

02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:07.570
to how complex life with
tissues and organs and this sort

02:04:07.570 --> 02:04:12.020
of thing might have a reason in the
absence of a eukaryotic threshold?

02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:15.760
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Let me
throw in there just into the mix,

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:22.970
whether that question really is
about the transition from one

02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:27.100
of the major forms of information
exchange being lateral gene

02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:31.590
transfer, shifting toward a
more vertical gene transfer

02:04:31.590 --> 02:04:34.890
and the invention of sex.

02:04:34.890 --> 02:04:38.650
Possibly another way of
phrasing the question.

02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:40.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Schrenk: I just
also like to add that some

02:04:40.030 --> 02:04:42.660
of the things we talked about
recently, the stromatolites,

02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:46.100
the biofilms earlier today,
horizontal gene exchange,

02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:50.660
all these are-- perhaps they
don't immediately translate

02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:54.060
into intelligent life back and
send out signals to other planets.

02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:57.470
But these are the beginnings
of differentiation

02:04:57.470 --> 02:05:01.990
and these microbial communities are
working together at some skills,

02:05:01.990 --> 02:05:04.440
sensing the environment,
having feedbacks

02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:08.160
with their underlying
biochemistry, and differentiating.

02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:15.040
And so, even before you have
nuclei; you have systems reacting

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.670
to the environment and
differentiating it in ways

02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:21.960
that are more complex than
they can individually.

02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:24.210
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Biofilms can be differentiated

02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:25.770
into different kinds of--

02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:27.080
&gt;&gt; Matthew Schrenk:
Yeah, I mean exactly--

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:28.380
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
As you were saying.

02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:29.970
&gt;&gt; Matthew Schrenk: You know,
what facilitates the layering

02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:34.300
in stromatolites and what
facilitates antibiotic resistance

02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:36.670
amongst biofilms in many cases.

02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:39.070
So there's a lot of evidence

02:05:39.070 --> 02:05:43.170
of these microbial communities
working together in that sense.

02:05:43.170 --> 02:05:44.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Let me see, if I--

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:47.610
I'm assuming that you
would the story rather

02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:49.670
than the statement
we don't know, right?

02:05:49.670 --> 02:05:50.970
So here's the story.

02:05:50.970 --> 02:05:52.480
&gt;&gt; I know we don't know.

02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:53.780
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: You
know we don't know.

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:55.880
&gt;&gt; Has somebody thought
about this more than I had?

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:57.180
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: Absolutely.

02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:58.480
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Oh sure.

02:05:58.480 --> 02:05:59.780
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: So
here's the story.

02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:02.420
Monocellular life emerged, we don't
quiet know well Cambrian explosion

02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:04.420
is a very clear statement as to

02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:10.720
when fossilizable forms 542
million years ago, is the number.

02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.360
And the story is that's
associated with the arise

02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.220
of atmospheric oxygen, right?

02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:21.630
Because the argument is the
oxygen, O2, and oil that is lipids,

02:06:21.630 --> 02:06:24.720
have a huge potential energy
difference between them

02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:27.830
as you run your car
by burning gasoline

02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:31.900
and that multicellular life
requires that huge amount of energy

02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:35.060
and therefore multicellular
life require the emergence

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:36.410
of atmospheric oxygen.

02:06:36.410 --> 02:06:40.170
Second point is atmospheric
oxygen is almost certainly arising

02:06:40.170 --> 02:06:42.930
from photosynthesis, the
cyanobacteria that we talked

02:06:42.930 --> 02:06:45.890
about are generating
dioxygen into the atmosphere.

02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:48.770
And then you can look at maybe
two and half billion years ago,

02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:50.340
there's a little rise in oxygen.

02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:53.920
But the real ramp up of oxygen
is roughly the same time

02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:56.500 position:56%
as the emergent of multicellularity.

02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:59.250
Eukaryoticness, which
is a different--

02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:00.550
You use that word, right?

02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:03.380
The idea of this nucleus membrane
having a differentiated cell

02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:06.510
and all the rest of it, is it
required for multicellularity?

02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:10.230
Well, any good microbiologist will
tell you that unicellular organisms

02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:12.500
by forming this mass,
and you just set this,

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:15.480
are multicellular in
some sense of a term.

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:18.780
But in an organism, if they find
specimen of multicellularity

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:22.340
that you are with a backbone
and the ability to walk

02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:25.040
without an exoskeleton so
you can grow without having

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:28.320
to shed your skin and all the rest
of these things, this is something

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.300
that is argued to be associated
uniquely with eukaryotic life based

02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:36.010
on the ability to have
sex, which you just heard.

02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:38.770
And that's an important
way of increasing the rates

02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:40.480
of evolution for adaptation.

02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:44.180
Now, second question is you have
to do about likelihood, right?

02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:46.600
Let's just-- speaking around
that, the sun will last

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:47.970
for what, 10 billion years.

02:07:47.970 --> 02:07:53.730
But the sun would grow to a
red giant and consume the orbit

02:07:53.730 --> 02:07:56.220
of the Earth and make
Earth an inhabitable say

02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:58.530
after five billion years--
I'm speaking around.

02:07:58.530 --> 02:08:02.450
So you can say I got life on
Earth within the first 15 seconds

02:08:02.450 --> 02:08:06.180
after the Earth emerged in terms
of microbes, but it took me four

02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:10.740
and half billion years to get the
fine specimen that is now standing

02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:12.950 position:56%
at that microphone, which just means

02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:16.450
that the sun is almost
done, done with you, right?

02:08:16.450 --> 02:08:21.740
So you can say that microbial life
easy by that metric, fine specimens

02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:26.690
of life able to use this microphone
are difficult by that metric.

02:08:26.690 --> 02:08:29.850
But in order to have
intelligence and the ability

02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:33.740
to communicate is a very rare
item, because at least on Earth,

02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:36.790
it took a long time that most
of the life of the habitability

02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:41.640
of this particular rock for it to
immerge, how does that do for you?

02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:42.940
&gt;&gt; Thanks to both of you.

02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:44.240
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: OK.

02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:45.540
One more here and we'll
do round two.

02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:49.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just want to add
the-- in the next billion years,

02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:52.980
the sun will increase its
luminosity by 10% and we're going

02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:57.090
to start the-- see the effects
of the runway greenhouse.

02:08:57.090 --> 02:08:58.390
It's a--

02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:59.690
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: When, when, when?

02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:01.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It's at 10 % every billion years.

02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:03.090
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: OK, got you.

02:09:03.090 --> 02:09:05.400
&gt;&gt; In next-- In a billion years,
so we don't need 10 billion years.

02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.150
&gt;&gt; Steven Benner: When I
should move back to Mars?

02:09:07.150 --> 02:09:10.140
&gt;&gt; In a billion-- In a half
a billion years to be--

02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:15.830 position:56%
yeah, but what I want to say just to
comment to the question about the--

02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:18.750
when universe became habitable?

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:21.270
There is a paper written
by Mario Livio

02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:23.930
from Space Telescope
Science Institute, who--

02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:26.490
he did calculations of
production of carbon, oxygen,

02:09:26.490 --> 02:09:31.390
and nitrogen as a result of
the three alpha reactions,

02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:34.760
and then iron and more
heavy elements.

02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:37.470
So you need at least seven
billion years, so that's--

02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:40.740
so basically they're half--
we're half away through.

02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:44.520
The first half billion years, the
universe was completely stir out.

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:47.900
So we're lucky-- we're not
lucky, it's just probably

02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:51.960
that the right place to be here.

02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:54.150
So, just a clarification.

02:09:54.150 --> 02:09:56.930
The paper is there, I
can give a reference.

02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:58.230
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: OK.

02:09:58.230 --> 02:09:59.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:09:59.530 --> 02:10:00.830
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
All right, yes?

02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:02.450
&gt;&gt; My questions is for Sophia.

02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:05.430
We saw earlier with one of the
first questions in your talk

02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:07.220
that the way we talk about science

02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:09.450
and the way scientists
do experiments

02:10:09.450 --> 02:10:14.260 position:56%
to fit narratives can change how
those explorations are investigated,

02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:15.560
right?

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:16.860
So looking at synthetic--

02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:18.160
&gt;&gt;Sophia Roosth: How
do those investigated?

02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:20.960
&gt;&gt; So looking at synthetic life,
we can get something to work,

02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:24.510
so we simply it and then they get
to the model that we want, right?

02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:26.930
So during your ethnographic
investigation,

02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:29.420
you investigated synthetic
biologist, right?

02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:30.720
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roost: Yes.

02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:32.860
&gt;&gt; And so did you find any other
cultural or rhetorical biases

02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:35.790
that were similar to that?

02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:37.090
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: Many
although with the caveat

02:10:37.090 --> 02:10:39.640
that I wouldn't refer
to them as biases--

02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.940
&gt;&gt; Sure.

02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:42.240
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: --
sciences, cultural,

02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:43.540
and social all the way down.

02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:45.170
So of course whenever we look
at how scientists are thinking

02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:49.600
about the living world, you will
see aspects of society and culture.

02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:51.370
And then that's the
reasons why we have a field

02:10:51.370 --> 02:10:52.670
like the history of science.

02:10:52.670 --> 02:10:54.260
&gt;&gt; So more salient ones, I guess?

02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:55.560
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: Yes.

02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:59.700
So, there are number of things that
I identified throughout my years

02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:01.000
of ethnographic research.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.680
One of the things that I found
most intriguing was the ways

02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.930
in which something really simple
like biological relatedness, right,

02:11:07.930 --> 02:11:11.760
otherwise known as taxonomy,
has to be radically reconfigured

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:15.970
when it comes to talking about
microbes that bear genes that come

02:11:15.970 --> 02:11:17.650
from diverse organisms, right?

02:11:17.650 --> 02:11:19.110
So what is that?

02:11:19.110 --> 02:11:20.810
Where does that fit
on the tree of life?

02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:24.790
If it has-- you know, using
the examples that I talked

02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:29.860
about in like-- talked
earlier, genes from petunias

02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:31.830
or hyperthermophiles
or something else.

02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:34.520
And this was something
that was a live question

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.770
from any synthetic biologist in the
ways in which they discussed it,

02:11:37.770 --> 02:11:42.430
drooped on a lot of social
and cultural assumptions

02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:44.390
about how people are
related to one another,

02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:47.210
but also about what the
ground for how we would think

02:11:47.210 --> 02:11:49.990
about living relatedness
or even a category

02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:52.970
like species is defined over time.

02:11:52.970 --> 02:11:55.680 position:56%
And I think it lost count-- I read a
paper that said that there are more

02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:00.220
than 57 working definitions for
what is a species as of, I think,

02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:03.370
two years ago, that could be found
in the scientific literatures.

02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:05.290
So terms like that are
incredibly capacious,

02:12:05.290 --> 02:12:06.590
and I mean different
things depending

02:12:06.590 --> 02:12:08.560
on what sub-discipline
in you're from.

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:09.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:11.210
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: All right,

02:12:11.210 --> 02:12:13.860
we have time for one more
question, I'm afraid.

02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:19.490
And then we can have further
informal conversation during

02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:20.790
the reception.

02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:22.650
So, we'll give this one to you.

02:12:22.650 --> 02:12:25.130
Jake, I'm sorry but
we can grab your--

02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:28.690
grab the speakers over a
glass of wine, all right?

02:12:28.690 --> 02:12:29.990
Yes?

02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:33.230
&gt;&gt; Professor Roosth, you in your
talk, you quoted a scientist

02:12:33.230 --> 02:12:37.910
who said "I only understand
what I create."

02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:39.950
And, of course, I mean,
they thought what

02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:43.090
if you create something
you don't understand?

02:12:43.090 --> 02:12:47.400
And I like to take that,
and to Professor Grinspoon,

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:57.780
you have great optimism
about the sapient, zoic era.

02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:02.290
And, you know, when we think about
the vast explosion of knowledge

02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:07.290
that we've had in our lifetimes,
you know, I tend to be optimistic.

02:13:07.290 --> 02:13:11.190
But is progress a comfortable
disease?

02:13:11.190 --> 02:13:15.140
And we are at a point,
certainly we learned recently

02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:17.390
that man can induce earthquakes.

02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:21.830 position:56%
And so, are we perhaps entering into
a strangely world here and I just

02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:24.000
to open that up to anybody?

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.300
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon:
Well, it's interesting.

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:26.820
I love the two parts
of your question,

02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:29.010
because in the certain
sense, our problem right now,

02:13:29.010 --> 02:13:31.700
is that we created
something we don't understand

02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:34.360
with our global technological
civilization

02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.750
and its effect on the world.

02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:38.460
So there you go, Richard Feynman.

02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:44.510
But, you know, and I just want
to say, you know, you refer--

02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:46.800
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: Well,
what Feynman well wrote was

02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:50.190
"What I cannot create,
I do not understand."

02:13:50.190 --> 02:13:51.570
Which is a very different
kind of claim.

02:13:51.570 --> 02:13:55.420
This is about how making something
further is a more comprehensive

02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:57.500
and deep understanding of it.

02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:58.800
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Right.

02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:00.100
So then-- So that doesn't imply

02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:01.420
that everything we
create, we can understand.

02:14:01.420 --> 02:14:02.720
&gt;&gt; Sophia Roosth: Not at all.

02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:04.020
&gt;&gt; David Grinspoon: Yeah, OK.

02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.320
That's-- Thank you for
that clarification.

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:09.800
But, you know, in relation
to optimism,

02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:15.240
I just want to say,
it's complicated.

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.520
And, actually, part of my book I
have a whole taxonomy of pessimism

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:21.120
and a whole taxonomy of
optimism where I kind

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:24.250
of break that down a little bit.

02:14:24.250 --> 02:14:28.860
Because it's-- I don't see this
binary, although people tend to.

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:31.630
And I certainly don't want
to minimize the challenges

02:14:31.630 --> 02:14:34.950
of the next century or
couple of centuries.

02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:37.160
You know, they're huge.

02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:43.090
But I do think that with
climate change and so forth

02:14:43.090 --> 02:14:45.210
and the possible-- you know, the--

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:48.210
some of the bad scenarios
where you see a horizon a lot

02:14:48.210 --> 02:14:50.150
of displaced people and
refugees and all of that.

02:14:50.150 --> 02:14:53.170
We're talking about the
21st century possibly being

02:14:53.170 --> 02:14:55.960
as bad as the 20th century.

02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:01.590
Where if you think of the wars and
famines and the mass displacement

02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:04.290
and so forth, I mean-- you know,
we made through the 20th century

02:15:04.290 --> 02:15:05.590
so we think, "Oh, that
wasn't so bad."

02:15:05.590 --> 02:15:08.020
But it was for a lot
of people, right?

02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:11.860
And so, I think, you
know, climate wave is--

02:15:11.860 --> 02:15:16.140
climate change is this wave
that we're sailing into now.

02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:18.470
And we are going to--
there is another side.

02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:24.670
There will be a human race and
some sort of global society.

02:15:24.670 --> 02:15:27.770
So, it's not an either-- or people
tend to think of it as either/or.

02:15:27.770 --> 02:15:29.410
It's a trajectory.

02:15:29.410 --> 02:15:33.370
And, you know, human beings have
two ways of learning about things.

02:15:33.370 --> 02:15:35.820
There's the good-- to
simplify, there's the good way

02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:38.320
where we see what's
coming and we anticipate

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:39.860
and we take corrective maneuvers.

02:15:39.860 --> 02:15:42.010
We're not so good at
doing that collectively.

02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:48.660
And there's the bad way where
we react to calamity right?

02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:50.630
And it's going to be some
combination of the two.

02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:53.560
And so it's a complex
range of trajectories

02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.860
that we're going to navigate.

02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:56.160
And there is another side.

02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.820
And I think that even with
some of the bad scenarios,

02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:03.210
there's ultimately a
glorious future but not

02:16:03.210 --> 02:16:05.300
without some pain and casualty.

02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:09.250
So, I am, in a long time
scale, I'm optimistic but I--

02:16:09.250 --> 02:16:11.950
that's actually fairly qualified.

02:16:11.950 --> 02:16:15.620
&gt;&gt; Carl Zimmer: I would just add
that, I mean, one form of life

02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:18.500
that we haven't talked
about is artificial life.

02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:23.730
And so, you know, so there's
a case where you're trying

02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:26.150
to build something and,
you know, you're all--

02:16:26.150 --> 02:16:29.500
you're totally in control
as the scientist, you know,

02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:33.600
programming a computer to have like
virtual life forms inside of it.

02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:35.580
And, you know, there are
people at Michigan State

02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:40.010
who have developed a system called
Avida where they basically get--

02:16:40.010 --> 02:16:43.740
let the systems evolve-- basically
a little program to evolve

02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:46.280
and solve problems adding
numbers, doing math,

02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:47.790
doing all sorts of things.

02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:51.450
And, you know, it's
all deterministic.

02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:54.550 position:56%
You can see exactly what happened
and they followed all the principles

02:16:54.550 --> 02:16:58.050 position:56%
that you built in a sort of an
evolution happening in the computer.

02:16:58.050 --> 02:17:01.580
And then they get this thing that
works and then they tried to look

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.710
at it and understand how it works
and they don't understand it.

02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:09.090
They can't-- It doesn't look like
a computer program any human wrote.

02:17:09.090 --> 02:17:12.530
And they can't-- it's very hard
to figure out how it works.

02:17:12.530 --> 02:17:16.410
And so, I don't actually
think that being able

02:17:16.410 --> 02:17:19.800
to create something is a
guarantee of understanding it.

02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:25.750 position:56%
And, you know, maybe the future like
the machines will be replacing us,

02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:28.760
and if we program them with
evolutionary principles,

02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:32.540 position:56%
we have no idea how they're going to
be working a billion years from now.

02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.860
And then they could just go
off into space and not worried

02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:37.010
about the sun burning up, I guess.

to thank you all, once again,

02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:56.840
for participating and really
making it a very lively

02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:58.140
multidisciplinary day.

02:17:58.140 --> 02:17:59.440
I've had a great time.

02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:01.240
Thank you.

[ Applause ]

02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:11.470
&gt;&gt; Well, this was something.

02:18:11.470 --> 02:18:14.170
Today's symposium really
has given us a lot of rich

02:18:14.170 --> 02:18:16.190
and diverse food for thought.

02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:19.710
And if you're like me, you
probably want another opportunity

02:18:19.710 --> 02:18:22.260
to mold these things over and
think about them and hear some

02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:24.560
of the discussions again and listen

02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:25.980
to the questions and
the answers again.

02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:28.750
And fortunately, you'll have that
opportunity, because in about six

02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:31.660
to eight weeks, we hope,
this will be available.

02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:33.960
The programs were taped
today or recorded today

as well as the Kluge Center
website, loc.gov/kluge.

02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:44.570
So you will have another
chance to reflect

02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:46.070
and think about these things.

02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:49.330
