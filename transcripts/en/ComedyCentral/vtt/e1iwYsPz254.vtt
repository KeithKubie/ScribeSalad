00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.803
Let's talk sitcoms.

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:06.572
It's short
for "situational communism,"

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:11.377
and a major tool of Hollywood's
liberal brain-washing machine.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.280
Like how Jerry Seinfeld wants us
to hate the Soup Nazi,

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:15.548
when we know for a fact

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:18.785
there were good soup people
on both soup sides.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.853
But this week,
we real Americans

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:22.989
had a major win
in the sitcom world

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.492
with the premiere
of a newly rebooted Roseanne.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:29.195
Now, Roseanne, a show
about a blue-collar Trump voter

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.597
who battles with her Antifa,
Soros-funded,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.400
abortion-crazed,
Clintonista sister.

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.335
I assume. I didn't watch it.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:38.237
Uh, but America did.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.374
In fact, 18 million viewers
tuned in on Tuesday night,

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.409
and it's all
anybody can talk about.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.979
"Anybody" being
everybody on Fox News.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:49.549 line:0%
The Roseanne reboot generated
an enormous rating.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.151 line:0%
18 million Americans
watched the show last night.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:55.121 line:0%
Funny what can happen when
Hollywood makes programming

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:58.791 line:0%
that's not condescending
toward half the country.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:01.861 line:0%
Sorry, Stormy, this other Trump
woman trounced your interview

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.596 line:0%
in the key demo.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.032 line:0%
This thing exploded, and it
exploded because it's a safe,

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.533 line:0%
fun place for people

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.268 line:0%
 to have
 a political discussion...

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.370
Yeah. Yes, safe places.
Finally!

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.706
A place where you can go
to be sheltered

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.943
from liberal snowflakes
demanding their safe spaces.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.378
And conservatives
can relate to Roseanne.

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:22.181
In real life, she's
a down-to-earth Trump supporter.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.816
She gets Middle America.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.019
She's even a farmer-- or, more
specifically, the humble owner

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:31.124
of a million-dollar macadamia
nut plantation in Hawaii.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.793
She's the salted nuts
of the earth.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.529
Now, I've always said
representation matters,

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.598
and finally,
Trump voters have it.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.867
 Roseanne is our Black Panther.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.136
(laughter)

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.639
And our Wakanda
is Lanford, Illinois.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.474
But while Wakanda's economy

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.510
is based around
futuristic technology,

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.979
Lanford's economy
is based around a Sam's Club

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:56.549
at a shuttered Sears
where squirrels have sex.

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:59.585
See, Wakanda fans get to do
that cool "X" thing,

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.455
but Lanford fans get to do this.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:03.890
Yeah.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.658
Way cooler.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.693
So, you hear that?
What's that noise?

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:09.228
I'll tell you what it is.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.997
It's the million UGG boots
of Hollywood

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.033
stampeding to replicate
 Roseanne's success.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.402
And leading the charge
are chief opportunists,

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.504
Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.873
-Welcome, guys. -Thank you.
-(cheering, applause)

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.608
Thank you.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.111 line:0%
Jordan, this opens
a huge lane for us.

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:27.113 line:0%
It's so nice to see
familiar TV faces

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.115 line:0%
a little bit older,
a little bit wiser,

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.117 line:0%
and a little bit more
reflecting back

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.952 line:0%
exactly what I believe at me.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.588
We want Hollywood to know
that we are full of ideas

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.823
for hot reboots that are
topical, political,

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.425
topical and right-leaning.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.594
Yeah, uh, NBC
could bring back Seinfeld.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.363
Exactly. But Jerry and George
moved away,

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:46.866
and Elaine is married
and Christian and quiet.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.869
Yeah, right. So now
most of the show is just Kramer

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.171
improvising slurs
to people on the street.

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:56.209
Yeah. Oh, I would love to see
 Perfect Strangers come back.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.844
Yeah. But it's all
about cousin Larry now,

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:01.013
because Balki's been deported.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:03.149
-So much better.
-Mm-hmm.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.953
Okay. The Jeffersons, only this
time they're moving on down.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:10.489
Yeah. They're just
a lot more comfortable there.

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:12.792
-Yeah, they fit in.
-Ooh, okay, The Cosby Show.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.360
-Mm.
-It's the same show.

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.996
We just know what we know now.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.497
(laughter)

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.867
Okay. So now I'm just,
I'm spitballing.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.869
How about 
 Malcolm Right of Center?

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:25.738
Oh, or Fake News Radio.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.673
 Alternative Facts of Life.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:30.610
Ideally, we could get Kellyanne
Conway to star, fingers crossed.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.311
Ooh, or-or Louie.

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:35.047
It's the same show--
we just know what we know now.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.682
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:40.586
 Clarissa Has Things Explained
 to Her by Her Male Boss.

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.955
The premise alone is crazy--
a woman with a job.

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.992
Yeah. Okay, how about 
 Buffy the Liberal Slayer?

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.060
You know,
 Angel we can leave alone.

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.595
 -Angel is perfect.
-Perfect.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:51.931
David Spade could do
 Just Shoot Them

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.833
as a stand-your-ground show.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:57.003
Ooh, or Boy Meets World,
 Rejects World, Builds Wall.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.305
Yeah. Abstinence in the City.

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:01.307
Imagine the fancy mocktails.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.775
Ooh. Alf.

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:05.311
It's the same show--
we just know what we know now.

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:07.113
-Yeah.
-But, uh...

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:08.614
what do we know now?

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.183
Oh, Jordan, just wait--
that one's coming, and it's

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:13.486
gonna make Harvey Weinstein look
like Mister Rogers.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.388
Geez. I got to tell you,
I love this.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.123
because right now
the right has nothing,

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.125
but once we're dominant
in popular culture,

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.526
other media doors will open.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.728
We can get a news channel
that caters to us,

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.163
then we can mobilize the voters

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.865
and take control
of state houses,

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.000
then before you know it, most
governors will be Republicans,

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.202
and then we can work
to take control of congress

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:33.105
-and even the executive branch.
-Yeah. Someday, Jordan.

00:04:33.138 --> 00:04:34.740
-Yeah, someday.
-Yeah.

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:36.842
Thanks, guys.
Go make Hollywood great again.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:38.477
-All right.
-Josh and Aaron.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.613
(cheering, applause)

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:43.883
Opposition...
you could feel it.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:47.219
You could feel it--
the future looks bright.

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:49.588
And very similar to 1988.

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:52.925
Uh, Roseanne's success is
clearly the most important story

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.226
of the week.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.228
It's why the president
of the United States

00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.998
personally called Roseanne
to congratulate her

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:01.267
on her huge ratings win.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.569
And he should, game knows game.

00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:06.706
But of course, the left
has its priorities flipped.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:09.275
It wants Trump to address
more pressing issues,

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:10.910
like the March For Our Lives,

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.479
the high number of porn stars
currently suing him,

00:05:13.512 --> 00:05:16.515
whether we should have a NASA.

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:19.652
And then there's
the recent police shooting

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:22.755
of an unarmed 22-year-old
black man, Stephon Clark,

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:25.257
who was shot multiple times
in his grandmother's backyard

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.259
while holding a cell phone.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:28.694
But there's a very good reason

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:31.130
why Trump's not talking
about that.

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:35.468 line:0%
Uh, this is something that is a,
uh, local matter,

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.303 line:0%
and that's something
that we feel should be left up

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.004 line:0%
to the local authorities
at this point in time.

00:05:39.037 --> 00:05:40.673
Exactly, exactly.

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.742
Just leave it
to the local authorities.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.510
The police are the best people

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:47.613
to deal with this particular
police shooting.

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:49.749
They were there.

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:52.551
It's like they're always there.

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:54.220
And what the left doesn't get,

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.122
is that President Trump
called Roseanne

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:58.257
because she had huge ratings.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.260
This police shooting
just didn't make enough noise.

00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:04.530
Probably because the cops
had muted their body cameras.

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:08.200
So let's leave this local story
to the local authorities.

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:10.436
The president
has television to watch.
