00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.280
Magic moments happen when
your app does something so

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.140
that your user won't have to, like
figuring out their location for them, so

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.080
they don't have to type on
that tiny little keyboard.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.850
In Sunshine we ask the user for
their location, but

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.820
the Google Maps platform provides
location services that could

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.450
allow us to get
a location automatically.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.540
The Places API was released
earlier this year and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.210
includes a variety of
helpful location services.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.970
For example,
the auto complete API offers your

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.380
users the power of
predictive auto complete for

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.330
places with a user experience
similar to the Google search box.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.250
You can also get the user's current
location, get a place by ID and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.750
even add a place to
the Google Places database.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
But for Sunshine, we're going to use the
Place Picker because it provides a UI

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.540
dialogue that displays an interactive
map, and a list of nearby places,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.620
from geographical addresses
to local businesses.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.560
Users can then choose a place
that is passed back to your app.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.920
You could always develop your
own location widget, but

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.320
there are several advantages
to using the Place Picker.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.800
First and foremost, the user experience
will be consistent with other apps using

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.300
the Place Picker, including both
Google apps and third-party ones.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.270
This means your users will likely
already know how to interact

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.560
with this widget.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.120
Second, accessibility is built in, and

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.390
you should already know
how important that is.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.670
But finally,
it saves you development time so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.000
that you can focus your efforts on
the features you care the most about.
