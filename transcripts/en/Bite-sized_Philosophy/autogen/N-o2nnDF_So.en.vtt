the manifestation of a judgmental ideal
 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.140
the manifestation of a judgmental ideal
and then it's only in establishing the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150
and then it's only in establishing the
 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.970
and then it's only in establishing the
relationship with the actual woman that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980
relationship with the actual woman that
 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.740
relationship with the actual woman that
they could start differentiating between

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750
they could start differentiating between
 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.290
they could start differentiating between
the judgmental ideal and the actual

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
the judgmental ideal and the actual
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.630
the judgmental ideal and the actual
individual woman and that also requires

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
individual woman and that also requires
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.680
individual woman and that also requires
the sacrifice and the sacrifice is you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690
the sacrifice and the sacrifice is you
 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.490
the sacrifice and the sacrifice is you
never can have an ideal woman so to have

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
never can have an ideal woman so to have
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.350
never can have an ideal woman so to have
a relationship with any woman you have

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
a relationship with any woman you have
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.450
a relationship with any woman you have
to sacrifice the relationship with the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460
to sacrifice the relationship with the
 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.920
to sacrifice the relationship with the
ideal woman and you have to see the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
ideal woman and you have to see the
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.000
ideal woman and you have to see the
individual woman and separate her from

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010
individual woman and separate her from
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.430
individual woman and separate her from
the ideal and that's the same thing that

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
the ideal and that's the same thing that
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.260
the ideal and that's the same thing that
happens to the hero in Sleeping Beauty

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270
happens to the hero in Sleeping Beauty
 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.150

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
actually turns into the dragon of chaos
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.430
actually turns into the dragon of chaos
and it's not until he can he can defeat

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440
and it's not until he can he can defeat
 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.160
and it's not until he can he can defeat
her that he can establish a relationship

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
her that he can establish a relationship
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.260
her that he can establish a relationship
with the actual princess and that's

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270
with the actual princess and that's
 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.080
with the actual princess and that's
