00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.570
When we first started learning
about fractions or rational

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.600
numbers, we learned about the
idea of putting things in

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.790
lowest terms. So if we saw
something like 3, 6, we knew

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.490
that 3 and 6 share
a common factor.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.940
We know that the numerator,
well, 3 is just 3, but that 6

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.250
could be written as 2 times 3.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.650
And since they share a common
factor, the 3 in this case, we

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.920
could divide the numerator by 3
and the denominator by 3, or

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.330
we could say that this
is just 3/3, and they

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.480
would cancel out.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.880
And in lowest terms, this
fraction would be 1/2.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.050
Or just to kind of hit the point
home, if we had 8/24,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.270
once again, we know that this is
the same thing as 8 over 3

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.380
times 8, or this is the
same thing as 1 over 3

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.240
times 8 over 8.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.090
The 8's cancel out and we get
this in lowest terms as 1/3.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.470
The same exact idea applies
to rational expressions.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.790
These are rational numbers.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.090
Rational expressions are
essentially the same thing,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.360
but instead of the numerator
being an actual number and the

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.980
denominator be an actual number,
they're expressions

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.670
involving variables.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.200
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:37.030
Let's say that I had 9x plus
3 over 12x plus 4.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.100
Now, this numerator up here,
we can factor it.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.950
We can factor out a 3.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.420
This is equal to 3
times 3x plus 1.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.590
That's what our numerator
is equal to.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.720
And our denominator, we
can factor out a 4.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.380
This is the same thing
as 4 times 3x.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.710
12 divided by 4 is 3.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.760
12x over 4 is 3x.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.380
Plus 4 divided by 4 is 1.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.810
So here, just like there, the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.620
have a common factor.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.370
In this case, it's 3x plus 1.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.220
In this case, it's a variable
expression.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.870
It's not an actual number,
but we can do

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.440
the exact same thing.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.150
They cancel out.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.160
So if we were to write this
rational expression in lowest

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.260
terms, we could say that
this is equal to 3/4.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.230
Let's do another one.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.020
Let's say that we had
x squared-- let

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.740
me see a good one.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:53.820
So let's say we had x squared
minus 9 over 5x plus 15.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.230
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.875
So the numerator
we can factor.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:02.210
It's a difference of squares.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.750
We have x plus 3 times
x minus 3.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.210
And in the denominator we
can factor a 5 out.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.680
This is 5 times x plus 3.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.360
So once again, a common factor
in the numerator and in the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.970
denonminator, we can
cancel them out.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.070
But we touched on this a
couple of videos ago.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.750
We have to be very careful.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.010
We can cancel them out.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.230
We can say that this is going to
be equal to x minus 3 over

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.240
5, but we have to exclude the
values of x that would have

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.620
made this denominator equal to
0, that would have made the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.170
entire expression undefined.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.730
So we could write this as being
equal to x minus 3 over

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.880
5, but x cannot be equal
to negative 3.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.190
Negative 3 would make this zero
or would make this whole

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.340
thing zero.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.200
So this and this whole
thing are equivalent.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.970
This is not equivalent to this
right here, because this is

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.630
defined that x is equal to
negative 3, while this isn't

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.590
defined that x is equal
to negative 3.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.540
So to make them the same, I
also have to add the extra

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.680
condition that x cannot
equal negative 3.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.990
So likewise, over here, if this
was a function, let's say

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.840
we wrote y is equal to 9x plus
3 over 12x plus 4 and we

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.360
wanted to graph it, when we
simplify it, the temptation is

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.230
oh, well, we factored out a 3x
plus 1 in the numerator and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.960
the denonminator.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.960
They cancel out.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.030
The temptation is to say, well,
this is the same graph

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.840
as y is equal to the constant
3/4, which is just a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.010
horizontal line at y
is equal to 3/4.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.760
But we have to add
one condition.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.080
We have to eliminate-- we have
to exclude the x-values that

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.110
would have made this thing right
here equal to zero, and

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.660
that would have been zero if
x is equal to negative 1/3.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.930
If x is equal to negative 1/3,
this or this denominator would

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.140
be equal to zero.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.650
So even over here, we'd have
to say x cannot be equal to

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.260
negative 1/3.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:14.100
That condition is what really
makes that equal to that, that

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.830
x cannot be equal
to negative 1/3.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.330
Let's do a couple
more of these.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.770
And I'll do these in pink.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:35.380
Let's say that I had x squared
plus 6x plus 8 over x

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.830
squared plus 4x.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.460
Or actually, even better, let
me do this a little bit. x

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:52.220
squared plus 6x plus 5 over
x squared minus x minus 2.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.540
So once again, we want to factor
the numerator and the

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.640
denonminator, just like we did
with traditional numbers when

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.380
we first learned about fractions
and lowest terms. So

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.330
if we factor the numerator,
what two numbers when I

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.980
multiply them equal 5 and
I add them equal 6?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.370
Well, the numbers that pop
in my head are 5 and 1.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.960
So the numerator is x plus
5 times x minus 1.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.280
And then our denonminator,
two numbers.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.940
Multiply negative 2,
add a negative 1.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.830
Negative 2 and positive
1 pop out of my head.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.210
So this is a positive
1, right? x plus 5

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.050
times x plus 1, right?

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.600
1 times 5 is 5.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.250
5x plus 1x is 6x.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.410
So here we have a positive
1 and a negative 2.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.635
So x minus 2 times x plus 1.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.970
So we have a common factor
in the numerator and the

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.350
denonminator.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.820
These cancel out.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.120
So you could say that this
is equal to x plus 5

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.940
over x minus 2.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.630
But for them to really
be equal, we

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.950
have to add the condition.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.970
We have to add the condition
that x cannot be equal to

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.025
negative 1 because
if x is equal to

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:09.910
negative 1, this is undefined.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.390
We have to add that condition
because this by itself is

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.940
defined at x is equal
to negative 1.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.250
You could put negative
1 here and you're

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.360
going to get a number.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.350
But this is not defined at x is
equal to negative 1, so we

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.820
have to add this condition
for this to

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.710
truly be equal to that.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.090
Let's do a harder one here.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:40.810
Let's say we have 3x squared
plus 3x minus 18, all of that

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:49.390
over 2x squared plus
5x minus 3.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.840
So it's always a little bit more
painful to factor things

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.490
that have a non-one coefficient
out here, but

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.500
we've learned how to do that.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.155
We can do it by grouping, and
this is a good practice for

00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:01.980
our grouping, so let's do it.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.500
So remember, let's factor 3x
squared plus 3x minus 18.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.840
So you need to think
of two numbers.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.010
This is just a review
of grouping.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.310
You need to think of two numbers
that when we multiply

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.330
them are equal to 3 times
negative 18, or it's equal to

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.990
negative 54, right?

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.920
That's 3 times negative 18.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.960
And when we add them, a plus
b, needs to be equal to 3x

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.930
because we're going to split up
the 3x into an ax and a bx.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.929
Or even better, not
3x, equal to 3.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.620
So what two numbers
could there be?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.100
Let's see, our times tables.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.280
Let's see, they are
three apart.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.510
One's going to have to be
positive and one's negative.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.940
9 times 6 is 54.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.650
If we make the 9 positive
and we make the b

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.970
negative 6, it works.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.770
9 minus 6 is 3.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.520
9 times negative 6
is negative 54.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.620
So we can rewrite
this up here.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.050
We can rewrite this as 3x
squared, and I'm going to say

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:11.900
plus 9x minus 6x minus 18.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.300
Notice, all I did here
is I split this 3x

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.200
into a 9x minus 6x.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.610
The only difference between
this expression and this

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.910
expression is that I split the
3x into a 9x minus 6x.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.670
You add these two together,
you get 3x.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.360
The way I wrote it right here
you can actually ignore the

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.460
parentheses.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.350
And the whole reason why I did
that is so I can now group it.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.510
And normally, I decide which
term goes with which based on

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.920
what's positive or negative or
which has common factors.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.430
They both have a common
factor with 3.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.150
Actually, it probably wouldn't
matter in this situation, but

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.920
I like the 9 on this side
because they're both positive.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.400
So let's factor out
a 3x out of this

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.280
expression on the left.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.780
If we factor out a 3x out of
this expression this becomes

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.920
3x times x plus 3.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.140
And then on this expression, if
we factor out a negative 6,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.260
we get negative 6
times x plus 3.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.640
And now this is very clear our
grouping was successful.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.990
This is the same thing as-- we
can kind of undistribute this

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:29.260
as 3x minus 6 times x plus 3.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.580
If we were to multiply this
times each of these terms, you

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.120
get that right there.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.950
So the top term, we can rewrite
it as 3x minus 6-- let

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.012
me do it in the same color.

00:10:45.012 --> 00:10:52.720
So we can rewrite it as 3x
minus 6 times x plus 3.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.750
That's this term right here.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.920
I don't want to make it look
like a negative sign.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.350
That's that term right there.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.000
Now let's factor this bottom
part over here.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.210
Scroll to the left
a little bit.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:09.600
So if I want to factor 2x
squared plus 5x plus 3, I need

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.410
to think of two numbers that
when I take their product, I

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.630
get 2 times 3, which is equal
to 6, and they need to

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.840
add up to be 5.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.110
And the two obvious numbers
here are 2 and 3.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:32.900
I can rewrite this up here as
2x squared plus 2x plus 3x

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.290
plus 3, just like that.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.050
And then if I put parentheses
over here, and I decided to

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.220
group the 2 with the 2 because
they have a common factor of

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.930
2, and I grouped the 3 with
the 3 because they have a

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.200
common factor of 3.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.000
This right here is 2 and a 3.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.270
So here we can factor
out a 2x.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:58.870
If you factor out a 2x, you get
2x times x plus 1 plus--

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.880
you factor out a 3 here--
plus 3 times x plus 1.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.950
And our grouping
was successful.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.110
This is clearly-- let me switch
colors-- this is the

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:16.325
same thing as 2x plus
3 times x plus 1.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.990
So here we've been able
to factor it as well.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:30.940
We were able to factor out
the denominator as well.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.340
Actually, I just realized
that I made a mistake.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.540
I wrote here minus 3.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.040
I wrote a plus 3 over here.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.085
Let me backtrack this.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.320
That would have been
a horrible mistake.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.330
I would have had to
redo the video.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.670
Let me clear all of this, all
of this business over here.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.220
Let me clear that.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:13:00.150
This is 2x squared
plus 5x minus 3.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:05.830
So once again, a times b needs
to be equal to negative 3

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.330
times 2, which is negative 6.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.960
And a plus b needs
to be equal to 5.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.430
So in this situation, it looks
like if we went with 6 and

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.680
negative 1, that seems to
be a better situation.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.830
6 minus 1 is 5.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.800
6 times negative 1
is negative 6.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.890
So that would have been
a horrible mistake.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:34.790
So we can rewrite this up here
as 2x squared, and I'll group

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.800
the 6 with the 2x squared
because they

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.880
share a common factor.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:46.190
So plus 6x minus x, this is the
same thing as 5x minus 3.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.200
I just had to find the numbers
to split this 5x into.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.190
But 6x minus x is 5x.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.420
And if I put some parentheses
here, I can factor out of 2x

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.530
out of this first term.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.780
I get 2x times x plus 3.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.870
And here I can factor out
a negative 1, so minus 1

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.540
times x plus 3.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.330
And then our grouping
was successful.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:18.880
We get 2-- let me do this in a
different color-- we get 2x

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:25.590
minus 1 times x plus 3.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:37.720
So our denominator here
is equal to 2x minus 1

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.750
times x plus 3.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.080
And once again, we have a common
factor in our numerator

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.200
and our denonminator,
the x plus 3.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.550
But we have to add the condition
that x cannot be

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.880
equal to negative 3, because
that would make this whole

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.670
thing equal to zero.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.810
Or not equal to zero, it would
make us divide by zero, which

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.020
is undefined.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.960
So we have to say that x cannot
be equal to negative 3.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:09.850
So this expression up here is
the same thing as 3x minus 6

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.560
over 2x minus 1, granted that we
also imposed the condition

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.750
that x does not equal
negative 3.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.220
Hopefully, you found
that interesting.
