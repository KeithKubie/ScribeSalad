If it takes you slightly more than a 30th of a second, and the monitor updates

00:00:04.468 --> 00:00:08.626
at 60 frames per second, this means you'll miss 2 frame updates and be able to

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:15.211
update only every third frame. 60 divided by 3 is 20, so 20 is the answer. I'm

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.916
fine with either using logic or experimentation to figure this out by the way,

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:21.093
but logic gives you a deeper understanding.
