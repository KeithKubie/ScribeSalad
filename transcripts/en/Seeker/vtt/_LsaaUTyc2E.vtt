00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.810
A new study finds that emotional abuse is
just as harmful as physical or sexual abuse

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.509
- so why is no one talking about this?

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:18.230
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and anyone
who’s not a complete monster knows just

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.770
what kind of scars sexual and physical abuse
can leave on a child.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.580
But something that’s rarely, if ever talked
about - is psychological abuse.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.099
There are no laws against it, no billboards
on the side of the highway.

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.160
And yet the American Academy of Pediatrics
says it’s “the most challenging and prevalent

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.200
form of child abuse and neglect.”

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.250
So why aren’t we addressing this issue with
the same fervency we give to other more, visible

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.250
kinds of abuse?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.400
Well, part of that may be a simple lack of
awareness.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.230
Until now, most of the studies on this subject,
have specifically looked at the long-term

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.680
effects of sexual or physical abuse.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.500
But according to a new study, children who
are emotionally abused or neglected can develop

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.270
similar and sometimes even worse mental health
problems than kids who are sexually or physically

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.270
abused.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.530
For this study, researchers analyzed data
from 5,616 children with lifetime histories

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.159
of physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological
maltreatment, or a combination thereof.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.920
Maltreatment in this case was defined as either
abuse or neglect inflicted by a caretaker

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.100
- so things like bullying, threats, severe
insults, isolation, etc.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.090
What they found, is that a staggering number
of children - 62% - had a history of psychological

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.460
maltreatment, and 24% of the cases they studied,
were exclusively related to psychological

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.460
maltreatment.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.460
They also found that children who were victims
of psychological maltreatment, suffered from

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.909
anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, post-traumatic
stress disorder, and suicidal tendencies - at

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.289
the same rate - and in some cases, an even
greater rate - than children who were physically

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.729
or sexually abused.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.770
Especially worrisome, is the fact that of
the three kinds of abuse, psychological maltreatment

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.450
specifically has the highest association with
depression, anxiety, attachment issues, and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.450
substance abuse.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.869
So clearly, this is not an issue we should
just be brushing off.

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.550
According to the US Children’s Bureau, nearly
3 million U.S. children experience some form

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.470
of maltreatment every year.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.640
But as the lead author of this study, Joseph
Spinazzola, points out - there are no physical

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.250
wounds associated with psychological abuse.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.390
So child protective case workers have a particularly
hard time recognizing it.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.850
He also brings up the point that emotional
abuse just doesn’t carry the same social

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.340
taboo as physical or sexual abuse, even though
it’s equally, if not more, damaging to a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.640
child’s mental health.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.920
As such, our primary goal, he says, should
be to implement more public awareness initiatives

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.920
to “help people understand just how harmful
psychological maltreatment is for children

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.030
and adolescents.”

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.070
While we’re on the topic of children, I
wanna remind all of you guys watching this,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.210
that I host another show here at Discovery
called TestTube - that’s a lot like Dnews,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.010
but more geared towards current events.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.600
Yesterday I did an episode on the secret pro-life
agenda of Crisis Pregnancy Centers[a], and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.010
how many of them have been deliberately misleading
women with false information and facts about

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.010
abortions.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:23.290
