00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.130
Many companies today have made deep
learning a central part of their

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.580
machine learning toolkit.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.090
Facebook, Baidu, Microsoft, and Google
are all using deep learning in their

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.670
products and
pushing their research forward.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.510
It's easy to understand why.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.350
Deep learning shines wherever
there is lots of data and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.070
complex problems to solve.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.890
And all these companies are facing
lots of complicated problems,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.850
like understanding what's in
an image to help you find it, or

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.900
translating a document into another
language that you can speak.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.140
In this class,
we'll explore a continuum of complexity,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.290
from very simple models to very large
ones that you'll still be able to train

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.160
in minutes on your personal computer
to do very elaborate tasks.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.690
Like predicting the meaning of words or
classifying images.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.730
One of the nice things about deep
learning is that it's really a family of

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.330
techniques that adapts to all sorts
of data and all sorts of problems,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.680
all using a common infrastructure and
a common language to describe things.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.920
When I began working
in machine learning,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.330
I was doing research
on speech recognition.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.900
Whenever I met someone
working on computer vision or

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.440
natural language processing, we had
very little in common to talk about.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.400
We used different acronyms,
different techniques, and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760
collaboration was
pretty much impossible.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.520
Deep learning really changed that.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.470
The basic things that you will learn
in this class are applicable to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.450
almost everything, and will give you
a foundation that you can apply to many,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.230
many different fields.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.010
You'll be part of a fast growing
community of researchers, engineers, and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.530
data scientists who share a common,
very powerful set of tools.
