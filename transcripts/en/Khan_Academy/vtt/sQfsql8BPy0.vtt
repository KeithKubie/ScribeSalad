00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.980
We're asked to rotate the line
segment negative 90 degrees

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.160
around the origin.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.440
So this is our line segment.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.080
We want to rotate it
around the origin.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.160
So let's use our Rotate tool.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.790
So let's define our
point of rotation.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.540
So we're going to
rotate around the origin

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.140
so that's why I put it there.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.847
And I'm going to rotate
it negative 90 degrees.

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:20.680
So I'm going to rotate
it in this direction.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.240
So let's see if I
can pull this off.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.330
So actually, let me
undo what I just did.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750
Let me get my Rotate
tool back here.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.780
So negative 90 degrees.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.530
So these arrows right
over here, right now

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.410
they're straddling the x-axis.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.700
If I rotate negative 90
degrees, these arrows,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.140
this double-headed, curvy
arrow should exactly

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.430
straddle the negative y-axis.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.350
So let's make sure I do that.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.150
So this is the negative y-axis.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.250
There we go.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.390
So I have rotated this line
segment negative 90 degrees

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.509
about the origin.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:55.300
And now we've got to
answer some questions.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.170
When a line segment is rotated,
the image created is a, well,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.600
it's, of course, a line segment.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.640
We know this is true because
the rotated image has two end

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.390
points.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.387
The rotated image is the same
length as the original image.

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:10.970
We haven't changed
the length of this,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.930
we just rotated it
around this dot.
