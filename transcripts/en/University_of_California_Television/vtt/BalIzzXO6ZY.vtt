00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:08.181
(piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.380
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical eight.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.933
Bipedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.630
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.820
Aware that death is inevitable

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:30.883
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.253
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.273
we empathize, and deceive.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.410
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.693
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.183
Carta brings together experts

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:51.690
from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.703
on who we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.960
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.693
of humans like you.

00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:24.318
(new age music)

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.260
- Pretty extraordinary kind of range

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.080
of work that I think we've seen

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:49.006
and in the way in which

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.630
these ideas kind of layer onto each other.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.730
You know I think it was really incredible

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.370
when we were seeing the Kennis brothers

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.840
and you know...

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:01.760
You start to hear the kinds of,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.440
the depth and complexity that is brought

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.480
to the idea of how you could go about

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.370
building a reconstruction

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.351
and you recognize that they are not only

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.450
kind of just looking at trying to come up

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.370
with a certain kind of physical fidelity

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.500
based on best practices

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.280
but that involves the development

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.530
and thinking about all
the other kind of factors

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.670
that would go into you know

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.670
what an early human or
other kind of hominid life

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.850
might actually consist of

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.380
and then how the kind
of aesthetic criteria

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.070
goes into creating
something that can actually

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.723
engage our imagination as we look at it.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.703
And in all the work that I
think we've heard about today,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.870
recognizing the necessity to be able

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.870
to think actually very
broadly across disciplines

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:07.050
such that you know
taking on a question like

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.450
you know the human origins,
you might come at it

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.460
from a disciplinary expertise

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.170
but because you're entering into such

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.070
unknown territory, you know the vectors

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.070
that you try to connect that are beyond

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.150
the specifics that you
bring to the question

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.280
are the ones that possibly lead you

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.920
to new kinds of answers about it.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.440
And so I hope everybody, people have been

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.330
filling out the questionnaires

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.900
and handing them to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.440
to the edges of the
aisles where our trusty

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.260
helpers here are kind of gathering them

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.819
and now I think we're
gonna do some Q and A

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.269
and so Allyson's gonna start.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.860
- Alright, I've been collecting

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.510
the questions for the first part and...

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.483
So the first question is for Caren.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.380
So the question is how do you feel about

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.110
pressure on teachers in
elementary school grades,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.090
K, transitional K fours to eliminate

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.783
playing class and emphasize academics.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.623
I think you have to come here.

00:04:29.813 --> 00:04:32.140
- Hi, good question, right?

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.180
So this is very much a
question that's being posed

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.410
to developmental psychologists
today all the time, right.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.492
There's all these new sort
of academic pressures,

00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:42.040
things are sort of getting
pushed earlier and earlier,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.520
there's less and less time for sort of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.410
free and exploratory activities,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.883
much more time spent on test preparation.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.620
I don't think that anyone would say

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.890
that this is a good idea per se.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.160
I mean I think that what we have seen

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.470
is that at least in the early school years

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.440
so in preschool in particular.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.620
Preschools have completely adopted

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.760
a play focused emphasis.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.760
To you this probably
seems totally natural now

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.466
because this is just the
way that we live our lives,

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:12.090
we just assume that play
is precisely the work

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.320
of this early childhood
and I think that now

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.950
with the sort of new
science that's coming out

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.860
showing that playful learning
actually might continue

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.000
right to have these sorts of benefits

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.260
and even later on,
there's pressure being put

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:24.650
on the education system to sort of combat

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.790
the direction that we've gone in

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.050
which is the sort of college preparation

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.400
that starts even as early as first grade

00:05:32.282 --> 00:05:33.907
so it's bad.

00:05:33.907 --> 00:05:35.490
(laughter)

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.270
But it's hard, right, it's
a really difficult problem

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.507
and I do think that right now

00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:40.996
it's part of the conversation and so it's

00:05:40.996 --> 00:05:42.583
certainly going to be adjusting.

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:44.033
- I have another one for you.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.680
So you said evidence of imagination

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.820
can be seen as soon as infants can speak.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.010
Does neo natal imitation suggest

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.143
that newborns imagine the
existence of other people.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.833
- Sorry.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.060
Neo natal imitation does it suggest

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.163
that they're imagining other people,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.940
I don't have an answer to that question.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.940
I don't know, I can't even
speculate on that question

00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:17.630
in fact, I'm not sure.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.780
So I think that generally what we think of

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.870
as neo natal movements right

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.425
there's an interaction
between touch sensation

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:29.090
from the mother and neo natal movement

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.760
also to sound right, and other kinds

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.010
of sensory inputs so
they're reacting, right

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.630
in many ways to their tactile
and sensory environment

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.180
but I don't think that we can speculate

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.080
about imagination.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.350
We know that neonates learn right

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.610
so they can be exposed to
particular kinds of sounds

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.150
for example in utero and afterwards

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.430
show signs of recognizing those sounds

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.810
in various learning contacts

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.480
there's some really
interesting and ingenious

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.740
ways of testing this, they also recognize

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.620
the smell of fluids that were
taken from the mother as well

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.850
and so there's recognition
and there's learning

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.410
that happens neonatally but I don't know

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.923
I can't comment on imagination.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.110
- So I'll just take
advantage that you are here,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.070
I'll ask you another one.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.807
How does a child
counterfactual cognition change

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.423
as he or she acquires language?

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.910
- How does counterfactual cognition change

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.295
as they acquire language, right.

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:36.100
So, it makes sense right that being able

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.410
to think about alternative possibilities

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.830
should be influenced by
having abstract concepts

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.401
and language gives us
those abstract concepts

00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:45.884
so as we acquire more
rich and complex language

00:07:45.884 --> 00:07:48.200
we're also able to think of more

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.100
rich and complex kinds
of narratives, right

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.420
and so this in part probably explains

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.460
some of the developmental
changes that we see

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.030
from very very early sort
of proto kinds of pretense

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.980
which is mostly just substitute
one object for another

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.370
to the very elaborate kinds
of pretense that we see

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.510
in middle childhood and adolescence

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.390
where they're developing these societies

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.920
that have their own system of governance

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.600
and rules and food and clothing

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.370
I mean it's really
amazing the work out there

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.170
sort of documenting middle childhood

00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:18.220
and the kinds of
paracosms that they create

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.793
and those things are dependent of course

00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:22.410
on a more mature language
and so it seems to me

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.932
that there's a relationship there.

00:08:24.932 --> 00:08:26.690
- Okay, I think that's all for you.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.920
- Okay, thank you guys so much.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.020
- Sheldon.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.270
(applause)

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.743
So I have a couple for Sheldon.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.373
Why do people have different
levels of imagination?

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.210
- Well you know there's certainly a lot

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.040
that might have that is attributable

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.040
to the cultural and social
upbringing and pressures.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.750
Whether or not there're underlying
neurological differences

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.750
that's maybe too murky
a thing that we haven't

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.880
been able to explore yet

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.640
but you know so in a lot
of educational theory

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:20.380
that educational theories
are changing always

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.610
and evolving and culturally you see

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.820
these differences where some children

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.700
are encouraged to imagine more

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.210
and for longer periods of time

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.640
and in other cultures you know it's like

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.420
childhood's over, get to work, you know

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.620
kind of attitudes

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.970
and so some of this
kind of spills over into

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.380
life in general as it's lived in adulthood

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.930
but even in those cases
you certainly always

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.360
have a kind of counter, you know

00:09:56.293 --> 00:09:58.010
counter examples of people who seem

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.330
to go against the grain and
have this kind of ongoing

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.320
imaginative capacity and you know

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.460
so then sometimes there
are these things like

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.820
you know where everyone's an artist,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.330
everyone can do all this stuff

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.090
and you know and I think that's also

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.370
kind of an oversimplification

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.573
of the cognitive differences that we have.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.950
So we're mentally very diverse species

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.960
and I think we should,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.420
we really should celebrate that diversity

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.360
rather thank think that everybody

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.060
should be everything all the time.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.726
- But if you take like
science fiction writers

00:10:38.726 --> 00:10:41.350
from different cultures,

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.950
is there something unique about them?

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.520
- Well you certainly see that,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.330
so he was asking if you
take science fiction writers

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.820
which is a group of imaginative people

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.222
that we spent some time talking with

00:10:54.222 --> 00:10:57.570
and is there something
different about them.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.040
Well I think one thing you see

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.380
is that there are different ways

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.890
in which they think about problems

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.764
and so there might be these kind of

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.960
practices that they have cultivated

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.670
or that they kind of
naturally kind of gravitated

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.196
to which caused them
to think about problems

00:11:14.196 --> 00:11:17.240
in ways that are more orthogonal

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.920
to how those problems
are typically approached

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.200
and it often means they they're kind of

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.470
really expand the context by which

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.260
they place problems within
so they don't think of them

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.756
quite so instrumentally
from a singular perspective.

00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:36.470
They are often kind of read across

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.760
many different kinds of literatures

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.640
or engage in many different
kinds of discourses

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.161
so historical, scientific,
you know humanistic,

00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:49.750
a bunch of different kinds of things

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.670
and then the work that they do

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.690
comes up with a kind of original synthesis

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.820
out of those many different elements

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.470
and so you start to see those kinds

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.480
of characteristics and then
if the question is well

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.400
why do they have them, you know

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.600
that is a good question.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.954
(laughs)

00:12:12.954 --> 00:12:14.123
- So another one for you here.

00:12:17.263 --> 00:12:18.140
So I think I'll simplify that but

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.230
is imagination really humans

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.070
is it present in different animals,

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.540
there are evidence that perhaps

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.830
chimpanzees even gorillas may have

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.430
some kind of imagination

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.140
and in this same context

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.003
what about artificial intelligence,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.360
you can make a computer be creative

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.173
or have innovation, is it imagination?

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.990
- Yeah, so you know I kind of indicated

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.240
a little bit the

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.240
in my talk how much richer our theories

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.580
of imagination can become when we

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:59.580
consider the imaginative
realms of the non human

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.080
and you know and this
isn't to kind of diminish

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.080
the kind of unique
capabilities of homo sapiens

00:13:10.955 --> 00:13:13.970
but I think we start to really expand

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.450
our understanding of our own imaginations

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.530
by trying to recognize what the kind of

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.133
imaginative umwelt is of
other kinds of entities.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:29.840
You know I gave just some
kind of cheeky little examples

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.840
but you know to then consider

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.840
well what is the imagination
of a swarm of bees

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.990
and you know that has both
a kind of social dimension

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.630
as well as an individual dimension

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.840
is an interesting way to
kind of think about then

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.650
how does that relate to what we consider

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.563
our kind of social imagination.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.910
And then as it goes to this question

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.610
of artificial intelligence that often,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.120
as I mentioned a little bit,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.390
when we start to approach the notion

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.660
of constructing an artificial intelligence

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.650
we do so by thinking of it

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.220
as modeling aspects of human intelligence

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.980
or human imagination.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.640
Well our models of that,
our own understanding

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.810
of what we're trying to model

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.030
is very limited fragmented and emergent

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.876
and so to kind of think of that

00:14:29.876 --> 00:14:33.120
as the kind of beginning and end

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.238
of what an artificial imagination could be

00:14:36.238 --> 00:14:41.220
is a terrible limitation
on that possibility

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.950
and in fact what we might find

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.430
is the more kind of viable
artificial imagination

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.030
would be imagination that is as alien

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.040
to the human imagination as
that swarm of bees imagination

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.733
is to the human imagination.

00:14:55.723 --> 00:14:57.360
So all of these things kind of you know

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.103
considering how we might.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.520
We need to continuously expand

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.820
our conceptions of what this kind of

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.220
human phenomena is in relationship

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.697
to the rest of the biosphere
and the techno sphere

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.383
that we're in the process of building.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.030
(applause)

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.313
- Agustín Fuentes, some questions for you.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.600
That's an interesting one.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.508
When it comes to
imagination why distinguish

00:15:35.508 --> 00:15:39.813
stone chipped tools from a
branch of stripped leaves.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.630
- So why, I have pockets
so I can use me hands there

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.213
I don't have to go like this.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.610
What's the difference between stone tool,

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.040
chimpanzees will frequently,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.010
different communities of chimpanzees

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.090
will take a branch, strip
that branch of leaves,

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.700
break it to an appropriate length

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.488
and then use it for fishing

00:16:00.488 --> 00:16:01.321
for termites or a variety of other things.

00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:03.020
Other chimpanzees will carry with them

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.030
a small stripped branch
that they really like,

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.350
they'll walk for 20
minutes to another site

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.300
where the termite den is,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.830
pick up a stick there,
use that stick first

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.736
to modify the termite, then
use that secondary stick,

00:16:15.736 --> 00:16:18.440
a work by Crickette
Sanz and her colleagues

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.970
have demonstrated that so there's a lot

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.330
of incredible and then there's other,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.160
not just chimpanzees, crows

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.430
and a number of organisms that use sticks

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:29.360
and modified sticks in
a simple way for tools.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.120
None of those require the level

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.560
of multiple foresight and planning

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.490
or structural and manual,
visual manipulation

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.650
that making stone tools does.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.250
It's too bad I should've had just brought

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.000
some pieces of flint or
obsidian and shown you

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.510
because it's really hard for us to imagine

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.700
how many sequences in the future

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.790
and how radically,
especially for something

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.140
like an Acheulean tool

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.460
you have to envision iterative steps

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.110
and each time you have to re envision them

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.570
because you've changed the platform.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.580
So there're many other examples

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.090
but the stone tool is a good one

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.960
because people have tried to teach

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.200
some of the smartest, most
human like chimpanzees

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.890
to make stone tools and we can't do it.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.550
What we did learn, and
chimps are incredibly smart,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.780
Kanzi we tried to teach,
people tried to teach

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.487
him how to make stone tools,

00:17:21.487 --> 00:17:22.460
what Kanzi learned really quickly is that

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.510
we wanted him to make
some sharp edged rocks

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.040
so finally he went to the highest place

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.230
and started breaking all the rocks

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.880
and brought people edges

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.983
which is really smart, but
it's not creating stone tools.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.460
- Have another one for you.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.010
Given the expensive nature
of human imagination

00:17:46.763 --> 00:17:49.850
of human imagination,
restructuring the environment,

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.930
notably accelerating species extinctions

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.730
and emerging technologies
is the end of the nature

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.303
as we have inherit inevitable?

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.460
- So let me back up one second and go back

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.010
to stone tools because one of the things

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.610
we have to think about is what's
called niche construction.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.530
So this is humans are very very good

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.710
at dealing with the pressures of the world

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.550
by actually changing
those pressures, right

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.000
which then changes the way
we interface with the world

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.510
so rather than thinking of the environment

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.210
just affecting organisms,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.510
think about organisms and environment

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.590
in a mutual advance, co shaping
and reshaping one another.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.080
In the human context,
what we become especially

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.840
good at in the last, we've been doing this

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.310
for a couple million years

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.610
but in the last many thousand years,

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.890
let's say five to ten 15,000 years

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.710
we've become really really
good at re engineering,

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.310
reconstructing other
species and landscapes

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.320
for our own benefit.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.550
Now that's had a lot of cascade effects

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.290
frequently when we change one component

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.710
in the environment, other components

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.920
come back to bite us in the butt.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.280
And so we then reconfigure that

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.090
so this back and forth is what humans do

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.580
that's how we made it in the world.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.900
Imagination plays a critical role in that.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.570
Now, what we've found
in contemporary times

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.590
and we can go back and look at this

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.310
from any context, we
find that in many cases

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:13.310
humans exceed, manipulate
or erroneously assume

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.030
some manipulation is gonna
have a positive effect.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.460
And we see humans correcting for that

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.550
but we also see lot's of human
populations going extinct.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.890
Remember most human
populations for the history

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.823
of our genus have gone extinct.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.030
Right, we now are doing something

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.363
we as humans and what we do,

00:19:31.363 --> 00:19:32.810
we're causing one of the
largest extinction events

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.220
in the history of our planet

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.600
but we know that we're doing it.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.817
Well we all know, most
people don't admit it.

00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:45.120
But we also know what those processes are

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.370
so is it too late, no
no it's not too late.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.290
It is not too late,
we're not gonna fall off

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.875
and break the world but we are breaking

00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.110
many many many ecosystems

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.930
and so using imagination and using

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.670
this collaboration and compassion

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.500
and this ability to sort of think

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.090
both technologically and socially

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.530
through issues, we know as many problems

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.520
as we're causing ecologically

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.140
we also have the knowledge

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.150
to address a vast majority of those.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.300
Do we have the will, do
we have the imagination

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.533
and do we have the endurance,
that's another question.

00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:25.464
(applause)

00:20:25.464 --> 00:20:28.220
- You should come, 'cause I see the time

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.953
and maybe you should
ask some from your pool.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.233
- So question for Lera.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.750
So are there any known
languages or cultures

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.833
that don't use metaphor?

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.330
- That's a really interesting question.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.380
So languages of course
have a finite set of words

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.230
and we have an infinite set of

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.440
situations we want to talk about

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.960
so in fact there isn't a way

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.400
to avoid using metaphor
whenever you're talking

00:21:02.562 --> 00:21:03.810
you're always going to be extending

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.830
prior uses of words in
slightly new contexts.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.480
Some of those extensions will strike you

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.420
as more metaphorical, some will strike you

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.390
as more mundane but in fact
we're always stretching

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.730
and pushing the boundaries of language

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.600
and the way I think about

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.070
the dictionary is that it's basically

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.110
a retirement home for metaphors.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.250
Right, once a metaphor has
gotten conventionalized enough

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.630
that you don't hear it
as a novel use anymore,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.970
it kind of goes and retires

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.190
and becomes a meaning in the dictionary

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:39.190
but really you're always extending words.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.810
One exercise I give to my students

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.430
is just to take any article
in the New York Times,

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.770
take the front page of the New York Times

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.720
and go through and try to underline

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.200
everything that's a metaphor

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.529
and it's really hard to
get through a sentence

00:21:55.529 --> 00:21:57.410
without finding a metaphor

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.300
and once you start adding in spacial

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.800
prepositions like if someone
says it arrived on time

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.473
well that's a spacial word
that we're using for time,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.333
is that a metaphor?

00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:09.820
Once you start, once you
get caught up in that

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.320
you're basically underlining every word

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.350
in the New York Times as a metaphor

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.620
and it just gives you
that sense of how hard

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.440
it is to actually tell
what is the literal meaning

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.880
because you're always
using words in new contexts

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.490
and you're always pushing the boundaries,

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.193
that's the nature of language.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.250
- Great, another question for you.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.340
So in the work you've
been doing looking at time

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.220
have you looked at when children

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.432
start to have a sense of time

00:22:41.432 --> 00:22:44.950
and if so is there anything about how

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.930
they map directions of time and space

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.953
before they learn reading
and writing for example?

00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:53.344
- It's a wonderful question.

00:22:53.344 --> 00:22:55.537
Of course there're many different things

00:22:55.537 --> 00:22:57.440
that we mean by time, there's
a judgment of duration,

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.940
or a sense of duration but there are also

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.530
more abstract things like the idea

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.830
of tomorrow, now a word like tomorrow

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.323
is hard to learn because
you never see tomorrow,

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.670
people always talk about tomorrow

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.890
but not when tomorrow is around.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.540
It's never around, right so how do you

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.750
figure out what that means,
it takes a little while.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.090
So it does take kids a little while

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.653
to figure out these temporal terms.

00:23:21.253 --> 00:23:23.200
Kids do start to organize things

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.150
according to the directions

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.360
that are prevalent in our culture

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.500
before they start reading
and writing themselves

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.150
and partially that's because of how much

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.930
their parents do that kind of
organizing for them, right.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.180
So even if you yourself are not reading,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.650
your parent is likely reading to you

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.110
and pointing things out to
you in a particular direction.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.700
And all kinds of things in your household

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.350
are going to be arranged that way

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.460
and so there're going to be
all these cultural practices

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.410
that drive exploration
in a particular direction

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:51.670
from left to right.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.140
You'll be asked to line up

00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:56.091
in lines from left to right

00:23:57.118 --> 00:23:58.588
and all kinds of other things

00:23:58.588 --> 00:23:59.660
so that's a cultural
practice that permeates

00:24:02.396 --> 00:24:03.260
lots and lots of other things

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.883
that then start to predate
reading and writing.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.167
- Great, thank you.

00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:10.768
Have some other questions.

00:24:10.768 --> 00:24:13.018
(applause)

00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:16.140
Got questions for Polly about

00:24:19.306 --> 00:24:20.560
can you come on up?

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.560
So one thing you were starting to get to

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.460
at the end of your talk was looking at

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.353
arctic societies and

00:24:30.353 --> 00:24:32.570
a question comes up about whether or not

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.210
they spend more time telling stories

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.363
within the long winter nights.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.480
- First I want to--

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.510
- Talk into there.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.820
- First I want to make a correction,

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.323
this is has nothing to do with pockets.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.850
This is a picture from
the New Guinea highlands

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.880
where it's very cold in the morning

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.448
and this is what we call
the Highlands over coat.

00:24:58.448 --> 00:25:00.310
(laughter)

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.400
That's what it is.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.580
Anyway, yes in the arctic I've looked

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.590
through many arctic societies

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.020
and like the Tlingit,
they will tell stories

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.690
for three or four days going.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.830
They will build fires
that are six feet high,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.650
they will sit around and then in between,

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.850
they'll sleep a bit and they'll continue

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.714
for days on end so yes,

00:25:23.714 --> 00:25:26.130
in those areas and of course

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.930
they also have very
elaborate social networks

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.780
to remember kinship systems

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.370
because there's very high risk

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.583
in the arctic, so yes.

00:25:35.933 --> 00:25:38.230
- Okay, and then another question

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.540
any of the societies that you've looked at

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:49.280
utilize any neurochemical augmentation

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.403
as a part of their storytelling rituals?

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.430
- Okay, none of the
societies I've looked at do,

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.620
the bushmen go into trance

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.530
so actually when they're in trance

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.010
and sometimes they go into trance

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.827
when telling stories, it's completely

00:26:05.827 --> 00:26:10.340
done without any
neurochemical augmentation

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.760
whatsoever and yet when
you see them in trance

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.050
some times they fall in the fire

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.550
and they're burning and
they don't even feel it

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.666
and then somebody else will say,

00:26:20.666 --> 00:26:21.810
hey get your arm out of the fire

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:26.090
and so they really get
into a very very intense

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.650
altered state of consciousness,

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.760
it's very painful to go into this

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.500
but it's done without drugs.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.020
There are a lot of
societies that use drugs too

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.900
but not usually with storytelling

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.503
unless a bit of marijuana.

00:26:39.533 --> 00:26:41.907
- Thank you thank you.

00:26:43.197 --> 00:26:45.447
(applause)

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.483
Allyson, couple questions for you.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:56.530
And actually we have
a cluster of questions

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.550
that are somewhat related

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:03.090
and they have to do
with 23 and Me analyses

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.830
of people's DNA and coming back

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.127
and I'm nine percent
neanderthal and blah blah blah.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.110
And so are you at the point

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.210
where you're able to look at

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.800
what this kind of latent
neanderthal DNA is

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.530
in humans and does any of that relate

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.883
to neurological development?

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.840
- Yeah, that's a great question

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.310
that was heavily discussed
in another Carta meeting

00:27:38.382 --> 00:27:41.090
on genetic origins of the neanderthals.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.180
So there's a fraction
of the human population,

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.250
most Europeans who actually
have the small part

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.330
of neanderthal genome.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.530
And yeah companies like 23 and Me

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.390
have making claims that they can detect

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.270
the fraction or how much you have.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.650
It's not a lot, it varies
between two and four percent

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.090
and everybody has is likely different,

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.030
it's not that everybody has the same

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.500
pieces of those, or fragments of those

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.440
neanderthal DNAs have been linked

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.160
to human conditions both
positive or negative

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.470
in right now I mean other than that

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.150
it's all very correlational,

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.860
there are some studies that are trying

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.320
to make a point for

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.070
why this was positively
selected in humans,

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.480
why we still have them

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.520
but I think experimental validation

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.520
such as recreating
these networks in a dish

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.810
even for all the tissues
is too in the early stages

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:45.703
so there is not much we can
say except for correlation.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.020
- Okay, so

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.670
I guess another category of interest

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.960
has to do with things like

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.060
when you're working with

00:29:05.486 --> 00:29:06.950
this kind of human origin work

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.950
and in a very wet way
with the actual genomes,

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.130
what kind of oversight is there

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.833
for this research or where,

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.920
what do you think are the,

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.710
kind of even the underlying ethics

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.220
of doing work with DNA and it maybe

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.750
not only applies to this work

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.110
but we can think of it
in a broader context of

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:35.720
you know everything that
we're now able to do

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.240
with Crisper technology

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.370
and the kinds of genetic engineering

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:46.260
that is viable now that is
just kind of extraordinary.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.570
So what are your thoughts about that?

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.150
- So this is a very field

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.680
and especially for the brain

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.290
it always raises a
little bit more red flags

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.340
than on the tissue.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.030
Nobody complains when
you make like a mini gut

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.410
in a dish but if you say
you have a mini brain,

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.393
people go oh, brain.

00:30:04.393 --> 00:30:09.393
And so far we have been
away from any ethical

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.940
controversies mainly
because those mini brains

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.140
never show an activity level

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:22.140
similar to something like a human brain,

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.590
a baby most of the work

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.100
before what I showed
you has been doing that

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.670
by gene expression and
that's a little bit tricky

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.850
because you are always
compared to a postmortem brain

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.490
now that we're showing real activity

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.040
and are actually plugging that

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.340
into a robot or even in the other tissue

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.660
that can actually experience

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.930
the world that becomes a
little bit more problematic.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.820
I think people are, and
scientists are aware

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.430
that these might create some

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.710
concerns in parts of the society

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.170
but nonetheless we are doing that

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.120
to answer from the mental questions

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.810
and my lab focuses on
neurological disorders

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.573
so the aim is good.

00:31:03.573 --> 00:31:08.573
Same rationale could be applied
for genome editing, right?

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.270
We have now this possibility
to modify genomes

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.814
we can go to an embryo and fix

00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:16.990
terrible mutation that that person

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.980
will have for the rest of his life

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.510
but what about if you start to using

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.730
this genome editing to create people

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.210
that are taller or have blue eyes

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.230
or are more intelligent if we figure out

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:30.060
what is the biological basis of that

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.070
so it's up to the society
to put the threshold.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.670
In my experience I think most scientist

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.520
would agree with that, in the beginning

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.740
of a new technology there always

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:45.340
some turmoil about what
the consequences of that

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.250
but this is slowly will go away

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.210
as the scientist shows
how useful are those.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.300
So the same thing for blood transfusion

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:57.560
for organ transplant,
they all raise red flags

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.170
and now we do it quite common to do it.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.108
So I think the idea of brain
organize in genome editing

00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:06.970
will pass through some kind of moratorium

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.100
and we'll know what's possible, what's not

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.280
what's dangerous, what's not

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.880
and we will regulate from there.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.750
- Yeah it's great I think the

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.838
you know the work is in a state where it's

00:32:21.838 --> 00:32:24.180
tremendously evocative you know

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.530
it's very novel for people to hear about

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.170
and then you put it in a robot, you know

00:32:33.129 --> 00:32:35.850
and maybe the robot has like
lasers and buzz saws on it

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:39.820
or something and so that maybe

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.610
kind of raises some questions but

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.980
you know I think for all of this

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.480
it is this idea that you know

00:32:47.692 --> 00:32:49.160
that we do bring our imaginations

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.720
and the work that everybody's doing

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.260
is kind of stimulating us

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.930
to kind of rethink what our humanity is,

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.530
what it consists of, where it's,

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.370
and when we try to think about where it's

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.220
coming from, it's definitely

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.100
with an idea to think
about where's it going.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.010
And you know and we here many things

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:12.010
about this is how we see
imagination happening in childhood,

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.890
this is how we see it
happening in other species,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.230
this is the kind of condition of humanity

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.680
that leads us to kind of have this genetic

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.909
and cultural co evolution
that are bound together

00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:28.120
in ways that have gotten us to this point

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.650
and that if we're gonna get

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.370
to the next point that this kind of

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:39.000
cultivation, understanding, and harnessing

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.950
of the human imagination and in an even

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:46.390
more effective co evolutionary way

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.890
is probably the thing
that's gonna save our

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.083
you know behinds.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.400
And so I think the work that you're doing

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.920
not only to look at how this works

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.760
to address neurological disorders

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.061
that we know are kind of
a real scourge of humanity

00:34:03.061 --> 00:34:06.910
but what comes with humanity 2.0

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.063
is a kind of important thing.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:15.200
So I think, do you have
another set of questions?

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.633
- I have some for Morris.

00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:20.860
If you want to come.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.850
So in terms of human evolution

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:24.380
and especially migration,

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.380
is the imagination always a positive force

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.590
and if so how does it come to be

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.490
overcoming in the process of considering

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:42.490
the fears from which the
first humans must have lived?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.900
I think the question
is about if imagination

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.400
is always positive we have to first

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.733
conquer our fears to imagine
something in trial, right?

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:58.130
- I'm not sure if it's always positive

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.780
but what I was trying to say is that

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.780
no human society can continue

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.213
without or this would
be completely different.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.963
If we didn't have this
level of social imagination.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.690
Our society would be just
like that of the chimpanzees

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.080
where it's a matter of
interpersonal relationships

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.790
while the question for humans

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.540
is how you get beyond
interpersonal relationships

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.180
to get much bigger groups.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.940
We see into personal
relationships in the end

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.450
limitless sizes of the groups

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:39.820
of the number of people you can have in

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.570
interpersonal relationships with obviously

00:35:44.504 --> 00:35:48.090
so I don't think it's dangerous

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.130
the kind of societies would be produced

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.220
would be...

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.571
We probably wouldn't even recognize,

00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:01.690
and we wouldn't get very far.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.253
I always thought we would
have been wiped out years ago.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.603
It'd be small and yeah.

00:36:14.249 --> 00:36:15.633
- I have another one for you.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.830
- Take the idea of

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.810
constructs of human grouping
and take it further.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.230
Do you see ramifications towards

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.980
symbolic interactions
and towards structural

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.833
anthropogeny as direct consequences?

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.380
- Well I don't very much
like the term symbolic

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.783
and I could explain it in a simple way.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.660
Several people have talked
about pretend playing

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.827
now it's very clear that in pretend play

00:36:56.827 --> 00:37:00.630
children understand that it is pretend.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.370
They love at the pretend

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.770
unlike Piaget who's just
sort of got muddled.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.730
So children have this area

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.680
which they think is symbolic

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.650
but they're conscious of it not being true

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.740
on the other hand the kind of imagination

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.910
takes place when people think you know

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.080
their national identity or their clan

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.400
or objects almost like
mountains in the world.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:42.150
They're not in a sense imaginary.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.010
This seems to be completely different

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.337
and so the reason why I
don't like the term symbolic

00:37:49.337 --> 00:37:52.530
is that it muddles these
two things together.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:57.530
It muddles what we're
conscious of as a symbol

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.220
and what is probably much more important

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.453
we think of is just true.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.402
- Alright, I think that's it.

00:38:10.402 --> 00:38:11.485
(applause)

00:38:11.485 --> 00:38:12.513
I would like to thank you
all for sticking around.

00:38:14.854 --> 00:38:16.304
Do you have something to say?

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.500
- Before I thank everyone Caren Walker

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.908
wanted to correct
something briefly, brief.

00:38:22.908 --> 00:38:25.100
- I do I do okay so I don't
know how many of you caught this

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.299
when you're standing
up here with the lights

00:38:27.299 --> 00:38:28.880
and everything it's very disorienting.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.360
So I was doing this
counterfactual reasoning

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.070
about my answer to your questions.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.430
Somebody asked me about
neo natal imitation

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.050
which is way different
from pre natal imitation

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.580
which is the thing that I
actually answered about.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.620
So neo natal imitation
is the thing that happens

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.380
after you're born where if you look at a

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.970
brand new baby and you
sticky your tongue out

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.810
they'll stick their tongue
out back at you, right?

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.930
This is a really different kind of thing

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.649
than the thing I thought
you were asking about.

00:38:49.649 --> 00:38:51.680
So the question here is
that kind of imitation

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.300
is that somehow grounded in imagination

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.890
and I still don't know the answer

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:58.560
but it's sort of a
different work around answer

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.630
which is that neo natal imitation

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.530
we think of mostly as a social reflex,

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.610
it's something that happens
immediately after birth

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:08.680
and what it does is it
sort of paves the way

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.270
for all of the rest of social
cognition to come on board.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.370
Attention to faces following gaze,

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.370
doing this kind of imitation
which makes your caregiver

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:18.650
love you a little bit more.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.410
All of these things are really important

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.250
for fostering social connection

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.930
and so that later becomes complicated

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.360
things like theory of
mind which absolutely

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.570
involve imagining the
perspective of other people.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.990
So anyway I would say
that neo natal imitation

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:34.460
is related to imagination but in a long

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.920
sort of long trajectory as
opposed to sort of immediate

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.243
so anyway I apologize
for my error, thank you.

00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:41.576
- Thank you, very much.

00:39:41.576 --> 00:39:44.610
(applause)

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.750
So with that I'd like to thank you all,

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.260
thank our two chairs, all our speakers,

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:54.890
the audience here and out in space.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.530
And all the many people who have

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:58.890
continued supporting Carta,

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:01.720
I would invite you all to support Carta.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.260
And I very much hope that we will

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.170
see you again at the upcoming symposia,

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.160
hopefully we'll see you
at some of these events

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.940
and again thank you all,

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.450
thank all the people for making possible

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.723
the recordings and the
streaming of this event.

00:40:18.261 --> 00:40:19.117
(applause)

00:40:19.117 --> 00:40:20.450
have a good one.

00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:29.602
(upbeat music)
