Do you remember solving linear equations? Well, we're going to use some of the

00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:07.948
same techniques we learned all those lessons ago to change equations like this

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:13.420
one, so that we can use our techniques using logs to find out what x is. It's

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.570
pretty common in mathematics to try to change a problem to be in a form of what

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:24.190
we've seen before. So here, we have the equation e to the x minus 3 equals 43.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.260
For right now, let's just think of e to the x as our variable. Now if we do the

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.799
same thing to both sides of our equation, what is e to the x equal to?
