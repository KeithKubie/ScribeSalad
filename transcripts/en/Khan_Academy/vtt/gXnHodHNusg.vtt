00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.910
In a regular
tetrahedron-- and that's

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.950
just a four-sided
polyhedron, and its regular,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.460
so all of the sides and all of
the faces will be the same--

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.810
the centers of the four
faces are the vertices

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.140
of a smaller tetrahedron.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.770
The ratio of the volume of the
smaller tetrahedron to that

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.340
of the larger is m over
n, where m and n are

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.110
relatively prime
positive integers.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.130
Find m plus n.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.780
So let's just draw this
regular tetrahedron first.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.820
So this is a
regular tetrahedron.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.120
So in order to have four equal
sides, or four equals faces,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.910
I should say, in
three dimensions,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.730
it needs to look like this.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.420
It essentially needs
to be four triangles.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.080
So we have one triangle,
just like that.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.640
Then we have another
triangle like that.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.550
Then we have another
triangle in the back.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400
So this is another
triangle in the back.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.350
And then we have a
triangle as a base.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.090
This is a regular tetrahedron,
where each of these faces

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.040
are going to be
equilateral triangles.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280
Each of these faces are
equilateral triangles.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.270
So if you looked, this length
is the same as that length,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.700
this is the same as that length.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.380
Fair enough.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.620
So that's our
regular tetrahedron.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.032
Now, they say the centers
of the four faces,

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:22.990
so let's look at the
centers of the four faces.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.970
Let's say that this is
the center of one face.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.550
This is the center
of another face.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.380
Back here is the
center of the face

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.550
that we can't see that's
behind these two faces.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.570
And then this is the center,
this right here, let's say,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.030
is the center of the base.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.470
The center of the four faces
are the vertices of a smaller

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.910
tetrahedron, so we
could connect them

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.760
and get a smaller tetrahedron.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.450
So along, so we
have this one going

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.930
from the center of this face
to the center of the base.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.570
Going from the
center of the base

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.510
to the center of this face
over here, we have this line.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.360
You connect those, we have one
of the faces of the smaller

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.460
tetrahedron.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.706
You go like that, you
have kind of the top.

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:06.580
If you flipped it over,
it would be the base,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.297
but you'd have the top of
the smaller tetrahedron.

00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:11.130
And then if you connected
those in the back,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.671
you would have the
two faces that you

00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:15.540
can't see-- that
face and that face.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390
Now, they want us to
essentially figure out

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.580
the volume of the smaller
tetrahedron, this magenta

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.685
tetrahedron, to this
yellow one over here.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:26.560
And you might already
be wrecking your brain,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.024
how do you figure out the volume
of a tetrahedron and whatnot,

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:30.690
and all of that.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.215
But the important
thing to realize

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:40.560
if you take two similar
objects and if you just

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.032
know the ratio of one
of their dimensions,

00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:44.740
and assuming that all
of their dimensions

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.550
have the same ratio-- and
it is the case in this right

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.620
over here-- then
the volume will be

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.400
the cube of the ratios
of one of their sides.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.000
So let me show this to
you right over here.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.720
Let me depict it.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.270
So let's say that this
length right over here,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.710
let's call that Length Big
for the big tetrahedron.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.290
And let's find the corresponding
edge of the small tetrahedron.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.100
So let's say that
we have another side

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.390
of the small tetrahedron,
let's call that Length Small.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:35.360
If we know the ratio of
Length Big to Length Small,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.230
we can figure out the ratio
of the big tetrahedron

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.630
to the small tetrahedron, the
volume of the big tetrahedron

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.780
to the volume of the
small tetrahedron

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.600
by just cubing this ratio.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.670
And we can do that because
these are completely

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.200
similar in every direction,
in every dimension.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.820
Whatever the ratio
of this is to this

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.870
is the same as the ratio
of that is to that.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.180
And actually, all of
these sides are the same,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.510
so all of these sides are
going to be the same as well.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.620
So they're similar
in every dimension.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.079
So with that said,
we really just need

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.500
to figure out the ratio
of one of the sides

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.070
of the big tetrahedron
to the length

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.590
of the side of a
small tetrahedron.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.340
And to do that, let's
just put ourselves--

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.290
And there are more
elegant ways of doing it,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.594
but those get a little
bit more abstract.

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:34.510
What I'm going to do is
just try to figure out

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.800
some coordinates of some of
these vertices of the larger

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.677
tetrahedron.

00:04:38.677 --> 00:04:41.010
And from that we can take the
average of the coordinates

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.730
to find the coordinates of
these vertices, the centres

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.240
of the faces.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.060
So let me draw some
coordinate axes here.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.000
So let's say that
this is my y-axis.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.710
I'm going to try to draw it
so that we can visualize it

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.785
in three dimensions.

00:04:56.785 --> 00:04:58.076
So let's say that is my y-axis.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.590
Let's make my x-axis
do something like this.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.152
So let's say that is the x-axis.

00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:11.360
And then you're going to
have your z-axis go straight

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.150
up and down.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.650
And actually, I
won't draw that yet.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.066
What I want to
just draw right now

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:18.949
is the base of the
larger tetrahedron.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:19.990
And I'm going to do that.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.073
I'm just going to pick
arbitrary coordinates here.

00:05:22.073 --> 00:05:24.580
We really just care
about the ratios,

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.420
so we can pick the larger
tetrahedron and have any size.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.470
So let's say that that
vertex right over here

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.890
is sitting right over here.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.250
This vertex sits
right over here.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.290
And then this vertex right
over here sit right over there.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.310
And then let's
assign-- we'll make it

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.660
so that looks a
little bit better.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.060
And so this is the base.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.540
of our tetrahedron,
of our big one.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.310
It's an equilateral triangle--
all the sides are the same.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.900
And just for simplicity
of the coordinates,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.030
let's make this coordinate
right over here,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.090
let's say that x is equal to
1, y is clearly equal to 0,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.520
because we are on the
x-axis, we haven't

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.120
moved in the y direction.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.170
And then we haven't even
paid any attention to z,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.750
but it's clearly
sitting in the xy-plane,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.690
so z is also going
to be equal to 0.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.900
If we go over here, let's
make this negative 1, comma 0,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.950
comma 0.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.280
So it's still on the x-axis.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.410
So this distance right over here
is 1, this distance over here

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.280
is 1, this entire side is 2.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.440
So we also know that this
entire side over here

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.270
is going to be 2.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.750
And you could use
30-60-90 triangles

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.300
to figure out this
distance, which

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.440
we need to figure out
the y-coordinate here.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.780
Let me be very clear.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.830
This, the coordinate of
this point over here,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.250
x is clearly equal
to 0 over here.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.590
X is 0.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.930
z is clearly equal to 0,
we're still in the xy-plane.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.020
But we don't know what
the y-coordinate is.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.330
So we're going to have to
do a little bit of-- well,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.190
you could use your knowledge
of 30-60-90 triangles

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.270
or if you don't even want to do
that, you can just go straight

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.290
to the Pythagorean theorem.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.520
We're looking for the
y-coordinate over here.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.190
We're looking for this
distance right over here.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.380
So this y-coordinate
squared plus 1

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.570
squared is going
to equal 2 squared.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.530
So let me write that over here.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.170
So this-- I will
do a new color--

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.370
so the y-coordinate squared plus
1 squared-- so plus 1 is going

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.350
to be equal to 2 squared,
it's going to be equal to 4,

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.050
where this is the y-coordinate.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.980
So y squared is going
to be equal to 3.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.540
y is going to be equal
to the square root of 3.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.880
So this distance right over
here is the square root of 3.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.607
Or so I could write
square root of 3

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.940
here-- you could see that
this satisfies the Pythagorean

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.560
theorem-- or I could
just put its coordinate--

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.450
it's coordinate is square
root of 3 in the y-direction.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.510
Now, while we're
focusing on the base

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.360
on the base of the
large tetrahedron,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.850
we can right now figure out
the center of that base,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.540
figure out the
center of that face,

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.750
which maybe might
sit right about here.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.320
And the easy way to figure
out the center of this face

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.640
is literally just to
average of the coordinates.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.990
So the coordinate for this
character right over here is

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.320
going to be the
average of the x's.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.580
So 0 plus 1 minus
1 is 0 divided by 3

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.010
is just going to be 0,
which is very clear.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.055
It's sitting on the y-axis.

00:08:41.055 --> 00:08:43.460
It does not move in
the x x-direction,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.860
either to the right
or to the left.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.920
The y-coordinate, we're going
to have square root of 3

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.760
plus 0 plus 0 over 3.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.210
So that's just going to be
square root of 3 over 3.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.080
So it's one third of the way all
the way to the top of the base.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.720
And then the
z-coordinate coordinate,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.553
you could take the
average, but it's clearly

00:09:03.553 --> 00:09:05.360
still sitting on the xy-plane.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.310
So it's also going to be 0.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.070
You can take 0 plus 0 plus 0
divided by 3-- clearly still 0.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.930
So we figured out also one of
the vertices of our smaller

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.890
tetrahedron.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.460
What I want to do now
to try to figure out

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.340
the coordinates of
this vertex right here.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.640
Then we can figure
out this distance,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.870
compare it to a distance of
2, and then, essentially,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.542
take the cube of it, and
we'll have the ratio we need.

00:09:32.542 --> 00:09:34.000
And then we can
figure out the rest

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.880
of the problem-- the m plus n.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.770
Now, to figure out
the coordinates here,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.320
we need to take
the average of this

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.260
coordinate, this coordinate,
and this coordinate up here.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.670
We know these two coordinates.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.360
We know these two coordinates.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.880
We just need to figure out
this coordinate up here.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.520
And to do that, let's now
extend into the z-direction.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.640
So if we were to go
straight up from this point.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.370
So if we were to go straight
up from that center point,

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.460
we just figured out.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.230
Let's say we go right.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.870
I could draw a neater
altitude than that.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.190
So let's say I were to go
straight up from this point

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.720
right here to the top
of this tetrahedron--

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.815
so let's say
tetrahedron, because I

00:10:17.815 --> 00:10:19.520
was saying it a
little bit weird.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.005
So now the tetrahedron, you
can imagine, looks like this.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.650
The drawing is the
hard part here.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.451
So now this is a face
of the tetrahedron.

00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:32.200
I don't even have to
draw the whole thing.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.480
I think we can visualize it.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.770
I'm having trouble
drawing it, making

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.430
my hand go in an
awkward position.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.010
Let me see if I can just
draw it with dotted lines.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.030
So that side.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.965
So what I've just drawn here is
this face of the tetrahedron.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.000
I've just drawn this magenta
face of the tetrahedron right

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.160
over here.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.760
And I could draw
the back side too.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.150
I could draw the
backside just like that.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.610
I could draw it over there.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.270
And I think it's
pretty clear to you

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.110
that this point
right here is going

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.280
to lie right on top of this
center point over here.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.080
So we already know a
few of its coordinates.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.860
We know its x- and y-coordinate.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.840
We just need to figure
out its z-coordinate.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.996
So its x-coordinate
is going to be 0.

00:11:22.996 --> 00:11:24.870
It's going to be the
same x-coordinate here--

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.040
we haven't moved
along the x-axis.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.711
Its y-coordinate is going to
be the square root of 3 over 3.

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.210
Same as this guy
over here, but it's

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.640
going to have some height
in the z-direction.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.530
So we need to figure
out what that is.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.150
And to do that,
what I'm going to do

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.060
is to draw,
essentially, an altitude

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.930
for the face of this front face.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.780
I'm going to go from this point
up to here, or from this point

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.569
up to here.

00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:52.610
So if you look at this
blue line right over here,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.800
we already figured out
what this distance is.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.940
All the faces-- it's a
regular tetrahedron--

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.630
so all of the faces
have the same length.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.490
So this blue distance
right over here

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.800
is going to be the same as
this distance over here,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.080
because this was the altitude
for that bottom face.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.780
And we already figured out
that this distance over here

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.000
is square root of 3.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.660
We did that, that
was the first thing

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.850
we did that this
distance over here

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.560
from this point to this
point is square root of 3.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.290
So this distance is also
the square root of 3.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.150
We also know that this
distance right over here--

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.210
let me do this in a
new color-- we also

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.120
know that this
distance over here

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.460
is the square root of 3 over 3.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.660
This is a right angle.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.826
It might not be completely
obvious the way I did it,

00:12:34.826 --> 00:12:35.980
but this was an altitude.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.920
So now we can figure
out the height

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.130
of the pyramid, or
the tetrahedron.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.990
And that height to this point
is going to be our z-coordinate.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.760
So let's call that height h.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.730
So we know from the
Pythagorean theorem,

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:57.080
h squared plus the base
squared right over here-- which

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.240
is going to be square
root of 3 over 3 squared

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.410
is going to be 3 over
3 over 9 is going

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.220
to be equal to the
square root of 3

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.810
squared-- it's going
to be equal to 3.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.900
Or subtracting this
from both sides,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.450
we have h squared is equal to--
I'll write the-- it's 3 minus 3

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.020
over 9, 3 minus one third,
which is the same thing as 9/3

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.297
minus one third,
which is equal to 8/3.

00:13:25.297 --> 00:13:27.630
And so if we want to take the
square root of both sides,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.250
we'll get h is equal
to the square root of 8

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.250
is a square root of 4
times square root of 2.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:37.260
So that's 2 square roots of
2 over the square root of 3.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.080
So that is h.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.500
And that's also the
z-coordinate here.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:49.500
So this is 2 square roots of
2 over the square root of 3.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.759
I'm already close
to 14 minutes here,

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:53.550
so I'm going to continue
in the next video.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.470
But we now have the
coordinate for this top point.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.890
So we can take the average
of these three coordinates,

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.300
find the coordinate for
this point right over here,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.850
then find the distance between
this point and this point

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.433
that we already got
the coordinate for

00:14:06.433 --> 00:14:08.550
to figure out how
long this side is.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.270
And then we can prepare
the ratio of that

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.780
to that, cube it to get
the ratio of the volumes.
