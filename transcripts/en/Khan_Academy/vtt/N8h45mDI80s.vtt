00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.305
If we were to buy the stock for $50,

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:04.799
so, this is the situation
where we're buying

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.072
the stock, we're clearly
putting $50 up front.

00:00:08.072 --> 00:00:11.069
If the stock moved up
to $80, and we able to

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.735
perfectly call the top
and sell it for that $80,

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:19.141
we would make a $30 profit
off of a $50 initial

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:23.641
investment. That's a 60%
gain. That's a 60% gain

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.402
on our upfront capital. On the other side,

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:29.069
if the stock were to go
down to $20, we would

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:34.803
loose $30 of our $50
upfront investment. It would

00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:39.538
be a 60% loss. So in the
buying the stock based on

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:42.189
the scenario that I
painted we could gain 60%

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:44.593
or we could lose 60%. In
terms of the potential

00:00:44.593 --> 00:00:47.654
upside you can gain an unlimited amount.

00:00:47.654 --> 00:00:51.323
The stock can just really
go to any possible value.

00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:54.344
In terms of loss when
you buy a stock the most

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:57.121
you can lose is 100%.

00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.764
Let's think about the
scenario with the call option.

00:01:00.764 --> 00:01:05.654
With the call option.
To buy the call option

00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:09.848
it only cost us $5. We only
have to put $5 upfront.

00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:13.260
The scenario where the
stock went up to $80,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.925
we figured out that we
were able to profit $15

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:18.931
net of the price of the
options. This was our

00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.429
pure profit. On a base
of $5 investment we were

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.679
able to get $15 of profit.
We were able to get

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.684
a 300% gain. We were
able to get a 300% gain.

00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:34.516
On the other side though
if the stock went down

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:38.344
we had no reason to actually
exercise our option.

00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:41.434
We essentially just
lost all of the money of

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:46.318
the option. We lost 100%.

00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:49.265
What I want to show here
is that when an option did

00:01:49.265 --> 00:01:52.563
is it gave us leverage.
It gave us leverage.

00:01:52.563 --> 00:01:55.263
The term comes from
physics, because a lever

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:58.664
will give you kind of mechanical leverage.

00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:00.857
It can allow you to
exert more force than you

00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:03.732
otherwise could by using that simple tool.

00:02:03.732 --> 00:02:07.118
A call option is giving
you financial leverage.

00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:10.200
You're essentially making
this same bet here,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.704
but you're multiplying
potential gain or your

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:17.032
potential loss. If the
stock you ... based on

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.666
the scenario we painted
in the good scenario

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:23.072
you made 60%. But in the
call option in the good

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:27.336
scenario you made 300%. We multiplied.

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:30.538
We multiplied our gain.
On the downside with

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:34.371
the stock we lost 60%.
With the call option we

00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:39.935
lost 100%. Once again,
we multiplied our loss.

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:42.543
Right here it looks the
numbers are still favorable,

00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:44.922
because our loss
multiplication wasn't as much

00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:46.450
as our gain multiplication.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.521
This is really based
on some of the numbers

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:51.721
I chose. The important
thing to realize is if

00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.522
you're dealing with
option to essentially make

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:55.832
the same bet, that the
bet that the company

00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:58.168
will go up, you're just
putting leverage on your

00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:00.855
bet. You're multiplying
your potential gains

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:02.184
or losses.
