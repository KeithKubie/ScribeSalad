00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.620
These divers are gearing up to head 400 feet
underwater.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.330
Their bodies will experience immense, almost
fatal, pressure that can literally turn the

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.710
very thing keeping them alive — against
them.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.250
“The longer you stay down there, the more
gas, mostly helium, also nitrogen, on boards

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.360
into your tissues, into your blood, into your
muscles, into your bones; it’s just building

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.480
up inside your body and you have to let that
out.”

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.590
The Twilight Zone is one of the most mysterious
and dangerous places on Earth.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.120
Only an elite team can handle the complexities
of diving at these depths and conduct scientific

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.620
research.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.719
Their job is a race against time to survey
these deepwater coral before they come under

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.810
serious threat from pollution and warming
ocean temperatures.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.880
“I would say less than 10, 15 scientists
worldwide go to those depths.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.810
And because of that, everything is new.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.810
Everything is novel.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.950
We don't know what's there, because nobody
goes there.”

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.220
Luiz Rocha is one of only a dozen of divers
in the world with enough expertise to reach

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.250
the twilight zone.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.940
A place you don’t want to visit alone.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.720
“We're dive buddies, so Luiz and I, we’re
almost inseparable, both on land and underwater.”

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.130
Bart and Luiz are equipped with nearly 180
pounds of gear.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.909
Fins, bailout tanks, propeller scooters, and
dive computers — these are all essential

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.960
to surviving in the twilight zone.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.060
“Getting all the gear on, on the boat, and
getting ready to drop into the water is definitely

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060
the most intense time.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.509
We make sure our straps are all clipped, we
make sure our valves are on.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.380
It's hot, you're in the sun, in Neoprene,
black, dying basically.”

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.990
The key piece of equipment that will keep
Bart and Luiz alive is called the rebreather.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.450
Because at the levels they're going, the normal
mix of oxygen and nitrogen actually becomes

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.450
toxic.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.789
“The deeper we go with nitrogen, the more
narcotic it becomes.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.979
So it's the equivalent of diving drunk.”

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.249
“We make the sign to descent and we go down
together.

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.730
That can be a 300 foot free fall.”

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.939
“When you're in a shallow tropical coral
reef it's well lit, it's warm, and as we go

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.870
deeper we see the transition.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.780
Everything becomes slower, and colder, and
darker.”

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.090
“Then finally you'll start to see the bottom
come up and that's when you work.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:54.599
You have your 10 minutes, your 15 minutes
on the bottom.”

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.599
And that’s it.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.379
That’s all the time that these divers can
spend exploring the Twilight Zone before all

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.209
that gas they’re inhaling becomes lethal.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.290
“It requires constantly monitoring yourself
for symptoms of all kinds of different aspects

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.889
of different gases interacting with your body.

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:17.180
So we have to be constantly thinking about
our gear and ourselves, and at the same time,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.480
trying to do science at those depths.”

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.120
During their incredibly short window of time,
the dive team have to survey their surroundings,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.109
catalogue coral and capture new species.

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.609
In fact, they’ve been known to collect 12
new species in just a single dive.

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.689
“It's really intense.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.680
All you're thinking about is, "Catch the fish.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.559
Do the job that I'm here to do.

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:39.559
Where's my buddy?

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:40.680
Okay, everybody's okay.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.810
What's the time?

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.760
OK I’ve got a little bit more time.”

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.440
“We have our own language and screaming
gestures, and taglines, and things like that

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.389
that we'll use to communicate and then we'll
scream at each other in our ridiculous helium

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:04.839
voices if we see something really exciting,
you know, come over here and look at this

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.619
fish.”

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.140
Bart and Luiz would spend hours down in the
Twilight Zone if they could, but it's time

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.329
to ascend.

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:20.409
“We have an agreed upon time where we leave,
what we call the TTS, the Time To Surface.”

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.650
Ascending too fast can cause life threatening
conditions, like decompression sickness or

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.650
the bends.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.750
So Luiz and Bart follow a very specific decompression
schedule, which means ascending in stages.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.900
“If we have 10 to 15 minutes at the bottom,
it could be 3-4 hours after that to come back

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.710
up to the surface.”

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.740
The longest stop is just before Bart and Luiz
surface - just 10 ft below the waterline where

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.970
they can spend up to 90 minutes.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.960
90 minutes in just one spot.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.639
“I’ve had about 300 hours of rebreather
diving now in the past few years doing this

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.840
project, and when you think about it, it's
probably like maybe a sixth of that is in

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.750
the Twilight Zone and the rest of it's all
the decompression.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.460
But you know, it's worth it.”

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.080
Bart and Luiz are just beginning to scratch
the surface of the Twilight Zone.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.180
And the information they collect from these
deep reefs are invaluable.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.060
They’re so rarely studied, that we could
be in danger of losing them before we fully

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.660
understand them.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.669
“Every time we go to those depths, We find
plastics, we find fishing gear//We find all

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.449
signs of human activity, even as deep as we
go, to 400, 500 feet.”

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.960
And Bart and Luiz are willing to go through
the process of donning heavy equipment, risking

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.100
decompression sickness and spending hours
underwater, over and over again, just so they

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.070
can better understand this world.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.240
“It's definitely worth it to be able to
go down there and see places that no person

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.099
has ever seen before.”
