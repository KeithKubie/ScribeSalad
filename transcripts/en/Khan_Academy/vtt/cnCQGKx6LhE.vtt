00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.360
The dimensions of
the Earth and moon

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.780
are in relationship
to each other

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.990
forming a golden triangle.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.520
Represented by phi,
the golden ratio

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.220
is the only number which has
the mathematical property

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.710
of its square being
one more than itself.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.000
And there's a whole video
on phi on the Khan Academy,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.520
and I suggest you watch it.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.730
It will give you chills.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.030
And if you watch that and
you do this problem here,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.130
you'll have even more chills.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.140
But let's just try to
tackle this problem.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.580
So they say that phi plus
1 is phi squared, which

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.770
is neat by itself.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.220
And this is where they just
write out what phi looks like.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.480
So phi is approximately 1.61803.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.110
It keeps going on and on and on.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.620
Plus 1 is going to be 1.61803
on and on and on squared,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.730
which is 2.61803.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.300
So it's just another
way of expressing this.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.060
They tell us by applying
the Pythagorean equation

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.680
to this equation, a
right triangle with sides

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.000
phi square root of phi
and 1 is constructed.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.220
So what are they saying?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.220
Let's say, well look, this looks
kind of like the Pythagorean

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.080
equation, or the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.150
If we make this a squared,
we make this b squared,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.450
and we make this c
squared, you could

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.960
think about that as
expressing the relationship

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.175
between the sides
of a right triangle

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:14.430
where our hypotenuse
c is equal to phi,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.485
that this side, the shorter
side b, is equal to 1--

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:21.460
the square root of 1 is just
1-- and the longer side, but not

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.030
the longest, the longer of
the two non hypotenuse sides,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.716
is going to be the
square root of phi.

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:29.840
That's all they're saying
with that first sentence.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.640
As shown below, and this is
a little bit mind blowing.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.840
As shown below, the radii
of the Earth and moon

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.367
are in proportion to phi.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:38.200
So this is exciting.

00:01:42.457 --> 00:01:44.040
Let me do this in a
color you can see.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.690
If you were to take
the Earth's radius-- So

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.767
that's this radius
right over here.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.100
I keep wanting to change
colors, and I'm having trouble.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.630
So if you were to take
the Earth's radius

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.880
and add it to the
moon's radius, the sum

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.750
of those two radii, the ratio
of that sum to Earth's radii

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.860
is the square root of phi.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.119
And that just makes you
think about the universe

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.660
a little bit.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.569
You should just pause
that video and ponder.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.110
Who cares about this
actual question?

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.943
Well, we should answer
the question as well,

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:16.072
but that's kind of
eerie because this

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:17.530
isn't the only
place this shows up.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.090
This shows up throughout nature
and throughout mathematics.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.990
It's just a fascinating number
for a whole set of reasons,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.920
and this is just a
little bit eerie.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.890
But anyway, we have
a problem to do.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.920
If the radius of the earth
is 6,371 kilometers, then

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.490
what is the radius of the moon?

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.970
So let's actually redraw
this triangle here,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.620
but let's draw it in
terms of kilometers.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.650
Right over here,
the measurements

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.460
are in terms of Earth radii.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.940
This right over here
is 1 Earth radii.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.050
If this is 1 earth radii,
then the entire distance,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.030
the combined radii of
the moon and the Earth,

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.450
is square root of
phi Earth radii,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.860
and the hypotenuse of this
triangle is phi Earth radii.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.550
So this is in terms
of Earth radii,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.030
but let's redraw the
triangle, and let's

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.980
draw it in terms of kilometers.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.355
So let's draw it in
terms of kilometers.

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:17.340
I'll try to draw it
pretty similar to that.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.610
So if we draw it in
terms of kilometers,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.200
and I'm going to do a
very rough drawing of it.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.262
So that's the Earth
right over here.

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:30.720
I'll just draw a
part of the Earth.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.800
I don't have to draw
the whole thing.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.160
I think you get the idea.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.610
And then this is the
moon right over here.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.260
I think you get the idea.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.890
They told us that the radius of
the Earth is 6,371 kilometers.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.570
Well, they also told us
that this height, the height

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.020
of this right triangle, is
square root of phi Earth radii.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.180
So if we write it in
terms of kilometers

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.780
it's going to be 6,371 times the
square root of phi kilometers.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.900
Square root of phi Earth radii.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.830
So that's this entire
distance right over here.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.329
Now what they want us to figure
out is the radius of the moon.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.089
They want to figure out this
distance right over here.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:25.280
So let's call that r for
the radius of the moon.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.770
So how can we figure out r?

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.570
Well, we also know
what this segment is.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.060
This segment, which
I will do in green,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.380
is also the radius of the Earth.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.320
The Earth is roughly a sphere.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.650
So we could say that this
distance right over here

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.180
is also 6,371 kilometers.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.770
So this actually breaks down
to a fairly simple problem.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.630
The combined radii, we can
write it in two different ways.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.080
We could write it as the radius
of the moon plus the radius

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.579
of the Earth, which
is 6,371 kilometers.

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:05.620
And we'll just assume that
everything we're doing

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.380
is in kilometers now.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:14.902
And we can write it as, the
combined radii, as 6,371 times

00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:15.860
the square root of phi.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.370
Once again, the combined
radii is square root of phi

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.230
times the length of
the Earth's radius.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.700
So here we just have it
in terms of Earth radii.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.626
Here we have it in
terms of kilometers.

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:34.750
This is the Earth's radius.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.541
You multiply that times
square root of phi,

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:39.187
you get the combined radius.

00:05:39.187 --> 00:05:40.770
Well, now we just
have to solve for r.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.080
We can subtract 6,371
from both sides,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.320
and we get r is equal to 6,371
times the square root of phi,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.530
minus 6,371.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.540
And if we want, we
could factor a 6,371

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.565
from both of those
terms, and we would

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:13.300
get r is equal to 6,371 times
square root of phi minus 1.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.770
And we are done.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.468
And this is still pretty
neat and pretty cool.
