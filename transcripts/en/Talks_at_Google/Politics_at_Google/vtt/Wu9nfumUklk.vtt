Welcome to "What the Flick?!"

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.530
-I finished watching it, and
I thought, oh, that was nice.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.140
-Welcome to "Nerd Alert" at CES.

-We want to completely
revitalize the Democratic Party

and make it a party
of the people.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.520
-What's happening to
millennials, the demographic

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.708
that's most impacted by this?

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.118
-[BLEEP] yeah!

00:06:07.044 --> 00:06:08.210
CENK UYGUR: Thank you, guys.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.340
That was very nice.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.660
JOE: Cenk, welcome to Google.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.104
Welcome to Chicago.

00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:15.270
CENK UYGUR: Thank you, guys.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.310
Thank you.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.230
We're not Google, you're Google.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.630
JOE: So tell me, you just
shared a story with me

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.420
when you flew in
here to Chicago.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.832
How big is TYT?

00:06:26.832 --> 00:06:27.890
5 billion views.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.490
We've just seen it.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.520
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, so it's
one thing to see the numbers,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.340
and people throw around
numbers, et cetera.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.630
It's another thing to
see it in real life.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.970
So this morning,
I'm getting a cab

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.590
from the hotel to come here.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.990
And the guy in the cab
says to me, oh my god!

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.400
I just saw you this morning!

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.950
I was just watching you!

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.230
And he said, this is
like out of a movie.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.510
But the cool part of that
story is that he then

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.550
explained to me that he was
making breakfast for his son,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.350
and that they now have
a morning ritual where

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.460
they flip around YouTube,
and they watch it together.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.544
So it's a whole new world.

00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:05.085
In the old days,
that would have been

00:07:05.085 --> 00:07:07.700
local news, or that would have
been "Good Morning America."

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.580
Now, they probably don't
even know what that is.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.060
And it used to be people
under the age of 25

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.800
had no idea about old media.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.140
Now, I think, it's under
the age of 35 have no idea.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.430
When I go to talk to young
audiences, and I ask them,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.670
does anyone know who's
the primetime news

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.150
anchor of ABC, CBS, or NBC?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.620
None of them know.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.900
None of them.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.850
JOE: Yeah.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.880
So yeah, today, we want to talk
a bit about your history, who

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.570
you are, so that people get
an idea what formed you.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.180
And then we will talk a
bit about The Young Turks,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.560
who The Young Turks
are, what defines you,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.870
really, as a news program.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.372
And also, in particular,
about the change

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:52.830
we're seeing in
the news landscape,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.940
in the media landscape in
general, fueled by technology

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.520
and particularly the internet.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.707
And in the end, a bit
of the current landscape

00:08:01.707 --> 00:08:03.040
we're seeing with the elections.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.800
Cool?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.508
CENK UYGUR: Yeah.

00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:09.140
JOE: So, Cenk, I did a bit
of research, and obviously,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.530
Wikipedia, a very trusted
source of everyone

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.130
in the millennial
landscape here.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.730
You moved to the US with your
parents when you were eight.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.771
CENK UYGUR: That's right.

00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:19.810
JOE: Can you tell us a
bit of your background?

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.470
CENK UYGUR: Sure.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.030
So we're in the best of times,
we're in the worst of times.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.800
And the worst of
times is easy to see.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.990
You see the terrorism,
you see Donald Trump.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.570
But we forget the best of times.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.530
So let me give you
some context there.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.590
In 1820, the average life
expectancy was 35 years old.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.909
So I'd have been
long dead by now.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.340
And 1820's not that long ago,
just a couple hundred years.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.900
And the reason I
bring that up is

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.340
because my dad grew
up as an olive farmer

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.960
in southeastern Turkey.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.700
And one of the
revolutions people

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.990
don't talk about is
public education.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.490
So he wound up getting
public education all the way

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:58.340
through college.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.600
He earned his way, and got
a free public education

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.590
in Istanbul, and became
a mechanical engineer.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.670
Otherwise, we'd have never
gotten off that farm.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.180
Right now, I'd be an olive
farmer in southeastern Turkey,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.790
getting shelled by ISIS.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.100
So we have made a tremendous
amount of progress.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.190
And so my dad got to build
a business in Turkey.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.770
He sold it.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.442
He came here.

00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:20.900
And I remember when I came
here, and I was eight years old,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.316
because I had lived
in a big city,

00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:25.100
in Istanbul-- lots of
concrete, tall buildings--

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.820
and then we moved to the
suburbs of New Jersey,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.980
and I thought that was nirvana.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.460
I was like, oh my god, look at
this utopia called New Jersey.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.440
There's grass everywhere.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.550
I'm like, this giant house.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.765
I'm like, how many
families are living here?

00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:43.010
They're like, no, just us.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.210
I'm like, this is amazing!

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.940
I love America!

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.030
So that's how we came over.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.380
And then I wound up
getting a decent education,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.400
and off we go.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.830
And so all that
was made possible

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.770
by that earlier revolution.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.560
JOE: OK.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:04.020
And you are very liberal, like
center to very to the left.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.130
But I also heard that you
have been quite conservative

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.230
in the past.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.650
What has really changed you?

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.480
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, so
two things have changed.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.340
Some of my views have
changed a little bit.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.580
But I think that, actually,
Washington has changed more.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.080
I think a lot of my views are
similar to what they were when

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.330
I was growing up as a
so-called liberal Republican

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.359
in New Jersey.

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:31.150
Of course, that just
doesn't exist anymore.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.010
There are no liberal
Republicans left.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.780
But there were when
I was growing up.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:40.240
And so I'm considered way
left, I guess, in America.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.850
I bet in Europe,
I'd be considered

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.270
right down the middle.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.910
I look at Jeremy Corbyn,
and I like his revolution.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.865
I look at some of his
views, and I go, oh,

00:10:47.865 --> 00:10:51.300
that's a little left,
that's a little left.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.340
I'm going to do a town
hall at YouTube Space LA

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.300
this Friday with Jill Stein.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.550
And John Oliver just quoted
one of my earlier interviews

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.210
with her in his show on Sunday.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.720
And in that section,
we're talking

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.500
about how she's going to
get rid of all student debt.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.508
And I was like, oh, that's
a little left, that's

00:11:10.508 --> 00:11:11.970
a little left.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.300
So what changed?

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.020
One, my eyes got open to the
marketing of the Republicans.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.150
They're great at marketing.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.880
So they'll say, OK, we
want to balance the budget.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.380
Really?

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.020
You got a funny
way of showing it.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.290
The last Republican
president to leave office

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.766
with a balanced budget
was Dwight Eisenhower,

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:33.140
who, by the way,
now would be too

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.900
liberal for the
Democratic Party.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.790
So the entire
spectrum has changed.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.830
They're like, oh my
god, we hate amnesty.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.610
Who did amnesty?

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:41.610
Ronald Reagan.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.670
Flat out amnesty.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.550
And so I think
there's some chance

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.720
that Reagan, in some
of his positions,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.080
would be considered too
liberal for the Democrats, let

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.280
alone the Republicans.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.070
So there's been this
massive rightward shift,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.180
But in the political
landscape in Washington,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.430
not in the country.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.850
If you do polling
in the country,

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.940
America is solidly progressive
on almost every single issue--

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.720
immigration, taxes, social
security, you name it.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.390
And then, of course,
the Iraq War.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.730
Al Gore was the first
Democrat I ever voted for.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.770
I watched the debates.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.820
I have eyes.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.740
And I was like, the one guy is
way smarter than the other guy.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.667
And then once Bush got into
office, and he's like, oh,

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:25.500
we're going to Iraq.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.010
I'm like, what?

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:26.634
I don't get it.

00:12:26.634 --> 00:12:28.310
They didn't attack us.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.680
Why are people missing
the big picture of they

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.380
did not attack us?

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.450
And so I was off that
crazy train at that point.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.480
And then they started
torturing people,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.060
and that's not what
I signed up for.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.870
So that was a super easy
decision by that time.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.270
JOE: OK.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.790
Let's switch gears a bit and
talk about The Young Turks.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.610
So it started out
as a radio show,

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.339
and now you're at a stage where
you have 5 billion, right?

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:55.380
CENK UYGUR: That's right.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.070
JOE: 5 billion views and
8 million subscribers

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.400
across the network.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.080
Can you tell us what, the
step was from a radio show

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.740
to actually an
online video show?

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.740
CENK UYGUR: So there's a
couple aspects to that.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.690
First, I always wanted to do
online video, even way before I

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.700
started the radio show.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.150
So back in '98, I wrote
an email to my friends,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.580
and I said, online video
is going to take off,

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.872
and it is going to
merge/replace TV.

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:27.330
And they're like,
oh, you're crazy.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.800
That will never happen.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.050
And I'm like, no, I'm
positive it's going to happen.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.630
And so at the time that we
started The Young Turks,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.040
it was 2002.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.050
We were as leading edge as we
could be within our resources.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.200
So we were the first
original talk show

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.140
for Sirius satellite radio.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.720
So we started that
in my living room

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.900
because I had no resources.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.340
We were in a one-bedroom
apartment off of Sunset in LA.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.720
And we bought a couple of
mics and a radio thing,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.110
and got going.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.400
And then at the end of '05,
I'm at a diner with a friend

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.330
of mine, Jim Gilliam,
who's a genius guy,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.910
eventually started
NationBuilder.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.576
And I said, look,
Jim, I've been wanting

00:14:05.576 --> 00:14:08.599
to do online radio
since back in '98,

00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:10.140
way before I started
The Young Turks.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.470
He said, OK, great,
let's do it tomorrow.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.820
And I said, what do you
mean "let's do it tomorrow"?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.140
He's like, I know how to do it.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.920
He's like, you buy the
cameras, I'll come set it up.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.700
And we did.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.182
And we're like, OK.

00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:22.890
And Jim's like, I love
giving you advice.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.530
You're the only one who
actually acts on it.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.850
People say they want advice,
they don't want advice.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.616
They just want affirmation.

00:14:29.616 --> 00:14:30.990
I'm like, no,
that's a good idea.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.887
I'm doing it right now.

00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:34.470
And we didn't know
what we were doing.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.180
We got a little
place on Wilshire.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.300
It was an office building.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.830
We didn't know you
needed high ceilings.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.454
We didn't know anything
about lighting.

00:14:41.454 --> 00:14:43.930
So we got this
tiny little office,

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.280
and we put a wooden table in the
front, giant radio microphones

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.480
that covered up our face.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.087
And we got started,
the lights in our head.

00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:55.420
And then you know what happened?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.200
One, YouTube happened.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.310
And two, the audience happened.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.150
So it was not just that
we gained the audience.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.639
It was that the
audience-- that's

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:05.930
why I said it in that video,
we're not The Young Turks,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.020
you're The Young Turks.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.270
We formed a symbiotic
relationship

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.380
where they were
part of the show.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:17.224
First suggestion they had for
us was move the goddamn mics.

00:15:17.224 --> 00:15:19.140
They're like, we don't
care about you and Ben,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.290
but Jill is gorgeous.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.535
Move the mic.

00:15:21.535 --> 00:15:23.320
Move the mic, all right?

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.030
And then they would
literally send in, hey,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.290
this is the lav mic
you need to buy.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.260
It goes on your jacket.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.450
And here are the specs on it.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.600
Some other guy came
in with TriCaster,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.770
like an old school
TriCaster we needed.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.761
He's like, here, just take it.

00:15:41.761 --> 00:15:43.240
And we're like,
oh, that's awesome.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.880
Now we can switch the cameras.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.820
It doesn't have
to be one camera.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.110
And so we just built it
together with the audience.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:55.410
And I think, even more to the
central point of your question,

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.130
we gave them an alternative.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.820
And when we were on the radio
but also in online video,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.000
people would most often say
to us in the YouTube comments,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.360
and the emails, and
later, in Twitter, you

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.780
are a voice in the wilderness.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.090
I thought I was alone.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.890
And there was a mom
in North Carolina who

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.140
would put her kid in the car
and drive around, and around,

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.700
and around to listen to us
back when we were on the radio.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.520
Because she's like, I couldn't
believe what I was hearing.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.500
I'm like, that's right.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.291
That's why there's no
one else saying that.

00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:24.900
That's right.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.490
And so one part of it
was that nobody was doing

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.202
anything that was progressive.

00:16:32.202 --> 00:16:34.410
If you just look at that
from a business perspective,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.610
that's mental.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.740
You're leaving 50%--
I would argue 60%--

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.110
of the market
completely untapped.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.890
What kind of business
people are you?

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.807
JOE: Why do you think
that is actually the case?

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:49.640
CENK UYGUR: Which leads
to the second point,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.400
which gets to your question.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.610
I think the bigger
part of it is not

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.600
so much that we're progressive,
but that we were doing it

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.430
from an outsider perspective,
and almost everyone else

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.560
was doing it from an
insider perspective.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.320
News.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.230
So they have the big
shiny studios on CNN.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.670
And they have all these people
who worked in government,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.619
and was a spokesperson for this
and a spokesperson for that.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:11.560
That's not the answer.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.750
That's the problem.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.060
So you're giving everybody
an insider perspective.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.930
And the guy sitting at home in
Wichita, he's not an insider,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.040
he's an outsider.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.710
He's part of the Rebel Alliance.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.558
He doesn't want to be part
of your Death Star, right?

00:17:24.558 --> 00:17:25.099
JOE: Love it.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.540
CENK UYGUR: So that actually
gives us 98% of the audience.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.950
And I'm being kind to
them, leaving them 2%.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.040
So I think that's
what resonated.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.880
And the reason why
no one else does

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.350
it is because in the old days,
if you wanted to set up a media

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.250
company, especially
in television,

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.357
you needed to be a
multibillion dollar company.

00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:46.815
You needed all that
infrastructure.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:48.210
You needed distribution.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.700
You needed to buy
your way into it.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.616
And when you're a
multibillion dollar company,

00:17:51.616 --> 00:17:54.660
you ain't the Rebel Alliance,
you're the Death Star.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.790
And so luckily, the internet has
changed that dynamic completely

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.440
because it has now empowered
many Rebel Alliances

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.310
and flipped the paradigm.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.000
But for old media,
they couldn't get out

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.870
of their insider perspective
because it just trickled down

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.700
from the top all the way down
to the anchors, what I call,

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.310
not news anchors,
but news actors.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.870
They're hired to read
a script, pre-approved.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.905
And it comes all the way
down from management.

00:18:23.905 --> 00:18:25.780
Not that the management
writes their scripts.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.270
It doesn't work that way.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.140
But management
hires the producers,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.970
who hires the anchors, who
all have the same perspective.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.400
So that's why they
couldn't do it.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.260
They couldn't do it
even if they wanted to.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.130
JOE: Yeah, and for people
who don't know The Young

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.530
Turks-- like me, for example,
I moved to the US a year ago,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.999
and that's how I came
across your channel--

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.790
how would you really
define The Young Turks

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.382
and what you do on your
channel and particularly

00:18:50.382 --> 00:18:51.090
the main channel?

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.440
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, so we want
to be a digital campfire

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.780
for the world.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.060
So in the old days, the one
good thing was we had campfires.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.056
So we had "Seinfeld."

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.430
Everybody would
watch "Seinfeld,"

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.180
and everybody would
talk about "Seinfeld."

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.260
We had the Super Bowl.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.650
Super Bowl's still around.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.040
And we would have
some news programs

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.735
that everybody watched,
maybe "Good Morning America"

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:14.380
or "Today Show," et cetera.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.530
Use these water coolers,
campfires, however you

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.600
want to call it.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.370
I want to recreate that
for the digital age.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.390
And so I think
The Young Turks is

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.210
where people come to
find out about the news,

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.330
discuss the news.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.261
And it's not just us
discussing it, which we do,

00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:31.510
but it's also in the comments.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.480
That's why we're among
the top YouTube channels

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.880
on number of comments per video.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.540
I think we were
at 14-- now, we're

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.880
at 1,600 comments per video.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.640
And the same is true
across all the platforms.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.760
Because that's where people
gather to discuss that news.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.890
So it's about news, and I want
to be the global news leader.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.946
And I think we're
going to replace CNN,

00:19:53.946 --> 00:19:55.820
and I think we're going
to do that, honestly,

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.530
relatively easily.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.360
But it's not just
about the news.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.750
It's about a discussion about
what is happening in the world

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.200
today, so whatever
is relevant to you.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.570
So the old school way
of thinking of news

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.500
is, OK, hardcore
politics, yada yada.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.190
The new way of thinking about
it is whatever is news to you.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.580
So whether it's
entertainment, sports, or it

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.060
could be more granular too.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.250
So we want to go global, but
we also want to go local.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:21.800
JOE: Yeah.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.490
And I think these big
news corporations,

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.590
they profit from their
access and their resources.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.790
But I've seen, now, Jill Stein,
Bernie Sanders on your channel.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.230
You have Jordan Chariton,
a guy outside in the field,

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.220
basically.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.120
How do you see the
future playing out

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.220
for TYT, especially on
that access and resources

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.800
perspective?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.996
Because I think
that's a big part.

00:20:44.996 --> 00:20:45.704
CENK UYGUR: Yeah.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:49.600
Well, that's our biggest
challenge because-- it's funny.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.400
In the valley, Silicon
Valley, they always

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.332
say, oh, they want disruptors.

00:20:54.332 --> 00:20:55.790
But when they see
a real disruptor,

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.192
they get a little
freaked out by it.

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:00.400
Like They want a disruptor
that's like the same thing

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.500
they've always seen-- a
young guy out of Stanford,

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.430
played in a jazz
band, yada yada.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.770
That's not a disruptor.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.770
So when we go shake their
house a little bit, and we say,

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.620
no, no, we're going to
pulverize the news business

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.270
as you know it.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.860
This was new media.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.110
And we came up organically.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.570
And we came up
with the audience.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.060
And here's our plan for
having more Jordan Charitons

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.842
in the field.

00:21:26.842 --> 00:21:29.050
So that's our investigative
reporter, field reporter,

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.750
he's done a great, great job.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.930
Yesterday, I was
in Seattle doing

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.120
a TV show, Young
Turks on Fusion,

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.860
talked to about 200 people in
the audience after the show.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.484
They were like, oh, give us more
of that, give us more of that.

00:21:40.484 --> 00:21:42.186
And I want to.

00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:43.560
So when you go to
some investors,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.300
it makes them a
little uncomfortable.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.653
Oh, Bernie Sanders?

00:21:47.653 --> 00:21:49.910
Ugh, he'd raise my taxes.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.780
Damn straight he would.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.690
And so that's a dynamic
we've gotta deal with.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.530
It's not easy.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.560
So we have a subscription model.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.390
We have, obviously,
ads on YouTube.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.630
We've got YouTube Red.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.260
Got ads on other platforms.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.410
And we cobble this thing
together, and we keep it going.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:11.160
But I think that in order to
get those 10 reporters instead

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.230
of just 1, and really
get out there and cover

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.990
things more dynamically, we're
going to need more resources.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.190
And I think that if
we got around the size

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.710
of normal digital media
companies, watch out.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.760
They'd have almost no
chance of stopping us.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.620
We duct taped this thing
all the way to here.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.410
If you guys knew how little
money was in The Young Turks,

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.670
it is astounding.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.830
How in the world did we beat CNN
with three rolls of duct tape?

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.670
And so I think that we're
the most efficient company,

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.370
probably, in digital media.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.890
And so if we got a real
round, we'd clean up.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.770
JOE: And what are
your plans to do that?

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:57.875
How do you break out of
this small business world

00:22:57.875 --> 00:23:00.180
and into getting the
message out further?

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.920
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, so
resources are real.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.150
There's two ways to do it, and
it's a combination of that.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.150
So number one, we could do this
round that I'm talking about.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.400
If you're at home, you might
not know what I'm saying,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.080
but I think a lot of
people in this room do.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.280
But the way that things
work in the new day and age

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.290
is you go raise big
amounts of money,

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.720
and that's your
resources to grow.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.757
And then you get to-- well,
we would get to profitability.

00:23:25.757 --> 00:23:27.090
A lot of other people just exit.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.570
But that's a whole
nother conversation.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.570
But we're built to last.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.700
So that allows you to
build in a sustainable way,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.930
so you've got more
reporters, more audience,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.660
and you create a virtuous cycle.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.600
And we were just
having a conversation

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.770
internally over the last
couple of weeks on this.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.390
And I think that somebody out
there or several people out

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.180
there are going to go look and
go, oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.790
I gotta get in on that.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.070
And so that will
very likely happen.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.670
But the other way
is just organically,

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.620
like we've been doing it for
14 years and 10 years online.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.210
And so the subscription
model is what

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.850
allowed us to hire
Jordan, which allowed

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.330
us to break so many
stories in this news cycle.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.780
The subscription
model has allowed

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.790
us to add more shows, including
"Aggressive Progressive."

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.090
They thought I wasn't
progressive enough,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.610
so they wanted more
aggressive progressives.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.820
And we started a whole
show called that.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.020
And so the more that
people pay $10 a month,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.210
the more we can give them.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.850
And that's what we do.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.475
We just take the
money, and we grow it,

00:24:31.475 --> 00:24:33.860
we grow it, more
reporting, more shows.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:34.360
JOE: Yeah.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.860
Let's focus a bit
more on that part,

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.230
especially on the
independent media part.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.720
Because that's how you
really differentiate yourself

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.786
from CNN, MSNBC,
Fox News, et cetera,

00:24:44.786 --> 00:24:47.140
because you're not
held-- you don't

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.550
have any huge investors that
basically tell you what to do.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.870
So from that
perspective, what do you

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.220
think are the advantages?

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.490
And what are you
really struggling

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.820
with as an independent media?

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.480
CENK UYGUR: Yeah,
so the struggle

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.945
is what you would expect.

00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:09.320
Here, let me make
it real for you

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.100
guys, a concrete
example that gives you

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.020
a sense of what it means to
be at a resource disadvantage.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.660
So everybody keeps coming to
us and saying, why aren't you

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.890
guys on Snapchat?

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.590
Now, not in this
building, they're not.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.633
Well, OK, yeah,
CNN's on Snapchat,

00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:29.770
and XYZ's on Snapchat.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.450
Well, Snapchat demands
original programming,

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.890
and it's structured to
their specific platform.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.630
And I've done research,
and other companies

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.910
have, literally, 30-person
teams for their Snapchats.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.390
Well, yes, CNN can afford
to throw away millions

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.369
upon millions upon millions
of dollars every year

00:25:50.369 --> 00:25:51.910
trying to build some
sort of audience

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.840
on Snapchat, which is, by
the way, never going to work.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.800
Which 24-year-old or
12-year-old is like, oh,

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.630
everybody, quiet, quiet,
Wolf is on, right?

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.670
But they can throw
a 30-person team

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.870
at it, which is a giant
amount of resources.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.307
I don't have a 30-person team.

00:26:08.307 --> 00:26:09.265
That's half my company.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.390
Would I love to be on
all those platforms?

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.017
Yes.

00:26:15.017 --> 00:26:17.350
But those are the things that
we've gotta struggle with.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.530
And they've got bureaus all
over the world, and we will too,

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.760
but it takes us more
time to get there.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.340
But the advantage is
I'm not encumbered

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:33.630
by all of their
monumental disadvantages.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.040
They can't turn the damn ship.

00:26:37.552 --> 00:26:38.760
What are their disadvantages?

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.740
They're reading from a
prompter, everybody knows it.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.610
Even if they don't know it,
they feel it in their gut.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.620
Why is that guy not talking
to me like a human being?

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.270
Why are they all robots?

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.870
So I remember watching this
local news in Louisiana

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.990
when I was down there
a bunch of years ago,

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.196
and she talked like this.

00:26:55.196 --> 00:26:57.320
And you guys will all
recognize it from local news.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.175
The number of ambulances
have doubled, but so

00:27:00.175 --> 00:27:01.383
have the number of accidents.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.120
Who talks like that?

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.400
Why did they convince
themselves that that's

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.454
the way that a
"professional" should talk?

00:27:12.454 --> 00:27:14.620
Maybe a professional robot,
but I wouldn't have even

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.670
programmed it that way.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.940
So they're stuck on the scripts,
and they can't get off of it.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.370
That's so inauthentic.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.420
You guys know that's never
going to work online.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.840
They're stuck on access.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.280
Oh my god, I need to get
Governor Kasich on my show

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.370
and Senator [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:32.310
No, you don't.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.580
They're super boring.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.180
And the audience does
not believe them,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.160
does not trust them.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.390
I remember when I
was at MSNBC, one

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.490
of the stylistic points
they had for me was act more

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.810
like a senator.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:46.980
I was like, why?

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.830
Why would you act
more like a senator?

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.040
They're the dullest
people in the world.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.200
Nobody's going to watch that.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.459
And so when they're
stuck on access,

00:27:56.459 --> 00:27:58.250
they're stuck on their
insider perspective,

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.740
they're stuck on
their prompters.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.450
And they're like, well,
OK-- I finally got--

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.290
and they fought me on this
in the beginning at MSNBC,

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.940
and they did it even more
so after I left-- sometimes,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.632
the anchors are now allowed
to take off their tie.

00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:14.870
Ooh.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.010
That's rearranging the
chairs on the Titanic.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.602
So they see the iceberg, they
know what their audience-- you

00:28:21.602 --> 00:28:22.310
guys know, right?

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.560
The average audience, the
median age of the CNN viewer

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.240
is 64 years old.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.740
At Fox, it's 68.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.020
At Bill O'Reilly, it's 72.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.520
Pfft.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520
JOE: And at TYT?

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:42.110
CENK UYGUR: At TYT, we're
70% 18 to 34-year-olds, 70%.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.530
They are doomed.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.910
They have no chance against us.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.910
I don't know if you guys have
read "David and Goliath,"

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.450
the Malcolm Gladwell book.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.230
And he flips it on its head,
and he's absolutely right.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.460
It's not that, oh, David
the underdog beat Goliath.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.180
No, David was the favorite.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.190
He had a slingshot.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.650
He could just fire
from a distant.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:02.350
Boom!

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.577
Goliath had no chance.

00:29:03.577 --> 00:29:05.160
How the hell is he
going to reach him?

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.480
He's got a slingshot.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.360
It's like a gun.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.770
He's like, oh, yeah,
I have a big sword.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:09.310
Boom!

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.210
Like Indiana Jones, right?

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.709
So we have a slingshot
called the internet.

00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:16.000
They're never going to beat us.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.880
They have no chance.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.950
JOE: Yeah, actually, that's
a good segue to my next point

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:21.540
there.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.870
We talked about how the
media landscape has changed,

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.640
but no question, the
internet and technology

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.130
has enabled that.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.290
How do you think, also, the
news consumption of, especially,

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:37.720
the millennials has changed
the consumption piece of it?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.960
CENK UYGUR: Yeah.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.260
So I think the millennials
are consuming news

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.652
in a lot of different ways.

00:29:42.652 --> 00:29:43.870
So let's keep it real.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.270
They're also consuming
it in small snippets,

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.140
so whether it's on Facebook,
Snapchat, or on YouTube.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.530
There's the memes, which, oy--
please double check the memes.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.119
Memes are not journalism.

00:29:58.119 --> 00:29:59.660
And there's some
good ones out there.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.070
We've used some
from time to time.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.980
But that's not a thing.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.730
That's not a fact.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.790
And how many Republican memes
have an asterisk and then

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.630
a link to the article?

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.040
None.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.560
So anyway, but then there's like
the quick 30 second thing, hey,

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.730
here's what happened today.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:17.610
Nothing wrong with that.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.200
That's the way that
people consume news.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.158
And then if they want a
little bit of analysis,

00:30:21.158 --> 00:30:25.180
they come to us, or
commentary, or just really,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.680
as I said before, discussion.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.010
And it's as old as time.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.330
When I was growing up, I used
to listen to Howard Stern.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.290
And it's in the morning.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.120
It's radio in the morning.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.180
I already know the news.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.040
I was a kid who cared
about the world.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.110
So I had already listened
to Peter Jennings,

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.730
and I knew what the news was.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.279
I went to Howard
because I can't wait

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:50.070
to see what Howard's
going to say about it.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.530
I didn't care about
the rest of his show.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.613
I mean, lesbians are fine.

00:30:52.613 --> 00:30:55.191
But all the other
characters and stuff

00:30:55.191 --> 00:30:56.440
like that actually annoyed me.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.370
I was like, just get
to the news already.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.130
And him and Robin would do the
news, and it was a campfire.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.190
I was in Scotland, and
we were touring castles.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.020
I love Scotland.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.040
I love castles.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.880
And I was really
interested to see they

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.700
had seven jobs at
the castle-- the guy

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.550
that protected the
castle, and the guy

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.160
who ruled the
castle, and the cook,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.500
all these things you'd expect.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.600
But one of the seven
was storyteller.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.960
It's as old as time.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.419
Because they needed
a storyteller.

00:31:24.419 --> 00:31:25.960
They needed
entertainment, otherwise,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.620
they're going to lose their
mind inside that castle.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.409
So we're the storytellers
for the internet.

00:31:31.409 --> 00:31:32.950
JOE: And we're in
a castle right now.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.770
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, we
are at Google fortress.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:35.686
It was hard to get in.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.720
JOE: Yeah, so you
mentioned it-- Facebook,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.730
Twitter, YouTube-- they all
accelerate the speed in what

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.110
news flows and gets shared.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.140
Mobile devices get cheaper and
cheaper and more widespread.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.310
Internet access
across the world.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.800
How do you see this
space, this landscape,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:04.310
of technology and news develop
in the next 5 to 10 years?

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.950
Now that everyone has access
not only to information,

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.470
but also can spread the news,
and create actually content,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.160
and it's basically democratized.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.920
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, so
I'm looking forward

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.970
to how we can
democratize our reporting

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.680
and our hosting even
more than we already do.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.419
We have this program
called TYT Next where we

00:32:28.419 --> 00:32:29.710
do auditions from time to time.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.900
We're going to start
a new show, let's say

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.280
it's an entertainment show,
we bring in a ton of people

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.060
like anybody would,
and we go through them.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.450
But we also find people
from our audience.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.550
Now our second largest
channel is "Think Tank,"

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.360
and the host and
executive producer of that

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.640
is John Iadarola.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.890
He was a kid at the
University of Texas

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.310
who was sending in videos to us.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.200
We're like, he's pretty good.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.030
And we had him come in,
work as an intern, then

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.340
a producer, then a host.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.661
And then he took over
one of the channels

00:32:59.661 --> 00:33:01.910
and made it the second largest
channel on the network.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.480
I believe in that.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.420
I think there's a great
resource of talent

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.735
all across the country,
all across the globe.

00:33:11.735 --> 00:33:13.820
TYT Next has
struggled a little bit

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:18.680
because lack of resources-- I
need curators, I need editors.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.910
So it's not the hosting
that's the issue at all.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.880
A bunch of great
tapes were sent in,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.540
but we've got to have the
manpower to curate all that,

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.950
get it up on the air.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.940
So people are always
talking about, hey, I

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.750
got phones wherever I am.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:32.811
I could just record it.

00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:33.310
Great.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.140
I want you to do that.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.056
And they will do that.

00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:36.970
And we will air it
on The Young Turks.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:37.890
But I need editors.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:38.910
I need curators.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.370
I need to set up
the infrastructure

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.020
to make that happen.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.440
So just being realistic about
how we're going to get there.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.290
But again, I'd rather
be us than them

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.406
when you look at-- to the
core of your question--

00:33:51.406 --> 00:33:52.280
how is news consumed?

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.550
Right now, nobody watches
the primetime news.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.570
There's still
70-year-olds, and that's

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.280
why they've got 7 million
people left watching those

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.500
that are left over and such.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.699
But even my dad is 78,
and I said, but, Dad,

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.380
every night, you used
to come home and watch

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.531
Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw.

00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:14.780
Why don't you do that anymore?

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.449
He's like, why I watch them?

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.647
I already got news online.

00:34:19.647 --> 00:34:20.230
And it's true.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.688
Why would you have
them regurgitate

00:34:21.688 --> 00:34:23.719
the news you already read?

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.830
So that is a hopeless model.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.520
And I was flying
in this morning,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.360
and I'm sitting next to a guy,
and he's in his 60s, I guess.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.051
And as people are coming onto
the plane, they're like, hey,

00:34:36.051 --> 00:34:36.550
Cenk.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.265
Hey, Young Turks.

00:34:37.265 --> 00:34:38.139
Hey, I love the show.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.030
I watch the show.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.699
And after, I don't know
however many of these guys

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.830
do it, he turns around to
me and goes, who are you?

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.330
Because he doesn't know
it from his perspective,

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.210
but all those guys on
that plane are never

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.190
going to watch-- by the
way, the correct answer

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.780
is David Muir on ABC News.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.430
David Muir?

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.010
Who's going to watch David Muir?

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.030
Nobody, the answer is
nobody, in 5 to 10 years.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.970
Nobody.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.690
So I think they're going
to shut some stuff down.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.350
And by the way, now
I'm getting really

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.170
inside baseball on
the financials here,

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.920
but if you look at
CNN's financials,

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.100
1/3 of their revenue
comes from advertising.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.140
2/3 comes from the cable
bundle, the subscription.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.850
And every year, that goes down,
for the moment being, about 4%

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.540
a year.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.050
It's going to speed up
to about 10% a year.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:32.410
Now if 2/3 of your revenue is
getting watered down like that,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.190
and you've built a giant Death
Star that costs a gazillion

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.520
dollars, well, you can't
afford that Death Star anymore.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.070
So I don't know what happens
to CNN 10 years from now.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.530
I know what happens to MSNBC.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:43.700
That's hopeless.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.830
They're goners.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.440
Fox News is in much better
shape because at least they

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.670
know who their audience is, and
they can serve that audience.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:54.000
CNN is going to be
drifting in space, kind

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.423
of like Sandra Bullock
in "Gravity," like, oh,

00:35:57.423 --> 00:35:58.830
just doing circles.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.620
But at some point,
I think they're

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.930
going to literally have to shut
down the old way they do news.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.780
JOE: OK.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.185
Are you looking forward to
the new Star Wars movie?

00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:10.143
CENK UYGUR: Apparently.

00:36:10.143 --> 00:36:11.472
A lot of references.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.240
JOE: We have 10 more
minutes before we open it up

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.740
to the questions
of the audience,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.270
so I want you guys to start
thinking about questions.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.820
And we have two
microphones over here.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.280
10 minutes roughly.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.910
But let's shift gears and give
you a bit of context here.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.400
Obviously, three
weeks out from today,

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.892
we have the US elections.

00:36:33.892 --> 00:36:36.380
I would argue one of the
biggest elections in the world.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:43.100
And it was actually one
year ago, a good year ago,

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.170
when I moved to the US.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.390
I wasn't really into politics.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:49.720
But I developed a weird
fascination-- and my colleagues

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.810
here can definitely prove that--
for this political landscape

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.570
here, how the media plays
into it, the general process.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.890
So I know that definitely,
some of my friends

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.850
are tuning in from Europe.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.810
So people who are
not from the US

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.690
and not familiar with
this entire election

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:13.190
process right now, and let's
say the past 12 to 15 months,

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:18.050
do you mind giving us a synopsis
of what happened, 15 months

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.240
to today?

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:24.360
And I know we have 10 minutes.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.140
And that will give us
a good idea, basically,

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.170
what the perspective of TYT
is and how you basically

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.970
run your shows.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:31.967
CENK UYGUR: Yeah.

00:37:31.967 --> 00:37:32.800
JOE: Take your time.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.690
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, so it's funny
you say 15 months, because I

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.620
think right around
15 months ago,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.720
I made a bet that
Donald Trump would

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.340
win the Republican primary.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.820
And that's probably
inappropriate,

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.030
but we get to make
our own rules.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:53.587
And at the time, people were
like, you're crazy, man.

00:37:53.587 --> 00:37:54.920
Of course he's not going to win.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.160
That's nuts.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:56.940
He's a clown.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.890
Right?

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.610
But what people are
missing and what

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.060
we can see because we
have outsider perspective

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.740
is people are really,
really mad at the system.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.670
And so out in the
country in America,

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.910
they are losing their jobs.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:14.830
They've got no
wage growth at all.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.950
And even if they hung
on to their jobs,

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.540
they can't get their son
or their daughter the job

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.515
that they used to have.

00:38:21.515 --> 00:38:24.430
And a lot of them are
working at Walmart.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.820
And so they used to have
a decent paying job.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.020
They don't anymore.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.640
Then they need to
go on food stamps

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.420
to be able to live because
they're getting minimum wage.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.250
They're angry, man.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.530
And in their mind, they
played by the rules.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:39.740
You told me to go to school.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.390
I went to school.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.431
You told me to work hard.

00:38:41.431 --> 00:38:42.450
I worked hard.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.230
And here I am at fricking
Walmart, and I got no hope.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:51.450
And somebody online said
this analogy, and it's true.

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.980
They want to throw a brick
through the establishment's

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.460
window.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.440
And that brick happens to
take the form of Donald Trump.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.920
And their anger is misdirected.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.210
So I talk to Republicans
all the time,

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.910
and I think I've done a
fair job of converting

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.900
a lot of Republicans
into progressives.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.250
And it's because I
ask them, OK, you're

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.566
getting screwed by the system.

00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:19.440
I think you're right.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.670
I can prove to you
how you're right.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.680
Now who do you
think did it to you?

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.509
The most powerless
people in the country?

00:39:25.509 --> 00:39:27.800
The Mexican immigrant that
just crossed the border that

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.930
has no power at all?

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.860
Or the most powerful
people in the country?

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.400
Well, come on,
that's a no-brainer.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.640
You know the real answer.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.630
It's the most powerful
people in the country.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.960
And they have that sense
too, like, ah, the powerful

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.890
are screwing me.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.720
But the Republican Party keeps
telling them, no, no, no,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.595
look away, look away.

00:39:43.595 --> 00:39:44.630
It's the Muslims.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.840
What Muslims?

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.090
They're worried about
Sharia law in Oklahoma.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:52.640
It's a weird, blind
rage because they're

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.990
mad about what's going
on in their lives.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:57.440
So even they don't
believe it's really

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.330
black people's faults, or
Mexicans' faults, or Muslims'

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:00.960
faults.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.251
But they feel like, I gotta
have somebody underneath me

00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:05.800
because I'm working at Walmart,
and I'm dying over here.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.540
And I gotta feel
better about myself.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.864
And Trump tells me it's the
Mexicans and the Muslims.

00:40:09.864 --> 00:40:11.280
Great, that's what
I want to hear.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.340
But really, what you should
hear is, no, your gut was right.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.720
They did rig the system.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.690
So for example, corporate
taxes used to be about 35%

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.680
of all the taxes in America.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.940
It's now down to about 9%.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.180
The payroll tax--
which is actually

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.250
the most regressive tax, the
one that not only the poor

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.570
and the middle class
pay, but it's capped,

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.040
the rich don't even pay it
after a certain amount--

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.620
that has increased to a much
larger piece of the tax pie.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.180
They shifted the tax
burden from corporations

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.180
onto regular people.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.450
That is one of dozens of
examples I can give you.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.690
Because the Supreme
Court allowed bribery.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:52.860
They said, oh, you can
give campaign donations

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.900
to politicians.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.220
You can give money to Super
PACs, independent expenditures.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.220
Well, that's bribery
by a different name.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.110
And everybody on TV goes, no
bribery, I don't see bribery,

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.000
I don't see any evil,
I don't hear any evil.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.380
Because where does it go?

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.180
In the old days, $4 billion in
an election cycle like this one

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.200
goes straight into
TV advertising.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.485
I say old days, that's today.

00:41:16.485 --> 00:41:18.860
I think it's changing now
because of digital advertising,

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.403
so soon, we'll get corrupted.

00:41:20.403 --> 00:41:21.611
You can look forward to that.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.120
But in all honesty, we have
to be on the lookout for that,

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.652
and you have to
be aware of that,

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:30.610
and you have to see the
trends that are coming.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:35.110
And so in that system where they
were allowed to just give money

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.730
to politicians, and
then, of course,

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.030
they're going to get
back whatever they want.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.529
You give somebody
a million dollars,

00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:41.910
they work for you,
that's the reality.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.286
And so I want to tell
those voters that

00:41:45.286 --> 00:41:46.660
are angry out
there, whether it's

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.840
Republicans or Democrats,
focus your anger in a way that

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.620
is constructive.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.000
And it's not personal.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.750
Hillary Clinton
is not a monster.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.060
She doesn't smell of sulfur.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.430
That's a theory going around.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:01.940
She doesn't have a body double.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.570
She doesn't have dementia.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.600
If she has dementia,
why is she killing

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.160
Donald Trump in the debates?

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.670
I know, low bar,
low bar, but still.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.790
And directing it in the right
way is to fix the system.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:18.370
It's not to be angry at
Hillary Clinton, or Jeb Bush,

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.665
or even Donald Trump,
or Mexicans, or Muslims.

00:42:21.665 --> 00:42:24.040
It's to say, hey, I think
maybe we could do this a better

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.220
way, the way we used
to do it for about 40,

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.380
50 years in this
country after FDR,

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.620
which is we actually have
representatives representing

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.120
us.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.820
It's this crazy idea
called democracy.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.560
And if we get back to democracy
and free and fair elections,

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.660
I think this sorts itself out.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.180
And then you'll be
shocked at how much better

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.490
our representatives are.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.891
In this corrupt system,
what do we have?

00:42:46.891 --> 00:42:49.140
We have Hillary Clinton,
which I think a lot of people

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.910
would argue, is the
corrupted, and Donald Trump,

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:53.580
who is the corruptor.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.830
He brags about it.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.500
In the Republican primaries,
he said, I bought all you guys.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.600
I paid you, and you did
whatever I told you to do.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.690
It's true.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.610
In New York, he
paid Alan Hevesi,

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:07.400
who later went to jail
for corruption, $45,000,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.350
and he got back $150
million tax break.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.860
If you allow that
system, they're

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.110
going to do that all day long.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:15.520
I'd do it.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.790
Who wouldn't give $45,000 to
get a return of $150 million?

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:22.927
So the correct thing
is don't vote for Trump

00:43:22.927 --> 00:43:25.510
because you're mad, and he's got
you convinced that somebody's

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:26.620
lower than you.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.585
Don't settle.

00:43:28.585 --> 00:43:30.210
In the case of Hillary
Clinton, oh, she

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.060
won, I bet she'll fix things.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.550
I got bad news for you.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.070
So fight through activism,
through new media,

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.860
through all of this, to
get to the real change

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.720
that the system needs so we
can get back to democracy.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.770
JOE: Yeah, you're doing it on
one side with your channel,

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:51.374
but I know you're also
doing it with Wolf PAC.

00:43:51.374 --> 00:43:52.540
Can you just share a little?

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.248
CENK UYGUR: Sure.

00:43:53.248 --> 00:43:55.199
So Wolf PAC is a
super PAC I started

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.490
to defeat all other super PACs.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.590
I hear that's impossible,
but I'm kind of

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.706
in the impossible business.

00:44:03.706 --> 00:44:07.220
So I also heard it was
impossible to beat CNN when

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.870
I started in my living room.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.660
So we've been there before.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.230
And so what Wolf PAC
does is it acknowledges

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.700
that our founding fathers
were revolutionaries,

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.260
which is obvious.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.880
And they built a revolutionary
document, the Constitution.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.990
They said the revolution is
this thing called amendments.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.530
So you don't have
to pick up a gun

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:31.400
like we did, you amend this
document as you go along.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.389
You're supposed to.

00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:34.680
And we'll give you two ways
to do it because we really,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.720
really believe in it, because
we're revolutionaries.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:42.246
One way is Congress calls for
an amendment, 2/3 of Congress.

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.870
But they said, at
some point-- and it's

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.030
in the Federalist Papers--
they say, at some point,

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.210
Congress will get too
corrupt, so we're going

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.570
to give you a second option.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:52.210
2/3 of the states can
call for a convention

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.190
specifically for an amendment.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:57.490
And then, no matter what, 3/4
of the states have to ratify it.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:59.410
Don't get me wrong,
the US Constitution

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.590
is the hardest
constitution to amend.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.290
It is not an easy process.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:06.230
But every generation of
Americans has done it.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.410
You know what was
really impossible?

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.670
How in the world can
women get the right

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.110
to vote when they don't
have the right to vote?

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.694
That was impossible.

00:45:16.694 --> 00:45:17.360
And they did it.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.320
That's the 19th Amendment.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.400
So we have a
relatively easy job.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.040
About 90% of the
country agrees with us

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.200
that money is
corrupting politics.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.180
Republicans agree.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.040
Democrats agree.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:29.950
Libertarians agree.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.909
Everybody agrees, money
is corrupting politics.

00:45:31.909 --> 00:45:34.449
When we get that amendment, they
will turn around and go, oh,

00:45:34.449 --> 00:45:34.950
come on.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.574
You shouldn't even
get credit for that.

00:45:36.574 --> 00:45:37.460
That was so easy.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.420
That was inevitable.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.630
You had the whole
country behind you.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.260
And so that's what our job is.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.077
We're going to go to
the states, and we're

00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:46.160
going to get 2/3 of them
to call for a convention.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.470
In that convention, we're going
to discuss election reform.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:49.920
There will be
conservative ideals,

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.097
liberal ideas, every kind
of idea you can have.

00:45:52.097 --> 00:45:54.680
And out of that commission, we
will come up with an amendment.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.263
And then we'll bring
it to the states.

00:45:56.263 --> 00:45:57.870
And 3/4 of it will ratify it.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.090
And we'll fix this system.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.980
That's what we're doing.

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:10.570
JOE: I heard you saying,
also, you're happy to die poor

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.390
and broke, but if
you get this through,

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.550
that would be the
achievement of your life.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.910
CENK UYGUR: I would
prefer not to.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:22.480
No, in all seriousness,
look, sure, material comforts

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:22.980
are great.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.790
And I'm not a hippie
that's like, oh, man,

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.770
I could live on granola
the rest of my life.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.470
I would rather not.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.730
I like food.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.820
But I think of the
Ben Franklin test.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.970
So Benjamin Franklin was running
a local paper in Philadelphia.

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:43.320
Somebody comes up to him and
offers him a lot of money

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.420
to run an ad for, I think
it might have literally

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.980
been snake oil.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.450
And he knows it's not
the right thing to do.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:50.970
He knows the product's bad.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.970
He says, I'm going to get
back to you in a week.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:56.180
And for a week, he sleeps on the
floor, and he eats only bread

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.190
and drinks only water.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.030
He comes back to him
and says, no thank you.

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.320
I'm not going to take that.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.920
I could do that.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.400
So that's the model we use.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.060
So if it turns out I
gotta sleep on the floor,

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.530
and eat bread and drink water,
but we get that amendment,

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.880
I will take that in a second.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.759
Because you know why?

00:47:13.759 --> 00:47:16.050
It's not because I'm a great
guy or anything like that.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.330
It's that fulfillment
is a hell of a drug.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.480
And it feels so good.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.890
And if you actually give
back, and you actually

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.850
get something accomplished
that lasts for a long time

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.640
and that actually
helps people, it's

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.380
the best feeling in the world.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.220
So that's why all the luxuries
and stuff couldn't possibly

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.350
compete with that feeling.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:37.850
I can't imagine
how good it would

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:40.540
feel to pass the 20th
Amendment and actually get

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.980
free and fair elections back.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.780
Be the best feeling
in the world.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.980
JOE: Cool.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.290
All right, so we
have 15 minutes left,

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.950
and we open up the
floor to questions.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.320
I see one, two people already.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:58.430
We also have a Dory, our
internal questionnaire tool,

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.044
so we have a few
questions there.

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.710
CENK UYGUR: Questions
from the internet,

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.267
I would have never expected.

00:48:05.267 --> 00:48:07.350
AUDIENCE: So first, I'll
say thank you for coming.

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.290
Second, I'll say
I've sat next to Joey

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:11.330
since he came to the US.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.079
And in this tornado of whatever
we're going through right now,

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:16.620
and I'm really happy he's had
voices like yours to listen to,

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.920
because if he only listened
to the traditional voices,

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.516
he'd be as confused
as the rest of us.

00:48:21.516 --> 00:48:24.230
The question pertains to
the earlier part of the chat

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.130
where you're talking
about traditional media

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.213
and traditional companies.

00:48:27.213 --> 00:48:28.490
You've worked there.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.110
You know what their stock is.

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:32.420
Do they see you coming?

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.940
When you think of the
taxi companies in Chicago,

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.440
you ask a lot of
these drivers, they

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.110
didn't see Uber coming
from a mile away.

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:40.776
And all of a sudden,
boom, they're here.

00:48:40.776 --> 00:48:42.862
Do you think CNN, Fox,
do they see you coming?

00:48:42.862 --> 00:48:44.220
CENK UYGUR: Mm-hmm.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.450
So that's a great question.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.600
They certainly didn't before.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.610
So some of you know the
story, some of you don't.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.470
I'll do a super
quick version of it.

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:57.540
At MSNBC, I didn't
follow the rules.

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.790
They literally told me to act
more like the establishment,

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:03.260
and they kept
telling me, hey, you

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.565
gotta root for the home team.

00:49:04.565 --> 00:49:06.940
I'm like, the home team's the
audience, what do you mean?

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.559
And they meant the
Democratic Party.

00:49:09.559 --> 00:49:11.350
And so they're a part
of the establishment.

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:14.689
And at some point, they
got a sense this guy is not

00:49:14.689 --> 00:49:15.480
going to play ball.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.190
He's annoying us.

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:18.330
We're going to move him to
the weekends, from 6 o'clock

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.560
at night, we're going to
move him to the weekends,

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.660
but we're going
to double salary.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.310
And they thought, well, of
course he's going to take it.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.540
One, we doubled his salary.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.520
Two, where the hell
else would he go?

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.100
Because in the old days,
there was nowhere to go.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.000
If you're an MSNBC
anchor, you're

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.230
not going to go to Fox News.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:34.557
Likely, CNN won't take you.

00:49:34.557 --> 00:49:35.390
Where are you going?

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.400
You're going back to Milwaukee?

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.640
And so that's a choice that
no one's ever said no to.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.930
And I did, not because,
again, I'm a great guy,

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:48.290
but because I know the potential
of online news and our company.

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:50.310
And for me, that
was a no-brainer.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.140
No, I'm going to go
tell my audience what's

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.310
actually happening.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:55.350
And they were like, what?

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.080
Because they didn't see
the audience coming.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.599
For them, they're
like, oh, that was

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:01.140
that cute little
thing you did to get

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.480
onto the real television.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.720
For me, television is
marketing for my real audience,

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.040
which is online.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.327
And so back then, it totally
took them by surprise.

00:50:11.327 --> 00:50:13.660
They thought it was the
craziest thing they'd ever seen.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.686
These days, it's a
little different.

00:50:16.686 --> 00:50:18.060
I was at the
Brooklyn debate, one

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.040
of the last debates for Bernie
Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.340
And I ran into someone
on CNN's digital team--

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.590
I'll leave our their
names-- but he said,

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:30.540
oh, first thing we check
when the comScore comes out

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.120
is Young Turks.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.572
Because we're number one
in half of the demos,

00:50:34.572 --> 00:50:37.030
they're number one in half the
demos, and we're number two.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.710
And they're number
two on each of those.

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.360
So they see us now.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.480
But those monoliths are-- I
mean, those giant companies.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.200
They're not monoliths,
I should say.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.390
At CNN, there's a million
people in the building.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.320
So some of the anchors come up
and yell at me in the streets,

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.180
like, I saw what
you said about me.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:55.684
That's not fair.

00:50:55.684 --> 00:50:57.975
Some of the other anchors
are like, what is a computer?

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.070
Some of the executives
are like, Jesus Christ,

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:05.030
how the hell is TYT beating us?

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.860
Some of the executives
are like, who are you?

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.540
So right now, it's a mix.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.140
I think at some
point, as they're

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.500
shuttering the
windows and the doors,

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.200
they're going to be like, oh,
we should've seen them coming.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.310
And final thing,
like I said earlier,

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:24.850
even if they see us coming,
they can't move the ship.

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:28.320
They're too used to making
money in the old way.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.720
Some folks in media-- again,
I'll leave out the names--

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.970
are actually forward thinking.

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.260
Really.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.180
Here, I'll say it.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.900
ABC, more forward thinking
than the other old media,

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.314
much more so.

00:51:40.314 --> 00:51:42.480
But I don't know that they
can move the ship either.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.771
They're like, yeah, we see
the handwriting on the wall,

00:51:44.771 --> 00:51:47.694
but-- [GRUNT] Can't move it.

00:51:47.694 --> 00:51:49.110
Because what are
they going to do?

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.810
They're going to take
away the prompters?

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:51.990
I told them to take
away the prompters.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:53.489
They're not going
to take that away.

00:51:53.489 --> 00:51:55.890
Are they going to be
objective rather than neutral?

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:57.292
Neutral is he said, she said.

00:51:57.292 --> 00:51:59.000
Democrats say this,
Republicans say this.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:51:59.930
I'm super safe.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:02.609
I didn't offend anyone.

00:52:02.609 --> 00:52:05.150
Objective is, yeah, Democrats
say this, Republicans say that.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:06.950
And here's what's reality.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.140
And so they can't do it.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.000
They can't say here's reality.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.730
These guys are wrong.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:17.450
On TV, that is almost-- you'll
get fired for saying it.

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:21.280
So they can't move the
ship, and they're doomed.

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.380
JOE: Thank you.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.080
AUDIENCE: Hi, first,
thanks for coming.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.540
My question is I'd love to
hear more of your thoughts

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.630
on commenting and
discussion in general.

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:31.290
So what I found
really fascinating

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:35.560
with The Young Turks is it's
not just people consuming news,

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.162
they're also getting
on discussing it.

00:52:37.162 --> 00:52:38.620
And what's particularly
interesting

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:41.710
about in the digital
age, you can do that.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:45.610
You connect people throughout
the world on the same topic.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:49.270
And so I'm curious to hear
what your thoughts are

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:52.140
on the next step of
engaging your audience,

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:55.880
either from a YouTube product
design standpoint of how

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.130
YouTube handles comments, or
maybe any other thoughts you

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.570
might have on engaging your
audience so they go out

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.557
and look at their
communities around them.

00:53:04.557 --> 00:53:06.390
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, so
that's a great question

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.600
because there is a
particular problem there

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.912
that is hard to fix.

00:53:09.912 --> 00:53:12.510
But you guys are smart, so you
might be able to figure it out

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:16.570
in a way that, certainly,
tech wise, we couldn't.

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:20.790
So as I described, we had this
wonderful symbiotic relation

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:21.550
with the audience.

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:23.400
We're getting
feedback from them.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.050
And they're also our editors.

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:28.010
So I'll give you a
concrete example there.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:32.310
Back in the '08 election,
John McCain was in some place,

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.420
and they chopped up his
speech in a local news outlet,

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.544
and they put it up.

00:53:36.544 --> 00:53:38.710
We took it from the local
news outlet, we played it,

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:40.530
and we made commentary on it.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.900
And people that were there,
because it's the internet,

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.335
people were in the room when
John McCain was speaking.

00:53:45.335 --> 00:53:47.210
They said, no, no, no,
that's totally unfair.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.410
You guys took John
McCain out of context.

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:51.360
And so we went back and
found the full tape,

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.865
and it turns out the local
news station had chopped it

00:53:53.865 --> 00:53:56.030
in a way that was totally
unfair to John McCain.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.210
So we came back, and we
said, thank you, guys.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.620
Great job on editing.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.390
It turns out this
is the full context.

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:04.930
And we didn't know,
but now we do, and so

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.550
that was unfair to John
McCain, and here's the reality.

00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:09.730
So that was the good old days.

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:11.330
Today, there's
still some of that,

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.290
and I still--
people are amazed--

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.470
but I actually scroll
through the YouTube

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.630
comments a decent amount.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:18.570
1,600 comments per video.

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:21.040
We do 10 videos a day on
just "The Young Turks,"

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.730
let alone all the
other network shows.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.350
Obviously, I don't read
them all, but I skim.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:28.070
Because if you listen
to any one commenter

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:31.560
and change your product
based on that, you're nuts.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.640
But if 80% of the
commenters agree,

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.740
they're probably onto something.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.320
And so you've gotta have that
umbilical cord between them.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.650
So the problem is the trolls,
and everybody knows this.

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:47.060
And they come in, and
they've figured out a way

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:51.030
to be the first
page in every video.

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:52.460
They're so obsessed.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:54.570
They've made a
living out of this.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:58.078
And they're wherever they are--

00:54:58.078 --> 00:54:59.375
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:54:59.375 --> 00:55:01.250
I was going to say
they're in their basement,

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:05.230
but that's derogatory.

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:06.990
I like that I'm so
liberal, I'm worried

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:08.815
about being derogatory
towards trolls.

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:16.321
Anyway, I just want an
open flow of conversation

00:55:16.321 --> 00:55:18.070
so I get something out
of it, the audience

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:19.320
gets something out of it.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.090
And the first page
of every video

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:25.530
isn't, ah, Cenk is overweight!

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.070
OK.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:29.930
I don't know, can I curse?

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:31.790
JOE: Yeah, sure.

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.790
CENK UYGUR: Yeah,
no shit, Sherlock.

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.470
We know that.

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:36.240
We know that.

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.337
And you put that on a
thousand other videos.

00:55:38.337 --> 00:55:39.920
And the guys watching,
they have eyes.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.860
They know I'm fat.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:42.610
So let's move on.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.240
You're brown!

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.040
No shit, Sherlock.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.920
So that's a slight issue.

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.730
I think we can get
past that issue,

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:53.200
but we gotta work on that.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.660
JOE: Another
question over there.

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:55.285
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.910
Thanks for being here.

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:59.610
Earlier today, you talked about
the Davids and the Goliaths.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.950
So you said that
the Goliaths are

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:06.730
the CNNs and the MSNBCs of the
world, and you are the David.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.360
And so I have no doubt that
in the not so distant future,

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.120
the David will
overcome the Goliath.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.480
However, the great thing
about digital platforms

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.707
such as YouTube is that it
allows any David to pop up.

00:56:20.707 --> 00:56:22.040
The barrier to entry is minimal.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.460
You just need a camera.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:28.060
So as you are
overcoming the Goliaths,

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.440
are you concerned about
all the other Davids

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.590
that are popping up?

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:34.540
And what differentiates
you from the other Davids?

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.960
And that's it.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.070
CENK UYGUR: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:45.820
So when people ask me,
who is my competition?

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:49.660
Right now, that's
a funny question.

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:52.010
So yes, old media
as competition.

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:54.950
But I think that they
are in such dire straits,

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.844
that I think that 5,
10 years down the road,

00:56:57.844 --> 00:56:59.260
I don't think
that's a real issue.

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:02.100
And I don't think
they're real competition.

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:05.385
There are some new media
folks that are working hard,

00:57:05.385 --> 00:57:06.760
and they've got
their own models.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.009
But I don't think that they
have the kind of camp fire

00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:10.150
that we've set up.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:14.410
I think they've got a
good tech solution for how

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:17.610
to get people to watch 30
second videos on Facebook,

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:20.890
and bless their hearts, but I
don't think that's sustainable.

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:23.790
Look, I'll give you
perspective on that too.

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.100
For example, Pluto
is a platform that's

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.340
doing really well on OTT.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.890
And it just came
up out of nowhere,

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:33.600
and so I don't know that we
had high expectations for it,

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.350
but all of a sudden, big
revenue's starting to come in.

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:38.660
And I said, Jesus,
on YouTube, I get it.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.430
We have hundreds of
millions of views.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:41.520
On Pluto, not so many.

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.610
Why are we getting
this size a check?

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:48.400
Turns out, average viewing
time is 90 minutes for us,

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:53.650
which is unheard of in
digital, 90 minutes average.

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:57.380
So I don't think a lot of
the current digital media

00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.870
companies are built for that,
and I think in the OTT world,

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:03.000
we're in great shape.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.450
So who's my real competition?

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.290
It's a kid in Nebraska.

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:09.030
And I don't know
what his name is.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:11.550
And I don't know how
he's going to do it.

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:14.310
But at some point, we'll
probably get Omar'd too.

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:16.020
For those of you who
watch "The Wire,"

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.134
watch out for the little guys.

00:58:18.134 --> 00:58:19.800
They're going to Omar
you at some point.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.000
AUDIENCE: Spoiler alert.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.480
CENK UYGUR: Sorry,
that's a good point.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:30.910
And so I am fully aware that
in a couple of years maybe,

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:32.400
we're going to be Goliath.

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.850
So we've got to look
out for the slingshots

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:38.450
and don't be so cocky about your
giant sword, and your shields,

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.164
and all that.

00:58:40.164 --> 00:58:41.330
We haven't gotten there yet.

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:43.090
We're still David.

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:44.560
Again, in the new
paradigm, David

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.610
is the favorite,
not the underdog.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:49.712
And at some point, we will
have a large enough size

00:58:49.712 --> 00:58:52.170
that I gotta look out for all
the little David's coming out

00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:57.040
of Nebraska, and Mumbai, and
Shanghai, and all those places.

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:57.790
But you know what?

00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:02.100
I welcome that, because
our point wasn't just so

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.370
that we could win and
be the top company.

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:06.680
Our point was to
change the media.

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.110
And if we have
changed the media,

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:11.590
and they're all copying
us, then the audience wins.

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:14.550
So I'm super happy about
that state of affairs

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.850
if we get there.

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:17.800
JOE: Thank you.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.580
The time is running
against us, but are we

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.580
cool with one more question?

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.640
OK.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.069
One more question then.

00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:25.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
can be a quick one

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:28.276
because it's actually a build on
something that Lauren mentioned

00:59:28.276 --> 00:59:30.010
that you built on.

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:32.940
You talked about your business
and where you see it scaling,

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.120
which I thought was
really fascinating.

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.730
But you also mentioned
we could become Goliath,

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:40.090
and as long as we're delivering
things in the right way,

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:41.520
the audience wins.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.290
I believe that.

00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:44.810
But when you think
about the pitfalls

00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:47.850
and organizational issues that
have happened with large news

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:50.420
organizations, how
do you, as a leader,

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.420
stay true to your values
throughout your company

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.810
and continue to instill
that from the top

00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:56.990
down without
influencing, ultimately,

00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:58.899
what comes out in your news?

00:59:58.899 --> 01:00:00.190
CENK UYGUR: Yeah, you're right.

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:01.300
It's a matter of culture.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:04.890
And so the culture is more being
open-minded than anything else.

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:09.650
And so our critics think that,
oh, you guys are just lefties,

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.360
or you just have
this point of view.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.470
That isn't true.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:16.720
We're fact-based, and we
believe in a range of opinion.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.050
I would have more
conservatives on if I

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.550
thought they were being honest.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:23.200
And lately, with
libertarians, we

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.890
are finding more and
more honest libertarians,

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:27.940
so I'd like to engage
them more and get them

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.210
more in the conversation.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.840
But what I mean by honest is
you get a Republican guy who's

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.740
used to being on
TV, he will hit you

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.700
with talking point after
talking point, some of them

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.210
provided by ExxonMobil, some
of them provided by the NRA.

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:42.640
It's like, ugh, you're
not a human being.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.030
You're a talking point machine.

01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:45.240
Get off my air.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.160
It's annoying.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.676
Nobody is interested in that.

01:00:47.676 --> 01:00:48.470
Yada yada.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.303
But if you've got real
honest conversation--

01:00:50.303 --> 01:00:54.576
so within our company, this
election was trying, man.

01:00:54.576 --> 01:00:58.950
It frayed a lot of our
internal relationships,

01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:00.450
because some are
in the Bernie camp,

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:03.080
some are in the Stein camp,
some are in the Clinton camp.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.080
Some hate everything that's
going on, and yada yada.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.300
And we started banging
heads sometimes.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.080
We're still doing it, three
weeks out from the election.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.060
And at some point, people come
and whisper to me, hey, hey,

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.160
we shouldn't let that guy
do as much as he does.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.370
No, no, no, that guy.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:24.460
And no, the answer is we
have got to be the forum.

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.300
So we're going to put
all that out there.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.040
We're going to let
the audience decide.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.570
I want the strongest voices
in all those different camps

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:34.760
so that the audience
can get informed,

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.540
have a variety of opinion.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.140
And so it's my job to
keep that culture going

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.010
of open-mindedness.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:44.254
I think just the other day,
somebody convinced me on air,

01:01:44.254 --> 01:01:45.670
which, in TV,
when's the last time

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:48.359
you saw someone go, oh, wait
a minute, that's a good point.

01:01:48.359 --> 01:01:48.900
You're right.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.140
I change my mind.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.900
[LAUGH]

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.270
That happens on The
Young Turks all the time.

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.399
It's usually me.

01:01:56.399 --> 01:01:58.440
So the culture is
open-mindedness and making sure

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.350
that audience is informed
through that conversation.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:04.700
JOE: I think that's a
great closing remark.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:11.170
And please join in in giving
Cenk a warm Google Chicago

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.680
applause for being here.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.180
Thank you.

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.680
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.485
Thank you.

01:02:17.485 --> 01:02:18.778
CENK UYGUR: Thank you, Joe.

01:02:23.712 --> 01:02:24.212
OK.

01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:34.092
JOE: For those of you who would
like to meet Cenk and his team,

01:02:34.092 --> 01:02:36.980
who is sitting
somewhere [INAUDIBLE],

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.160
we are in Hyde Park
for a meet-and-greet.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:51.510
