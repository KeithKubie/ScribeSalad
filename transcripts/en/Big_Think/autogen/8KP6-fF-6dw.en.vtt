00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
of it I could take her leave I thought
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100
of it I could take her leave I thought
that her manner of reading novels was

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
that her manner of reading novels was
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.710
that her manner of reading novels was
great it's a wonderful book and she just

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
great it's a wonderful book and she just
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480
great it's a wonderful book and she just
has a great voice as a critic and I felt

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
has a great voice as a critic and I felt
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.760
has a great voice as a critic and I felt
I would follow her wherever she led

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770
 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.399

Magic Mountain when I was a kid I read

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880
Magic Mountain when I was a kid I read
 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.819
Magic Mountain when I was a kid I read
that I mean not a kid probably about 20

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829
that I mean not a kid probably about 20
 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.300
that I mean not a kid probably about 20
and I remember being like deeply

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310
and I remember being like deeply
 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.130
and I remember being like deeply
invested in that character I don't even

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140
invested in that character I don't even
 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.630
invested in that character I don't even
know why anymore but I remember feeling

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640
know why anymore but I remember feeling
 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.850
know why anymore but I remember feeling
I really mattered to me how things came

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860
I really mattered to me how things came
 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.609
I really mattered to me how things came
out for him ya know that's part of why I

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619
out for him ya know that's part of why I
 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.559

attached to characters whether movies

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
attached to characters whether movies
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.630
attached to characters whether movies
are stories but I think that that's part

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
are stories but I think that that's part
 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.649
are stories but I think that that's part
of the reason you get involved with

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659
of the reason you get involved with
 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.940
of the reason you get involved with
literature is because there's something

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950
literature is because there's something
 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.350
literature is because there's something
that grabs you about it and then you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360
that grabs you about it and then you
 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.270
that grabs you about it and then you
want to figure out why that's part of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280
want to figure out why that's part of
 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.770
want to figure out why that's part of
what the job is really is to figure out

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780
what the job is really is to figure out
 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.139
what the job is really is to figure out
what what is it about this story or this

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149
what what is it about this story or this
 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.479
what what is it about this story or this
character this outcome or the style or

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489
character this outcome or the style or
 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.240
character this outcome or the style or
this voice that that gets to you what is

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250
this voice that that gets to you what is
 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.460
this voice that that gets to you what is
what's getting to you does it mean and

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470
what's getting to you does it mean and
 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.080
what's getting to you does it mean and
that's really an interesting problem to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090
that's really an interesting problem to
 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.430
that's really an interesting problem to
trying to figure out so that's what this

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440
trying to figure out so that's what this
 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.009
trying to figure out so that's what this
book was give taking a stab at doing and

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019
book was give taking a stab at doing and
 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.270
book was give taking a stab at doing and
I just thought it was a pretty original

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
I just thought it was a pretty original
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.180
I just thought it was a pretty original
and fresh and fun take on the subject
