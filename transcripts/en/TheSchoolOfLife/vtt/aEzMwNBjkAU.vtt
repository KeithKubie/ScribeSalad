00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
One of touching signs of the influence of philosophy on everyday life.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.020
Is that people can sometimes be heard to complain that they're

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.480
Going through something what they call A Existential Crisis.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.440
Man: "Noo!" (Dramatic music)

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.780
The phrase maybe used rather casually  and vaguely but it nether the less-

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.620
Touches on one of the major  traditions of European philosophy

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.600
Closely associated with the ideas of five philosophers

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600
In particular .

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.580
And

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.980
(Boxing bell rings)Those these figures disagreed on many things it is possible of five of their thoughts

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.100
To come to a coherent view of  what a Existential crisis  really is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.780
(twinkles)

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.480
And when  it might therefore be helpful to refer to ourselves

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.540
As going through ....  ( Inspirational music )

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.540
(Inspirational music continuous)

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.380
(funky music )

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.060
(*whoosh........whoosh,whoosh )

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.980
The crisis is marked by five distinctive features

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.060
(*Whoosh...Whoosh)   ( Footsteps)

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.080
Firstly it's a period when a lot that previously seem like common sense or normal

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.180
Reveal it's contingent, chance, uncanny and relative nature.   (Dramatic music)

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.560
For example, we might start to wonder "Why do we live in (THIS) part of the world?"

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.700
"Rather than (ANY) other?"

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.940
"Why we're doing (THIS) job and (NOT) somethings else?"

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.800
"Why are we with (THIS) partner  and following (THIS) set of social norms

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.140
In short we realized rather disturbingly there are far more options under the surface

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.980
Than we normally allow ourselves  to imagine..... We are more free than we thought

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.780
Secondly,  this revelation is acutely in anxiety inducing

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.820
Man:(distress crying)

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.100
Recognition of our freedom doesn't bring with it calm quite the opposite

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.900
Man:(distress crying)

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.140
We recognize we've been deluding ourselves about what (HAD) to be.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.600
No one (Really) cares quite  as much as we thought about what we are and what had choosen to do

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.300
We could change everything around (Seagulls calling)

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.240
We could come to a disturbing awareness that our ultimate responsiblity

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.260
Is to ourselves (NOT) the social world

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.740
Thirdly, we develop a heightened awareness of death.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.360
Time is short and running out, we need to re-examine our lives

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.080
But the clock is ticking  ever  loud (footsteps)

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.800
Fourthly, and cruciaily for(All) the existential philosophers

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.380
We have many chooses but are by the nature of human condition

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.120
Denied the information we would need to choose with ultimate wisdom with certainty

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.360
We are forced to decide and can never be assured that we've done so adequately

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
We are steering blind

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.380
And Therefore we can be guranteed to make a lot of mistakes

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.560
The condition of a mankind is to have to plot our course in the dark without  adequate reason or incite

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.880
This leads to  another favorite word for the Existentialist

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.900
(Crowed cheers)

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.940
Anxiety

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.900
The human condition is to be anxious

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.960
Not about " This or that" particular thing but is a basic feature of our lives

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.680
Because we must always choose without any security that we've chosen well and without sufficient time

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.580
To explore  the options

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.260
This can call all sound  paralyzing conspiracy

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.840
Man: (distress yelling)  Yet the existential philosophers don't mean to depress us.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.480
They want to learn dignity and grandeur

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.840
To dilemmas

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.020
which we too often we think of  harsh alone

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.580
And therefore

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.480
Feel ashamed about some personal curse

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.840
When they are in fact

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840
Fundamental features  of the human condition

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.840
Which are immobile us

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.840
when we considered them  with sufficient depth

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.840
(Music plays)

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.840
(Music plays)

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.840
(Music plays)

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.840
The existentialist  offer us

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.840
A useful corrective to a normal

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.840
Pernicious view that intelligent

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840
Choice  might be possible and untragic

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840
in Structure

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.840
An existential approach tempers

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.840
The modern sentimental notion

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.840
That perfection is within reach

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840
(tire screeches) Man : (Cries) (Drives off)

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840
Is that you suffer from agony

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840
of  choice isn't some

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.840
anomaly  its one of the most

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.840
predictable  and poignant things

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.840
About being alive (whoosh)

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840
This is a message we benefit from hearing

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.840
Quite often because what helps

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.840
With regret is the knowledge that in fact

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
Every life is burden by it

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.840
In some shape or form

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.840
(Music plays)

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.260
(Music plays ) ( Woman singing in french)( Record scratch)

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.140
The regret free life only exist in movies and songs

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.460
The way  to diminish our anxiety and panick

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.060
Is to  alleviate the sense that one had the options to choose correctly but failed

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.660
A degree of disappointment

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.840
Is as a existentialist philosopher

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.840
So beautifully admitted

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840
It's simply a human condition.
