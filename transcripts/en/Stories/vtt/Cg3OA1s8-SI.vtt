00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:02.450
LAURA LING: Did you know
that the urban waste produced

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.630
from cities around the
world is enough to fill

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.570
a line of garbage
trucks stretching

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.700
more than 3,100 miles?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.800
That's a distance from Florida
to Washington, every day.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.570
And things are only
expected to get worse.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.940
Thankfully, some cities
such as San Francisco

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.670
are paving the way
and trying to change

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.580
the way we think about trash.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.990
San Francisco plans
to become zero waste

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.800
by 2020, which is a pretty
ambitious but awesome goal.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.320
And this is the
main nerve center

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.970
for all of the
city's recyclables.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.020
This is where everything ends
up to be sorted and processed.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.375
What is zero waste?

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:36.750
ROBERT REED: It's
an idea, and it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.390
means sending next to nothing
to landfills or incinerators.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.890
LAURA LING: In 2009,
the city passed

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.060
a law requiring
residents and businesses

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.870
to sort their waste into
recyclables, compostables,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.300
and landfill trash.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.940
Recology is the private
company that handles it all.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.370
ROBERT REED: When I started
at Recology 23 years ago,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.320
the recycling rate
was around 38%.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.616
Today we've more
than doubled that.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:02.990
LAURA LING: So
far, San Francisco

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.420
has diverted 80% of its
waste away from landfills,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.060
and its success has been
getting global attention.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.860
Government representatives
from all over the world

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.759
visit this facility
to learn about how

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.050
they might be able to replicate
what's being done here.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.710
What is the current method of
waste management or recycling

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.820
in your town?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.861
DANIEL ANDERSEN: What we
have a lot of in Denmark

00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.200
is actually incineration,
where you will burn the waste.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.450
LAURA LING: Do you think
that you might implement some

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.950
of what you've learned here?

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.075
DANIEL ANDERSEN: One thing
that we have heard about

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:37.350
is the value of composting.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.530
We don't do that a lot.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.987
So maybe we will go home
and do more composting.

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:43.570
LAURA LING: San
Francisco now collects

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.270
650 tons of food
scraps, yard trimmings,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.570
and other organic
waste every day.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.980
That material is brought here
to be turned into compost.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.250
ROBERT REED: This is one of
the most modern composting

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.922
facilities in North America.

00:01:56.922 --> 00:01:58.880
LAURA LING: OK, so you
can see a bunch of stuff

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.830
here that people
have thrown away.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.330
Mostly like wood here.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.721
A shoe, this flip-flop.

00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:07.470
ROBERT REED: Yeah.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.845
LAURA LING: What's
up with shoes?

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:09.346
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:11.928
ROBERT REED: Well, there's seven
billion people on the planet,

00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:13.260
so there's a lot of shoes.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.610
We're in a culture
here in California

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.530
where people are
moving very quickly,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.930
and so people make mistakes.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.000
So we get the
things that are not

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.280
supposed to be here, we get
them removed right away,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.784
right at the beginning.

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:27.450
LAURA LING: After the
waste is ground up

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.870
and screened for plastic
and other bits of trash,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.805
the organic matter left over
gets watered and aerated.

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:36.180
A piping system then filters
out dangerous greenhouse gases

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.640
produced by microbes.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.890
In about 60 days, the
compost is complete

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.180
and sold to local organic
farmers and vineyards.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.530
How does composting
help the environment?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.690
ROBERT REED: Composting keeps
materials out of landfills,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.750
it returns nutrients
to farms, it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.070
reduces the production of
very potent greenhouse gases,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.880
it attracts and retains
water, like rainwater.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.476
LAURA LING: I mean,
it smells like hell.

00:03:02.476 --> 00:03:03.850
But it's actually
very beautiful,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.170
what you're describing here.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.840
You know, people's food scraps,
which might otherwise be waste,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.150
comes here to essentially
feed these farms

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.097
and produce new crops.

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:17.680
ROBERT REED: Well,
from this facility,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.390
more than 300 vineyards
have received the compost

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.700
and applied it to
their vineyards.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.610
Farmers are using the compost
to grow cover crops that

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.910
pull carbon out
of the atmosphere

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.000
and return carbon
back to the soil.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.410
This is one of the best
things we can do in an effort

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.940
to slow down climate change.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.620
People have really heard a lot
about environmental problems.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.756
They want to hear now a lot more
about environmental solutions.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.630
LAURA LING: How much
recycling and composting

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.900
is there in your town?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.530
Let us know in the
comments below.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.230
And be sure to watch
this next episode

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.900
about a woman who already
lives a zero-waste lifestyle.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.750
LAUREN SINGER: Two years of
trash in this tiny little jar.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.510
My values are having a really
low environmental impact.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.720
I have to live like I want
that, and so that's why I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.719
decided to change my lifestyle.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.510
