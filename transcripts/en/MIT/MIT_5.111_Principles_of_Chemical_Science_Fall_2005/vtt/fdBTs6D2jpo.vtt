00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.024
Monday's class really picks up
from the lecture we had this

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:22.008
past Monday.
We started crystal field theory

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.616
and then talked about
octahedral-shaped molecules and

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:28.600
splitting of d-orbitals.
And then on Monday,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.000
we are going to continue with
that topic.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.259
We are going to move in and
talk about tetrahedral

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:38.984
molecules, square planar
molecules and how they are going

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:42.444
to split the d-orbitals.
And then how that relates to

00:00:42.444 --> 00:00:45.637
something, why we need to know
about any of that.

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:49.096
And that is because it is able
to predict some of the

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:52.422
properties of molecules,
like their colors and also

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:56.414
their properties in terms of
spin and using various different

00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:59.673
spectroscopies to learn
something about particular

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:03.000
molecules, coordination
complexes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.595
Before we get into that unit,
we are going to kind of take a

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:11.489
step back and talk today about
shapes of molecules.

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:15.616
We introduced octahedral,
but now we are going to talk

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:20.133
about all the other kinds of
shapes of molecules in today's

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.093
lecture.
This is kind of jumping around

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:28.000
in the book a little bit.
We have been in Chapter 16.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.485
And now, the way the book is
divided, this particular unit is

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:35.925
back in Chapter 3,
although it is referred to a

00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:39.289
lot in Chapter 16.
This is kind of some of the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.177
things that you need to know to
finish up Chapter 16.

00:01:43.177 --> 00:01:47.364
And then on Monday we will be
back in Chapter 16 as well.

00:01:47.364 --> 00:01:51.775
Again, this is a little bit odd
order because of the way the

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:54.317
calendar fell this year.
All right.

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:58.429
VSEPR, shapes of molecules,
why do we need to know about

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.784
this?
Well, as most of you know,

00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:05.764
I do protein crystallography,
which is all about structure.

00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.372
So, of course,
I am going to think that

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:11.803
structure is important,
that shape and geometry are

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:13.382
important.
And, in fact,

00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:17.568
they have an influence on the
physical properties and chemical

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:21.068
properties of molecules.
Things like melting points,

00:02:21.068 --> 00:02:22.990
boiling points,
reactivities,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.147
and, in particular,
in biological systems it is

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:29.479
important.
A biological system has

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.824
particular shapes of chiral
molecules, it is a chiral

00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:35.783
environment, which we have
talked about before.

00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:39.321
And so molecules must fit
precisely in that environment.

00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:42.988
Often, if you are talking about
an inhibitor of an enzyme,

00:02:42.988 --> 00:02:46.269
the inhibitor or the
pharmaceutical drug is designed

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.192
so it specifically fits into a
particular crevice in an active

00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:53.152
site and blocks activity.
A lot of the world of

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:56.883
pharmaceuticals is all about
shape of molecules and how you

00:02:56.883 --> 00:03:01.000
design particular types of
shapes of molecules.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.234
We have learned a lot about
this sort of area already,

00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:09.787
and we found that the shapes of
molecules can be predicted

00:03:09.787 --> 00:03:14.661
pretty well using simple methods
based on Lewis structures and

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:19.534
also in terms of thinking about
sort of where orbitals are and

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:23.209
how that may affect the
particular shape of the

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.925
molecules.
Again, this is sort of a

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:30.000
simplistic view that works
pretty well.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.700
And it will be also,
on the next problem set,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.322
a good opportunity for you to
review Lewis structures before

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:39.146
you take the final.
Sometimes this unit is with

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:41.847
Lewis structures,
there is some rationale for

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:45.530
that, but it is also kind of
nice to come back to it later in

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.275
the semester as a way to review
things that you learned before

00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:51.485
and get you ready for the final
exam.

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:54.922
The particular theory we are
going to talk about today is

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:57.992
referred to as VSEPR.
And this is the valence-shell

00:03:57.992 --> 00:04:03.062
electron-pair repulsion theory.
And so, like crystal field

00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:06.790
theory, you are talking about
repulsive effects.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.628
Here this is based on a simple
principle that valence electron

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:16.150
pairs will repel each other and
that the geometry around a

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.274
central atom will be such to
minimize that repulsion.

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:23.368
This is a lot like crystal
field theory,

00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:29.000
where we were talking about the
splitting of the d-orbitals.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.604
And we are talking about
ligands as negative point

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:35.473
charges heading toward those
d-orbitals.

00:04:35.473 --> 00:04:39.887
A lot of these theories that
work pretty well are just really

00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:43.344
based on the idea that repulsion
is unfavorable.

00:04:43.344 --> 00:04:47.832
It is a pretty simple concept
which can explain a lot in terms

00:04:47.832 --> 00:04:51.583
of properties of molecules.
Before we get into this,

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:55.335
there is always nomenclature
that we must deal with.

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:57.763
And here is the nomenclature
here.

00:04:57.763 --> 00:05:03.432
We have A as a central atom.
Whatever is in the middle,

00:05:03.432 --> 00:05:08.016
which when we are talking about
transition metals,

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:13.254
complexes would be your metal,
but this works for organic

00:05:13.254 --> 00:05:17.745
chemistry as well,
when you are all talking about

00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:20.738
carbon, oxygen,
sulfur, nitrogen.

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:26.538
And X is going to be your bound
atom, and E will be a lone pair

00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.000
of electrons,
hence the E.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.307
There are just a few rules.
It is not too bad compared to

00:05:34.307 --> 00:05:37.153
some of the other things we have
done.

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:40.615
Just a handful of rules that
you need to know.

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:44.153
First, you need to know that
the steric number,

00:05:44.153 --> 00:05:47.769
abbreviated S.N.,
is used to predict geometries,

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:50.230
and what steric number refers
to.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.384
It refers to the number of
atoms bound to central atom,

00:05:54.384 --> 00:06:00.000
plus the number of lone pair
electrons on the central atom.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.890
Here we are not concerned about
double or triple bonds.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.997
We are only concerned about how
many things are around our

00:06:07.997 --> 00:06:10.951
central atom,
both the bonded and the lone

00:06:10.951 --> 00:06:13.329
pairs.
Whether it is a double or a

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.860
triple bond doesn't matter at
all for these cases.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.967
It is the number of atoms
bonded, not the number of bonds,

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:24.713
which is important to remember.
And so steric number,

00:06:24.713 --> 00:06:28.532
here, should not be confused
with coordination number,

00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:31.558
which we talked about in
transition metals,

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:35.177
--
-- which is just the number of

00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:37.500
ligands around the central
metal.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.419
So, there are a number of
different things that you are

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.669
going to learn about.
All right.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.516
For resonance structures,
you can imply a VSEPR to any

00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:50.637
one of them.
And there are two cases that we

00:06:50.637 --> 00:06:54.483
need to consider today.
One is the case when there are

00:06:54.483 --> 00:06:57.387
no lone pairs,
and other is the case when

00:06:57.387 --> 00:07:02.546
there are lone pairs.
Those are all the rules.

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:06.897
It is really not too
complicated for this.

00:07:06.897 --> 00:07:13.053
We are just going to go through
today and look at all these

00:07:13.053 --> 00:07:18.995
different molecules and consider
the nomenclature and the

00:07:18.995 --> 00:07:24.514
geometry around them.
First, we will consider formula

00:07:24.514 --> 00:07:28.185
type.
And so AX two would

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:32.800
mean that you have a central
atom A, and we have two atoms

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.090
bound to it, so two Xs.
And now we are considering the

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.866
cases without lone pairs of
electrons, so there won't be any

00:07:41.866 --> 00:07:45.590
Es until later.
Then the steric number is going

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.828
to be two.
And so here would be the shape

00:07:48.828 --> 00:07:52.390
of the molecule.
And so we have a center atom

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.842
and two atoms bound to it.
It would have linear geometry

00:07:56.842 --> 00:08:02.578
and a bond angle of 180.
That is pretty simple.

00:08:02.578 --> 00:08:08.671
Now, we go to the next
category, where you have three

00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:13.828
things bound,
so that would have an SN number

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:18.046
of three.
And this is going to be the

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:23.554
shape of that molecule.
And what is this called?

00:08:23.554 --> 00:08:28.242
Trigonal planar.
And what are the angles?

00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:30.511
120.
Okay.

00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:36.245
Now, if we move up to four,
and this one should be pretty

00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:40.853
familiar to you,
if we have four things bound,

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:45.460
SN number of four,
this is the molecular shape

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.249
that we have.
And you all know this as

00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:53.447
tetrahedral.
And the angles of tetrahedral

00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:57.440
are 109.5.
These are all things you have

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.514
to memorize.
This is written in your notes,

00:09:02.514 --> 00:09:07.208
but if you don't look at your
notes and just try to think

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:12.153
about it, it will be a good
review for the next exam on this

00:09:12.153 --> 00:09:13.494
topic.
All right.

00:09:13.494 --> 00:09:17.601
If we go into the next
category, when we have five

00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:20.450
things bound,
that would be AX five,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.306
five atoms bound,
SN number of five.

00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:29.000
We have this trigonal
bipyramidal geometry.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.431
And what are the angles around
the equator here connecting the

00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:36.907
red atoms?
120.

00:09:36.907 --> 00:09:40.175
And what about red to black?
90.

00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:43.971
All right.
Then, if we go to the next

00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:49.769
category, when we have six
things, we talked a lot about

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:55.990
this in the last two classes,
what kind of geometry is this?

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:02.000
It is octahedral geometry,
with angles of 90.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.475
Right.
These are all the basic shapes

00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:09.917
when you just have two through
six atoms bound.

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:15.806
Let's take a look at a couple
of examples of molecules when we

00:10:15.806 --> 00:10:21.020
have actual atoms listed.
If we look at CO two,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.206
what is our SN number?
Two, right.

00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:30.000
We are only considering the
number of atoms bound.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.007
We don't care that they are
double bonds.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:37.368
We are only concerned with the
atoms that are linked to the

00:10:37.368 --> 00:10:40.676
central atom here.
Then the geometry is what?

00:10:40.676 --> 00:10:42.030
Linear.
And angles?

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.187
180, right.
We will look at another example

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:47.593
here.
Is this one going to be the

00:10:47.593 --> 00:10:50.300
same or different from the one
above?

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.834
The same, right,
because we don't care about the

00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:56.917
double or triple bonds.
We can go through.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:11:01.539
SN number is still two.
It is still linear.

00:11:01.539 --> 00:11:05.995
And the angle is still 180.
We move into another example

00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:08.831
here.
And I will just say that these

00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:12.557
lecture handouts have this
information in here.

00:11:12.557 --> 00:11:17.256
This is the most requested
lecture handout that I have from

00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:21.631
people who have been in the
classes who get up to other

00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:24.953
level classes and need to know
this stuff.

00:11:24.953 --> 00:11:28.761
And, for some reason,
some of them have not kept

00:11:28.761 --> 00:11:35.000
their 5.111 notes sort of next
to their pillow in later years.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.285
I am not really sure why,
but sometimes it gets lost and

00:11:38.285 --> 00:11:41.451
they request this handout,
because it is a really nice

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:45.096
summary of all of these things.
You might want to keep it in a

00:11:45.096 --> 00:11:47.425
nice special place for future
reference.

00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.875
All right.
Some day I should bring in what

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:53.579
my freshman chemistry textbook
looked like with like everything

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:56.566
highlighted and stuff just for
entertainment value.

00:11:56.566 --> 00:12:00.710
All right.
This molecule here would have a

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.120
SN number of three.
And its shape again?

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.480
Trigonal planar.
And angles?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.191
180.
By the time you get through

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.213
with lecture today,
you should have all of this

00:12:13.213 --> 00:12:18.196
memorized, because we are going
to see these a couple more

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:19.595
times.
All right.

00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:22.306
This one, what molecule is
this?

00:12:22.306 --> 00:12:25.978
Does someone know its name?
Methane, right.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:31.142
Again, what is this geometry?
Tetrahedral.

00:12:31.142 --> 00:12:34.190
SN number of four.
And angles of?

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.904
109.5, right.
Okay.

00:12:35.904 --> 00:12:41.238
Now we get into a few more
complicated molecules that you

00:12:41.238 --> 00:12:46.476
do not see quite as often,
although I think we have seen

00:12:46.476 --> 00:12:51.333
this one quite often in
different kinds of problems,

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:55.809
including chemical equilibrium
and other things.

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:57.714
SN number here?
Five.

00:12:57.714 --> 00:13:02.880
Geometry?
It is hard to say that one in

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.655
unison.
We can work on this for the end

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:10.231
of lecture.
Then we can all say it in

00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:12.019
harmony.
All right.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:14.602
And our angles again?
Yeah.

00:13:14.602 --> 00:13:16.788
Okay.
And one last one.

00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:20.264
This should be very familiar to
you.

00:13:20.264 --> 00:13:23.344
This is SN number six.
Geometry?

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:25.132
Octahedral.
Angles?

00:13:25.132 --> 00:13:25.927
90.
Okay.

00:13:25.927 --> 00:13:32.727
People are doing well.
Here is some stuff that you may

00:13:32.727 --> 00:13:36.775
not have heard before,
or maybe have in another

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:40.296
chemistry course,
but now we are going to

00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:44.607
introduce lone pairs and see
what effect this has.

00:13:44.607 --> 00:13:49.096
It gets a little bit more
complicated at this point.

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:53.056
For lone pairs,
we think of them as being sort

00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:57.543
of centrally located.
And I brought in some props to

00:13:57.543 --> 00:14:03.000
talk about the spatial
distribution of electrons.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.110
One can imagine that the
electrons are spread out as far

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.175
as they can go.
They like to have a lot of

00:14:10.175 --> 00:14:12.865
space.
And so the lone pair electrons

00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:17.350
are going to take up more space
and experience more repulsion

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.685
then when you have the electrons
as part of bonds to atoms.

00:14:21.685 --> 00:14:25.123
The lone pairs are not sort of
held in as much,

00:14:25.123 --> 00:14:28.786
they are not sort of forced to
be in one location,

00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:33.411
so they will spread out more.
And so because of this,

00:14:33.411 --> 00:14:36.418
their spreading out more,
they are taking up room,

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.872
they are kind of pushing
everything away,

00:14:38.872 --> 00:14:42.493
because they want to have as
much room as they possibly can.

00:14:42.493 --> 00:14:46.236
That means that lone pairs are
going to be more repulsive than

00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:49.304
the atoms that are bound.
Even though electrons are

00:14:49.304 --> 00:14:52.372
involved in those bonds,
they are not quite as bad.

00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:56.238
The worst thing you can have is
two sets of lone pairs near each

00:14:56.238 --> 00:14:59.000
other.
They want all the room.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.220
And so they are going to be
sort of bumping into each other

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.568
and trying to force the other
set farther away.

00:15:06.568 --> 00:15:10.715
See, this is much more bulky
than if you just have the two

00:15:10.715 --> 00:15:13.626
atoms bound with bonds to a
central atom.

00:15:13.626 --> 00:15:17.338
The next would be a lone pair
versus a bonding pair.

00:15:17.338 --> 00:15:21.194
And then the least repulsive
will be two bonding pairs

00:15:21.194 --> 00:15:25.779
because those electrons are sort
of fixed into locations for the

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.399
bonds.
They are not requiring as much

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:32.393
space.
They are not sort of spreading

00:15:32.393 --> 00:15:36.462
out and taking over all the
space that is available.

00:15:36.462 --> 00:15:40.611
Worst is lone pair-lone pair,
then lone pair bonding,

00:15:40.611 --> 00:15:44.840
and then bonding-bonding.
And, if you think about this

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.909
sort of simple rule,
you can predict a lot about the

00:15:48.909 --> 00:15:52.420
shapes of molecules.
Let's look at what shape

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.808
something will have if it has
this sort of set molecule.

00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:02.590
Again, A, the central atom.
X is four atoms that are bonded

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.768
to the central atom,
and E is one set of lone pair.

00:16:06.768 --> 00:16:11.782
And so this is going to have
what is known as a seesaw shape.

00:16:11.782 --> 00:16:15.793
And let's think about why that
would be the case.

00:16:15.793 --> 00:16:20.640
If we have this sort of central
framework, but one of these

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.403
bonded atoms is now going to be
replaced with a lone pair.

00:16:25.403 --> 00:16:30.000
There are five things around
this framework.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.782
One is a lone pair.
Where are you going to put it?

00:16:35.782 --> 00:16:41.329
If we put it on top,
what are the angles between

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:47.701
these lone pairs on top and the
three red bonded atoms?

00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:51.478
90.
That is kind of close and not

00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:56.080
so favorable.
If we instead put one over

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:02.689
here, then we have still the
sort of negative interaction

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:08.000
with the 90 here and the 90
here.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.354
But we only have two of them
instead of three.

00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:15.006
And these guys are 120 apart,
so it is not so bad.

00:17:15.006 --> 00:17:18.658
There is a little bit more
space in the equatorial

00:17:18.658 --> 00:17:21.639
position.
And so that is why you get this

00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:24.770
seesaw shape,
because you would want to put

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.018
it in the equatorial position,
where there is only sort of

00:17:29.018 --> 00:17:34.361
these two rather than three.
There is just a little bit more

00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:37.560
space, because these guys are
farther away.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.149
That gives rise to seesaw
geometry.

00:17:40.149 --> 00:17:44.186
You can sort of again,
these rules are more to explain

00:17:44.186 --> 00:17:48.147
in retrospect what is observed
about those molecules,

00:17:48.147 --> 00:17:52.260
and then you rationalize.
But the rationalization works

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.240
pretty well.
If we do that,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.125
if we put a lone pair,
then, here, instead of one of

00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:03.000
these top positions,
we get this seesaw geometry.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.926
And so let me help you remember
this.

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:08.201
See?
Get the seesaw geometry.

00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:12.347
How many of you actually grew
up with seesaws in the

00:18:12.347 --> 00:18:15.761
neighborhood playground?
Still most people,

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.443
okay.
They are actually one of the

00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:21.694
most dangerous toys.
And I think a lot of

00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:26.571
playgrounds have removed them
because of the one kid who sort

00:18:26.571 --> 00:18:30.879
of sits on it and keeps you,
like, stuck up in the air

00:18:30.879 --> 00:18:36.000
because they are a little
heavier than you are.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.685
And you are stuck there for a
really long time,

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:44.571
and then eventually they get up
and you go falling and flying.

00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:49.138
We may have to give this a new
name at some point when all

00:18:49.138 --> 00:18:53.544
seesaws are removed from
playgrounds, but it sounds like

00:18:53.544 --> 00:18:56.988
it is still usable.
Now, if we wanted to put

00:18:56.988 --> 00:19:01.314
another lone pair on that same
structure, we still have

00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:05.000
essential atom,
three atoms bound.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.194
Now we have two lone pairs.
Those two lone pairs,

00:19:10.194 --> 00:19:15.714
then, will go into the
equatorial positions as well.

00:19:15.714 --> 00:19:20.909
And so you kind of have this
sort of arrangement.

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:27.619
And they were so repulsive they
actually made the atom unbonded

00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:30.000
from it.
Okay.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.032
That leaves you with this
shape, which is a T-shape

00:19:34.032 --> 00:19:36.048
molecule.
Again, this is a

00:19:36.048 --> 00:19:39.435
rationalization.
Someone figured out that a

00:19:39.435 --> 00:19:43.387
molecule like this had this
T-shape ad it could be

00:19:43.387 --> 00:19:48.306
rationalized by the fact that
the lone pairs wanted to sort of

00:19:48.306 --> 00:19:50.967
fill out in that equatorial
plane.

00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:54.919
And they could move away
slightly from each other,

00:19:54.919 --> 00:20:00.000
and that would minimize the
amounts of repulsion.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.770
All right.
If we keep going here and look,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:10.705
now, at a molecule with this
geometry, AX four E two

00:20:10.705 --> 00:20:16.290
molecule.
That is based on kind of what

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:21.759
structural framework?
What is the sort of parent

00:20:21.759 --> 00:20:26.414
structure when you have six
things bound?

00:20:26.414 --> 00:20:32.000
Yeah, based on an octahedral
geometry.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.941
If you take your octahedral
molecule and if you want to

00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:41.790
figure out where you are going
to put your lone pairs,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:46.091
you could stick one down here
in the equatorial,

00:20:46.091 --> 00:20:51.764
but that doesn't do you as much
good this time because now your

00:20:51.764 --> 00:20:54.784
other equatorial things are at
90.

00:20:54.784 --> 00:21:00.000
This one would have a lot of
crashes down here.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.666
What ends up happening is the
two lone pairs would go one

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:08.666
above and one below,
so they would be as far away

00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:13.500
from each other as possible.
You have one below and another

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.500
one on top.
And remember,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.500
the worst thing to have is a
lone pair-lone pair.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.416
Even though you have four atoms
at 90 that it is interacting

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:30.000
with, at least it is far away
from the other lone pair.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.452
Each kind of gets half the
molecule, one up top and one on

00:21:35.452 --> 00:21:40.713
the bottom, so they have the
most room, those electrons,

00:21:40.713 --> 00:21:45.017
to spread out.
And so that gives you what kind

00:21:45.017 --> 00:21:47.504
of geometry?
Square planar,

00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:49.034
right.
All right.

00:21:49.034 --> 00:21:54.773
You can also predict something
about what might happen to the

00:21:54.773 --> 00:22:00.130
angles that you have all now
pretty much memorized on the

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:05.250
previous slides.
That if you do have a lone

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:09.490
pair, and out here we have an AX
three E,

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.865
SN number of four,
so four things bound,

00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:18.057
one lone pair and three atoms,
and this is based then on what

00:22:18.057 --> 00:22:21.605
kind of structure?
With SN number of four,

00:22:21.605 --> 00:22:25.500
what is the kind of the parent
geometry there?

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.000
Yeah, tetrahedral is the parent
geometry.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.279
And now we have replaced one of
the bonded atoms with a lone

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:36.891
pair.
And so what that is going to do

00:22:36.891 --> 00:22:40.663
is that lone pair is really not
in that bad of shape.

00:22:40.663 --> 00:22:43.854
You put it on top.
You have 109.5 now between

00:22:43.854 --> 00:22:47.409
those angles pointing down in
the parent geometry.

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:51.181
And that was better than the
others which were at 90,

00:22:51.181 --> 00:22:53.937
but it is still not good enough
for it.

00:22:53.937 --> 00:22:58.000
And so it actually presses down
even more.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.802
Those lone pairs,
they are going to spread out as

00:23:01.802 --> 00:23:06.635
much as they possibly can and
repel those bonded atoms away to

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.567
the extent possible.
In this molecule,

00:23:09.567 --> 00:23:13.608
what is observed is that the
angles in between here,

00:23:13.608 --> 00:23:17.411
in between the hydrogens,
instead of being 109.5,

00:23:17.411 --> 00:23:21.689
which is what you would expect
for the true tetrahedral

00:23:21.689 --> 00:23:25.730
geometry, they are 106.7.
This lone pair is pressing

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.404
down, compressing the bonded
atoms even closer to each other

00:23:30.404 --> 00:23:35.000
than what is sort of the normal
framework.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.044
This really takes up a lot of
room here and is repulsive

00:23:39.044 --> 00:23:43.014
toward these bonded angles.
Again, the VSEPR theory can

00:23:43.014 --> 00:23:46.838
predict these kinds of,
or really explain these kinds

00:23:46.838 --> 00:23:49.558
of changes.
If you observe the smaller

00:23:49.558 --> 00:23:52.794
angle you can say,
oh, there was a lone pair.

00:23:52.794 --> 00:23:57.352
That makes sense that it would
be a smaller angle because there

00:23:57.352 --> 00:24:03.366
would be repulsion down.
Again, you can think about it.

00:24:03.366 --> 00:24:08.415
You can make one of these lone
pairs yourself,

00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:12.904
low tech and think about the
shapes here.

00:24:12.904 --> 00:24:17.056
All right.
We can also rationalize the

00:24:17.056 --> 00:24:21.656
difference between a PH3 and NH3
molecule.

00:24:21.656 --> 00:24:26.706
They have pretty much the same
framework here,

00:24:26.706 --> 00:24:34.000
based on tetrahedral geometry
AX3E, SN number of four.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
But now, instead of the number
for methane that we saw of

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.321
109.5, and instead of the 106.7
for NH3, we now get a really

00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:51.678
small angle between here,
between the angle between

00:24:51.678 --> 00:24:56.928
hydrogen and phosphorus.
And hydrogen is now 93.3,

00:24:56.928 --> 00:25:03.416
so it is even more compressed.
And the reason why is because

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:06.750
we are moving down in the
Periodic Table.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.333
And so as we move down the
column in the Periodic Table,

00:25:11.333 --> 00:25:16.333
we are going to have lone pairs
that have even larger spatial

00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:19.000
volumes.
And so they are going to

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
compress even more.
Now it is an even bigger sort

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.833
of situation here.
The lone pairs are trying to

00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:32.012
fill up even more volume.
And so they are sort of trying

00:25:32.012 --> 00:25:35.233
to compress as much as possible
these atoms away.

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:38.789
They are filling up all
available space and making the

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:42.210
angle here even smaller.
And so if asked about this,

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.632
if asked to predict,
you could sort of look at where

00:25:45.632 --> 00:25:47.779
things are in the Periodic
Table.

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:51.000
Here is nitrogen,
here is phosphorus.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.767
And so if we had a compound
based on nitrogen or phosphorus

00:25:55.767 --> 00:26:00.698
that was based on tetrahedral
geometry, one might expect that

00:26:00.698 --> 00:26:05.547
the angle becomes even smaller
as you move down the Periodic

00:26:05.547 --> 00:26:10.808
Table, as that lone pair that is
on there is filling up even more

00:26:10.808 --> 00:26:15.246
and more spatial volume.
This kind of combines ideas of

00:26:15.246 --> 00:26:19.602
trends in the Periodic Table
with shapes of molecules.

00:26:19.602 --> 00:26:22.561
All right.
Another thing that you can

00:26:22.561 --> 00:26:27.000
sometimes predict is about bond
lengths.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.527
If you experimentally observed
different bond lengths in a

00:26:32.527 --> 00:26:38.442
molecule, you could use VSEPR to
go back and think about where

00:26:38.442 --> 00:26:43.387
that may have come from.
What is this geometry here,

00:26:43.387 --> 00:26:48.236
the one that is shown and also
the parent geometry?

00:26:48.236 --> 00:26:51.824
The one that is shown is what?
Seesaw.

00:26:51.824 --> 00:26:56.866
And the parent geometry?
Right, trigonal bipyramidal.

00:26:56.866 --> 00:27:01.078
All right.
Here we have AX four E.

00:27:01.078 --> 00:27:04.669
We have an SN number of five.

00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:09.110
We have four atoms bound.
We have one lone pair.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:14.590
And now it is observed that
there are two sets of SF bonds.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.803
One set is 1.545,
and one is 1.646.

00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:23.000
What do you think those
different bond sets --

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:39.000
There are two types of bonds.
We have one lone pair.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.023
Likely one set would involve
the gray atoms,

00:27:48.023 --> 00:27:50.695
and the other would be the
black atoms.

00:27:50.695 --> 00:27:53.085
Which do you think would be
longer?

00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:56.601
Do you think the gray or the
black would be longer,

00:27:56.601 --> 00:28:00.468
the bond lengths from the
central atom to the gray or to

00:28:00.468 --> 00:28:03.446
the black would be longer?
Gray.

00:28:03.446 --> 00:28:07.553
And why is that?
Right, because these are at 90

00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:10.678
going down.
Whereas, this is at 120.

00:28:10.678 --> 00:28:15.589
The 90 is more repulsive,
so it basically kind of pushes

00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:20.142
that up farther and down
farther, moves them farther

00:28:20.142 --> 00:28:23.000
away.
The black atoms are already

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
farther and won't feel the
repulsion as much.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.222
Another way to sort of,
if you have a lone pair here,

00:28:32.222 --> 00:28:37.176
for the lone pair to feel like
it really has the space that it

00:28:37.176 --> 00:28:41.805
requires, is to sort of repel
the atoms that are closer in

00:28:41.805 --> 00:28:45.540
terms of distance,
repel them just a little bit

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.870
farther away.
And then it can kind of fill

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.874
out and feel like it has enough
space.

00:28:51.874 --> 00:28:55.935
Again, if you had an
experimentally observed set of

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:59.183
bond lengths,
you could rationalize using

00:28:59.183 --> 00:29:03.420
VSEPR, why you would have this.
Okay.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.210
As we said, more repulsion
between the lone pair electrons

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:13.420
and the axial ones because those
are at 90, so those would move

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.865
farther away.
That is a lot of the theory.

00:29:16.865 --> 00:29:21.655
Now we are just going to run
through these sheets and talk

00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:26.361
about the different types of
geometries, the names of the

00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:31.403
different types of geometries
when you have the lone pairs on

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:35.076
there.
And then look at some examples.

00:29:35.076 --> 00:29:38.759
Again, if you call out the
answers, and if we go through

00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:41.639
this quickly,
this is all that we need to go

00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:44.586
over for today,
and it will be a good review.

00:29:44.586 --> 00:29:47.533
You will sort of have the
opportunity, today,

00:29:47.533 --> 00:29:50.681
to memorize this.
You might want to go back over

00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:53.695
it a couple times,
but pretty much this is the

00:29:53.695 --> 00:29:56.173
whole unit.
It is not too challenging.

00:29:56.173 --> 00:29:59.789
If we have AX two E,
we are going to have a SN

00:29:59.789 --> 00:30:04.365
number of three.
And a molecular shape.

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:09.204
I will draw that.
And what is the name of that

00:30:09.204 --> 00:30:11.354
geometry?
It is bent.

00:30:11.354 --> 00:30:17.161
And that is because you are
only considering the bonded

00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:20.924
atoms.
You are not talking about the

00:30:20.924 --> 00:30:25.010
lone pair.
We don't really see the lone

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.956
pair, two bends,
and so it would just look bent

00:30:29.956 --> 00:30:35.979
to us.
That is where that comes from.

00:30:35.979 --> 00:30:43.408
And what angles would this have
for this particular case,

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:46.591
SN number of three?
Okay.

00:30:46.591 --> 00:30:52.826
We have this one here.
The SN three would have a

00:30:52.826 --> 00:31:00.280
trigonal planar parent geometry.
But if we take a lone pair and

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.840
put that on instead of an atom,
then it will also be somewhat

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.957
compressing of those two atoms
down there.

00:31:07.957 --> 00:31:11.377
We won't really know,
without knowing what the

00:31:11.377 --> 00:31:14.722
central atom is,
we cannot really predict how

00:31:14.722 --> 00:31:17.306
bad the compression is going to
be.

00:31:17.306 --> 00:31:21.866
What you would put is less than
120 here, because it would be

00:31:21.866 --> 00:31:25.135
120 if this was an atom and not
a lone pair.

00:31:25.135 --> 00:31:30.000
If this is a lone pair,
then it is less than 120.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.419
All right.
Here is another case.

00:31:33.419 --> 00:31:38.272
Now we have three atoms bound,
one lone pair,

00:31:38.272 --> 00:31:43.345
SN number of four.
And our parent geometry here

00:31:43.345 --> 00:31:48.750
would be tetrahedral.
And now we have a lone pair.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.169
We saw this a little bit
before.

00:31:52.169 --> 00:31:55.698
And what is that geometry
called?

00:31:55.698 --> 00:32:01.717
Here, we have this picture.
What is this called?

00:32:01.717 --> 00:32:04.466
Trigonal pyramidal.
We have this.

00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:07.300
And what would the angles be
here?

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.907
Less than 109.5.
All of you should know the

00:32:10.907 --> 00:32:15.116
answers because they are
actually in your handout,

00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:18.809
so feel free and confident to
yell them out.

00:32:18.809 --> 00:32:22.331
All right.
Again, this is going to be less

00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:28.000
than 109.5 because we have a
lone pair pressing down.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.252
You have to in all these cases
consider what the parent

00:32:33.252 --> 00:32:37.240
geometry is.
And then the angles are going

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:43.270
to be a little less than that if
you have one lone pair sitting

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.924
on top.
All right.

00:32:44.924 --> 00:32:49.398
AX two E two has a SN
number of four.

00:32:49.398 --> 00:32:53.386
All right.
What geometry is this based on?

00:32:53.386 --> 00:33:00.000
Yeah, tetrahedral again.
We have two lone pairs on that.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.272
And what does that look like it
should be called?

00:33:04.272 --> 00:33:08.188
Bent as well.
And now the angles are going to

00:33:08.188 --> 00:33:10.947
be less than 109.5.
So, you see,

00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:15.931
we have two bent molecules,
but the angle isn't the same.

00:33:15.931 --> 00:33:21.183
It depends on whether it is
based on a trigonal planar or it

00:33:21.183 --> 00:33:25.900
is based on tetrahedral.
You need to sort of know what

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:31.596
the whole molecule was to figure
out what degree of bend you have

00:33:31.596 --> 00:33:35.198
in these two.
All right.

00:33:35.198 --> 00:33:39.990
AX four E has SN
number of five.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:46.101
And so our shape here,
what is this one going to be?

00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:50.175
Yeah, this is going to be a
seesaw.

00:33:50.175 --> 00:33:54.728
And so what are our angles
going to be?

00:33:54.728 --> 00:34:00.000
Right, less than 120,
less than 90.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.027
It could be that really the 120
are not going to be that

00:34:04.027 --> 00:34:08.421
affected, but that will be what
you will put down because you

00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:11.936
don't really know.
This is just a rough predictor

00:34:11.936 --> 00:34:16.111
of what those are going to be,
so it is less than what the

00:34:16.111 --> 00:34:18.308
parent molecule was.
All right.

00:34:18.308 --> 00:34:21.823
SN number of five.
And so what are we going to be

00:34:21.823 --> 00:34:24.606
doing here?
We are going to add another

00:34:24.606 --> 00:34:29.000
lone, take off an atom,
add another lone pair.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.090
And what are we going to get
here?

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.930
Right, T-shaped.
And the angles will be...

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:41.362
At this point is our T-shape,
and so we will have less than

00:34:41.362 --> 00:34:44.078
90.
You will have the two lone

00:34:44.078 --> 00:34:48.854
pairs in the equatorial
position, as we talked about

00:34:48.854 --> 00:34:54.193
before, trying to spread out as
much as they possibly can.

00:34:54.193 --> 00:35:00.000
Now we are replacing another
one with a lone pair.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.988
Another bonded atom.
Our SN number is still five.

00:35:03.988 --> 00:35:07.893
And what shape are we going to
get in that case?

00:35:07.893 --> 00:35:11.632
Linear, right.
They all go in these equatorial

00:35:11.632 --> 00:35:15.952
positions to spread out as much
as they possibly can.

00:35:15.952 --> 00:35:20.272
And so we are going to end up
with a linear molecule,

00:35:20.272 --> 00:35:24.759
so we would replace here.
And what are our angles here?

00:35:24.759 --> 00:35:28.000
They are exactly 180.
Yeah?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.584
It could be that there would,
but they probably will just be

00:35:39.584 --> 00:35:42.864
really spreading out around to
fill out as much room as

00:35:42.864 --> 00:35:45.415
possible around the whole
equatorial place.

00:35:45.415 --> 00:35:48.878
You can just sort of think
about it as if there was space,

00:35:48.878 --> 00:35:52.098
they would move into it,
so they have really filled up

00:35:52.098 --> 00:35:54.467
this space.
And pretty much you might as

00:35:54.467 --> 00:35:57.322
well keep them there,
because whichever way they

00:35:57.322 --> 00:36:02.000
move, they are just going to get
repelled in another direction.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.022
That's kind of the one
exception, are these ones that

00:36:06.022 --> 00:36:09.889
turn out to be linear.
There is one other exception

00:36:09.889 --> 00:36:13.602
where the angles are not going
to change as well,

00:36:13.602 --> 00:36:18.397
where you have orbitals on kind
of either side that counteract.

00:36:18.397 --> 00:36:21.027
That is a good question.
All right.

00:36:21.027 --> 00:36:23.812
One more.
We have AX five E,

00:36:23.812 --> 00:36:27.292
SN number of six.
This is based on what parent

00:36:27.292 --> 00:36:30.000
molecule?
Octahedral.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.254
We are going to take off one
ligand, and so this would be,

00:36:37.254 --> 00:36:41.963
if we removed one of the
ligands here,

00:36:41.963 --> 00:36:47.945
we get this parent shape,
which is called square

00:36:47.945 --> 00:36:52.909
pyramidal.
And what are the angles going

00:36:52.909 --> 00:36:56.090
to be, here?
Less than 90.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.220
Okay.
Every year, when I do this

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.148
unit, I like to reward people
who are in class.

00:37:04.148 --> 00:37:07.820
And so I give a little hint
about the final.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:12.176
And the hint will be that this
will be on the final,

00:37:12.176 --> 00:37:16.019
[LAUGHTER] so you might want to
put that down.

00:37:16.019 --> 00:37:20.801
The last couple of years I did
seesaw, which really is my

00:37:20.801 --> 00:37:24.644
personal favorite,
but at some point I have to

00:37:24.644 --> 00:37:29.000
switch.
This time it will be this one.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.314
And it is always so sad to me
when people get that one wrong,

00:37:34.314 --> 00:37:37.325
so please get that one right.
Okay.

00:37:37.325 --> 00:37:40.337
Let's keep going.
SN number is six.

00:37:40.337 --> 00:37:44.500
And so we are going to put on
another lone pair.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.334
And where are we going to put
it?

00:37:47.334 --> 00:37:52.294
We are going to try to move it
so that there is the least

00:37:52.294 --> 00:37:57.874
amount of repulsion between the
lone pairs, so it is going to be

00:37:57.874 --> 00:38:02.625
up on top.
This geometry keeps the lone

00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:06.843
pairs as far away from each
other as possible.

00:38:06.843 --> 00:38:12.656
And what is the remaining thing
called when you have those lone

00:38:12.656 --> 00:38:16.500
pairs on there?
That is going to be square

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.781
planar.
And what about the angles in

00:38:19.781 --> 00:38:23.531
this case?
In this case they are just 90,

00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:29.437
because you have a lone pair on
top pushing down and a lone pair

00:38:29.437 --> 00:38:35.289
on the bottom pushing up.
This is another example where

00:38:35.289 --> 00:38:37.657
it is not less than.
All right.

00:38:37.657 --> 00:38:40.342
Next one.
We add another lone pair.

00:38:40.342 --> 00:38:44.605
And at this point does it
matter where you put the lone

00:38:44.605 --> 00:38:45.236
pair?
No.

00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:49.342
They are all equivalent
positions, so it doesn't make

00:38:49.342 --> 00:38:52.894
any difference.
It is going to be one of these

00:38:52.894 --> 00:38:56.684
guys gets replaced,
and so that is going to leave

00:38:56.684 --> 00:39:00.859
you with the what geometry?
T-shaped.

00:39:00.859 --> 00:39:05.828
And angle here is going to be
this time less than 90,

00:39:05.828 --> 00:39:11.178
right, because it will repel
this one and this one if you

00:39:11.178 --> 00:39:14.713
have a big lone pair in this
position.

00:39:14.713 --> 00:39:16.528
All right.
One more.

00:39:16.528 --> 00:39:21.878
Again, the same geometry.
We take another bonded atom off

00:39:21.878 --> 00:39:27.038
and put another lone pair.
And what are we left with in

00:39:27.038 --> 00:39:30.000
this case?
Linear.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.297
Again, this is going to be 180.
All right.

00:39:33.297 --> 00:39:37.962
Now we have looked at all of
those, and we can very quickly

00:39:37.962 --> 00:39:40.214
go down.
And in this handout,

00:39:40.214 --> 00:39:44.235
I have most of it written.
I don't have the angles,

00:39:44.235 --> 00:39:48.820
so that you can write the
angles in and have your complete

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.439
set for this as well.
Now let's look at water.

00:39:52.439 --> 00:39:57.265
The Lewis structure for water,
you would end up with two lone

00:39:57.265 --> 00:40:03.047
pairs on the oxygen.
And so what formula type would

00:40:03.047 --> 00:40:06.196
this be?
AX two E two.

00:40:06.196 --> 00:40:08.939
SN number of four.
Geometry?

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:11.682
Bent angle.
Less than 109.5,

00:40:11.682 --> 00:40:16.660
because this is based on the
tetrahedral geometry.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:22.349
Remember, bent could either be
less than 120 or less than

00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:28.241
109.5, but if you have a SN
number of four then it is based

00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:35.646
on tetrahedral geometry.
It would be less than 109.5,

00:40:35.646 --> 00:40:39.683
which is the tetrahedral
angles.

00:40:39.683 --> 00:40:42.418
Okay.
SF four,

00:40:42.418 --> 00:40:49.320
here is our structure.
Formula type for this would be?

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:55.181
AX four E.
And that is a SN number of

00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:57.655
five.
And the shape?

00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:01.182
Seesaw.
And angles?

00:41:01.182 --> 00:41:05.053
Yeah, less than 90 and less
than 120.

00:41:05.053 --> 00:41:09.247
Here is another one,
BrF three.

00:41:09.247 --> 00:41:15.161
These are all probably ones
that you did Lewis structure

00:41:15.161 --> 00:41:18.387
for.
If not, I am sure you will

00:41:18.387 --> 00:41:22.365
before the final.
Here is another one.

00:41:22.365 --> 00:41:30.000
The formula type for this would
be AX three E two.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.095
And SN number?
Five.

00:41:32.095 --> 00:41:34.522
And geometry?
T-shaped.

00:41:34.522 --> 00:41:36.727
Angles?
Less than 90.

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:39.154
Okay.
If we keep going,

00:41:39.154 --> 00:41:44.227
here is another example,
selenium and fluoride.

00:41:44.227 --> 00:41:48.198
And we have three sets of lone
pairs.

00:41:48.198 --> 00:41:53.713
What is the formula type?
AX two E three.

00:41:53.713 --> 00:41:56.691
SN number of five.
Geometry?

00:41:56.691 --> 00:42:00.000
Linear.
Angle?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.303
180.
Okay.

00:42:01.303 --> 00:42:05.794
BrF five. Formula type?

00:42:05.794 --> 00:42:09.995
AX five E. SN number?

00:42:09.995 --> 00:42:11.878
Six. Geometry?

00:42:11.878 --> 00:42:15.355
Square pyramidal.
Angles?

00:42:15.355 --> 00:42:21.584
Less than 90.
You want to remember that one.

00:42:21.584 --> 00:42:26.219
Okay.
Here is another one with an

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:32.370
addition lone pair.
Formula type?

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.955
AX four E two.
SN number?

00:42:35.955 --> 00:42:37.326
Six. Geometry?

00:42:37.326 --> 00:42:39.435
Square planar.
Angle?

00:42:39.435 --> 00:42:43.336
90, exactly.
That completes that list.

00:42:43.336 --> 00:42:49.030
Again, the theory of VSEPR,
you are taking experimental

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:53.986
results and then trying to apply
a theory to it.

00:42:53.986 --> 00:43:02.000
It is not good at really making
exact predictions about things.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.437
But it is really good at
rationalizing what they have.

00:43:07.437 --> 00:43:10.770
All right.
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving,
everybody.
