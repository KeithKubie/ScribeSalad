so when you think about the skills of

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140
so when you think about the skills of
 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.840
so when you think about the skills of
the future and what's really most

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850
the future and what's really most
 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.670
the future and what's really most
important I'd say learning agility is

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680
important I'd say learning agility is
 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.199
important I'd say learning agility is
probably one of the most important

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209
probably one of the most important
 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.539
probably one of the most important
skills that people can have and what

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
skills that people can have and what
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.330
skills that people can have and what
exactly is learning agility learning

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
exactly is learning agility learning
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849
exactly is learning agility learning
agility is really the ability to learn

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
agility is really the ability to learn
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.000
agility is really the ability to learn
new things quickly and be aware of the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
new things quickly and be aware of the
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.830
new things quickly and be aware of the
trends that are that are coming out in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
trends that are that are coming out in
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.260
trends that are that are coming out in
whatever industry you're in in

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270
whatever industry you're in in
 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.210
whatever industry you're in in
particular so if you're a hiring manager

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
particular so if you're a hiring manager
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.160
particular so if you're a hiring manager
and you're wondering does this person

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170
and you're wondering does this person
 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380
and you're wondering does this person
that I'm interviewing have learning

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
that I'm interviewing have learning
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.569
that I'm interviewing have learning
agility ask them you know what did you

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
agility ask them you know what did you
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.970
agility ask them you know what did you
learn last week what did you learn last

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
learn last week what did you learn last
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.680
learn last week what did you learn last
month what did you learn last year it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
month what did you learn last year it
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.960
month what did you learn last year it
will give you a sense of what kind of a

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970
will give you a sense of what kind of a
 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.420
will give you a sense of what kind of a
learner that person is do they read a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
learner that person is do they read a
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160
learner that person is do they read a
lot of books do they spend a lot of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
lot of books do they spend a lot of
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.979
lot of books do they spend a lot of
their own time learning about new trends

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
their own time learning about new trends
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139
their own time learning about new trends
in in their industry if so they're going

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
in in their industry if so they're going
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299
in in their industry if so they're going
to be the most valuable employees that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
to be the most valuable employees that
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.280
to be the most valuable employees that
you can have in the future because

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290
you can have in the future because
 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.280
you can have in the future because
things are changing so quickly

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290
things are changing so quickly
 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.229
things are changing so quickly
year by year that it's hard to predict

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
year by year that it's hard to predict
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819
year by year that it's hard to predict
what skills you'll need so people who

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
what skills you'll need so people who
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799
what skills you'll need so people who
can actually pick up skills before you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
can actually pick up skills before you
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.509
can actually pick up skills before you
even know which ones are most important

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
even know which ones are most important
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490
even know which ones are most important
are gonna be the most valuable one of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
are gonna be the most valuable one of
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560
are gonna be the most valuable one of
the arguments that I make in the book is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
the arguments that I make in the book is
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.039
the arguments that I make in the book is
is that typically corporate learning has

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
is that typically corporate learning has
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.810
is that typically corporate learning has
focused on on three or three primary

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
focused on on three or three primary
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.789
focused on on three or three primary
areas managers leaders and

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
areas managers leaders and
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.590
areas managers leaders and
high-potential employees yet that's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
high-potential employees yet that's
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.590
high-potential employees yet that's
leaving 80% of your workforce out of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
leaving 80% of your workforce out of
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270
leaving 80% of your workforce out of
those learning programs that most

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
those learning programs that most
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.250
those learning programs that most
companies are focused on so what are the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260
companies are focused on so what are the
 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.320
companies are focused on so what are the
80% of your employees supposed to be

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330
80% of your employees supposed to be
 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.899
80% of your employees supposed to be
doing if if the company's not focusing

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
doing if if the company's not focusing
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.700
doing if if the company's not focusing
on on you so I think that there's this

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
on on you so I think that there's this
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.550
on on you so I think that there's this
amazing trend that's happening where

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
amazing trend that's happening where
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.679
amazing trend that's happening where
people are realizing we need to skill

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
people are realizing we need to skill
 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.109
people are realizing we need to skill
the whole workforce not just the 20%

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
the whole workforce not just the 20%
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.590
the whole workforce not just the 20%
that are in leader leader or manager

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600
that are in leader leader or manager
 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.630
that are in leader leader or manager
positions and so I think the trend is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
positions and so I think the trend is
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.100
positions and so I think the trend is
more towards personalized learning

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
more towards personalized learning
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.469
more towards personalized learning
because everybody's at a different phase

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
because everybody's at a different phase
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.350
because everybody's at a different phase
of their learning regardless of what

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
of their learning regardless of what
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179
of their learning regardless of what
position they're in and so for a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
position they're in and so for a
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219
position they're in and so for a
corporate learning organization to try

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
corporate learning organization to try
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.819
corporate learning organization to try
to fit one size to try to implement one

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
to fit one size to try to implement one
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.539
to fit one size to try to implement one
size fits all programs into the company

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549
size fits all programs into the company
 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.550
size fits all programs into the company
doesn't typically match what each

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
doesn't typically match what each
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.830
doesn't typically match what each
individual employee might need so with

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
individual employee might need so with
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.539
individual employee might need so with
personalized learning you can actually

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549
personalized learning you can actually
 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.339
personalized learning you can actually
assess what are the strengths and

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
assess what are the strengths and
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.399
assess what are the strengths and
weaknesses for any given role and where

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409
weaknesses for any given role and where
 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.140
weaknesses for any given role and where
are the skill gaps that you have either

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
are the skill gaps that you have either
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.789
are the skill gaps that you have either
to get better the job that you already

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799
to get better the job that you already
 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.819
to get better the job that you already
have or to prepare yourself for the jobs

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829
have or to prepare yourself for the jobs
 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.600
have or to prepare yourself for the jobs
of the future so I think for many years

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
of the future so I think for many years
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.420
of the future so I think for many years
we've been stuck in a model where we

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
we've been stuck in a model where we
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850
we've been stuck in a model where we
think about hiring managers think about

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
think about hiring managers think about
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.039
think about hiring managers think about
you know where someone went to school

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049
you know where someone went to school
 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.979
you know where someone went to school
and what degree they got and those are

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
and what degree they got and those are
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.819
and what degree they got and those are
huge qualifications for whether or not

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829
huge qualifications for whether or not
 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.369
huge qualifications for whether or not
you hire somebody but one of the things

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379
you hire somebody but one of the things
 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.949
you hire somebody but one of the things
that we often ask is if I ask you tell

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959
that we often ask is if I ask you tell
 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.780
that we often ask is if I ask you tell
me about your education you'll tell me

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790
me about your education you'll tell me
 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.699
me about your education you'll tell me
where you went to school and where you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
where you went to school and where you
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.740
where you went to school and where you
got your degree yet that might have been

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
got your degree yet that might have been
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.960
got your degree yet that might have been
10 or 15 years ago and does that really

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
10 or 15 years ago and does that really
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.530
10 or 15 years ago and does that really
tell you what you actually know and what

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
tell you what you actually know and what
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.440
tell you what you actually know and what
you can do so the the workforce of the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
you can do so the the workforce of the
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.690
you can do so the the workforce of the
future I think is going to really focus

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
future I think is going to really focus
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.569
future I think is going to really focus
more on skills and what people can

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579
more on skills and what people can
 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.839
more on skills and what people can
actually do rather than where they went

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849
actually do rather than where they went
 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.879
actually do rather than where they went
to school because if you liken it to

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889
to school because if you liken it to
 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.670
to school because if you liken it to
asking somebody if I asked you tell me

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
asking somebody if I asked you tell me
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.229
asking somebody if I asked you tell me
about your health and you told me I ran

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239
about your health and you told me I ran
 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.960
about your health and you told me I ran
a marathon 10 years ago does that really

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
a marathon 10 years ago does that really
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.170
a marathon 10 years ago does that really
tell me what your health is like not

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
tell me what your health is like not
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.180
tell me what your health is like not
really so how do they talk the language

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190
really so how do they talk the language
 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.939
really so how do they talk the language
of skills and how do we get people to be

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949
of skills and how do we get people to be
 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:27.949
of skills and how do we get people to be
able to communicate what skills they

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
able to communicate what skills they
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.559
able to communicate what skills they
have and what skills they need and and

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569
have and what skills they need and and
 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.750
have and what skills they need and and
if hiring managers can start focusing

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760
if hiring managers can start focusing
 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.770
if hiring managers can start focusing
more on skills rather than degrees I

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
more on skills rather than degrees I
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.710
more on skills rather than degrees I
think that they'll be a lot more

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720
think that they'll be a lot more
 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.649
think that they'll be a lot more
effective ways to get people in the

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659
effective ways to get people in the
 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.430
