00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:07.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right.

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:09.326
Okay, guys, heads up.

00:00:10.946 --> 00:00:12.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Something
big is taking off

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:14.556
at high schools all over California.

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:18.916
&gt;&gt;Alan: If it wasn't for the Academy,
I- I probably would've dropped out,

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:21.966
and, you know, I'm graduating
now and gonna go to college.

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:24.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: More than 1,000 schools

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:27.626
within schools are merging
college prep and career

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:31.446
and technical education, making
the high school experience real,

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.096
rigorous, and rewarding.

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:35.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I know it's going
to be a thicker viscosity.

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.646
&gt;&gt;Steven: This is about making
sure that the young people of today

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:41.726
in California and across the
country are prepared to go

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:46.536
on to higher education, go into the
world of work, and be successful

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:50.666
because the skill sets that they're
getting really are 21st century.

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The average velocity
is- that was your velocity...

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:55.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Described by
different labels and delivered

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:59.176
in various forms, the concept
is as old as apprenticeships--

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.306
to link learning to careers.

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:03.596
&gt;&gt;So what are two ways of
stimulating your heart rate?

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:06.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Bravo Medical
Magnet High School in Los Angeles,

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:10.706
all students are exposed to career
opportunities in the health field.

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:12.796
&gt;&gt;Student: This electrode's going
to be measuring your brainwaves,

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:14.186
so I'm going to put an
electrode on your forehead

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.466
and one electrode on your ear.

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:16.556
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:19.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There are also smaller
academies within the school,

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.236
like the Engineering
for Health Academy,

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:25.436
in which students move together
through a three-year curriculum

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:27.976
of focused, academic,
and technical study.

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And when it's such a
small amount, we do really need

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.186
to make sure that it's exact.

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Bravo forms
partnerships with local businesses

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:37.286
and institutions like the University

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:41.106
of Southern California Medical
Center, which provide internships

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:43.386
and other work-based
learning opportunities.

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:46.326
&gt;&gt;Faizan: I've been testing my
compounds, which are my drugs,

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:49.186
basically trying to
find a cure for cancer.

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:51.376
&gt;&gt;Mark: Education has to
be much more hands on.

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:55.436
We can't continue to just
educate students in silos

00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:58.866
and not integrate technologies into-

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:01.896
into medical applications
in this case.

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:03.676
&gt;&gt;Student: So where's
the edit at right now?

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:06.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since academies
generally have a limited number

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:10.416
of slots available, students
develop a sense of community,

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:11.906
and learning becomes personal

00:02:11.906 --> 00:02:14.626
because teachers know
each student individually.

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:15.846
&gt;&gt;Shawn: What is this
poster representing

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:16.616
since you're putting it in?

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:19.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Shawn Sullivan teaches
a sequence of animation courses

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:22.046
at Sheldon High School in Sacramento.

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:24.306
&gt;&gt;Shawn: Doing an academy
is really important.

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:28.056
It gives a chance for the students
to be around likeminded students.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:30.576
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, so we're going to
start off master chart right here

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:34.196
and the narrator introduces the film,
"Ah, the natural selection pet shop."

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:37.226
&gt;&gt;Shawn: What they're really
learning is what they can take

00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:41.566
to any job they do as working
with teams, coming up with an idea

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.276
and sharing it with others, and
seeing it being finished and created.

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:48.266
&gt;&gt;Student: One, two, three, go.

00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:49.446
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, I just signed

00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.946
up to see what it was,
green energy technology.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:53.196
Wonder what it is.

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:54.646
Took the class, love it.

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:57.846
Just going home, telling my
parents, "Look what I learned.

00:02:57.846 --> 00:02:58.696
I made biodiesel.

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:00.516
I created a solar bicycle ambulance."

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:00.856
All right.

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:04.486
Act sick. Actually want to continue,
maybe become electrical engineer.

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:06.146
&gt;&gt;Student: Let me see
if the light works.

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:06.956
Check it out.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:08.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: According
to recent studies,

00:03:08.716 --> 00:03:12.166
academies have higher attendance
and lower dropout rates.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:16.526
Twice as many high-risk students
complete required core classes

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:20.576
when enrolled in academies, and more
of those students apply to college.

00:03:20.886 --> 00:03:22.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Bravo has been great.

00:03:22.446 --> 00:03:25.776
This is like the only place that
offers me a chance to work at a lab,

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:27.136
and this experience has helped me.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:29.976
Yes, it's actually pretty fun.

00:03:30.406 --> 00:03:32.946
&gt;&gt;Keith: I chose this academy
because I'm trying to get

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:36.426
into like a computer-based
technological-based career

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:38.146
when I grow up, and so
like this really helps me

00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:39.786
with the hands-on problem solving.

00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:40.816
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This one's
going a long way.

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:41.226
&gt;&gt;Keith: Yeah.

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:44.086
It just integrates everything in
to where you have to learn how

00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:45.736
to work together with
people and things

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:47.336
to get something finished
and accomplished.

00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:50.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Was a good shot.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:51.316
Nice, Keith.

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:52.206
All right.

00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:55.496
Back to the launch site.

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:58.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
