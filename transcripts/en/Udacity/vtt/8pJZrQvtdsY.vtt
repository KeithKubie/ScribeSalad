00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.380
We've just seen how the fundamental
theorem of linear programming

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.939
tells us that we can always
achieve an optimum value for

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.770
the program with a basic solution.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.880
Moreover, basic solutions
come from a choice of m

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.640
linearly independent columns for
the basis.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.310
This immediately suggests an algorithm
where we just try all possible bases and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.530
take the best generated basic
feasible solution, as outlined here.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.330
And my question for you is, why is this
algorithm problematic or impractical?

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.230
Check all that apply.
