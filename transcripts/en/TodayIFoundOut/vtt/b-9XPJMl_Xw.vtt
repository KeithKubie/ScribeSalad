00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:35.149
For

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.930
years fans of the Star Wars franchise have
expressed frustration with the fact that Chewbacca

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.030
didn’t get a medal at the close of Star
Wars: A New Hope despite playing a pivotal

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.289
role in the destruction of the Death Star.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.520
Since then, George Lucas constantly meddled
with his films, but stopped short of giving

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.500
a CGI medal to Chewbacca and instead decided
that Greedo apparently had the worst aim in

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.500
the galaxy…

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.659
But why didn’t Chewbacca get a medal in
the first place?

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.289
To begin with, there’s currently no canonical
explanation for why the lovable Kashyyyk wasn’t

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.109
rewarded for his bravery when his co-pilot
was.

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:12.270
This is because after Disney gained ownership
of the Star Wars franchise, they decided to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.959
delete from canon the entire Expanded Universe
so that you don’t get to know ahead of time

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.090
what’s going to happen in the upcoming films
and their writers aren’t bound to storylines

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.250
in the numerous comics, video games and books
released by Lucasfilm over the years.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.200
(It also no doubt helped that this way they
can make a whole lot more money by rebooting

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.500
the entire thing with many new books and other
media based on the upcoming films coming soon

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.910
to a store near you ;-)). While the old Expanded
Universe certainly could use a little house

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.130
cleaning (with Lucas having been notoriously
lax at policing inconsistencies in it), this

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.109
is a little unfortunate as particularly Heir
to the Empire, Dark Force Rising, and The

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.010
Last Command (the first of which set five
years after Return of the Jedi) are awesome

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.709
and would have been amazing to see on the
big screen in some form or another.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.709
Ah well…

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:08.970
In any event, as a 
result of all this, the current official canon

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.569
of Star Wars is limited to that established
by the core six films (despite the issues

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:12.569
with I-III), The Clone Wars TV show and any
games, movies or books that are going to be

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.569
released by Disney in the future.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.230
While Disney has acknowledged that its writers
are free to take inspiration from the Expanded

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.699
Universe, they’re also free to ignore it
to come up with their own ideas, so long as

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:26.080
it doesn’t contradict the canon Disney establishes
from here on out.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.670
Meaning, Chewbacca never got a medal, Boba
Fett never escaped the Sarlaac pit and Darth

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.949
Vader’s glove never went on a planet hopping
adventure after Luke cut off his hand.

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.170
But since we never pass up an opportunity
to delve into the Star Wars Universe, we may

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.390
as well thumb our noses at Disney’s decree
and dig deeper into the saga of Chewie’s

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.549
lack of a medal.

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.400
For this, we must go back to the beginning…

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.989
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far too full
of terrycloth jumpsuits, George Lucas gave

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.301
an interview recorded just a few weeks after
the release of A New Hope; when asked why

00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:03.069
Chewbacca got stiffed on the medal front,
Lucas explained that the Wookiee people “do

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.019
not care for medals” and as a result, Chewbacca
simply didn’t want it.

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.730
This is strange, because according to the
film’s novelization which was released six

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.550
months before the film and was supposedly
written by George Lucas, Chewbacca did get

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.530
a medal during the award ceremony.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.639
As it turns out, the book was actually written
by a ghostwriter called Alan Dean Foster,

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.610
who based the majority of the novel on Lucas’
original screenplay where Chewbacca was awarded

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.071
a medal for his part in destroying the Death
Star, meaning it was initially Lucas’ intention

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:35.190
for him to get one: [Draft from May of 1974]

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.390
Queen Leia, in all her grandeur, sits on the
magnificent throne of Aquilae.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.600
Starkiller and the general stand to her right.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.880
Several old advisors stand to her left.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.509
Han presents Chewbacca and a delegation of
Wookees with a treaty, gifts, and a medal

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:49.509
of honor.

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.509
They bow and exit.

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.560
Han moves to one side of the crowded court.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.460
Exactly why Lucas decided to make this change
during his many revisions of the script isn’t

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.410
clear, because he eventually went back on
his explanation that Wookiees don’t place

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.030
value in tangible rewards in a later interview
with the Official Star Wars Fan Club, instead

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.900
claiming that Chewbacca did get a medal in
a small ceremony after the one seen in the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.900
film.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.940
Lucas explained that because Princess Leia
was so much shorter than Chewbacca, who is

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.930
canonically stated to be 7 feet 6 inches tall
(3 inches taller than Peter Mayhew, the actor

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.330
who physically portrays him), she couldn’t
place the medal around the Wookiee’s neck.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.639
Chewie_medalThis explanation was expanded
upon in the 1980 comic, The Day after the

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.639
Death Star!

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.560
In it, Chewbacca is given a medal by Princess
Leia in a small private ceremony, with Leia

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.979
having to stand on a table so that she can
reach him comfortably.

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.499
(Although, why he couldn’t just bend down
is anybody’s guess.)

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.199
The comic also alludes to Lucas’ earlier
assertion that Wookiees don’t place value

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.930
in material rewards by showing that Chewbacca
initially refuses the medal, only changing

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.030
his mind at the behest of Han Solo, thus explaining
why he was awarded it the day afterward.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.930
But even if you reject such works that are
no longer part of canon, Chewbacca was (kind

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.210
of) awarded a medal some two decades after
the original film during the 1997 MTV movie

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.210
awards.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.740
At this award ceremony, he won a “Lifetime
Achievement Award” which was intentionally

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.270
styled to look exactly like a Medal of Bravery
from the film and was presented to him by

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.770
none other than Princess Leia (aka Carrie
Fisher).

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.710
While not exactly canon, the award was largely
seen as a tongue in cheek way of addressing

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.639
one of the major fan complaints about the
original trilogy and was supported by Lucasfilm

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.360
who provided Mayhew with a copy of his costume
to wear on stage.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.990
Upon receiving the award, Chewbacca addressed
the crowd and uttered a few shorts words of

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.819
appreciation before being given a rousing
round of applause.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.710
In the end, while he may have been slighted
in A New Hope, as Chewbacca himself (Peter

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:47.639
Mayhew) noted, Chewie did get the last word
in the film

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.460
Speaking of film endings that had a glaring
mistake, in the original TV version of Rudolph

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.370
the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Rudolph, Hermey, and
Yukon Cornelius promise to help the toys on

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.939
the Island of Misfit Toys.

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:03.339
However, once Rudolph and company leave the
island, they never actually bother to help

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:04.339
the toys.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.610
This resulted in numerous complaints that
Rudolph broke his promise, so a new scene

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.039
was added to the end of a subsequent version
of the film where Rudolph leads Santa to the

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:16.069
island to collect the toys.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:19.789
According to Mayhew, during the filming of
the Endor scenes, he wasn’t allowed to walk

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.039
around the forest in costume without guards
because the crew were concerned that he’d

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:26.779
be shot by a hunter, perhaps mistaking him
for Bigfoot.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:31.689
Ironically, in one questionable Extended Universe
comic called, Into the Great Unknown, Chewbacca

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:34.729
and Han Solo crash into a forest on Earth.

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:39.910
While Solo is ultimately killed by natives,
Chewbacca survives and spends 126 years roaming

00:07:39.910 --> 00:08:15.750
the forest where he becomes mistaken for Bigfoot
in later years.
