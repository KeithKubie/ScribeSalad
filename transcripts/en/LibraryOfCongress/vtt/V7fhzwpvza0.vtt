00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.490
&gt;&gt; JOHN COLE: Well,
good afternoon everyone.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.710
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.690
I'm John Cole.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.050
Up until this week, I was the
Director of the Center for the Book

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.200
in the Library of Congress, which
indeed is sponsoring this talk.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.710
But through different
sets of circumstances,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.290
which pleased me very much,
I've started a new position,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.360
which is a historian of
the Library of Congress.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.650
And I'm going to be
developing a new history office

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.400
about the library, for the library.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.360 position:56%
But I'm exercising my prerogative as
the founding Director of the Center

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.670
for the Book by not only
introducing our speaker today,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.430
but also on Thursday we
have a second talk related

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.400
to elections and the year.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.320 position:56%
And I will be coming back to do some
of those introductions as we move

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.030
into a new phase in the history
of the Center for the Book.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.720
The Center was created
by Daniel Boorstin

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.670
when he was Librarian
of Congress in 1977.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.500
And he plucked me out of the ranks
to become the founding director,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.820
because largely of my interest
in, he knew of my interest

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.120
in the history of the library.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.710
And here we are all of these
years later still having a chance

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.830
to show my interest
and to keep learning

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.610
about the Library of Congress.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.870
Dr. Boorsin's idea was that we,
the library should do more to reach

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.940
out to the general public to
promote books and reading.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.550
And as the Center for the Book
has grown, we have done so,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.640
but we've added literacy promotion,
we've added library promotion.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.700
The center was created
as a partnership

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.000
between the private sector.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.200
We were started with
donations from publishers.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.460
McGraw Hill actually
and Time Life Books.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.730
And continued to really
support most of our activities

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.660
by private donations,
often related to projects.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.780 position:56%
But the Library of Congress supports
our positions, and as we have grown,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.570
we have also created the first,
well Young Readers Center.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.680
It's the first part of the
library that's open to the interest

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.940
and programming for 16 and under.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.640
And it is in the of Jefferson
Building the Library of Congress.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.190
We also are closely associated
with the National Book Festival,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.300
which came to the Library of
Congress with Laura Bush in 2001,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.890
and we just celebrated our
15th annual Festival last year.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.440
And I can announcement this
year's festival is September 24th.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.860
It is now moved off the mall, into
the Washington Convention Center.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.700
And it's bigger and
better than ever.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.350
And in addition, has toilets
and air conditioner inside.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.500
So, and actually the programming
opportunities are much greater too,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.640
as you can well imagine.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.920
You've joined us for a
Books and Beyond Program.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.220
Thank you.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.290
The Books and Beyond
Series started in 1996.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.320
And the notion was to have author
talks about books that were related

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.260
to the Library of Congress,
one way or another.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Often as is the case today,
and often is the case,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.220
the author has made good use of the
Library of Congress's resources.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.530
But we also look for books
that have other kinds

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.140
of relationships to the library.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.930
For example, they were
published by the library,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.880
which obviously will be
related to our collections.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.950
Or maybe they are a
result of a special project

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.350
from the Library of Congress.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.440
But since 1996, we're
approaching 400 of these talks.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.870
One of the nice features
about them is that the Library

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.300
of Congress films them
for its website.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.150
As we actually film the
author presentations

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.990
for the National Book Festival.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.020
But in the Books and
Beyond Series, we now are,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.260
as I said, approaching 400.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.170
And of those, around 300
of them have been filmed.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.790
We didn't get started quite when
we should have with the filming.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.110
But all of the talks including
today's talk are films.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.150
So I ask you to kindly turn
off all things electronic.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.770
We will hear from our speaker.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.290
Then we will have a
question and answer period.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.560
And then finally, there'll be a
book signing at about 1 o'clock.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.990
It needs to start by
1 o'clock for certain.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.150
As you know, our talk today
is "The Fight to Vote."

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.020
And it's by Michael
Waldman, who is here to talk

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.500
about the book and to sign it.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.120
Michael is a constitutional
lawyer and an expert

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.840
on the presidency and
American democracy.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.950
And he too has the right Job.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.610
Since 2005, he has been President
of the Brennan Center for Justice

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.590
at the New York University
School of Law.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.070
A nonpartisan law and policy
institute that focuses

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.850
on improving the systems houses
for a purpose and a goal,

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.300
and focuses on improving the
systems of democracy and justice.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.640
And I learned today the Brennan
Center also has an office

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.000
in Washington and there
is some literature

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.610
out on our literature tables
where you also will find out more

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.930
about the Center for the Book

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.990
and our future programs during
the book signing period.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.040
Under Michael's leadership,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.320 position:56%
the Brennan Center has become a
leading legal voice on election law,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.640
constitutional law, government
reform and racial justice.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.630
Two years ago he tackled the
tough constitutional issue

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.170
of the Second Amendment.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.720
And he chronicled his
discoveries and made his analysis

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.700
in a widely reviewed
and praised book

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.260
"The Second Amendment a Biography."

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.990
And we were privileged to have
him speak here of the Center

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.290
for the Book at the Library

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.060
of Congress all almost
2 years ago to the day.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.620
It was on June 24, 2014.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.850 position:56%
Now, nearly 2 days to the day
later, we are lucky to have him here

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.090
to discuss his new book, "The Fight
to Vote," which is an analysis

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.440
of the crucial American struggle,
very much on our minds today.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.870
And I think I mentioned
we have a talk

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.090
on the history of American
elections.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.590
Not elections as much as
the presidential power

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.450
and the presidencies and the
families related to the presidency

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.680
on Thursday when Stephen
Hess will be here.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.670
But today we're going to be
able to hear Michael talk

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.210
about his second book
that we've featured.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.780
And it too is really
getting excellent reviews.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.490
And we're very pleased
that he can be here to talk

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.150
about "The Fight to Vote."

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.080
It's so important in
our democracy right now,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.750
and certainly on our
minds right now,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.830
what really constitutes the
definition of the consent

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.060
of the governed, and how the right
to vote is a crucial part of it.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.510
So please join me in
welcoming Michael Waldman.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:54.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.030
Michael, thank you.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.470
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: Thank you.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:03.710
Thank you John for the introduction
and thank you for all you have done

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:09.490
for the book and for our
democracy by making so many

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.140
of the ideas available
and by lifting up the idea

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.270
of us coming together
as a national community

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.820
around these discussions
and debates.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.580
Thank you to the library
of Congress.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.580
I want to acknowledge and thank
my friend Raf Sagalen [assumed

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.320
spelling], who is the agent
for me and for so many

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.050
of the great authors whose work
is in the walls of this building.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.930
And my colleagues from
the Brennan Center.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:41.210
It is a challenging and exciting
time to work on these issues.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.220
I appreciate all of you
coming today also at a time

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.190
of great sorrow for our country.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.610
It is striking to walk from Union
Station to here seeing the flags

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.420
at half-mast and understanding
that the country at a moment

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.580
like this can come together
with the militant rededication

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.910 position:56%
to the ideals we all share together.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.560
This book tells part of
the story of those ideals.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.890
And how we forge them and how
we try to live up to them,

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.030
and how hard it often can be.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:22.600
I am asked all the time why
did I write this book now.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.960
And actually the first question
I'm often asked these days is

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.110
so do you still support
the right to vote.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.340
And I generally answer yes.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:40.330
But even before this topsy-turvy
election, this was a period

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:46.190
where the institutions of American
democracy, the institutions

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.730
of our electoral system
have been under pressure

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:56.020
and facing strains they have
not felt in years and years.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.400
This is going to be an election

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.090
where in 17 states new
voting laws are on the books.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.570
For the first time in a
high turnout election laws

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.130
that I believe actually make it
harder for many Americans to vote.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.320
It's the first time
in half a century

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.700 position:56%
that we have a presidential
election without the full protection

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.570
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.460
which was weakened greatly
by the Supreme Court.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.120
It's the first presidential
election where the full force

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.900 position:56%
of citizens united, and other recent
Supreme Court rulings on money

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.400
and politics are being
felt throughout our system.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.110
And it is a not uncomplicated
story, but here's just an example

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.790 position:56%
of the kind of impact we are seeing.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:51.260
In the last election, 2014 election
the top 100 donors, federal donors,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:58.590
gave more than the 4.75
million small donors combined.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.840
That is a level of concentrated
political wealth we haven't seen

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.290
since the Gilded Age
in the United States.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.390
Add all this on top of the
ongoing normal problems

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:12.050
of our electoral system,
partisan gerrymandering,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:18.440
ramshackle voter registration, and
election administration systems,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.830
and voting machines,
and all the other things

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.170
that people know about it.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.730 position:56%
And it is not a surprise that voter
turnout in the last election plunged

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.150
to the lowest level in 72 years.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.880
And that was that was
during the World War II,

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.390
when a lot of Americans were
overseas fighting and so

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.070
in a sense they had an excuse.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:46.390
These are signs of strain
and stress on our democracy,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.200
on the meaning of that
right to vote.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.710
And so what I wanted to understand
for myself, for my colleagues

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.560
and for our readers was
why is this happening now?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.310
Is it unusual?

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.930 position:56%
And what turns out to be the case,
when you look back at the long sweep

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.740
of history is that the
strains we're facing now,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.470
the fights we're having now, the
fact that the right to vote seems

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.040
to require a fight to vote.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.830
That is consequential.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.190
These debates are fierce.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.930
They are challenging,
but they are not new.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.920
In fact, this question of the fight
to vote has been at the center

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.370
of American history,
from the very beginning.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.970
It's been at the heart
of political debates.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.540
It's often been a fulcrum
for elections.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:44.070
It's a fight that has been
raw and rowdy, and often very,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.470
very partisan from the beginning.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.400
And just as we might see
now, throughout history

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.850
as many Americans have demanded
their place at the table

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.490
and have claimed their
voice in our democracy,

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.300
many others have fought
just as hard to stop them,

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.840
to restrict that right to vote.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.370
And so that is ultimately
the context,

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.800
the usable history I
was seeking to find

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.060
in understanding today's
moment, today's fights.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.550
And as I say, this goes back
all the way to the beginning.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.500
This is not a fight
that started last year,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.620
or 50 years ago in Selma, Alabama.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.690
It's been going on for
240 years, at least.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.460
At the time the nation was
founded, as we all know,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.590
it was far from anything any of
us would consider a democracy.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:45.690
The book begins fittingly, as
we sit in the Jefferson Building

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.980
in the Madison Building across
from the Jefferson Building,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.220 position:56%
the book begins actually with
Thomas Jefferson sitting at his desk

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.110 position:56%
in Philadelphia writing the preamble
to the Declaration of Independence.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:02.680
And stating in that famous preamble
the government is legitimate only

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.840
if it rests on the
consent of the governed.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.720
And that was a radical
idea then, as well as now.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.870
And it had a tremendous
force, a tremendous power,

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.620
and obviously was not the
reality at that moment.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.270
Among other things, as I note,
Jefferson while he was writing

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:26.420 position:56%
that was attended to by a
14-year-old slave boy, Bob Hemmings,

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.260
Sally Hemmings' younger brother.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.300
But the idea took on
a life of its own.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.950
And one of the things that was
interesting is we all know,

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.580
we remember from school
perhaps, that at that time

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.590
when we were not a
democracy, only white men

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.080
who owned property
were allowed to vote.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.710
That was the tradition
in effect handed

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.040
down from England in the continent.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.280
But even then it was controversial.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.740
The power of those revolutionary
ideals began to crack the certainty

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:06.760
that surrounded that approach
in 1776 in Pennsylvania,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:13.030
Benjamin Franklin led a
working man's revolt in one

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.420
of the only places in
the whole revolution

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.100
where it really looked like,
you know the French Revolution.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.050
Where a giant throng of people
stormed the State House.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.220
He led a working man's revolt,
demanding a new government,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.350
and demanding as its key element

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.790
that the property requirement
for voting be ended.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.260
He actually was the
president of the convention

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.130
that wrote the Constitution
of Pennsylvania.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.310
It was the world's most radical
Constitution at the time.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.860
And he said, this is how
he explained it, he said,

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.700
'There's a man who owns a jackass,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.180
and it's worth $50,
so the man can vote.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.550
Then the jackass dies.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.850
The man is older.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.150
He understands more
about government,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.790
but the jackass is still dead.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.330
So the man cannot vote.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.950
So therefore,' he asked, 'who
really has the right to vote?

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.640
The man or the jackass.'

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.300
This seemed pretty
persuasive in Pennsylvania

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.570 position:56%
and they created the most democratic
constitution the world had

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.070
ever seen.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:18.160
Up in Massachusetts, John Adams
reflected the other strain.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.850
He was aghast at this notion
of expanding the right to vote,

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.810
of expanding American democracy.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.310
He wrote their Constitution, he
was urged to do the same thing,

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.590
to end the property requirement.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:32.440
And he wrote, he said,
'If you do that, he said,

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.720 position:56%
women will demand the right to vote.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.550 position:56%
Lads of 18 will think their
interests insufficiently attended to

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.510
and they will demand
the right to vote.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.500
And men,' he said, '
who have not a farthing

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.550
to their name will think
themselves worthy of an equal voice

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.220
in government and then will
demand the right to vote.'

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.390
Adam said, 'there will
be no end of it.'

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.690
And that's basically the book.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.520
That's basically the
story of what happened

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.830
over the next 2.5 centuries.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.550
The idea that government rested
on the consent of the governed,

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.850
and that the vote was the center

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.410
of that consent took
on a life of its own.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:12.410
And it's worth noting in
this wonderful building,

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.230
named after James Madison.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:20.330
As you know, Madison's notes
are our principle basis

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.930
for understanding what
the conversations were

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.510
at the constitutional convention.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.010
And the Constitution
does not originally refer

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.400
to a right to a right to vote.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.850
There was even a move to put
that property requirement

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.730
into the Constitution,
which Madison shrugged off.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.630 position:56%
He didn't think it was such a bad
idea, but he did it was a good idea.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.260
And Franklin actually
blocked it with his prestige.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.960
We only know those notes

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.800
because they were released
many decades later.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.350
But when the doors opened
up and it came time to fight

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.410
for the ratification
of the Constitution,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.000
in that very controversial
debate where the antifederalists,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.570
as they were called,
made a very strong case

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.270
against the Constitution.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.670
One of the issues was this question

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.050
of whether it was a counter
revolution, whether it was elitist,

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:15.130
whether the ordinary people
would be cut out, and Madison

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.300
and the other founders, even the
ones who didn't believe it went

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.830
to the country and said no
this is about democracy.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.900
In Federalist 57, Madison
asked the question.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.040
He said, 'Who are to be the
electors of the new government?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.480
Not the rich more than the poor.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.160
Not the learned more
than the ignorant.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.790
Not the haughty heirs of famous
names more than the humble sons

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.960
of obscurity and unpropitious
fortune.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.900
The great body of the people
are to be the electors."

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:48.730 position:56%
That's as compelling a definition of
democracy as we could find even now.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.220
And again, that took
on a life of its own.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:57.850
In the 1820s and the 1830s, was
the first great breakthrough

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.540
for this expanded right to vote.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:05.330 position:56%
And in the modern political context,
it's worth noting it was won

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.830
by angry, white, working-class
men of the time.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.410
The period of Jacksonian Democracy.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.400
When states all across
the country ended

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.410
that property for white
men in voting.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.300
And one of the interesting
and for me,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.580
slightly unexpected storylines
throughout all of this,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.230
is that that victory for
voting rights was not won

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:32.240
by voting rights groups, or a
lawsuit, or citizen activists.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.430
It was waged and won by
political parties, by politicians,

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.900
by cynical insiders often.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:44.040
One of the great leaders in
that fight was Martin Van Buren,

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.390
who was the governor of New
York and then President.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:54.070
And Van Buren helped to found the
world's first mass political party,

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.090
the Democratic Party,
as we now call it.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.830 position:56%
Around this issue of wider suffrage.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.040
And he was no firebrand.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.090
There's a story from the time that
the Albany was notoriously corrupt,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.640
even then as a state capital, and
one state senator bet another.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.730
He said I bet you I
can get Van Buren

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.260
to give a straight answer
to a simple question.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.680
And the other guy took the bet.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.130
And he went up to Van Buren and
said, Mr. Van Buren, tell me,

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.270
is it true that the
sun rises in the east?

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.410
And Van Buren said well, seeing
as how I never wake up that early,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.770
I cannot speak to that
from personal experience,

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.450
so I don't know the answer to that.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.540
He led the fight to
expand voting rights.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:42.350
And this role of insiders, the role
politicians and political parties,

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.260
is a significant storyline
throughout this

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.720
that recurs and often surprises.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.960
The next great breakthrough
of course,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.420
albeit one that was
tragically cut short,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.010 position:56%
came during and after the Civil War.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:05.280
Because the expansion of the
vote to working-class white men,

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.170
the idea that we were democracy.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.690 position:56%
The almost faddish devotion to
political participation that you saw

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.390
around the country,
again set up the demand

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.370
for the next great breakthrough.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.000
At the end of the Civil War, as the
book describes, Frederick Douglass

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.800 position:56%
and the other abolitionists realized
that the next great fight was

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.300
to enfranchise the former slaves.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.180
To extend the right
to vote to black men.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:35.080
And Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln was
opposed to extending the right

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.620
to vote to the former slaves.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.950
He was ardently against it.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.920
He campaigned against it.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.760
But on this, as on so many other
issues, the war changed Lincoln.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:52.770
By the end of the war, 1 out of
10 Union soldiers was a black man.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.060
When Lincoln, just
a few hundred yards

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.820
from here gave his famous
second inaugural address,

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.930
back when the inaugurals were
on this side of the capital,

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.090
half the audience were
African-American men

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:11.160
and women, many of them in uniform.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.300
And 3 days after Appomattox,
3 days after the surrender

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:21.190
by Robert E. Lee, Lincoln
gave his first major speech

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.490
on reconstruction.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.970
On what he wanted to have
happen after the Civil War.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.560
It was a long speech and he gave
it to from the second floor window

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.160
of the White House by candlelight.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.250
And in the middle of the speech he
said, 'Now I've been criticized,

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.750
because his original plans

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.250
for reconstruction did
not extend voting rights.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:45.050 position:56%
And he said, 'I've been criticized
for not extending the right to vote.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.550 position:56%
And I now agree with that criticism.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.830
In fact, I think that there should
be the right to vote for those

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.060
who have served in the military,
for those who are intelligent.'

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.470
He went through some categories.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.340
And actually in the cabinet
meeting a few days later,

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.600
he made clear to his cabinet that
he was likely to go the whole way.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.710
At least one member of the
audience, historians tell us,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.810
caught the significance
of what Lincoln said.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.320
John Wilkes Booth was there.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.020
And when Lincoln said this, Booth
gasped that means citizenship.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.590
That is the last speech
he will ever give.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:21.280
And he in fact tried to
get the guy at that moment

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.480
to shoot Lincoln on the spot.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.780
The guy standing next to him.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.580
And when he wouldn't
do it, Booth said,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.400
'Well then by God I
will put him through.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.240
And two days later, went to
Ford's Theater and did that.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.630
This was the case that,
I'm not meaning to imply

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.920
that Booth was a big
Lincoln fan other than that.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.260 position:56%
His previous idea had been to you
know kidnap him and bring him south.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.240
But the spark for the
assassination, we are told was

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.340
in fact Lincoln's conversion
to the cause of voting rights.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.640
And this was, as it turns out
one of the great central fights.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.010
One of the great central
issues in reconstruction.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.660
And again, one where
partisanship plays a significant,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.830
positive role in expanding
the right to vote.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.230
This time it was the
Republican Party,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.990
which pushed through the 15th
amendment to the Constitution,

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.270
which prohibited discrimination.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:23.090
Which said the right to vote could
not be abridged because of race.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.310
And it's important to note, as I
said, this is a partisan issue.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.300
The identity of which party is
pushing for greater voting rights,

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.010
and which party is pushing against
voting rights, often changes.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.310
Often switches.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.610
It's not always one
party or another.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.910 position:56%
In this case it was the republicans.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.910
They did this out of a mix of
idealism and political calculus,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.530
to help win the black
vote in the border states.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:54.270
But, it's also worth noting that, I
mentioned that the phrase the right

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.240
to vote, the notion of a right to
vote was not in the Constitution.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.840
And you'll hear people
say that all the time.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.140
That it's not in the Constitution.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.440
There's no right to vote.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.730
Well it wasn't in the
original Constitution.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.470
But starting with the
15th amendment,

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.680
and actually the 14th
amendment before that.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.980
It has been added

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.850
to the Constitution 5
separate times, explicitly.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.510
There is a right to vote
in the Constitution.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.740
It's in there more than
just about any other topic.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.400
But it was added after
the original Constitution.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.730
And this was one of the
most significant times.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.890
And what many Americans for
a long time did not realize,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.360
and we now all understand is that
there was a flowering of democracy

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.030
in the south after
the 15th amendment.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.900
Voter participation rates among
African-American men reached 90%.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.500
Hundreds were elected to state
legislatures, to Congress,

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.470
to governorships, even
to the U.S. Senate.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.920
And then as we know, it was
cruelly, effectively revoked.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.950
First, by terrorism.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.990
By the Ku Klux Klan and
other paramilitary groups,

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.460
which were serving in effect

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.340
as a military wing of
the Democratic Party.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.980
This is not, we all
understand the perils

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.460
of living in an age of terrorism.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.970
This was, we are not
living in either the first,

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.640
or the greatest age of
terrorism in the United States.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.740
That was after the Civil War.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.020
The violence drove many
people away from the polls.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.160
And then cowardice, and
a cynical deal struck

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.960
out to settle the 1876
presidential election

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.490
that saw the troops
withdrawn from the south.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.460
And effectively ended
for a century or so,

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.500
the national government's effort
to protect the right to vote

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.490
for the former slaves
and their descendants.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.160
And one of things that
was interesting is

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.090
that it didn't happen right away.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.270
Voter turnout rates among black
men was actually quite high

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.540 position:56%
in the south for decades after that.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.800
It wasn't until the Jim Crow
Constitution of the 1890s,

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.180
which formally, and creatively

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.160
and systematically
disenfranchise black voters.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.620
That it was completely done.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.910
And as many of you know, that
central fact what was called

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.880
in those days the solid south.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.110
The all-white Democratic
Party south,

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.910
with very low voter
participation rates

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:16.400
of any kind was the
central political fact

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.800
in American government
for decades and decades.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.900
Well into the 20th
century, into my lifetime.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.420
What a lot of people don't
know, is that during this period

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:30.490
in the late 19th century, something
similar happened in the north,

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.960
not as bad, but something similar.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.080
The cities of the North during this
time were filled with immigrants.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.410 position:56%
They weren't immigrants from Mexico.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.490
They were from Ireland, and
Italy, and Russia, and Poland,

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.780
and other European countries.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.070
And a lot of the established
institutions,

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:54.560
a lot of the blue bloods of
the time reacted with language

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.200
that would be very
familiar to us today.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.630
And in fact, many of them
decided that this idea

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.140
of universal voting rights wasn't
such a good idea after all.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:11.750 position:56%
John Adams' great grandson said
that if you have universal suffrage,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:16.920
you will have government of
corruption and vice dominated,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.510
as he said by the Celtic
proletariat in the North,

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.510
the African proletariat
in the South,

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.720 position:56%
the Chinese proletariat in the West.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.060
So it turned out that voting rights
wasn't such a good idea after all.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:32.870
Two of my favorite
surprises during that period,

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.770
one of the great leaders of
the opposition to the right

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.980
to vote was E.L. Godkin, who
founded the "Nation Magazine"

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.970
and Walt Whitman, wrote ardently
against democracy at this point,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.110
and against the right to
vote for the same reasons.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:51.140
And what you saw throughout
the north were a series of laws

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.700
and a series of practices.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.280
Some of them quite
defensible on their face,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.690
that effectively made it much
harder for working people,

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.520
for non-English speakers,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.820
for non-educated people,
for poor people to vote.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.840 position:56%
Everything from voter
registration, which was a new thing,

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.440
imposed in many places only in
democratic and Catholic big cities

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.720
and not in republican and rural
areas out in the countryside.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.920
Even something like
the printed ballot

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.410
which means you have
to be able to read it.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.510
Or the secret ballot, which
meant that similarly that you had

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.180
to process who you were
voting for on your own.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.980
Things that we obviously think are
important parts of what it means

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.180 position:56%
to run a clean and honest democracy.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.480
Always these various things
made it harder, and harder,

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.680
and harder the other
crackdowns on the often corrupt,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.070
but highly participatory
political parties of the time meant

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:53.670
that voter turnout rates began to
really plummet in the late 1800s.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:58.080 position:56%
And then you added on top of that a
new factor, which began at that time

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.190
and which of course we're living
with now, which is the role

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.360
of big money in American politics.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.060
Which had not been a
factor until the late 1800s.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:10.520
But now with the tremendous
inequality of that Gilded Age time,

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.920
the campaign money from the robber
barons began to dominate politics

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.700
at the very moment that the
vote was being pushed back.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.440
So in many ways, American democracy
slid backwards in the late 1800s.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.680
And it's an important lesson.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.330
Because we think of the
beginning, where we were,

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.920 position:56%
had a kernel of the democratic idea,

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.880
but that we've expanded
it over time.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.640
And that's true and it's
true as Dr. King said talking

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.310
about voting rights that the
moral arc of the universe is long,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.050
but it bends toward justice.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.070
But it sometimes goes backwards.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.950 position:56%
Then what happened after that period

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.380
in the late 19th century is
something else that also happens

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.220
with some recurring frequency,
which is there was a response.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.570
There was a period of
reform and renewal.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.340
Very significantly in
response to what had happened.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.010
Now we know it of course,
as the Progressive Era.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.060
And when we learn about the
Progressive Era and we think

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.870
about it, it's certainly the
case that it was in a lot

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.410 position:56%
of respects very similar to our time
in terms of the public's concerns.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.430
People were unsettled
by economic change.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.810
They were unsettled by the new
degree of inequality that had come

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.870
into the American economy.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:27.290
They were unnerved by
demographic change, by immigration.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.970
They felt that the
political system was rigged.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.420 position:56%
They felt that government was not
functional, that it was not working,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.170
given the challenges of that time.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.540
And we think about the Progressive
Era as being when the beginnings

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.470
of the modern governmental
system was built,

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.420
you know food safety
regulation, or antitrust laws.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.430
And that's all true, but to
the Progressives of the time,

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:50.140
they felt that restoring and
revitalizing the institutions

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.500
of American democracy, and
expanding the vote were critical

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.100
to their efforts.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.210
They passed the first
campaign finance laws,

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.450
some of which were
affected by Citizens United.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:06.650
They passed the 17th
amendment to the Constitution,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:11.430
which to them was a central
campaign finance reform effort.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.600
That was the moment that gave
the right to vote to people

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.730
for senators, previously it
had been state legislatures

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.030
who elected senators.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.380
And they felt that the state
legislatures were corrupt

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.460
and were dominated by big special
interests and that giving that vote

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.750
to a much wider group
would change that.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.040
And by the way when you hear today,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.050
some people actually urge the
revocation of the 17th amendment.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.450
Saying that it was a power grab by
Washington imposed on the states.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.290
It's actually the other way around.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:44.460
The U.S. Senate was the
last place that wanted

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.760
to do the 17th amendment.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.430
It was actually demanded
by the states and by people

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.360
of the states at the time.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.400
And we know that they expanded
direct democracy, referenda,

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.330
and a whole host of other ways
that this vote gained more power.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:04.240 position:56%
And they took the single, in numeric
terms, the single biggest step

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.470
to expand the vote, which
is the 19th amendment,

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.570
guaranteeing the right
to vote to women.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.900
And we sort of skip
over this one often

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.490
in our thinking of
American democracy.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.880
We know it happened.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.430
But it turns out that the
fight for the vote for women,

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:25.130
for that 19th amendment, was
every bit as fiercely contested,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:29.470
as dramatic, as any voting
rights fight before or since.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.510
And there are many stories that
we learned for the first time.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:37.980 position:56%
Those of us at the Brenna Center,
we work on this stuff day and night.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.080
You know, we know and
Secretary Clinton mentioned this

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.850
in her speech the other
day that in 1848

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:48.180
at Seneca Falls was the first time
that the demand for a right to vote

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.870
for women was really put forward
by the Seneca Falls Declaration.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.500
The fact is not a whole lot
happened after that, for decades

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.710
and decades not a whole
lot happened after that.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:04.280
And it was not until 1911, when a
small group of very young women,

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.820
many of them had been in
graduate school in England,

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.570
where they participated in
the suffrage movement there.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:14.860
Came back to the United States and
in the face of kind of eye rolling

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.980
by their elders said
that they were going

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.040
to try something really audacious.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.220
There were going to actually try
to pass a constitutional amendment

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.530
to give women the right to vote.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:30.900
Just 3 months later, the day before
his inauguration as president,

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.030
Woodrow Wilson got off the
train a few blocks from here,

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:39.060
and was expecting to be
greeted by a giant throng.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.480
And there was basically
nobody there.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.770
It was the Princeton Glee
Club and that was it.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:49.520
They belted out a song, and
"The New York Times" wrote,

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.500
they made up in enthusiasm
what they lacked in numbers.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.190
They were very pro-democrat
even then.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:59.950
And finally Wilson's aide
said, where are all the people?

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.850
And the hosts said with
sort of embarrassment, well,

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:08.450 position:56%
they're actually all down
Pennsylvania Avenue where there was,

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.840
for the very first time, a
march for women's suffrage

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.810
down Pennsylvania Avenue the day
before the presidential inaugural,

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.600
5000 women marching
for the right to vote.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:24.520
At the head of the parade was a
27-year-old woman on a white horse,

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.860
named Inez Milholland,
dressed in the costume

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.400
of a Greek goddess
carrying a banner,

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.330
sort of a hallucinatory figuring.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:39.230
And we're especially fond of her,
because she was a recent graduate

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.710
of NYU School of Law, where
the Brannan Center is.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.590
And 5000 women.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:48.000
And on either side a
hundred thousand men flanking

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.680
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.180
They were there for the inaugural.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.890
Many of them were drunk.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.550
And they started spitting
and throwing things.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.620
They broke through the lines
and assaulted the women.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.990
Beat them up.

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:02.060
Sent 100 women to the hospital.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.540
They had to fight their way
down Pennsylvania Avenue

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.770
to the Treasury Department,
where the march ended.

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:09.940
And it was a very big deal.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.580
It was massively publicized.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:17.010
The publicity you know, overshadow
the inauguration in many ways.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.940
The police chief of
Washington DC had to resign.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:26.890
And public opinion swung in
support of voting rights for women.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.770
And when I learned this story,
I thought and perhaps some

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.720
of you are having the same thought.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.440
That sounds just like Selma.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:42.030
That this public publicized
attack on nonviolent protesters

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.470
for the right to vote,
revealing the injustice of it,

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.660 position:56%
the changing broader public opinion.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.550
It was 50 years before Selma.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.320
And it took 5 more years.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.770
And a pioneering use of
strategies and tactics of protest

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.990
that really began with the suffrage
movement in the United States.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:04.290
Everything from hunger strikes.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.190
They picketed the White House
for two years, straight.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.080
They ran political candidates
against Woodrow Wilson

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.500
in states where they could.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.000
A whole host of things.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.200
All this before Gandhi used a
lot of these tactics in India.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.510
Certainly before the
sit down strikes

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.800
and the American Labor
Movement in the '30s.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.330
And obviously before the
civil rights movements

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.720
of the '50s and '60s.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.230
And finally, in 1920,
won the right to vote.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.900
And the electorate, the size

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.090
of the electorate doubled
in one fell swoop.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.690
It was an extraordinary
breakthrough.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:47.360
Much of the 20th century, there was
this continued inexorable pressure,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.220
but there were a lot
of ongoing problems

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.400
that built up, and built up.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.940
And the true ultimate breakthrough,
which I won't go into much detail

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.670
about because it's something
you know the most about,

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:03.980
came with the Voting Rights Act of
1965 when for the very first time,

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.130
really, we as a country,
articulated the expectation

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.810
that every eligible citizen
would be able to vote.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.480
And it as accompanied at the time

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.080
by a constitutional
amendment ending the poll tax.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.300
By another constitutional amendment
lowering the voting age to 18.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:25.080
All I will say in terms of
the Voting Rights Act is

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:30.590
that it too was the
product of political forces

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.740
that were complex, and intense.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.350
And obviously the principle movers

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:45.270
of that voting rights act were the
ordinary people who braved violence

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.590
and even death in Selma,

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:52.010
Alabama during the great voting
rights struggle and march there.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.130
But it's also the case
that it was the product

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:58.270 position:56%
of this incredibly fascinating duel,

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:02.830 position:56%
joust between these two viscerally
talented southern political leaders.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.530
Dr. Martin Luther King
and Lyndon Johnson.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.580 position:56%
And you know this is one of the
questions that arose after the movie

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.970
"Selma" was did Johnson, you
know did he get a fair treatment

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.270
in that movie.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:18.250
And I certainly came out of the
research concluding no he did not.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:24.160 position:56%
Johnson was most of the time
strongly for and extremely important

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.630
in the fight for voting rights.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.510
But King and Johnson pushed
and pulled with each other.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.270
And so much of their
interaction was taped.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.870
And so you can hear these
incredible conversations.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:38.830
Three days before Bloody
Sunday, the Friday before,

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.320
King came to the White
House and met with Johnson.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.170
And Johnson did not tell
King, 'by the way Dr. King,

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.580
I've ordered the Justice Department
to draft the Voting Rights Act'

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.690
over the rejection of the
liberals who were there actually.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.050
'I've ordered them to draft
it and we've negotiated it

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.760
with the Republicans
in the Senate already.'

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:00.410
And King did not tell Johnson,
'by the way Mr. President,

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:05.040
turn on your TV on Sunday,
we're marching in Selma.'

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.000
And the reaction of course,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.110
to that public violence created a
spontaneous national mass movement

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.830
demanding action that enabled
Johnson, both pushed Johnson

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.280
and enabled him to then go before
the Congress a week later and give

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.550 position:56%
that great speech where he said, 'we
shall overcome' embracing the slogan

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:26.220
of the civil rights movement.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.750
And during this period, and after,

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:32.280
American democracy achieved a
formal openness, a formal equality

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.440
that it had never had before.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.050
And when I was going up, when
I was learning this stuff,

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.680
that was sort of you
put your pencils down,

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.510
that was the status quo.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.320
And that was the expectation.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.230
It was expected that these
issues were a thing of the past

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.630
and that they weren't the subject
of intense current fighting.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.590
Well, that is not how
it's turned out.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.350
The last 15 years has seen,

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:58.480
once again as we see throughout
American history, tremendous focus

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.190
on these rules of democracy.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.240
And I think a lot of
it actually started

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.640 position:56%
with the recount in Florida in 2000.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.170
Probably about 4 in the
morning that first night,

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.610
when people realized the country
was really closely divided,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:14.350
that turnout now mattered a lot.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:18.290
That you could win an election
by manipulating the system

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:22.270
or by turning your side out, or
by suppressing the other side.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:28.940
And you began to see as a
strategy, building overtime,

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.890
a drive to restrict voting rights.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:37.890
And this is where I get to
the contemporary part where,

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:43.630
I will note that as I said,
this is often a partisan fight.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.640
It's often been the Democrats who
have been the side of restricting

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.940
or expanding the right to vote.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.210
It's often been Republicans
were the most for,

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.630
for example woman's voting rights.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.610
Who have been on the
side of expanding

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:56.590
or constricting the right to vote.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.780
Right now in America today it
is the Conservative Movement,

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.640
and the Republican Party that
is pushing for these laws

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.820
to make it harder for
people to vote.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:10.820
And the argument is made that this
is necessary to stop voter fraud.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.230
As the only kind of voter fraud

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:18.040 position:56%
that these laws really address would
be in-person voter impersonation.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.830
Someone walking in and claiming
to be someone they're not.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:26.260
And every bit of research will
tell you that that is less likely

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.760
that you are more likely to be hit
by lightning in the United States,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.110
statistically than to commit
in-person voter impersonation.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:40.360
Despite this concerted
strategic effort,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.930 position:56%
not a whole lot happened until 2011.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:48.810
In 2011, a lot of state
legislatures changed hands.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:52.840
And instantly you saw laws
being passed all over the place

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.300
to make it harder to vote.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:58.550
Nineteen states passed 24 new
laws in a few months' time.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.120
They ranged from harsh and
restricted new forms of voter ID,

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.750
to cutbacks in the early
voting, but especially

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.940
on the days used by
African-Americans.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.640 position:56%
To ending election day registration,

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.270
to crackdowns on voter
registration drives.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.160
A whole host of things.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.910
The Brennan Center, we played
a bit of a role in this,

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.300
in that this was happening
in public, obviously,

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.450
this was not a secret, it
was in state legislatures,

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.570 position:56%
but the dots had not been connected.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:27.910
And a year before, in October
2011, we put out a report.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.910
We looked at all of
this stuff and concluded

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:34.620
that 5 million people might have
the right to vote restricted

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.390
or affected, or even lost.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.750
And that helped kickoff
a big national debate.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:44.420
It helped kickoff an awareness
on the part of a lot of people

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:49.020
that this was a political
strategy being carried out.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:54.270 position:56%
And so that when we and other voting
rights groups went to court in 2012,

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:58.050
the spring of 2012,
every single ones

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.520
of the worst new laws
was blocked, or bunted,

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.420
or postponed, or repealed.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.240
And it didn't matter if
it was Republican judge

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.360
or a Democratic judge, or a
state judge, or a federal judge.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.200
They understood that there was
something fundamental and sacred

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.030
in the right to vote that was
actually improperly being affected.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.870
And that was kind of where it stood

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.500
until the Supreme Court
got involved.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.300
Which is a much more divided and
much more frankly partisan court

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.020
than you find in most
other courthouses.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.030
And as you may know, in
2013, the Supreme Court

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:32.360 position:56%
in a case called Shelby County
versus Holder, struck down the heart

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.620
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.380 position:56%
which everybody acknowledged was
the most successful civil rights law

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.770
in American history.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:42.380
This was the part of the law that
required states with a history

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.410
of discrimination in voting to get
voting changes cleared in advanced

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:49.040
by the Justice Department
or a federal court.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:55.810
And this was the ruling
during the arguments,

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.070
across the street, down the block.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.350
This was the case where Justice
Scalia said in the courtroom

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:05.240
that he thought that the voting
rights act was nothing more than,

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.530
as he put it, a racial entitlement

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.730
which actually elicited
gasps in the courtroom.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.030
He didn't write the opinion.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.660
Chief Justice Roberts
wrote the opinion.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.100
And he made a point
which has some validity.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.470
He said you know,

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:25.130
voter participation rates among
African-Americans in many places,

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.360
including the South are now
higher than among white voters.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.900
His main argument in effect
was that was then, this is now.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.260 position:56%
Therefore, it's not needed any more.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.800
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote
a famous dissent in that case.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.440
She said that that's like standing
in a rainstorm holding an umbrella

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.420
and not getting wet,
and deciding therefore

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.110
that you can throw
away the umbrella.

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:50.650
So who was right?

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:55.420
Who was right as a predicted
matter of what would happen?

00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.540
Two hours after the
ruling came down,

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.710
The State of Texas
implemented its voter ID law,

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.280
and I should say I'm
actually for voter ID.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.360 position:56%
I'm not against voter ID, I think it
makes sense for people to have to be

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.130
who they say they are and it's not
crazy to ask t hem to prove it.

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:18.860
I'm against requiring forms of ID
that lots of people don't have.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.760 position:56%
Nationwide, around 11% of eligible
voters don't have a driver's license

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.020
or the other kind of
ID that's required.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.490
In Texas, two hours later
the law was implemented,

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.430
it's the harshest law
in the country.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:33.730
It's kind of notorious.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.730
It's the one where you cannot
use your University of Texas ID

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:41.350
as a government ID, but you can use
your conceal to carry gun permit.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:44.030
And the, now Stephen Colbert said,

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.330
well that's actually
very democratic.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:49.100
It's a lot easier to get a
gun than a college education.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.270
But he partisan intent
was fairly naked.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:56.450 position:56%
And at that precise moment, two
hours after the Supreme Court ruled,

00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:00.940
608,000 registered voters in
Texas lost their right to vote.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.350
Not potential, maybe
they'd vote someday.

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:05.290
Registered voters.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.300 position:56%
Disproportionately African-American.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.020
Disproportionately Latino.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:11.160
Disproportionately poor.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.760
Disproportionately either
the elderly, or the young.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:22.570 position:56%
And one of those voters was a woman
who we met named Sandy Louise Bates.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.000 position:56%
We and others went to court on this.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.860
And we met Sandy Louise Bates.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.350
And she was born in Mississippi.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.300
She remembered counting out money

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.840
for her grandmother
to pay the poll tax.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.670
She moved to Detroit and Chicago.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.090 position:56%
Sort of the classic great migration.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.820
She actually went to college.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.120
She worked.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.870
Then she retired, and she moved
to Texas, Round Rock, Texas,

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:51.940
where she lives on Social
Security and nothing else.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.310
She's been voting since
she was 21 years old.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.160
And she lost the right to vote.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.470
And we asked her, why didn't you
just get your birth certificate

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.770
from Mississippi.

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:06.070
Why didn't you go through
the process

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:08.200
and get your birth
certificate from Mississippi?

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.390
And she said well that costs
$42 and I had to put those $42

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.390
where they would be the most good.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.550
You can't eat a birth certificate.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:23.590
And she was the lead
witness in the federal trial,

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:28.260 position:56%
and with many others persuaded the
federal judge to strike down the law

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.310
as discriminatory, illegal,
violating the remaining parts

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.160
of the Voting Rights Act
and the Constitution.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:40.710
That ruling was upheld by the most
conservative federal appeals court

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.130
in the country.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.640
The Fifth Circuit.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.940
And the law's still on the books.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.240
It's still in effect.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.540
It's going to be in
effect in November.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:56.240
Because the simplified answer is
Texas is appealing very slowly.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.030
And the wheels of justice
are grinding very slowly.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:03.010
And ultimately this is not a fight
that will be won in the court

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:05.980
of law, but in the
court of public opinion.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:11.710
And so we have every reason to
expect a lot of hand to hand combat

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.810
in courtrooms all over the country.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.840
A lot of drives to make it
possible for people to vote.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.750
We think that these new laws
will affect polling places,

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.620
certainly where we've
seen already evidence

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.180
that they cause long
lines and chaos.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.710
And there's reason to be worried.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.740
But there is also, I'll say in
conclusion reason for optimism.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.130
Why would there be optimism,

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:36.290
other than temperament why
would there be optimism?

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:43.320
Just as perhaps we say in
the early 20th century,

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.790
this focus on the rules of
democracy, this recognition

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:51.210
that some people are trying to
take away others' right to vote.

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:54.210
This recognition that the system
needs to be changed if we want

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.680
to solve our problems, is creating
its own moment of pushback,

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.160
of renewal one hopes

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.340
of revitalization of
these institutions.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.870
There's actually a tremendous
ferment going on on the issues

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.460
of democracy all over the country.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.650
Plainly we see this in the
election, in both parties.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:16.660
Where weather it's Bernie Sanders
saying he's winning these primaries

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.770
because of his position on campaign
finance, or Donald Trump saying

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.660
that he's the only one
who can't be bought.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.890
Or Hillary Clinton
putting out what I regard

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:29.040
as by far the most robust set
of policy reform proposals

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.920
on this stuff, all though she
talks about it in a more muted way.

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.400
This issue is at the
center of debate again.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.060 position:56%
And you're seeing breakthroughs on
these issues all across the country.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.790
The single biggest change that
could make a big difference

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:46.460
in our voting right now, would be

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.700
to change the way we register
voters in the United States.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.510
If we move to automatic
voter registration.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:54.200
Automatic and universal
registration,

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.470
which is how every
other democracy does it.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.950
If we made it so that if
you're eligible to vote,

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:03.320
the government has the list, it's
responsible for keeping the list

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.790
and you stay on the list.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.520
It would add 50 million
people to the rolls,

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.090
permanently, would cost less.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:19.050 position:56%
And for people who are worried about
fraud, it would address the accuracy

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.360
of the list, it would
clean up the lists

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.260
and it would make it
harder to abuse.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.260
And the exciting thing
is it's starting

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.660
to happen all over the country.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:33.820
In the last year and a half,
Oregon, California, West Virginia,

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:38.600
by bipartisan vote, Vermont,
by tri-partisan vote.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.150
They've got the Democrats and
Republicans and the Socialists all

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:45.480
to vote for it, enacted automatic
voter registration for people

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.530
who interact with the DMV in those
states and they can broaden it

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:49.830
out to other agencies too.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:53.380
We had a conference a couple
weeks ago and the State

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.470
of Connecticut came and announced

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.060
that the night before they
decided they were going to do it

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.420
without even waiting
for the legislature.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.470
The Illinois legislature,
last week passed this.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:06.060
While we don't know if Governor
Rauner is going to sign it,

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.260
there are enough votes
to override a veto.

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:12.990 position:56%
We expect that if that happens, then
1 out of 5 voters will now be living

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:14.980
in states with automatic
registration.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.960 position:56%
We know from Oregon that it has
tripled the registration rates month

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.260
by month there.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.560
It would be a tremendous
breakthrough

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.440
and it's happening
all over the country.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.970
There are things like
that that are happening.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:27.710
Creative new versions of
public financing being enacted

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.630
for campaign finance.

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:33.430
Redistricting reform, such
as redistricting commissions.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.740
Being approved up by the
Supreme Court last year

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.040
and pushed in states.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.630
Whether it was Ohio where
Governor Kasich backed it,

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.980
or California where
Governor Schwarzenegger,

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.180
or Florida where it
was liberal democrats

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.580 position:56%
who pushed the redistricting reform.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.950
It's sort of both parties
[inaudible]

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:52.010
and the reform is actually
genuinely bipartisan as a result.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:53.730
There is a lot happening.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.830
So that's really the question.

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:58.180
We are on the knife's edge.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.210
We could be in a period
like the late 19th century.

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:02.510
The signs are there.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:03.920
Where our democracy
slides backwards,

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.580
where participation
recedes, where the right

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.560
to vote takes on less meaning.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.460
Or, as I hope and believe is
more likely to be the case,

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:16.260
we could be in a period, like
what followed, a time of renewal,

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.540
of activism on these issues,

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.380
that helps create a new
moment for American democracy.

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.880
Ultimately, even if this
happens it won't be over.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.420
John Adams was right there
will be no end of it.

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.650
There will never be a point
where we're not fighting

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:34.980
over what it means
to have a democracy.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.440
But the next chapter will
be written by all of us,

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.510
and those who come after, so.

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:45.050
[ Applause ]

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:46.710
I'm happy to take questions.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.010
Raf.

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:51.660
&gt;&gt; I just think that
something simple can be

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:56.910
so consequential I just think it's
a really fascinating presentation.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.210
Quick question.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:03.050
Just say a minute about Whitman and
his objection, like what we know

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.930
about that I find to
be very interesting.

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:11.470
And secondly is [inaudible] can
you you know a little bit along the

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:19.000 position:56%
subject, but can you say a little
bit about when a percentage of those

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.390
who voted [inaudible] is there
a connection between the temper

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.610
of the time, or candidates.

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:30.500
Are there some general guidelines
that you could draw form history?

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.800
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: Yes.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.100
So absolutely.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.120
So the first question was about
Walt Whitman opposing democracy

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.000
and what exactly was his rationale.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.440
And he wrote about, what he
said was the wolfish corruption

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.810
of politicians of the time.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:50.150
And that he felt that this is what
happens when you let the masses

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.470
of the time vote them in.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:55.010
And this goes, actually to the
second part of the question

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.840
which was what drove
the high participation.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.900
We all know that in the late
1800s was a period not only

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.620
of considerable public
participation,

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.160
but also public corruption.

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.140
It was the time of Tammany
Hall in New York and Boss Tween

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:14.760
and you know all the, all the
legendary characters we know about.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:21.140
And the reason that,
the question was

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.120
when was participation
at its height?

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.330
And when you look at
participation as a share,

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:30.830 position:56%
in effect of who was legally allowed
to participate, it was probably

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:33.720
in 1800s when women couldn't vote,

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.960
when African-American men
and woman couldn't vote.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.320
But among white men
it was very robust.

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.970
It was a time of much
greater party mobilization.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:47.090
And these political parties
were emphatically participatory

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:50.660
institutions, they rested
their power on millions

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:52.270
of people being involved.

00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:56.750
There was a festive aspect to it.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:03.360
A public tribalism almost
that actually had a lot to do

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.410
with why people participate.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.520
And I mentioned that
ironically, one of the things

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.470
that helps constrict this, which
I wouldn't want to reverse this,

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:19.000
but it's the secret ballot among
other things made it less likely

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.300
that people would vote.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.140
And it's a crazy thing, because
why would that be the case.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:27.220
But think about if there were a
law passed saying you could root

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:31.110
for any football team you wanted,
but you had to do it in private.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:36.030
And you couldn't tailgate
and so forth.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:38.460
People might have sports
teams for which they rooted,

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.760
but it wouldn't be the same.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.680
And in effect, we found when you
look at the level of mobilization

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.910
of the public as the strategy
in those days to win office,

00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:49.930
versus the money drenched
system later,

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:55.230 position:56%
it was much more participatory then.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:59.820
So, what we have to come up
with is a way to not replicate,

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:02.890
but to draw on that spirit now.

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:05.370
And of course there are
many ways that people engage

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:07.090
with each other including

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:10.900
through digital communities
and other things.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.200
And we even have seen in some

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.500
of the more successful political
organizing efforts in recent years,

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.820
the public nature of that.

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.720
Whether it's the mass
rallies that Trump

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.020
and Sanders have had this time,

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.160
or the canvassing operation
of the Obama Campaign.

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.310
A colleague of ours, Erick
Lou [assumed spelling],

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:32.760
has written quite a bit about
the need to bring back that sense

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.170
of public celebration
to our democracy.

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.930
Turns out it was really
quite important.

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:41.190
We don't want to replicate all
of it, but it was not only.

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:43.470
Some people said well maybe the
voter turnout rates were so high

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:45.530
because it was all
cemeteries voting.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.780
But even when you factor that out.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.550
At that time, it was said that
the signers of the Declaration

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.470
of Independence were still
voting in Pennsylvania.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:57.870
But even if you factor that out,

00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:00.550
there was actually a lot
more involvement back then.

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:01.850
Yes, sir.

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:03.290
&gt;&gt; My name is Charlie Sullivan,

00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:06.080
and I direct the Prison
Reform Organization.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.610
And of course prison voting is one

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:13.770
of the exciting things
going on today.

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:17.240
A few years back, there
were actually four states

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.560
that allowed prisons to vote.

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.530
Utah and Massachusetts
were together.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:25.750
Today we have Maine and Vermont.

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:30.900
They did away with those
two states, the legislature,

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.300 position:56%
whatever the governors who led this.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.470
And to me it was in violation

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:38.200
of another issue which
is very exciting.

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:44.190
And we actually, the United States
actually ratified the covenant

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:47.140
on civil and political rights,

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.390
which says that voting
universal suffrage, the same.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:56.170
That was actually ratified before
the decision by those two states.

00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:00.740
It seems to me that, I
realized that is not supposed

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.900
to be implemented to
a certain extent.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:06.610
But it is the law of
this country and to me

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:08.860
that should have been
challenged by someone.

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:11.630
Maybe if the Brennan
Center had been in existence

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:16.340
or whatever had challenged it maybe
those two states would not be able

00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.970
to deny voting rights to prisoners.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:20.530
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN:
So the question is

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.600
about voting rights for prisoners.

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.170
For people in prison.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.570
And for example, international
human rights conventions

00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:32.450
and the possible challenge to that
practice that those could present.

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:35.200
&gt;&gt; Right and if there
had been ratified

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:39.490
by the United States,
which it was ratified.

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:43.540
It was actually before
those two states decided,

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:44.840
but no one challenged it.

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.120
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: Well, you know
I think that it's pretty unlikely

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:53.640
that courts would strike down
a practice in the United States

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.790
for an international
convention of that kind.

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:58.190
That's always on of
the controversies

00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:59.490
with these conventions.

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:00.890
But it's also important to note,

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.920
the Branson Center actually
has brought these cases.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.650
Felony disenfranchisement
has long roots.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:12.910
And actually is it explicitly
authorized in the 14th amendment

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:18.310
to the Constitution where it says
states cannot restrict the right

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:22.310
to vote, except for somebody who's
committed a felony or rebellion.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:26.000
So there is a long
constitutional provenance

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.230
to felony disenfranchisement.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:35.700
However, the way the system
exists is unquestionably unfair,

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.050
far harsher than other
countries have it,

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:40.860
and with a very significant
racial impact.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:43.100
A lot of these laws
are actually passed

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.960
or created the way they were
created during the Jim Crow Era.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.290 position:56%
And one of the positive developments
this happened, it's not so much

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:53.620
about voting by people in prison.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:57.770
But what about the millions and
millions of our fellow Americans

01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:00.720
who have been in prison,
or who have been part

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.250
of the criminal justice system.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.270 position:56%
People with past felony convictions.

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:08.340
And that's something where
there is a very encouraging

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:13.120
and cross ideological and
often bipartisan movement

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.060
to change our felony voting rules.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:21.170
It's interest, it's something of
a byproduct of the coming together

01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:24.760
of understanding around mass
incarceration in the United States.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.920
As you know, both left and
right are quite active right now

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:36.300 position:56%
in understanding as has been
frequently explained that we have 5%

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:42.030
of the world's population, and 25%
of the world's prison population.

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:46.150
And that is not necessary to
keep the cities and streets safe.

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:49.660 position:56%
And that there's a tremendous
racial, and social and economic cost

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.240
to having a system like that.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.400
There's also a cost
to our democracy.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.870 position:56%
And so over the last 10 or 15 years,

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:57.650
even though there have been
all these partisan fights

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.360
on voting going on over here,
there's been a wonderful movement

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.880
to end felony disenfranchisement
or make it easier for people

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.190
with past felony convictions,
people who are in the community,

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:11.120
they've served their
sentence, they're paying taxes,

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.210
they're doing the right
thing, to reintegrate

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:15.140
in the community and vote.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.530
And there's been a lot of legal
changes all over the place.

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.420
We work with Chuck Colson
and Prison Ministries.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.720
With Jack Kemp before
they both passed away,

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.740
major conservative and
evangelical leaders.

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.390
The Christian Conservative
Movement is very involved.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:33.120
And as you know here
in Washington DC,

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.980
there's been quite a
bit of movement here.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.440
In Maryland last year, the
legislature passed a law

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.250
that restored the right
to vote to 40,000 people

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.980
with past felony convictions.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:48.280
The governor vetoed it,
but it was overridden.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.890
And as you know, Governor McAuliffe
a few weeks ago issued an executive

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:57.010
action that has the
consequences of giving

01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:02.530
up to 200,000 people the right
to restore their right to vote.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.830
It's important to know we
believe what he did was legal

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.130
and constitutional.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.430
He urged him to do it.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.970
I think it will be upheld by
the courts, if it's challenged.

01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:12.910
It's also the case that
he and his Republican

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:14.390
and Democratic predecessors

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.220
as governor have been
doing this bit by bit.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.550
He was not, this was not
a bolt out of the blue.

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:21.570
He followed on the previous
governors of both parties.

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:24.200
The big state where
there's continuing to be,

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.590
there's two states
where there remains.

01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:31.050
No, so there's three states
with a lifetime ban on voting

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.110
for anybody who's convicted
of a felony.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:37.860
Even if they were 18 in a
nonviolent drug possession

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.750
or something like that.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:42.430
Iowa, Kentucky and Florida.

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:45.450
In Kentucky, Rand Paul is
one of the great champions

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:47.050
for doing something about that.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:48.820
Florida is very challenging.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:52.470
There are millions of
people affected overtime

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:57.150
and there's a constant push,
perhaps to get a ballot initiative

01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:00.610
for a Constitutional limit there,
but you need 60% of the vote

01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:03.040
to pass a ballot initiative,
so it's tough.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:07.270
But this is an area of
actually of optimism.

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:08.570
Yes?

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:11.450
&gt;&gt; Did you say that the states

01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:15.190
that started doing
universal voter registration,

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:16.490
that it's through the DMV?

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:19.550
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: That's
where they started it.

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:21.290
&gt;&gt; I mean, the government finds you

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:24.690
when you're 65 whether you
have a driver's license or not.

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:30.260
Why? I mean it's not like that's
more you know focusing on people

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.220
who have driver's licenses.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.140
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: Right,
and fewer, not only do about 1

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.190
in 10 eligible voters not have
a driver's license, but fewer

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:40.590
and fewer have a driver's license.

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:44.050
But younger people actually don't
want to get driver's licenses.

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:46.590
My three kids it's actually
been quite a challenge

01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:49.850
to get them to go do it.

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:53.990 position:56%
So, nobody wants to stop at the DMV,

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.670
but it greatly increases
the number of people.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:05:00.680
Most people do go to the DMV and
are registered through there,

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.260
and it could be done through
social welfare agencies.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.830
Selective Service.

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:08.290
All men when they turn 18, and as

01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:13.550
of two weeks ago all women will now
register for the Selective Service.

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:17.700
And there is no reason that every
18-year-old eligible citizen can't

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.000
be registered.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.300
You're exactly right.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.600
The government has us on a list.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.020
We're on plenty of lists.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.410
They use those lists for all
different kinds of purposes.

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:30.530
And it ought to be made possible
for people to vote based on that.

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:31.830
&gt;&gt; Two more questions.

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:33.130
Great questions.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.510
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: Yes, ma'am.

01:05:35.510 --> 01:08:18.190
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:19.880
Seems to me, thank
you for your question.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.380
It seems to me that there's two
broad issues that you raised.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:28.060
One is, you know first of all,
even if we had no legal barriers

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.720
to participation, many
Americans just don't participate.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:37.590
And there are a lot of reasons
for that, ranging from elections

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:41.360
that are not competitive, because
redistricting and other things

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.920
and they don't feel they
have a reason to participate,

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.960
to lack of public engagement in
a whole host of a different ways.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.510
And so the answers, some of
it is on us, as citizens.

01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:53.110
Some of it is making sure
that information is available

01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:57.540
in a wide range, not just around
elections, or on election day.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.080
In fact, the changes in technology

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.400
of how we communicate offer
some very positive potential

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.700
developments too.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:08.960
You know we talked
about campaign finance,

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.000
which was the other
part of your question.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.350
That's driven.

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:15.700
The massive increase in the
role of money in the last 30

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:20.610
or 40 years was driven mostly by
the need to buy 30 second TV ads

01:09:20.610 --> 01:09:23.950
on publicly licensed
broadcast stations.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:25.620
That was why.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.220
And as we all know.

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.790
That is a less and less
important way of communicating

01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:36.870
with the public, versus all
the other ways we communicate.

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:39.340
People who are now able
to access information

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.270
from candidates through
digital means.

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:46.950
Now that stuff's expensive too, but
it actually isn't close to being

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:54.530
as expensive as the 30 second
ad regime targeted at a sliver

01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:56.360
of swing voters which is
what we've been living

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.190
through over the last
several decades.

01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:01.490
That goes to the second part
of your question which was

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:05.760
about the new version of
public campaign finance.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.750
So the idea of public
financing has always been

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:12.630
that it's a public function
running an election in a democracy

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:15.850
and if you can in effect replace
the private money in some way

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.960
that you can give candidates
a chance

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.030
to represent a broader
swath of the public.

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:24.140
And some of the earlier
versions of public financing,

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:27.420 position:56%
including the version that was
quite successful for several decades

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:31.610 position:56%
for presidential campaigns, although
it eventually was out of date.

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:35.070
The idea was that you give a big
block of money to the candidate

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:36.620
if they qualified, and
then they were done,

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.370
they wouldn't raise it anymore.

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:42.240
The new version actually
seeks to boost participation.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.750
It doesn't try to get all the
private money out of politics.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:48.510
It doesn't pretend you can try
to get all the private money out.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.530
What it does is try
to boost the voices

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:53.520 position:56%
of small donors, of ordinary people.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.400
And the most successful
model in the country

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.420
so far is actually
used in New York City.

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.700
Small donors there get a 6
to 1 match from taxpayers.

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.870
And it hasn't changed everything,
but it's changed very much

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:11.630
who can run, who they listen to,
how they run their campaigns,

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.830
and the competitiveness
of campaigns.

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:16.940
You'll still have Michael
Bloomberg spending $100 million

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.540
at a pop, to win the mayoralty.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:23.230
But other than him, who
was kind of an outlier,

01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:26.140
it's actually been
tremendously widely used

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.160
and tremendously effective system

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.370
but I think it would make a big
difference if we could bring it

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:32.080
to Congress and the presidency.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.380
Last question.

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.680
I'll be quick.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.800
&gt;&gt; My question is actually
voting on election day.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.840
Are there, I assume there are
rules and laws about hours

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:46.880 position:56%
that polling places have to be open,
where they can be, access to people

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.180
in different communities.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.890
I know in the primary there
was a big issue in Arizona,

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.700
where I guess they did use
the number of polling places.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.980
So I'm just curious what the
state of play is around that

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.280
and are the states trying

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.830
to restrict that, or
sort of [inaudible].

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:01.420
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: You
know, yes the answer is yes.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:05.750
The question was about the
actual hours on election day,

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:09.110
are those subject to the
controversy and manipulation.

01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:10.410
And the answer is yes.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:13.390
We don't have a national
election in this country.

01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:14.990
We don't even have state elections.

01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:18.000
We have thousands of
counties running elections.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.230
We have tried as a country
when we've been good at this

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.410
to set national standards
for what the bare minimum is.

01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:28.340
That in effect was part of
what the Voting Rights Act was.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:32.910
In Maricopa County, this year,
which previously had been covered

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:36.860
by Voting Rights Act and
no longer is by section 5.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:40.310
A local official decided gee what
would happen if we closed 70%

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:43.330
of the polling places in the
heavy Hispanic Maricopa County,

01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:46.250
and not surprisingly, people had
to wait hours and hours in line.

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:50.400 position:56%
And that was not, even if it was
not malevolent, which we don't know,

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.020
it would have been stopped
by the Voting Rights Act.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.540
There ought to be a national
standard for at the very least,

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.840 position:56%
making sure there's enough voting
machines per person on election day,

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.050
and enough opportunities
for early voting.

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:06.240
There's a bipartisan commission
appointed by President Obama,

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.430
led by Ben Ginsberg, who was
Mitt Romney's chief counsel,

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.190
and Bob Bauer, who
was his chief counsel

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:16.830
that proposed national standards on
early voting, on voting machines,

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.120
and all this kind of stuff.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.410
So, really good, it's the
right set of policies.

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:24.220
There actually could
be federal legislation.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:29.760
There was a bill called the county
revote act about 10 years ago

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.020
that embodied a lot of this stuff.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.790 position:56%
And Hillary Clinton was the sponsor
and she's made clear in her campaign

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:39.020
that this something she would want
federal legislation on as well

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.390
as automatic, universal
registration.

01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:47.260
The thing to remember is right now,

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:51.280
about 1 out of 3 people
don't vote on election day.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.330
So the market, there's really
been customer service here

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:56.260
by election officials and states.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.430
It's much more convenient in
this day and age for people

01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:02.400
to vote early, or absentee,
or by mail, or whatever.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.690
Some of us are unfortunate
enough to live

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:07.190
in places that don't have those.

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:10.060
And New York is backwards
on almost every front.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:14.400
In North Carolina, the state
legislature passed a kind

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.410 position:56%
of greatest hits voter suppression
bill that had every single bad idea,

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:20.370
all in one piece of legislation.

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:23.820
And it was challenged in court,
and last year there was a trial.

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:29.670
And North Carolina's defense was
they said as bad as we are now,

01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:31.450
we're not as bad as New York.

01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:33.820
We cut back on early voting.

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.860
New York doesn't have early voting.

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.630
We ended same day registration,

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.420
New York never had it
in the first place.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:40.720
And on, and on.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.120
So there are wide variations,

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.880
but there's an inexorable consumer
demand for ways to vote other

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.370
than standing online on
election day and I'm sure

01:14:49.370 --> 01:14:51.580
that will continue to be the case.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:52.880
&gt;&gt; JOHN COLE: Michael
thank you very much.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.680
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL WALDMAN: Thank you.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.040
[ Applause ]

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.340
&gt;&gt; JOHN COLE: He's done it again.

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.010
You get a wonderful civics lesson

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:04.160
when you get a book
talk from Michael.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.460
That happened with the first book.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.760
It happened again today.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.110
I want to thank him very
much for the presentation.

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:13.300
His patience, your patience and
have a chance to speak with him

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.350
at the book signing in the back.

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:17.410
The books are for sale
at the Library

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:21.300
