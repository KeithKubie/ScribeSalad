Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and today we’re going to continue

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:05.729
our discussion of Kurt Vonnegut’s
Slaughterhouse Five.

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.520
So, Slaughterhouse Five is often called an
anti-war novel. But that raises a question:

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.380
What does it mean for a novel to be against
war?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.030
Are novels in the business of passing judgment?
Can they actually change the actual world?

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.080
Well, that’s some of what we’re going
to talk about today. So like Kurt Vonnegut,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.400
our protagonist Billy Pilgrim struggles to
make sense of what he has witnessed during

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.000
the Allied firebombing of Dresden in World
War II.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.020
And there’s a tremendous tension between
the desire to testify to that violence and

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.989
a need to repress the traumatic memories of it.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.660
Along the way we’re going to talk about free will and we’ll also probe Billy Pilgrim’s stories of alien abduction.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.000
MFTP: Mr Green, Mr Green! Alien? Probe?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.640
Boy, Me From the Past, if you think that’s
funny, you’re gonna love the show South Park.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.760
It comes out in about two years. But anyway,
we are going to get to some anatomical humor.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.340
And I’m sure it will please you.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:00.000
[Theme Music]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.119
So Vonnegut published Slaughterhouse Five
in 1969, before the term “post-traumatic

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.100
stress disorder” had entered the language.
But Billy Pilgrim clearly exhibits symptoms

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.560
of this condition. I mean, first off, his experiences
during the war were definitely traumatic:

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.380
I mean, he gets lost behind enemy lines during
the Battle of the Bulge. He is taken prisoner

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.590
by the Germans. He sees a fellow soldier die
from gangrene while walking to a POW camp,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.890
so it goes. He is crammed for days into a
train with other POW’s. He survives the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.000
bombing of Dresden and observes the aftermath
of the firestorm, including, like, many charred

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.009
bodies. And then he witnesses a fellow POW
being executed for stealing a teapot, so it

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.670
goes.
So no wonder Pilgrim experiences flashbacks

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.670
to the war as if these incidents were happening
in the present. It’s not surprising that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.700
he suffers from hallucinations either. But what’s
the deal with the toilet-plunger-shaped aliens?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.640
So here’s an English-y way of looking at it:

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.320
Billy Pilgrim has a lot of blocked up
stuff, right? Let’s call it excrement. Toilet

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.990
plungers are in the business of unblocking
drains, right? So in other words, fantasies

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.210
involving the Tralfamadorian aliens help Pilgrim
work out the shame and horror of his war experience.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.660
I mean, look, the Germans made Pilgrim strip
when he arrives at their camp, right? So do

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.250
the Tralfamadorians. The Germans refuse to
answer why they beat one prisoner and not

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.940
another. The Tralfamadorians refuse to answer
why they’ve kidnapped Pilgrim. The Germans

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.020
confine Pilgrim to a slaughterhouse. The Tralfamadorians confine him to a zoo.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.940
So obviously there are parallels between Pilgrim’s
past and his fantasy life.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.280
But in his fantasy world, Pilgrim can rewrite
these painful events, right? Like, for example,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.510
Pilgrim felt emasculated when he was a prisoner
of war. He was stripped, forced to don a woman’s

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.890
coat, and ridiculed. But in Pilgrim’s fantasy
of alien captivity, he discovers that he can

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.440
“enjoy his body for the first time.”
And he claims that the Tralfamadorians consider

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.080
him “a splendid specimen” (if only because
they “had no way of knowing” otherwise).

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.640
And he describes himself, famously, as possessing,
and here I am quoting, “a tremendous wang.”

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.040
He’s desired by a 20-year-old porn star,
he’s incredibly virile, he’s able to sire

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.360
a child almost immediately. I mean, how is
that for revisionism?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.560
It’s the greatest POW experience of all
time!

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.340
Now some would say this revisionism is a symptom
of madness, but I would argue that it could

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.620
also be seen as a necessary step in the journey
toward recovery.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.110
And then there are the deeper, more philosophical
aspects of Pilgrim’s fantasy — particularly

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.270
the Tralfamadorian concept of time and space.
Tralfamadorians view past, present, and future

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.480
events all at once. Like one alien explains
that these moments exist simultaneously and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.610
can be viewed much as humans “might see
a stretch of the Rocky Mountains.” And since

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.130
an individual can’t change past, present,
or future events, the Tralfamadorian vision

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.670
of time and space denies the possibility of
free will, right?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.020
Many classical Greek plays support the idea
that individuals are governed by their fate.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.750
Like you’ll remember our old friend Oedipus,
told by the oracle that he would kill his

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.510
father and sleep with his mother, despite
his best efforts - he does. And it’s still gross.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.170
So why are we talking about free will in the context of reading Slaughterhouse Five? Well, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.620
For one thing, the concept of free will is
related to the concept of moral responsibility.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.180
Like in the broadest terms: if one doesn’t
have free will, one can’t be responsible

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.650
for one’s behavior. I mean, no matter how
heinous the crime that you might commit, you

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.820
can be morally absolved because you had no
choice.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.850
In Slaughterhouse Five, Pilgrim makes some
problematic life decisions. I mean, his choice

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.350
of a marriage partner, for one, is not particularly
inspired: “Billy didn’t want to marry

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.130
ugly Valencia. She was one of the symptoms
of his disease. He knew he was going crazy,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.530
when he heard himself proposing marriage to
her…”

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.750
Yet, his life choices aren’t particularly
immoral. I mean he served as a chaplain’s

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.590
assistant in the war (a role in which he is
“powerless to harm the enemy or help his

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.900
friends”). He works as an optometrist (a
job in which he helps other people see better).

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.210
He supports his family (a role in which he
is a provider). So why would Pilgrim want

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.250
to be absolved of moral responsibility?
Well it’s obviously because Billy feels

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.400
guilt: Guilt for surviving the Dresden bombings.
Guilt for being on the same side as the bombers.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.340
Guilt for becoming “well-to-do” after
the war. In adopting a worldview that denies

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.600
free will, Billy can’t blame himself for
surviving, or for being complicit in mass

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.850
murder, or for benefiting financially at the
war’s end.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.910
But we also see this conversation about the
relationship between free will and moral responsibility

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.470
reflected in the structure of Vonnegut’s
novel.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.070
Vonnegut framed Slaughterhouse Five with two
chapters that at least seem to be narrated

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.020
in his own voice. And at times he even includes
himself as a character in the main action.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.960
(For example, the author appears among the
prisoners of war, and again at the Dresden

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.090
corpse mines.) And these appearances help
ground the narrative in a form of reality

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.400
that Billy Pilgrim can’t see, our reality.
But Vonnegut mainly presents scenes from Pilgrim’s

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.840
perspective and as such, the narrative conflates
historical events with fiction and that fiction

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.460
is conflating historical events with fantasies
of alien abduction.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.600
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So since Vonnegut also presents these events

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.230
in the order that Pilgrim experiences them,
the narrative jumps back and forth in time

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.380
and space.
And that means that in certain ways, Slaughterhouse

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.770
Five is kind of a work of “Tralfamadorian”
fiction, right? Pilgrim quotes an alien as

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.290
defining Tralfamadorian fiction as follows:

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.740
“…each clump of symbols is a brief, urgent
message—describing a situation, a scene.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.120
We Tralfamadorians read them all at once,
not one after the other. There isn’t any

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.520
particular relationship between all the messages,
except that the author has chosen them carefully,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.800
so that, when seen all at once, they produce
an image of life that is beautiful and surprising

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.310
and deep. There is no beginning, no middle,
no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes,

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.310
no effects. What we love in our books are
the depths of many marvelous moments seen

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.540
all at one time.”
Obviously back in 1969, Vonnegut had never

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.889
had the experience of scrolling through a
Twitter feed, but I can’t help but notice

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:47.760
the similarity between his fantasy of Tralfamadorian
literature and our reality of the feed-based

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.730
reading experience.
Slaughterhouse Five - oh, it’s time for

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.780
the open letter!
Oh, it’s my Twitter!

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.800
Dear Twitter, you really are all things at
once, but I have to say, you’re kind of

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.680
the worst possible version of Tralfamadorian
literature.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.210
Like I follow Walt Whitman on Twitter, and
yes, I am aware that he’s deceased, and

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.740
so sometimes my Twitter feed will literally
be, “I contain multitudes,” then followed

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.940
by, “Don’t miss the new season of Rich
Kids of Beverly Hills!” I made that show

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.330
up, isn’t that a hilarious idea for a show?
Oh my god, are you kidding me? That’s real?

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.620
So I love the idea of your asynchronicity
and I love how you unmoor me from time, but

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.680
I’m not sure that you present an image of
life that’s beautiful and surprising and

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.139
deep so much as you present distraction. Best
wishes, John Green.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.520
Anyway, Slaughterhouse Five is obviously like
Tralfamadorian literature because: 1) it contains

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.449
a series of brief, urgent messages; 2) its
scenes are presented out of order (creating

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.370
the effect that they take place “all at
once’); and 3) Vonnegut has obviously chosen

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.160
each scene carefully.
And yet, it’s not a work of alien fiction.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.300
It’s a deeply human book that does contain
a beginning and a middle and an end, and it

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.620
does depict causes and effects; and it does
create suspense, just not in the usual way.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.240
Billy Pilgrim longs to believe that he can
access past moments though time travel. And

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.479
although that might seem misguided, it’s
actually a deeply human response to loss.

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:08.150
I mean, I think we’ve all felt that way.
Who isn’t familiar with wanting to go back

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.180
to a time of innocence? In its way,
Slaughterhouse Five is an anti-bildungsroman,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.380
it’s a novel about someone who wants to
go back to a world before their education.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.540
Because Billy Pilgrim’s education has taught
him, as the Romans put it, that “man is

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.389
a wolf to man.”
One of the most famous aspects of Slaughterhouse

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:27.880
Five is that Vonnegut repeats the Tralfamadorian
mantra “so it goes” each time he mentions

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.810
a death in the novel. It’s a brutal and
radically unsentimental way of grappling with

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.319
death, and therein lies its power.
I mean, how are we supposed to respond to

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:39.979
Billy Pilgrim’s mind being destroyed by
wartime trauma; how is he supposed to respond

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:42.469
to it? So it goes.
But I think it’s clear in Slaughterhouse

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:46.680
Five that Vonnegut doesn’t want readers
just to accept traumatic events enabled by

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.939
weapons of mass destruction as a matter of
course, as part of human life.

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:54.579
The novel is so intentionally unadorned and
unsentimental that he’s aiming to shock

00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:58.220
us out of our passive perspective.
But I think Slaughterhouse Five is “Tralfamadorian”

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.369
literature in one sense, at least. As the
alien confesses: “What we love in our books

00:09:02.369 --> 00:09:06.089
are the depths of many marvelous moments seen
all at once.”

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:08.930
The word “marvelous” is very interesting
there, because, of course, we don’t marvel

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.279
just at the wonderful things, we also marvel
at the horrible ones.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:17.300
Vonnegut’s gift was to render it all fresh
and new, both the great and the terrible,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.420
and allow us to marvel at it.
Because it’s funny and because it’s absurd

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.910
and unflinching, Vonnegut describes mass murder
and torture and ordinary death in a way that

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.339
makes it feel real.
There are two great modern human dangers.

00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:36.249
First the danger of our proclivity towards
mass violence and secondly, the danger of

00:09:36.249 --> 00:09:41.350
us averting our gaze from it. We all know
that humans have the ability to distract ourselves

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.769
and in doing so, to tacitly accept the intolerable.
I mean frankly, we’re all doing that every

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:50.869
day, and those dangers are the depths that
Vonnegut seeks to expose.

00:09:50.869 --> 00:09:55.269
And in that sense at least, I truly believe
that a novel can be against war. Thanks for
