00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.910
PROFESSOR: Hi, here we are in
week four, can you believe it?

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.460
We're going to be
taking a quick look

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.500
at using your mobile devices
in your camera phones.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.090
And we're also going to
take a very superficial look

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.170
at making videos.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.180
Superficial in the sense
that we're not going

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.520
to teach you step-by-step.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.850
The idea is for you to
use what you've already

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.820
learned, which is an
extraordinary amount,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.270
in terms of making
your still pictures

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.690
and applying it
to making videos.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.270
And we'll show you by example
of some very, very interesting

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.960
videos that people have made
of science and engineering.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.120
I'm going to take a
look at my notes here.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.080
So we'll take a quick look back.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.700
Natasha has some comments and
takes that she saw in the week

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.240
about light.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.820
Let me just quickly
tell you who Natasha is.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.510
Natasha is the one
responsible for creating

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.390
the videos in terms
of fabricating them,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.190
all of these tutorials.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.960
The way we worked
was the following.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.430
I just did not want to make
talking head tutorials.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.960
It's not my style.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.430
And this is, of course,
all about pictures.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.910
So the idea was for me to
collect 20 years of images,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.010
and some recent
ones, too, of course.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.170
And then when it was
created storyboards.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.450
Which then Natasha
collected the images

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.730
I gave her and overlaid the
voice overs that I made.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.530
And we went back and forth
and we edited this and that.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.140
And then she added
some of her magic.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.180
And that's how we got
the videos that we

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.450
got, which I think work, I
hope you think they're working.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.040
I think that we're
getting comments

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.950
from you that you're
enjoying the videos, which

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.120
is part of this.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.520
It's not only learning,
but enjoying the stuff.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.740
Because otherwise why bother.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.200
So if you remember a while ago
I said, please read your manual.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.500
And your manual will
talk about white balance.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560
Some of you are not balancing
your light properly,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.890
in that we saw this
more in this past week.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.190
It's very simple.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.010
It's just a means of telling
the camera what temperature

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.580
to adjust the images for.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.790
An you'll find a better.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.080
We'd reality rather
you do that here

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.360
while you make the pictures and
not do it in post-production.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.960
It's something that you
might want to look at.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.510
OK.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.670
So that's it.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.890
Here we go in week four.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.650
Have fun.
