00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.070
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.203
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:13.771
(solemn music)

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.680
- Now, yesterday you heard

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.660
a detailed introduction
about her background

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.450
and all the awards she's won

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.630
so there's no reason for me to reiterate

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.470
how she just won the
$100,000 Gairdner Award

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.030
or the Selman Waksman Award

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.600
from the National Academy of Science

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.170
or that she's been the
first female director

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.760
of the Beckman Center and she's done

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.320
all these amazing things.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.400
So the first thing that
came to mind is why me?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.280
Why do I get to introduce Lucy Shapiro?

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.060
So I thought about it and I thought well,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.360
we both went to Brooklyn College,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.120
we both escaped from New York

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.990
and we were both work on
developmental bacteria

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.100
that don't cause any disease

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.603
and most people haven't heard of,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.773
until recently.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.780
So why caulobacter?

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.180
Well, caulobacter has
an interesting history.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.850
It really came into
prominence when Roger Stanier

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.870
and Jeanne Poindexter isolated it,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.410
they were looking for
organisms that would grow

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.540
in the distilled water of
the Life Science Building

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.880
and sure enough, they isolated
caulobacter crescentus

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.880
because it grows in very
dilute environments.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.360
Of course, a little bit while later,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.130
Mike Doudoroff told me they
found a dead rat in it still,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.423
so possibly there was some
organic material there as well.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.440
Anyway, after Stanier

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.280
and Jeanne Poindexter worked out

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.000
the life cycle of this
very interesting organism

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.800
and realized that it has two forms;

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.360
it forms a stem cell

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.690
like a stalk cell

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.320
that puts out Swarmer cells

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.730
and this was a very interesting model

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.083
for studying cell differentiation.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.160
Dr. Shapiro realized the
tremendous power of this system

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.190
and she almost single-handedly developed

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.190
this field from just kind of
a gee whiz type phenomenology

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.610
of bacteriology into a
detailed model system

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.800
for studying the cell cycle.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.310
So she's accomplished quite a bit.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.600
She has over 250 papers, she's mentored

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.380
over 31 PhD students, 50 postdocs

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.550
and her recent graduates
have established themselves

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.870
in major universities and
actually, throughout the world.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.500
So it's really a credit to her

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.657
that she's accomplished all this.

00:03:24.657 --> 00:03:29.310
And so I'm very pleased to
introduce Professor Lucy Shapiro

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.411
to give her lecture on caulobacter.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.411
(audience applause)

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.440
- Thank you, it's a
pleasure being here today.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.010
I might add to the introduction
that David Zusman gave you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.220
about where caulobacter grows.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.720
When I was at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.230
in The Bronx, we isolated one
of the first bacteriophages

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.040
that infects caulobacter
in The Bronx tap water

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.260
and it's the largest phage ever isolated.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.510
So whether there are dead
rats in the drinking water

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.820
in The Bronx or not, I don't know

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.700
but certainly caulobacter
can be found everywhere

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.283
and it is probably one of the
most ubiquitous bugs on earth.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.520
We have used this bug

00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:27.652
as a way of carrying out, in
essence, systems engineering

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.263
on a living entity.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.120
What I show here is the
cell cycle of caulobacter

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.490
and why we're interested in it.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.410
As you can see, every
division is asymmetric.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.910
You start off with a cell that can swim,

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.050
it's called a swarmer cell,
it has a flagellum at one pole

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.870
and there are pili at this pole as well.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.123
This is the chromosome.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.140
This cell is not able to
initiate DNA replication

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.100
and it's present and swims
around for about a third

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.800
of the cell cycle, independent
of the generation time

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.450
and independent of the nutrients.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.490
Once this swarmer cell
differentiates into a stalk cell

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.430
by ejecting the flagellum and
building a stalk in this place

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.280
and as Jeff Skurka showed,
sucking these pili back in,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.380
then you can initiate
DNA replication shown

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.730
by this theta structure.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.960
Replication goes on during this S phase.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.210
Cell division happens
here but you start making

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.140
the components of the cell
division machine quite early.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.450
Flagella biogenesis occurs in a hierarchy

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.860
of about 42 genes and then is assembled

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.563
at one side of the cell and nowhere else.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.680
Once the chromosome has
completed its replication

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.420
then an enzyme that methylates
the DNA gets turned on

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.090
and this is important because
I'm gonna come back to this.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.290
So when the cell divides,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.900
you have two fully methylated chromosomes

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.150
and when you initiate replication

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.530
and the replication fork
travels around the chromosome,

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.700
you get two copies that are hemimethylated

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.470
and then you don't, that would be here,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.990
this is a fully methylated,
you initiate replication

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.293
and you get two copies
that are hemimethylated.

00:06:19.184 --> 00:06:21.750
The reason why it happens just here

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.040
is that the cell, as I'll show
you at the end of this talk,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.770
uses the methylation
state of the chromosome

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.600
to integrate multiple regulatory events.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.100
And pili biogenesis, of course,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.320
happens between here and
here in the cell cycle.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.460
Each one of these boxes represents

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.780
what I call a functional module.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.160
In other words, there are multiple genes

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.250
within each one of these boxes

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.680
that have to carry out their function.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.850
Each module gets turned
on at a specific time

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.940
in the cell cycle and there
are four master regulators

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.760
that control 200 cell
cycle regulated genes.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.270
Each group within this 200,
sits in one of these boxes.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.960
So now turning to understand
how this might be,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.130
not how you might get regulators

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.500
to turn these various things on

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.490
and how many levels of
control allow you to do this

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.420
and most importantly,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.630
how are these regulatory
events coordinated?

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.190
So back in the year 2000,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.553
a then graduate student
in the lab, Mike Laub,

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.030
did the first cell cycle
microarray of a bacterial cell.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.300
We had just gotten the sequence from TIGR

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.550
and what he did was
synchronize the cell cycle

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.820
which is probably one of the
best things about caulobacter,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.420
you can actually synchronize these cells

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.160
and starting with a swarmer
cell every 15 minutes,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.670
he took a sample, got the
RNA and then did microarrays

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.620
and in yellow, it shows
genes that are turned on,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.700
blue, genes that are turned off

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.200
and there is a hardwired
pattern during the cell cycle

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.570
of a consistent set of genes
that are turn on and off

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.770
as you move through the cell cycle.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.800
An example is very the
DnaA gene which is required

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.540
for the initiation of DNA replication.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.260
And that's turned on in
preparation for turning on

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.960
the replication of the chromosome.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.470
Another example is the
hierarchy of flagellar genes

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.050
that are turned on just when needed

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.600
to build the flagellum at this pole.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.650
And here is that DNA methyltransferase

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.750
that's turned on at the
end of the cell cycle

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.530
to remethylate the chromosome.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.340
And I could fill this in
with many, many, many genes.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.980
We know almost all of them at this point

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.310
and so this is turning on a gene,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:53.310
not in response to glucose
or not in response to lactose

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.270
but rather, a hardwired
pattern of gene expression

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.820
as you move through the cell cycle.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.250
What could be involved in this?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.500
Well, bacteria and caulobacter
as well, generally use

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.900
the two-component signal
transduction paradigm.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.480
Most of the initial work
revealing how these things

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.350
have been done was done by Sydney Kustu,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.240
here at at Berkeley and the paradigm

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.900
is that there is a histidine kinase

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.280
which can have a part of
its protein sticking out

00:09:27.516 --> 00:09:29.130
into the periplasmic space

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.780
or it can be inside.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.080
Generally a dimer, and some signal,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.730
either inside or outside
causes autophosphorylation

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.120
of the histidine and then CtrA

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.670
is phosphorylated on an aspartate.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.460
In this case, this is the
global regulator in caulobacter

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.370
and here we have a
response regulator attached

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.780
to a DNA binding domain which
does not have to be the case.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.480
In this case, it is true and it acts as

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.273
a transcriptional regulator.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:03.460
Kim Quon, a graduate student
in the lab identified CtrA

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.270
and then Christine Jacobs, when she was

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.910
a postdoc in the lab,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.430
identified the kinase that's involved

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.540
in this phosphorylation reaction.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.250
There has since been shown to
be another protein in between

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.800
but I'm not gonna go into that.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.420
This CtrA protein was very surprising.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.190
It was found, initially,

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.330
because it controlled flagella biogenesis

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.500
but it was very perplexing
because it was also

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.920
an essential gene and the flagellum

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.300
is not essential for viability.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.670
And then it turned out, I had
different people in the lab,

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.950
working on different functional modules

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.370
and to our astonishment,
we found that this one,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.640
regulatory protein controlled the onset

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.620
of flagella biogenesis, pili biogenesis,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.380
turned on the the DNA
methyltransferase gene,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.430
turned on the genes for
the chemotaxis machinery

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.520
as well as cell division genes.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.710
One curious thing about
this response regulator,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.260
is it's not only a transcription factor

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.460
but when it's present in the cell,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.430
it sits on the origin of
replication and silences it.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.510
So there is a protein that
both is a transcription factor

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.380
and a silencer of the
initiation of DNA replication.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.570
This protein does not
control stalk biogenesis,

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.070
DNA replication or chromosome segregation

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.110
but as you can see here,
where I've colored in

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.670
where CtrA is, CtrA is in a swarmer cell,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.060
where it's sitting on
the origin of replication

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.840
and silencing it, then, in order
to turn on DNA replication,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.690
this thing has to be
cleared out of the cell.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.160
Then you stop the proteolysis of CtrA,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.910
it again now accumulates,
turns on functional things

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.610
and then there is a closure
of the inner membrane

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.970
of this pre-divisional cell
creating two compartments.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.650
This compartment has the CtrA in it

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.890
and you're silencing the origin.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.870
This compartment, again,
clear CtrA out of the cell

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:16.870
by proteolysis so you can
initiate DNA replication;

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.840
therefore, each progeny of
a division is asymmetric,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.830
you get two different cells.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.900
Not only do they look
different because this guy

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.360
can swim away and this guy's got a stalk

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.990
but this one cannot
initiate DNA replication

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.600
and this one always does.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.513
Clearly, that's this one.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.140
So now, I showed that CtrA is present,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.840
gets cleared away, it comes back,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.950
gets cleared away here asymmetrically.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.300
What about this kinase?

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.440
Here's the intermediary protein.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.700
What about this kinase?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.283
And this was an experiment
that Christine did.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.610
She first showed

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.210
that this kinase was present
throughout the cell cycle

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.300
by Western blots but it seemed

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.420
to be only functioning sometimes

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.840
so what she did was label
it with a GFP derivative

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.390
and made the surprising observation

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.720
that this protein is localized
to the pole of the cell

00:13:12.597 --> 00:13:15.370
and Antonio Iniesta and Nathan Hilson

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.430
have recently shown that if
this thing isn't localized

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.200
to the pole of the cell, it can't function

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.490
and it is at these times in the cell cycle

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.230
that it is involved in phosphoryl transfer

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.250
to the CtrA protein and activating it.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.560
So again, by the time
Christine showed this,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.950
Janine Matic in the lab had already shown

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.410
that the chemoreceptors are
localized at the cell pole

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.600
so we knew that polar
localization of proteins,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.090
in fact, happened so now we
were faced with the question,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.550
how do you go about using the
three-dimensional organization

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.900
of the cell as a regulatory phenomenon?

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.810
How do you incorporate that
into transcriptional circuitry,

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.680
into proteolysis, into the
multiple layers of control?

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.870
One of the critical events
which I'm sure you realize

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.150
at this point is getting rid of CtrA here

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.990
and it has to be absolutely specific

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.740
and it has to be controlled.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.080
So this is now another
surprising observation.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.340
The ClpXP protease, which has six subunits

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.770
of the chaperone ClpX and 14 subunits

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.370
of the protease ClpP, it's
like a little Waring blender,

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.300
CtrA binds to a factor RcdA,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.760
which then brings it

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.750
into the Waring blender and chews it up

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.110
but the surprise was that
this protease complex,

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.160
localizes to the pole of the cell.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.150
And then the CtrA and
RcdA, in other words,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.210
the substrate, comes down to the protease,

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.220
CtrA is chewed up and then surprisingly,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.570
it goes away from this
pole but then assembles

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.170
at the cell division
plane, goes away from that

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.650
and then reassembles only at this pole

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:13.060
so that you chew CtrA
up here but not here.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.270
So this is just an example,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:21.270
a cute little movie that
was made by Antonio Iniesta

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.600
and his work is really a summary

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.550
of the work of Antonio
Iniesta, Patrick McGrath

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.120
and Kathleen Ryan and as you can see,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.170
it goes to the pole and
the substrate comes in

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.400
and it's chewed up.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.400
This ClpXP protein is a single
domain response regulator

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.230
that, in fact, is required to, excuse me,

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.700
the CpdR, single domain response regulator

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.310
is the factor that is
required to bring ClpXP

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.313
to the cell pole.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.450
So now, the critical question is

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.620
how is this integrated
with the passage through

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.670
the cell cycle and the role

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.870
of the two components signal
transduction proteins?

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.470
So this CpdR protein which I
introduced to you once before

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.980
as a single domain response regulator

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.530
can exist in the phosphorylated state

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.750
or the unphosphorylated state.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.990
When it's in the unphosphorylated
state, we call it active

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.930
because it's in the unphosphorylated state

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.930
that it allows the protease
complex to go to the cell pole.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.360
What's amazing is that this kinase

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.380
that I showed you a moment ago

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:42.380
as the kinase that activates
CtrA is the same kinase

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.470
that keeps this CpdR protein
in the phosphorylated state.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.310
So in a very robust way, the same kinase

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.490
that activates CtrA
prevents its degradation

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.160
by keeping this thing in
the phosphorylated state.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.160
Now, when we have CpdR in
the unphosphorylated state,

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.940
it localizes the protease, CtrA and RcdA

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.350
then go to the protease and get degraded.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.640
Now let's put it together
with the localization

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.500
of this kinase.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.180
So here we are in the swarmer cell

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.170
and in the swarmer cell, CpdR exists

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.650
in the phosphorylated state,
therefore the protease

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.160
is not localized, then

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.440
you have the localization of the protease

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.620
and it substrates here, it's degraded

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.500
and then you get the
localization of this kinase

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.970
to this pole and it's now active.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.890
So what happens when
this kinase is active?

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.110
CpdR accumulates in the
phosphorylated state,

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.610
those were all the yellow dots

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.020
then this begins to form two

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.040
compartments with the
kinase trapped up here

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.630
and because of that triggered

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.620
by cytoplasmic compartmentalization,

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.670
you then degrade CtrA

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.960
because the protease via CpdR

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.130
is localized to that cell pole.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.570
So in fact, there is a correlation

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.490
between multiple
three-dimensional observations.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.270
Number one, you have to
localize the protease itself

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.270
to a specific place.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.430
Number two, when you
form two compartments,

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.180
you trap the protease in one
compartment and not the other

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.380
and you are trapping the kinase

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.660
that makes sure that this guy is not able

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.550
to localize the protease but this one is.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.660
So there is now a connection

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.900
between localized proteolysis

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.903
and the phosphosignaling cascade.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.030
This thing then chews up CtrA

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.650
and it can initiate DNA replication.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:04.270
So what I've shown you
is that CtrA is cycling

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.760
through the cell cycle but
we predict that there has

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.590
to be at least another
regulator that happens

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.160
when CtrA isn't around because we know

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.180
that multiple proteins are made
at all these different times

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.670
in the cell cycle.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.670
So the second regulatory
protein, GcrA shown here in blue,

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.850
well which was found by Holtzendorff

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.890
is present when the when
CtrA is not present.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.210
And CtrA, as I showed
you, controls 95 genes,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.380
that's directly controls 95 genes

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.273
by doing chip analysis.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.510
And GcrA controls the expression
of approximately 50 genes

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.380
and these 50 genes are
involved in DNA replication

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.520
and chromosome segregation.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.491
So swarmer cell has it then
it goes away by proteolysis,

00:19:57.491 --> 00:20:00.780
GcrA builds up, the early
pre-divisional cell one

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.080
is going away and the other is building up

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.080
so you have CtrA here

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.743
then you have the differential expression,

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.800
GcrA because here it can't be made,

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.390
here you clear out CtrA
and GcrA can be made

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.380
so now when the cell divides,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.680
the asymmetry is not just morphological;

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.720
this can swim, this has a stalk,

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.180
this has CtrA, this has GcrA.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.570
And these are major transcription factors

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.770
that are controlling different genes.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.730
So if we look now at a circuitry,

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.490
a regulatory genetic pathway, that CtrA,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.470
activated CtrA phosphate controls

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.250
and its phosphorylation is a complicated

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.280
phosphokinase pathway.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.720
This CtrA phosphate controls
all of these modules

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.550
as I showed you initially.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.130
Here is CtrA phosphate
sitting at five sites

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.760
on the origin of DNA
replication and silencing it.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.040
Clearly, the degratory
pathway is critical.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.560
Now, we can put on top of this

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.110
the 50 cell cycle regulated
genes that GcrA controls,

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.260
controlling multiple
genes that are involved

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.840
in replication of the
chromosome and in segregation

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.490
as well as the localization
of kinases at the cell pole.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.563
So how does GcrA and CtraA
deal with one another?

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.080
So (coughs) excuse me.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.553
It forms a regulatory cycle.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.640
When CtrA is present,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.933
it sits on the GcrA
promoter and silences it.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.840
It also acts and excuse me,
and when you get rid of CtrA

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.420
then you can turn on GcrA.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.140
When GcrA is turned on and does its thing,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:55.140
it then turns on the P1 promoter of CtrA.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.030
You make some CtrA, it's activated,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.590
it shuts off GcrA, it
shuts off its P1 promoter

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.770
and turns on the very active P2 promoter.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.550
So what we have here is
an oscillating circuit

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.050
that has GcrA and CtrA doing their things

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.253
at different times in the cell cycle.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.970
What was particularly surprising

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.920
was that this oscillation
is linked to DNA replication

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.980
and I'm gonna come back to this again

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.350
but in front of the P1 promoter
is a DNA methylation site

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.260
and the transcription of
this gene is dependent

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.793
on this being in the hemimethylated state.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.960
Now the GcrA gene, which we
know is turned off by CtrA,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.960
what turns it on and that
turns out to be DnaA,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.490
a protein that has been
known in bacterial,

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.623
almost all bacterial
cells, seemingly forever.

00:22:58.525 --> 00:23:01.550
DnaA is a protein that's
required for the initiation

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.700
of bacterial DNA replication,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.870
it does so by interacting
with the single origin

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.740
of replication, allowing it to open up

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.710
and form the replisome.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.090
Not too long ago, a couple of years ago,

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.500
both in Alan Grossman's lab
studying bacillus subtilis

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.890
and in our own lab, Allison Hottes

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.740
and Justine Collier showed that DnaA

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.120
is a transcription factor and
it's a transcription factor

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.480
for approximately 50 genes that are needed

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.040
right at that time in the cell cycle.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.340
So just like CtrA does double duty

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.630
as a repressor or silencer
of the origin of replication

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:46.510
and a transcription factor,
then DnaA does double duty

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.000
as an activator of DNA replication

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.393
and as well as a transcription factor.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.540
So now that we knew that, somehow,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.210
this cycle is hooked up

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.173
to the replication of the chromosome,

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.230
it was a puzzle, how could this be?

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.440
How could all these parts be integrated?

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.520
How does the cell know
when to do X or Y or Z?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.563
How are the modules ordered?

00:24:15.728 --> 00:24:19.060
So we then decided and that is
including Martin Thanbichler

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.590
and Patrick Viollier and Patrick McGrath,

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.900
we looked at the caulobacter cell

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.440
and it was pretty much assumed

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.430
that the bacterial chromosome
was a bowl of spaghetti,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.900
sitting inside of the cell
with no nuclear membrane

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.130
and there were indications
that the cell at least knew

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.670
where the origin was and
where the terminus was.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.820
And that's shown here; the
origin sat at this pole

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.950
of the cell where the flagellum was

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.293
and the terminus sat at the other pole.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:55.140
So what we wanted to ask
is where are the rest

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.450
of the genes in the
cell, all the other loci,

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.330
is it really just a random mess?

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.060
And so using a well-known
technique at that point,

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.840
in which you put in a whole
array of DNA binding proteins

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.310
to a specific place on the chromosome,

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.040
here we're putting in tetO sequences

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.627
and then we had a plasmid driving tetR

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.860
fused to YFP and if we
turned on that plasmid,

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.490
we were able then to attach this tag,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.270
fluorescently tagged binding protein

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.140
to a side in the chromosome

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.120
and that would light up a
specific place in the cell.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.210
We also, in all the experiments we did

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.290
with this kind of technique, we did FISH

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:48.030
so that we didn't have to
just depend on multiple pieces

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.190
of DNA stuck into the chromosome

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.270
and we confirmed it
all with FISH analysis.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:58.070
And so doing this, what we
found is that the chromosome

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.300
is really amazingly ordered.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.700
What I'm showing you here is a cartoon,

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.300
it does not mean that this is the order.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:10.300
All we do know is that
where a genetic loci exists

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.560
on the chromosome reflects
where it sits in the cell

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.920
so that loci closer to the origin

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.710
or sit down here, further
away, they move up the gradient

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.830
so that there is a specific place

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.430
and it has a radius of attachment
but it's within an area

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.070
for individual loci in the cell.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.560
So here we have the origin of replication.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.320
When you get rid of CtrA

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.880
and you're no longer silencing the origin

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.230
then you build the replisome
and that's shown here in green,

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.800
on this region then what you find

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.560
is that as soon as you
initiate DNA replication,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.560
the newly duplicated origin

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.550
can be seen to harpoon across the cell

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.123
and establish itself at the other pole.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.970
And here you have the light
blue new chromosome going up

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.840
and the old stuff getting smaller

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.750
and you keep moving it apart.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.880
And what I show down
here is actually a movie

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.550
of the tagged origin of replication

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.410
which is shown here being duplicated

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.100
and harpooning across the cell.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.680
To us, this was very exciting.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.440
It is not as showy as
looking at eukaryotic cells

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.860
but this rather blew my
mind when it happened,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.440
we can actually see a
locus move across the cell

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.240
and calculate its speed of movement.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.010
Now a graduate student
in the lab, Esteban Tore

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.950
has recently shown that
the thing that first moves

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.920
across the cell is not the
caulobacter origin of replication

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.660
but a sequence not far away from it,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.640
called the parS sequence

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.060
and in a very elegant
series of experiments,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:04.060
Esteban showed that it
is this parS sequence

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.120
that sits away from the
origin of replication

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.823
that moves first across
the cell and that parS

00:28:12.823 --> 00:28:16.010
is the centromeric
sequence that is the site

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.030
of force generation that
drives chromosome segregation

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.850
and by making a series of inversions,

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.870
he was able to show that
no matter where you put

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.150
this parS sequence,
that's what moved first

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.270
and you had to replicate through it

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.720
in order to get the movement.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.870
So now what I show here is a overview

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.720
of what I've been telling you.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.940
Here now is the swarmer cell.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.300
Now, I'm showing this little red dot

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.010
or origin as parS, terminus is here,

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.880
you clear CtrA out of the
cell, the replisome forms.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.920
What I've done here is
indicated a genetic locus,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.410
some generic genetic locus in gold

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.510
and what happens here is

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.563
you have parA driven segregation of parS.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.530
ParA is an ATPase that
assembles into a polymer

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:17.150
and the newly replicated parS sequence

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.180
then moves across the entire cell

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.350
and when it reaches the other pole,

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:27.350
it's anchored at that pole
by a polymeric network

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:31.290
of a protein called popC,
this was found in our lab

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.440
by a Grant Bowman, at the same time

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.550
as we published this in
cell, Christine Jacobs Wagner

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.960
also found popC in her lab.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.690
So the work is definitely corroborated,

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.790
two labs have it and
it's an amazing protein

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.280
because it's a 19 kilodalton protein

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.290
that forms a very large
polymeric complex at that pole

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.640
and is essential for grabbing
this centromeric sequence

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.740
and holding it there at that pole.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.880
If you don't have popC,
the chromosome keeps trying

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.680
to go to that pole but it goes there

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.970
and draws back, goes there and draws back.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.940
You have to grab it and keep it there

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.920
but now coming back to the duplication

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.350
of the chromosome, once the replisome

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:21.260
moves through this locus, we
find that it is segregated

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:26.260
to the mirror image position
of the incipient daughter cell.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.440
So that in fact, we have
segregation occurring

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.560
while you're replicating the chromosome

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.220
and this region of the chromosome knows

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.500
how to go to the right place then

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.770
you finish DNA replication,
the replisome disassembles

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.000
and you get two cells

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.100
that are mirror images of one another.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.130
This cell now cannot initiate replication.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.070
This cell, you get rid of CtrA

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.770
so you can build the
replisome and start again.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.700
So now that we know

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.070
that there are very logical progression

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.650
of DNA replication occurring,

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.410
how can we integrate
multiple cell cycle events

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.200
with this replication of the chromosome?

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.990
So I'm gonna tell you two short stories;

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.990
one is the spatial regulation
of division site placement

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.600
which is dependent on the positioning

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.960
of that centromeric sequencer.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.440
And the other is DNA methylation control

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.290
of the actual cell cycle regulators.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.573
So first, the division site placement.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.710
This, again, is the work
of Martin Thanbichler

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.750
and Martin identified
a protein called MipZ

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.940
which is an ATPase, a ParA like ATPase

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:57.940
that's absolutely essential
for placing the FtsZ gene

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.780
in the middle of this FtsZ ring

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.230
in the middle of the cell.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.240
Sure, we do know that when
cell division happens,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.950
you have asymmetry in
a smaller swarmer cell

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.697
and a larger stalk cell

00:32:09.697 --> 00:32:12.150
but that's because once the division ring

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:15.410
is laid down mid-cell,
this portion of the cell

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.240
does not grow as fast as
that portion of the cell.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.030
Furthermore, we know
that this shown in blue

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:28.030
is the origin centromere
region and MipZ colocalizes

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.560
with that origin region.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.187
So now here is, which I
should change this to ParS

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.660
at this point or the centromere

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.660
and that is decorated by the ParB factor

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.840
and ParB then binds directly to MipZ,

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.550
this was shown by
surface plasmon resonance

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:55.910
but it doesn't just have
a very orderly attachment.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.110
It seems to form some sort
of gradient in the cell

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.430
so if we look at MipZ EYFP,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:07.470
you see it at its highest
concentration at the pole

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.900
but then it becomes less
and less as you move

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.580
towards the center whereas EGFP ParB

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.330
is very tightly bound at the pole

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.140
and this gradient of MipZ concentration

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.510
which is highest at the origin regions

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:28.510
and lowest at mid cell, is what
in fact gives the function,

00:33:31.847 --> 00:33:35.170
gives the function to
the MipZ-ParB complex.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.920
So how does it do this?

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.100
Well, Martin showed that if
you purify the FtsZ protein,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.400
FtsZ is a tubulin that has to assemble

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.360
into these long polymers.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.183
If you add purified MipZ to purified FtsZ,

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.530
you get these short
non-functional curlicues

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.280
and then he went on and showed that MipZ,

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.490
in fact, stimulates the GTPase activity

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:08.400
of FtsZ, preventing it from assembling.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.240
So therefore, we knew that
we could put together a model

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:18.240
of this cell, in which
here's the centromere

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.300
or origin sequence,

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.600
decorated with the ParB
segregation factor,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.410
MipZ is on it.

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:28.440
At the other pole of the
cell and this is a new pole

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.800
that just resulted from a cell division.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.300
So you have a pool of the FtsZ protein

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.960
or tubulin sitting here
and as you now duplicate

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.890
this region of the chromosome,
you redecorate it immediately

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:47.880
with ParB and MipZ and as
it moves across the cell

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.040
and sees, hits the FtsZ, the FtsZ moves

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.480
to the region of lowest
concentration of MipZ

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.540
and that's where it assembles.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.930
And I can actually show you this.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:05.550
So what I'm showing you
here are two cells in red.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:10.300
I show the ParB bow to the
origin region and in green,

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.920
is the pool of FtsZ at this pole.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.890
Here's just a second cell,

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.000
we initiate DNA replication

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.810
and as it moves across the cell,

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:26.550
it hits the FtsZ and
FtsZ assembles mid-cell.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.630
And Martin has elegant movies,

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.930
where he can chase the
FtsZ around the cell

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.800
so that wherever MipZ
is, FtsZ can polymerize.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.930
So in fact, what Martin has shown,

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:44.090
that this complex
represents a novel system

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.290
that coordinates chromosome
origin segregation

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.240
with the initiation of cell division

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.500
and furthermore, it ensures
the proper localization

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.160
of the division plane to mid-cell,

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.560
the region of lowest concentration
of the MipZ inhibitor.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.010
Now, turning to the second story

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.830
that is involved closely
with the coincidence

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.210
of DNA replication and segregation,

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.920
the DNA methylation control

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.410
of the cell cycle master regulators,

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.800
we knew and I've been showing you

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.400
that this is a Western blot
of when each of these proteins

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.920
is present in the cell,
going through the cell cycle

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.603
and we knew that GcrA is turned on here.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.670
GcrA turns on CtrA.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:34.880
CtrA turns on the DNA methyltransferase

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.300
and DnaA, which starts the whole thing

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.960
because DnaA turns on GcrA, et cetera,

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:47.620
what turns on DnaA and
how do you, in fact,

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.620
make this a cycle?

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.110
So what Justine Callier
found is that it depends

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.960
on the methylation state
of the promoter region.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.900
So let me see if I can make this clear.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.850
Here is a caulobacter chromosome,

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:06.970
here is the origin of
replication, I flipped it over.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.620
Here is the terminus.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.120
This is where the DnaA gene sits.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.670
This is where the CtrA gene sets.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.710
In bacteria and in caulobacter,

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.140
replication is bi-directional

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.250
and when you begin this and now we're

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.490
in the swarmer cell, cell is just divided.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.430
The chromosome is in the
fully methylated state,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.670
a specific sequence, GANTCC is methylated

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.433
on Watson and Crick, one way to put that.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.850
There is a DNA methylation
site within the DnaA promoter

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.760
and this is in a fully methylated state

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.603
so the DnaA gene is transcribed.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.230
However, CtrA is also in
a fully methylated state

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.970
and it's not transcribed because this guy

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:57.420
can only be transcribed from
a hemimethylated promoter.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.280
Now as the replication
initiates and moves through,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.000
first the DnaA gene, you
get two copies of the gene

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.180
that are now both in the
hemimethylated state.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.470
Just remember I told
you, you don't turn on

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.490
that DNA methylating enzyme
till the end of the cell cycle.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:19.223
So this is now hemimethylated,

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.770
you turn off the transcription of DnaA,

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:25.730
the replication fork on this side

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:30.730
hasn't yet hit CtrA so this
guy is not transcribed either.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.240
However, once the replication fork travels

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.000
through the CtrA gene, creating
two hemimethylated copies,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.990
then you turn on the transcription

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.110
of that P1 promoter of CtrA.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:50.110
Therefore, the passage of
the replication fork itself

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.710
controls methylation state and thereby,

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:57.940
controlling the timing of
activation of the promoters

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.570
of these two genes.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:03.410
Now I wanna remind you that each protein

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.350
is controlled at multiple levels.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.710
It's controlled by turning
on its transcription.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.900
It's controlled by
proteolysis at the right time

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.050
of the cell cycle, it's
controlled by positioning

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.630
and it's controlled by activation.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.562
CtrA has to be activated.

00:39:21.562 --> 00:39:23.040
DnaA has to be activated

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.050
so there are multiple levels of control.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:30.120
We found that if we moved DnaA far away

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.740
from its normal site so the timing

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.890
of its transcriptional control is changed,

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:39.840
the cell is still alive
but it's severely impaired.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.110
If you make a mixed
population of a wild-type cell

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:46.230
and a cell in which this
gene is moved down here,

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.360
the cell in which this is
moved is gonna disappear

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.360
within a generation, it's gone
and the same thing is true

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.380
of moving the CtrA gene and curiously,

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.720
moving the CtraA gene,
the cells seem confused,

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.690
they're of all different sizes.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.590
And we don't really know what causes this

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:09.290
but they're not dead so what
we're looking at is robustness.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:13.640
If we put back into this circuit
everything I've told you,

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.150
this would be the epigenetic control

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.470
and that's not really the correct phrase.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:22.180
What this is is differential
methylation of these genes.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.610
So DnaA which is transcribed

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.210
from a fully methylated promoter controls,

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.669
here it was 40 genes, I
think it's up to 50 now.

00:40:31.669 --> 00:40:36.210
DnaA then turns on GcrA which
controls about 50 genes.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:40.650
GcrA turns on the P1 promoter of CtrA.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.750
I told you about this oscillating circuit.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.700
CtrA controls about 95 genes

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.230
and inhibits DNA replication

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.680
and it also turns on this
DNA methyltransferase.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.170
Interestingly, there are
two methylation sites

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:00.520
within the plus one region of CcrM

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.360
and as soon as these are methylated,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.940
you turn off the expression of CcrM.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.450
So this DNA methyltransferase

00:41:07.399 --> 00:41:10.730
is like a shot of the
DNA methyltransferase.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:15.730
It methylates up 1400 GANTC
sites around the chromosome

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.340
and then is cleared out of the cell

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.760
very rapidly by proteolysis.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.800
Then while it's rapidly turning
on a whole bunch of genes,

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.350
it methylates up the DnaA gene

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.933
and you can start the
cell cycle all over again.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.880
So in fact, given all of
these coordinated events

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.360
that occur to give you
a logical progression

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.690
of the cell cycle, we can
make some conclusions.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:46.570
One, we believe that there's
a small number of regulated,

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.040
of master regulators that are controlled

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.960
both temporally and spatially

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.870
and they oscillate
throughout the cell cycle.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:58.470
The control system is
hierarchically organized,

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.660
there's stuff at the
top then turns on these,

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.850
turns on these.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:05.300
A beautiful example of that
is the flagella hierarchy,

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.900
functions are turned on as
modules just in time when needed

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:14.400
and the synchronization of
this whole cell cycle engine

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.660
is linked to multiple other events,

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.050
for example, I showed you that

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.900
the reliable cell cycle functions,

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.680
the order is linked to
chromosome replication

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.090
and is also linked to the
phosphosignaling pathway,

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.320
which is linked to the
correct time of proteolysis

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.990
during the cell cycle so
you can get rid of things

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.780
when you have to get rid of them.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.140
And most importantly, the
three-dimensional organization

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.720
of the cell matters.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.060
The dynamic spatial positioning
of these regulatory proteins

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.823
is essential to their function.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.950
Their position of the regulatory genes

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.500
on the chromosome can be essential.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.930
And compartmentalization
triggers cell differentiation

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:05.830
so we have a paradigm
here where it's not enough

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.050
to study the transcriptional
regulatory network.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:14.580
That is just a layer of
multiple layers of control

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.860
and if you want to model
a regulatory pathway,

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.350
simply looking at a
transcriptional network

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.340
can be very misleading.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.470
Overall regulatory wiring
diagram, of course,

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.900
is selected for robustness and in fact,

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.990
this DNA methylation regulation

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.640
is something that
contributes to the fitness

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.233
of the organism not life and death.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.590
So in fact, what I've
shown you is that there's

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.270
a forward-biased circuitry

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.990
that drives cell cycle progression

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.900
and the progression through the cell cycle

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.660
is pasted in a ratchet like fashion

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.640
so that you have gates moving forward

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.930
and opening, allow you to go
from one state to another.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.010
And what I've shown here is
just some of these gates,

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.440
coming back to the
first slide I showed you

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.090
when I started this talk.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.960
So here is the cell cycle, here
are the functional modules.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.730
One of the gates is that
replication initiation

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.140
is triggered by proteolysis of CtrA.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.560
It's clearly not the only thing

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.860
but it's one of the licensing events.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.810
Then DNA origin segregation
to the opposite pole triggers

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.290
the cell division machine, another gate,

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.120
always moving forward.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.680
Gate three, the
compartmentalization at this point

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.450
in the cell cycle, triggers
daughter cell asymmetry

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.560
by trapping different regulators

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.130
at the two different poles of the cell.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:49.660
So in fact, what I've shown you is that

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.870
if you take a logical
approach to the cell cycle,

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.300
trying to understand how
multiple events happen

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.200
at specific times and are dependent

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.770
on all the events that happen before it,

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:06.130
you get the forward progression
throughout the cell cycle

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:09.560
and we have a systematic explanation

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.820
of cell cycle expression in a living cel.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.240
And what I have here is I'd like to thank

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.660
the extraordinary group of
graduate students and postdocs

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.840
who have worked on this,
not only currently,

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.680
including Antonio Iniesta and Grant Bowman

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.860
and Esteban Tore but the large group

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:32.490
of people who now all run their own labs

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:36.100
and are fierce and incredibly
wonderful competitors,

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.380
running their own caulobacter lab

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:41.380
and I also want to mention that our lab

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:46.000
is closely integrated with
the lab run by Harley McAdams.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.610
Harley McAdams is a physicist
who has become interested

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:53.690
and learned the language or
genetics and biochemistry

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:57.970
and in his lab, his students
are all getting their PhDs

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.270
in computer science, EE or physics

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:04.750
and what we've done is we've
integrated our two labs

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:08.390
so that we have physicists
sitting next to geneticists

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:11.820
and electrical engineers
sitting next to biochemists

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.147
and instead of a biologist saying,

00:46:14.147 --> 00:46:15.657
"Look, we have this problem.

00:46:15.657 --> 00:46:17.900
"Mr. Physicist, solve this for us,"

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.380
we designed the experiments together

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.690
and we understand what we
need to ask the questions

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.710
and how we can interpret the results.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.390
Sure these guys must write algorithms

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.970
and they help us figure
out how to build beautiful

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:35.220
technologically advanced equipment
but that's not the point.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.880
We learn each other's language

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.550
and we learn to think in different ways.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.590
So I would like to sort of give a plug

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.480
for interdisciplinary work.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.100
I work closely with Harley.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.130
Not everybody can work quite
as closely as he and I do,

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:50.283
since he's my husband.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.240
But we do know how to talk to each other

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.830
and after all these
years, we still get along

00:46:56.830 --> 00:47:00.280
and so I really recommend integrated labs.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.480
I think they're wonderful.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.993
And with that, I'd like to
thank you all very much.

00:47:04.993 --> 00:47:07.993
(audience applause)

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.060
- I'd like to thank Professor Shapiro

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.540
for the amazing seminar
and it just shows you

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.700
that the caulobacter has come a long way

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.290
and is now a household word. (chuckles)

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:28.650
So Professor Shapiro is
going to entertain questions

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.493
and we'll do that up here.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.720
- [Announcer] Yes, please
come up to the microphone,

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.770
thank you.

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.580
- [Man] So the force that
drives one ori to the next

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.320
after you get the--

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.610
- [Both] Initiation.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:44.370
- [Man] Presumably, you asked me to think

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:45.730
about it yesterday.

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.700
Just hearing your seminar, it seems to me

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.590
that just the replication fork itself

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.990
might be enough to move--
- Yeah, but it's not.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:57.210
- How can you eliminate--
- If you have a mutation

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:01.910
in parA that prevents
it from hydrolyzing ATP,

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.480
everything stops.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.860
- [Man] But that says that it's necessary

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.250
but it might not be sufficient.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:08.610
So part of the eg--
- Okay!

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.690
Okay, I give you that,
they could contribute

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:14.530
and Ling Xio suggested that

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.530
the force of replication per
se could contribute to it

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:18.680
but clearly, it's not.
- But there's not

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.540
a filament that runs--
- Oh, yes there is.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.543
ParA polymerizes.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.899
- [Man] I see, so you
think that maybe it moves--

00:48:27.899 --> 00:48:30.320
- We've shown polymerization
of parA both in vivo

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.560
and in vitro and Ethan Gauner
has done the in vitro work

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.560
of the caulobacter parA and
yes, it is a polymer. (chuckles)

00:48:39.623 --> 00:48:40.991
- [Man] One other, one other.

00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:42.820
There is a lot going on at the ori

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.870
at different times.
- Yeah!

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:48.230
- The vicinity, so
presumably, the MipZ complex

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:53.090
that spreads comes on
after the initiation event,

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:54.490
that it doesn't--
- Yes, it comes on it.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:57.140
- [Man] So the replication
fork doesn't move through it?

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.100
- No, no, no, it's decorated.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.050
No, it's a very complicated
business going on it that's,

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.260
I use the word centromere,
what I'm doing is referring

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.600
to a sequence that is the
site of force generation.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.610
Clearly, we have to
define all the proteins

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:15.470
that are coming on and
off that particular site

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:17.003
as this event is occurring.

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:19.950
- [Lady] Do you know something about

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.560
how widely distributed
in evolutionary history

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.140
this particular modular architecture is?

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.180
- Well, this is present
in, whenever you look

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:32.250
at an Alphaproteobacteria,
this whole system

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.590
is in there and what's interesting

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.970
is that, for example, a whole
CtraA regulation is there

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:43.410
but the output varies with
respect to the ecological niche

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.890
of the particular Alphaproteobacteria.

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:49.760
So that in brucella which infects people,

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.770
it turned on a different
set of genes ultimately

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.590
than are turned on in caulobacter.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:58.440
In some Alphaproteobacteria,
CtrA is essential,

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.240
as in caulobacter and others, it's not

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.320
but in all instances,
it's controlling genes

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.223
that allow it to live and
survive in its environment.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.962
- [Lady] So it is a master regulatory gene

00:50:11.962 --> 00:50:12.928
in all of them--
- But it does

00:50:12.928 --> 00:50:13.761
different things.
- But it's not necessarily,

00:50:13.761 --> 00:50:16.320
controlling the same set of
down stretch right genes.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.700
All right, thanks.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.090
- [Man] You mind if I
put you on the spot Lucy?

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:22.660
- Oh well, please, feel free.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.760
- [Man] I'm just curious,
since you do collaborate

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.300
with physicists, what
biological insight did

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.439
you have as a consequence
of a collaboration

00:50:30.439 --> 00:50:31.677
with a physicist that
you wouldn't have had?

00:50:31.677 --> 00:50:34.310
- There are a number of
ways of answering that.

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:36.260
I think the best example

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.030
is that when we were first contemplating

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:44.180
what the organization
of that genome was like

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.620
and we knew that the
origin was at one pole

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.460
and we knew that the terminus
was at the other pole

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.670
and what happened in between,

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:55.330
we knew that we could tag individual loci

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:58.320
but the question was,
alright, what do we do,

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.570
like lock up 20 graduate students

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.700
in a dark room for 10 years?

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.330
That didn't seem very logical
and so working with some

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:08.970
of our engineers and physicists,

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:13.740
they designed not only the
computer-driven microscope,

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.740
fluorescent scope, but they
designed the algorithms

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:22.470
that let the computer
analyze 50,000 images

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:26.200
of 114 different tagged loci

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:31.200
and yes, individual genes and
their position in the cell

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.960
had been visualized in E.
coli and in bacillus subtilis

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:36.793
but a few.

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:40.750
Now we're up to, I don't know, about 150.

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:44.450
So the whole question
was how general is this?

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:48.100
And we were able to answer
a very important question

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.940
because immediately, when
we first started talking

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.720
about this, my druthers was well,

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.570
you initiate replication,
you keep replicating

00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:00.980
and then you start moving
or maybe you move the origin

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.790
and the rest comes after
it's all duplicated

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.907
and the physicists and
engineers said, "Wait a minute,

00:52:05.907 --> 00:52:07.317
"that makes no sense.

00:52:07.317 --> 00:52:10.287
"What you wanna do is you
wanna do it at the same time

00:52:10.287 --> 00:52:12.037
"and let's see if the cell dies."

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:15.200
Hypothesis-driven research

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.770
as opposed to
non-hypothesis-driven research

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:21.350
and so that's one example
but there are many others.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:22.320
- [Lady] So you talked about

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.660
this gates-driven architecture,

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.950
so certain events have to happen
for other events to happen

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:32.930
but then you also talked about
the process depending on time

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:37.930
and so I was interested if
there's also a master timer,

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.530
if you think, so both
time and the conditions

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:43.157
for the gates to happen have to be true

00:52:43.157 --> 00:52:44.840
but can you slow things down?

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:47.590
- You can slow things down
by growing them on media

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:49.880
that they're not very happy
on, on a carbon source

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.350
that takes a lot to use
so you can slow down

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:57.560
the generation time but you
get exactly the same pathway.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.960
And another timer, of course,

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.910
is the movement of the replication fork

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.600
because that's when you
get things turned on

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.600
and that lets you continue
at least at that level

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.800
but there are not only control mechanisms

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.610
of transcription, there are all those

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:16.740
other layered control mechanisms

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.110
that contribute to the
timing that are connected

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:22.930
with the morphology of
the cell and the time

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:24.870
when you get compartmentalization.

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.310
So I guess what I'm trying to say,

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:30.940
is that it's a layered and
complicated gate opening

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.290
as you move through to give you timing.

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:34.200
- [Lady] So I wanted to ask you,

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.550
it is very obvious that the
localization of the termini

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.470
and the origin at the two opposite poles

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:42.170
is very important for all this story

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:46.500
but you showed that the whole chromosome

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.220
is very localized and different,

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.780
what do you think the role of that,

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.997
where does that become important?

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.440
- Let me try to explain a bit

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.393
about what might be happening here.

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:03.680
The question is are there
many loci on the genome

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.840
that attach to the membrane

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.560
the way centromere does to the pole?

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.610
Is there another one or two or none?

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:16.090
And one possibility is once you harpoon

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.910
the duplicated origin to the other pole,

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.240
make-believe that the
replicating chromosome

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.600
is like a rope and you're standing

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.540
at the top of a swimming pool

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:29.190
and you're coiling the
newly replicated chromosome

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.150
down into the swimming pool

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:35.260
in the most logical
energy-saving confirmation.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.240
And you're just wrapping it down

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.000
and packing it down into the cell

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.080
as though you're filling a phage head

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.420
and so it's not that
it's grabbing on to sites

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.970
and it's all specific but
rather, it's just physics,

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:51.490
just the most logical way
of packing into the cell.

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.910
This is a hypothesis, we
don't know whether it's true.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:57.220
There might be sites, other sites

00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.560
that are grabbing on to things in the cell

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.360
but we don't know that.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.910
Esteban is sitting here now actually

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:07.290
is doing experiments to answer that.

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:09.630
So hopefully the next time I come back,

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:10.980
I can answer that question.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.320
- [Man] I think you answered
my question towards the end

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.130
because you said the something
about the methyl transferase

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.120
added to the robustness of the system

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:19.980
but it wasn't required.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.330
So I assume by that a deletion

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.260
of the methyl transferase is not lethal?

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.880
- It's lethal.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.930
- [Man] How about over-production?

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:28.680
- Over-production is not lethal

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.050
but the cells are--
- I think that's far

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.200
from just contributing to
robustness, essentially.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.860
- Yeah, that's true.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:38.750
It is lethal but we don't know
all the functions of that.

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.180
- [Man] So my question was:
is part of the coupling

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.570
to growth because that
methyl transferase requires

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:46.460
SAMe or tetrahydrofolic acid--

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.293
- [Both] SAMe.

00:55:47.293 --> 00:55:50.163
- [Man] So is growth
coupled in an intimate way

00:55:51.213 --> 00:55:54.290
via methionine levels or
methionine biosynthesis--

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:56.440
- We've never done that, that's
an interesting experiment.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.490
We've not asked that.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.510
And it's interesting, even the SAMe

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:03.710
is cell cycle control and
comes up at the same time

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:07.700
in the cell cycle as a CcrM

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.130
but that's a good experiment,
we should do that.

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:12.820
- [Man] What would happen
if you blocked cell division

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.100
with cephalexin and you got filaments

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.670
but DNA replication continues?

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:19.790
I'm sure you've done that.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:21.780
- You have very sick cells.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.123
- Sick.
- Sick.

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.810
They elong and they die.
- They elong and they die?

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:30.290
- [Man] What would happen, E coli has

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.260
rounds of replication in rich media

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.730
that initiate before--

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:36.030
- We can't do that in caulobacter

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:38.190
because it's so tightly coordinated.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.440
- [Man] But do you think this
kind of mechanism would work

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.940
in an organism like E. coli?

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.760
- Well, E. coli has its own way

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.130
of regulating the
initiation of replication

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:51.259
which has to do with the
Sec protein that binds--

00:56:51.259 --> 00:56:54.050
- All the other site,
all the other gates--

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:55.650
- Yeah, I think that E. coli is gonna

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:57.260
have different kinds of gates.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.110
I think whatever I've told you applies

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:02.780
to the Alphaproteobacteria
and not all bacteria

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:05.760
and bacteria are very clever creatures

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.150
and they have designed all kinds

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:10.080
of different regulatory mechanisms.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.310
Is it gonna be a logical progression?

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:15.530
Sure, it's not stochastic events

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:17.573
that make E. coli be E. oli.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.910
They just haven't been
worked out in this way

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:22.330
and what's helped this of course

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:25.060
is we can synchronize these cells easily

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.280
and there's very tight control

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:31.323
and this tight control is
not observed in E. coli.

00:57:35.466 --> 00:57:38.764
- [David] Are there any more questions?

00:57:38.764 --> 00:57:39.694
Thank you--
- Thank you.

00:57:39.694 --> 00:57:41.358
- For a wonderful lecture, appreciate it.

00:57:41.358 --> 00:57:44.218
(audience applause)

00:57:44.218 --> 00:57:46.801
(solemn music)
