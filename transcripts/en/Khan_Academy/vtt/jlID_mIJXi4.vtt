00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.870
We are told that h
of x is equal to 3x.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.386
g of t is equal to negative
2t minus 2 minus h of t.

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:12.620
f of n is equal to negative
5n squared plus h of n.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.720
So we have three
function definitions,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.340
and two of these
function definitions

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.470
are actually defined in
terms of another function--

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.490
in particular, in terms
of the function h.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.740
And then we're asked to
calculate, what is h of g of 8?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.610
And this can be very
daunting, but we just

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.050
have to remember that all a
function is is something that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.120
takes an input and gives
you an output for it.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.830
And this somewhat
convoluted looking statement

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.830
is another way of
saying, look, we

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.350
are going to take
the number 8, and we

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.840
are going to input it
into the function g.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.055
And then that is going
to produce g of 8.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:57.270
And then we're going to
take whatever value that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.444
is and input that
into the function h.

00:01:00.444 --> 00:01:02.110
So we're going to
take this whole thing,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.840
and then we're going to input
that into the function h.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.840
And what we will have will
be h of what we inputted,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.620
h of g of 8.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.520
So let's just do it
one step at a time.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240
Let's figure out what g of 8 is.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:26.630
And I'm going to color code it,
so we can keep track of things.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.540
g of 8 is equal to-- well, g of
t, we have our definition here.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.180
So our input now, 8 is going
to be our t, so our input is 8.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.200
So every place where we see a
t in this function definition,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.465
we replace it with an 8.

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:50.911
So it's going to be negative
2 times 8 minus 2 minus--

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.410
and this might be
a little daunting,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.090
but let's just replace
this t with an 8

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.756
and then see if we
can make sense of it.

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:58.540
h minus-- and let me do
it in the right color--

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.900
minus 2 minus h of 8.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.430
Notice, to evaluate g of 8,
all we did is, everywhere

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.970
we saw a t, we replaced
it with the input 8.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.785
Now let's see if we
can calculate this.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.620
This is going to be equal
to negative 2 times 8

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.240
is negative 16.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.090
Minus 2 is negative 18.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.560
Let me do that the same.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.750
So this is going to be equals
negative 18 minus-- what

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.230
is h of 8 going to be equal to?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.570
So let's do that over here.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.820
So h of 8-- this thing, h of 8.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.196
Now we go to the
definition of h.

00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:40.653
Don't worry about
later we're going

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:42.400
to input all this
business into h again.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.275
Just let's worry about
it one step at a time.

00:02:44.275 --> 00:02:45.970
We need to calculate h of 8.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.080
So h of 8 is just going to be--
well, every time we see an x,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.960
we replace it with an 8--
it's going to be 3 times 8,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.410
which is equal to 24.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.210
So this value right
over here is 24.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.900
We are subtracting it,
so we have minus 24.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.970
Negative 18 minus 24 is what?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.310
That's negative 42.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.449
So all of this
business is going to be

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.740
equal to-- did I do that right?

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.060
Yeah-- negative 42.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.960
So we figured out
what g of 8 is.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.320
It is negative 42.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.990
So this right over
here is negative 42.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.130
And now we can input
negative 42 into h.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.210
Let me do it right over here.
h of negative 42-- remember,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.800
negative 42 is the
same thing as g of 8.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.765
So this is h of g of 8 is the
same thing as h of negative 42.

00:03:41.765 --> 00:03:43.140
Let me do that in
the same color.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.820
This is going to be equal to
3 times negative 42, which

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.760
is equal to-- this
is negative 126.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.830
And we are done.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.290
So it seemed
convoluted at first,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.790
but if you just
keep track of what's

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.580
our input, what's our
output, and really just

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.840
evaluate the functions,
it should hopefully

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.275
be reasonably straightforward.
