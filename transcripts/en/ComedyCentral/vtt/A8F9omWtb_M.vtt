Next up-- the war on Santa.

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.805
If you're watching this show
with your kids,

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.073
you're a great parent!
Thank you!

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:09.610
And, also, sorry for all
the times I did this. Aah!

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:10.978
(laughter)

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.746
(applause and cheering)

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.081
But...

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.484
before this next piece,
here is a disclaimer.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.785
MAN:
<i>Spoiler alert.</i>

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:23.891
AUKERMAN:
This is dance.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.726
According to a new study,
it's damaging

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.861
for parents
to lie to kids about Santa Claus

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.630
before Jesus' birthday.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:32.599
Here's a fair and balanced take
from Fox News.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.902 line:0%
 
MAN: <i>They suggest
that lying to children</i>

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:37.671 line:0%
 
<i>could undermine their trust
in parents,</i>

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:41.775 line:0%
 
<i>as a result leaving them open
to abject disappointment.</i>

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.911
<i>If parents can lie
so convincingly</i>

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:48.115
<i>and over such a long time,
what else can they lie about?</i>

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.883
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.955
First of all, (bleep) you,
(bleep) those kids.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.623
This is all dumb.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:57.925
Yeah, I love this.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.294
Like, oh, don't lie
to your kids, but go ahead

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.829
and keep getting your news from
a totally biased news source.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:06.600
-(cheers and applause)
-Oh! -Wow!

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.569
Nope. Nope. I'm out.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:10.270
-I'm out.
-HARDWICK: You're in. You're in.

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:11.438
-Scott's out?
-Aukerman out.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.507
-Aukerman's in.
-CARVEY: You know, uh...

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.142
(imitating Trump):
This wasn't very nice, okay?

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.845
You're not very nice, okay?
When's this on? Midnight?

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.913
-Why? Why? -HARDWICK: I don't
know. -What a nasty man.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:22.583
-What a nasty man. -It's not
even on at midnight.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:24.384
Comedians, at this very
sensitive time of year,

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.220
what else is triggering you
about Santa Claus?

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.856
-Scott Aukerman.
-Now I don't believe it

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.958
when I hear
anyone who's coming to down.

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.059
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.360
My uncle, <i>Cavalia.</i>

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.628
HARDWICK:
Yeah, none of 'em.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.630
-The I Loved The 90s Tour.
-HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:39.433
-Chelsey Crisp.
-I saw Mommy kissing him,

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.668
but he didn't have a beard,
and he looked a lot

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.136
-like her Pilates instructor?
-All right, points.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.738
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-He was ripped!

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.174
-He was just ripped. Santa was
jacked. -Just (bleep) ripped.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.344
-Dana. -I'm a vegan, but I eat
reindeer meat out of spite.

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.079
HARDWICK: Yes. Points.
Very good, very good.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:52.179
-(laughter, applause)
-You'll show them!
