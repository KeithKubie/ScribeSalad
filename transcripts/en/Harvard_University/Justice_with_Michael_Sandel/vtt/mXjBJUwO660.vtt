00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.709
Now consider,

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.840
another doctor case.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.750
This time your transplant surgeon,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.009
and you have five patients each
desperate need

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.379
of an organ transplant in order to
survive.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.990
One needs a heart, one a lung,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.340
one a kidney,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.909
one a liver,

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.670
the other

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.009
a pancreas.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.609
You have no organ donors,

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.669
you are about to

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.370
see them

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.700
die, and then

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.450
it occurs to you.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.260
That in the next room

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.240
there's a healthy diet who came in for a
check-up. (LAUGHTER)

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.580
And he's, (LAUGHTER)

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.960
you like that, (LAUGHTER)

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.140
he's taking a nap, (LAUGHTER)

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.390
you could go in very quietly

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.460
yank out the five organs that person
would die.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.110
But you can save the five 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.860
how many would do it,
anyone.
