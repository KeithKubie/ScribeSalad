00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.170
In this lesson, we've learned some new concepts that

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.950
can be summarized into four main points. Point one.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.460
Genomic information is organized into both coding and non-coding

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.430
sequences. And it's these coding regions of genes that are

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.290
turned into proteins, which are one of the major

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.440
active components of cells. Point two. A gene is

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.890
transcribed into an MRNA copy that leaves the nucleus

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.590
and is translated by ribosomes in the cytoplasm into amino

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.260
acids that make up proteins. The code is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.000
read in sets of three nucleotides called a codon

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.340
and this whole process is referred to as,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.435
the central dogma. Point three. The genetic code is

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:40.470
non-overlapping and any change in the sequence may

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.110
or may result in overall changes to the amino

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
acids. And point four different versions of genes

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.020
are referred to as alleles. And although all humans

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.250
have two copies or two alleles of almost every gene. Many

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.950
different alleles can exist for any given gene in a population.
