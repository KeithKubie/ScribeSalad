00:00:00.257 --> 00:00:01.418
- [Voiceover] So I have three different

00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.705
relationships here between X and Y.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:04.866
And what I wanna think about

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:08.276
which of these, if any, are
proportional relationships.

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:09.229
And then I wanna graph them to see

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.006
if we can see anything visually

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.455
that makes them obviously proportional.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:14.546
And just as a reminder,

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:16.276
a proportional relationship is one

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:18.168
where the ratio between the two variables,

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:20.792
and let's say we took the
ratio between Y and X,

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:21.988
you could also go the other way around,

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.450
the ratio between X and Y.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.285
But the ratio between
Y and X is always going

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:28.315
to be some number, some constant number.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:29.919
Or you could rewrite it another way,

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.593
If you were to multiply both sides

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:33.276
of this equation times X,

00:00:33.276 --> 00:00:34.913
you could say in a
proportional relationship,

00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:39.913
Y is always going to be equal
to some constant times X.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.135
So with that out of the way,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.434
let's look at these three relationships.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:44.932
So this one over here,

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:46.801
let me draw another column here.

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:49.796
Another column.

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:52.640
This is, let me call
this the Y over X column.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.358
I'm just gonna keep figuring
out what this ratio is

00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:56.018
for each of these pairs.

00:00:56.018 --> 00:00:58.038
So for this first pair,

00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:00.279
when X is one, Y is one half,

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:02.531
so this ratio is one half over one.

00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:03.738
Well one half over one is just

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:06.199
the same thing as one half.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.440
When X is four, Y is two,
this ratio is gonna be

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.409
two over four, which is
the same thing as one half.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.398
When X is negative two
and Y is negative one,

00:01:15.398 --> 00:01:18.079
this ratio is negative
one over negative two,

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.947
which is the same thing as one half.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:22.421
So for at least these three points

00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:24.139
that we've sampled from this relationship,

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:28.667
it looks like the ratio between
Y and X is always one half.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:30.919
In this case K would be one half,

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:35.137
we could write Y over X is
always equal to one half.

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:36.972
Or at least for these three
points that we've sampled,

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:38.841
and we'll say, well, maybe
it's always the case,

00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:41.441
for this relationship between X and Y,

00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:42.741
or if you wanted to write it another way,

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:47.176
you could write that Y
is equal to one half X.

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:49.521
Now let's graph this thing.

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:52.621
Well, when X is one, Y is one half.

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:55.999
When X is four, Y is two.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.621
When X is negative two, Y is negative one.

00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:00.921
I didn't put the marker for negative one,

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:02.674
it would be right about there.

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:05.019
And so if we say these three points

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:07.039
are sampled on the entire relationship,

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.918
and the entire relationship
is Y is equal to one half X,

00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:13.157
well the line that represents,

00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:15.270
or the set of all points
that would represent

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.530
the possible X-Y pairs,
it would be a line.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.733
It would be a line that
goes through the origin.

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:26.797
Because look, if X is
zero, one half times zero

00:02:26.797 --> 00:02:30.176
is going to be equal to Y.

00:02:30.176 --> 00:02:32.172
And so let's think about some
of the key characteristics.

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:33.867
One, it is a line.

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:36.828
This is a line here.

00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:38.836
It is a linear relationship.

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:41.448
And it also goes through the origin.

00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:43.491
And it makes sense that
it goes through an origin.

00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:45.256
Because in a proportional relationship,

00:02:45.256 --> 00:02:46.251
actually when you look over here,

00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:48.851
zero over zero, that's indeterminate form,

00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:50.535
and then that gets a little bit strange,

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:52.473
but when you look at this right over here,

00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:54.807
well if X is zero and you
multiply it by some constant,

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.080
Y is going to need to be zero as well.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.076
So for any proportional relationship,

00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:01.839
if you're including when X equals zero,

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.672
then Y would need to be
equal to zero as well.

00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:07.156
And so if you were to plot its graph,

00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:10.941
it would be a line that
goes through the origin.

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:13.680
It would be a line that
goes through the origin.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.183
And so this is a proportional relationship

00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:17.713
and its graph is represented by a line

00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:19.942
that goes through the origin.

00:03:19.942 --> 00:03:21.289
Now let's look at this one over here,

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:22.682
this one in blue.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:24.830
So let's think about
whether it is proportional.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.084
And we could do the same test,

00:03:26.084 --> 00:03:29.404
by calculating the ratio between Y and X.

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:30.971
Y and X.

00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:32.747
So it's going to be, let's see,

00:03:32.747 --> 00:03:34.488
for this first one it's
going to be three over one,

00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:35.847
which is just three.

00:03:35.847 --> 00:03:38.726
Then it's gonna be five over two.

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:39.829
Five over two,

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.520
well five over two is not
the same thing as three.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.612
So already we know that
this is not proportional.

00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:49.935
Not proportional.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.926
We don't even have to look

00:03:52.926 --> 00:03:55.248
at this third point right over here,

00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:57.105
where if we took the
ratio between Y and X,

00:03:57.105 --> 00:03:58.603
it's negative one over negative one,

00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:00.344
which would just be one.

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:01.981
Let's see, let's graph this just for fun,

00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:02.886
to see what it looks like.

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:04.384
When X is one, Y is three.

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:07.565
When X is one, Y is three.

00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:09.840
When X is two, Y is five.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.124
X is two, Y is five.

00:04:14.124 --> 00:04:18.408
And when X is negative
one, Y is negative one.

00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:22.622
When X is negative one, Y is negative one.

00:04:22.622 --> 00:04:24.386
And I forgot to put the
hash mark right there,

00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:25.965
it was right around there.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.184
And so if we said, okay,

00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:28.565
let's just give the benefit of the doubt

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:32.002
that maybe these are
three points from a line,

00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:32.988
because it looks like I can actually

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:34.521
connect them with a line.

00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:37.005
Then the line would look
something like this.

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:42.776
The line would look something like this.

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.367
So notice, this is linear.

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:48.805
This is a line right over here.

00:04:48.805 --> 00:04:51.510
But it does not go through the origin.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.110
So if you're just looking
at a relationship visually,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.385
linear is good, but it needs to go through

00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:59.787
the origin as well for it to
be proportional relationship.

00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:00.785
And you see that right here.

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:01.993
This is a linear relationship,

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:04.628
or at least these three
pairs could be sampled

00:05:04.628 --> 00:05:06.543
from a linear relationship,

00:05:06.543 --> 00:05:09.887
but the graph does not
go through the origin.

00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:11.907
And we see here, when
we look at the ratio,

00:05:11.907 --> 00:05:13.985
that it was indeed not proportional.

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.889
So this is not proportional.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.854
Now let's look at this one over here.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.540
Let's look at what we have here.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.325
So I'll look at the ratios.

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.279
Y over X.

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.492
So for this first pair, one over one,

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:30.952
then we have four over two,

00:05:30.952 --> 00:05:33.425
well we immediately see that
we are not proportional.

00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:35.851
And then nine over
three, it would be three.

00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:38.452
So clearly this is not
a constant number here.

00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:40.123
We don't always have the same value here,

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:44.906
and so this is also not proportional.

00:05:44.906 --> 00:05:47.344
Not proportional.

00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:49.248
But let's graph it just for fun.

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.628
When X is one, Y is one.

00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:53.532
When X is two, Y is four.

00:05:53.532 --> 00:05:54.925
This actually looks like

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:59.879
the graph of Y is equal to X squared.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.254
When X is three, Y is nine.

00:06:02.254 --> 00:06:04.437
At least these three points
are consistent with it.

00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:08.895
So one, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:11.240
So it's gonna look something...

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.679
And so, if this really is,

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:15.071
if these points are sampled
from Y equals X squared,

00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:18.739
then when X is zero, Y would be zero.

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:20.353
So this one actually would
go through the origin,

00:06:20.353 --> 00:06:22.280
but notice, it's not a line.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.834
It's not a linear relationship.

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:28.479
This right over here is the
graph of Y equals X squared.

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.416
So this one also is not proportional.

00:06:31.416 --> 00:06:32.995
So once again, these three points

00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:36.068
could be sampled from Y equals one half X,

00:06:36.068 --> 00:06:39.249
these three points could be sampled from,

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:41.989
let's see, Y is equal to, let's see,

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:44.764
it looks like a line when...

00:06:44.764 --> 00:06:48.653
this looks like it could be Y = 2x + 1.

00:06:48.653 --> 00:06:50.348
So it's a linear relationship,

00:06:50.348 --> 00:06:52.031
but it does not go through the origin,

00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:53.552
so it's not proportional.

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:56.628
And these three points look
like they could be sampled

00:06:56.628 --> 00:06:58.184
from Y equals X squared,

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.542
which goes through the origin.

00:06:59.542 --> 00:07:01.388
When X is zero, Y is zero,

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:03.582
but it's not a linear relationship.

00:07:03.582 --> 00:07:05.463
Any way you look at it,

00:07:05.463 --> 00:07:06.867
if you look at it visually,

00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:08.527
it has to be a line that
goes through the origin,

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:11.464
or if you look at a table of
values, look at the ratios,

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:14.139
and the ratios always
have to be the same value.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.101
And that was only the case
with this magenta one,

00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:17.465
right over here.
