Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Good for the UFC. It's good for everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:04          Her mom's mind, people say, oh, did you ever think about going Belloto one and my mind is great fighters everywhere right now. I still think the number one and all of his in the UFC, number one martial arts and UFC, and right now that's my goal. Yeah, that's all great, but I'm here to be the best. I can go to one and make a killing. I go to bed to try and get my sponsors back, but I'm in no rush to leave here because I want to be the best. Yeah, like after I proved that there was nothing else, and then it's like, okay, now I'm ready for the money. Then that's maybe an option, but there's no competence

Speaker 1:          00:34          in terms of prestige. There's no context. If you get the UFC title, you're the best.

Speaker 2:          00:39          That's it. There's no question I got. What about the villa tour? This isn't is because dibella toy chant, while especially John Jones absolutely

Speaker 1:          00:46          went on in your division. You know in your division you have one of the best guys of all time, if not the best guy of all, Thomas and champion. So when you see a guy like John at the top of the heap, is that, is that motivating to you to just ramp up and even harder because you realize that the guy who was a champion in your division is not just the best light heavyweight of all time, may be the best martial artists of all time.

Speaker 2:          01:11          They're ramps up so much like I, well I'm riding a bike in my basement. I got the air down bike and a stationary bike and I got the project and I'm down there only thing on fight pass and I watching him fight pass. I'm usually watching Jon Jones, you know, to see him dominate another guys and that you just hear that bite. You can hear the, the pedals are putting on weight gain. So I can go from raw some crazy and like I don't even be looking down at the clock and just here had aired the fam picking up right now. I didn't realize it till like it goes to break and I slow it down in our heart rates and not just Washington just like this. Like I want to get there. I gotta, I gotta beat him to be the best, so I need to work hard for you to take on him.

Speaker 2:          01:46          You can't take away what he does in the sport. What is his outside? His personal life, that's all he say. She say, I have my words after the, the California stuff, we went to two 26 or whatever fight was in Vegas and got moved here because of his lifestyle and drug tests and all that extra stuff. However you want to code it up, his past, you know, I'm done with it. I had my words there, the fact that he kept using God and Jesus and this, this and this, and I'm a golfer and got read my Bible every morning and I don't like the fact that you can, that he would do that. I'm like, I'm not want it now. But at the time my worries was the fact that he did that. And then at the same time I want to interview with us.

Speaker 2:          02:20          I want to thank God and is that kind of rubbed me wrong. And then we flew on a plane together and like I said, I saw the way he was acting when he came on a plane. Like we not doing this because of him like all day at a time bothering me and I was a pent up anything else on mills going into that fight? That was something on my shoulders. I have posted something cause when the UFC called me right before I got on the flight and he's like, oh don't come all the way to Vegas now I've got my wife, she's eight months pregnant. Like she's 30 weeks, whatever. She can't travel after this. She's struggling. We all them bags and y'all call me and I'll say don't come this and this. Go back home. We're going to fly you out again. Like I'm not doing this again.

Speaker 2:          02:53          And then when they get to they will, we can get you here but we get you to Cali. But we can't take your wife like what? Like, well you, we your ticket in the code you take like no, fuck that all because Jon Jones, that's what got me mad that so they're trying to save money pretty much flying people because we as all, we was literally walking down the wrong way to the plane. When they call him a can I turn around? But then when we got like, okay, you come here but we can get you to category. We couldn't get you get a wife to Cali. Like my wife is 30 weeks pregnant. She's here when she's coming like, well we don't know what to do because you bought her ticket, isn't it? Like what do you mean you don't know what to do? Get her another ticket.

Speaker 2:          03:26          Like I paved my family. What about the people that's on the way right now? Like God, I got to find the own way and that maybe around week five, week of the fight, the thing of the things that you have to think about, do you know fucking with, that's the last thing I'd worry about God and then I get there and they said, when you get, make sure you got your workout. If you don't have your workout, schedule the Pie set already. As soon as you get there, go do it. I did mine like a month and a half ahead of time. I'm all, I'm like I said, I'm punctured. Like I like having stuff done. Yeah, I'm getting ready to go to the piano. I'm packing my bags and I get a call. Oh, you can't come to the Pei. Why? John just came in and said he wanted to work out so we closed the gym down.

Speaker 2:          04:02          You're not allowed. Y'All call me two months ago. Told me to set my schedule to come ahead of time. I'm really get ready to walk to my Uber that's outside. And you said I can't come now. Like I, sorry. Nothing we can do is John, why can't you work out the same place with John's working on the same thing when connoisseur and I'm there in the summer and kind of show up. They're coming until there. But you gotta leave like just throw. Yeah. Really. You all got and kindness. I just got locked up on the sidewalk come. Yeah, they have security guards block the stairs off and everything.

Speaker 2:          04:32          Yes. Yeah, exactly. And like you heard somebody say big place. Yeah, but you can go to the cardio room and the weights, but you can't use the upstairs with the cage in the bag and stuff is, you can't use the, if he's in the cage security best there, so you can't go up there. Oh fuck. Is that about mass jazz to people? I don't know. My Pete, I'm an independent contractor sir. But yeah, like that stuff. It kind of rubbed me wrong and that's what I was kind of like, if I was a champ I wouldn't want that. No. Yeah, I mean I want people to be able to see what I'm doing. Security, I don't know. You know, you got to think about how much death threats that guy must get, how much shit he must take. You know, and he's just popular as he is, as famous as he is, maybe just has overzealous security maybe and they just want to tighten it down.

Speaker 2:          05:18          So they didn't want anybody up there. They kept was. So that was the first time I've ever cursed at a UFC employee. Like [inaudible] I was Kurt like going on like y'all want me to change my whole workout scheduled fight week. I'm cutting weight too. You know like it's not just John like we understand bit, I'm going to fuck up at night, I don't care. What are you doing? I need to go up there and get a workout. My coach's meeting me there from the airport but we can't do it antibiotic corridors. And the guy kept hanging up cause I was going on that is when her and call her back and I was like Yo. And then people would hit me up like I'm glad you actually voicing it. So I'm hearing around the PR right now, everybody talking about how you're mad if somebody texts like I'm glad you actually speaking out cause everybody else kind of like, okay.

Speaker 2:          05:52          Like no, like if it wasn't for my wife being there, I probably wouldn't check the same. But I see the way she's struggling to carry this belly around. She's hurt. She's eight months. She could just give birth at any time. So the, I'm sure it's like all that and my baby's Miller's. Sure. Really? Yeah. It was revving me up and my wife can't like Cory just stop, calm down. It'll be okay. This isn't this. Like, I think the fact of being okay with the fact that they laid in one person dictate at all. Like we're all equal and I treat it as like a number. He's Jon Jones, but we're number 4,722 right. You know what I mean? I don't like that. He's John. I'm Corey. Like I was telling wheel on the way here. Reason. I love rose number units cause I've never seen that from her.

Speaker 2:          06:32          She's a champ. But you would see her and she act just like rose before when she was in Invictus did. She doesn't change. I don't want to have special treatment from her or from anybody. If I was a champ, treat me the same. You know what I mean is some people are different I guess. I don't know if it's John or his camp doe is doing it or UFC is doing or security or what, but it rubbed me wrong that we aren't equal anymore. No, that's understandable. But that's also got to give you some motivation. Exactly. I got 'em told them in the area. Other one, I'll sit on the plane and I was really directly behind Jon Jones. I see said, hey Bob and Sally just looking. I looked at my wife and she's like struggling like falling asleep but struggle to fall asleep. I looked at the top of his head, the back of his head.

Speaker 2:          07:11          I was just like, it's time for change the torch. Like my brother always said like, you're good and you know you can be there by about, I feel like when I come to those top guys like John Jones and Gus, you doubt yourself just a little bit. You ain't sure that you can get them yet. You know you're good. But you feel like this was before like before they leave fight, you get there and you, you feel like you don't think you're ready for that. But I'm telling a wash you bro, I know that you may have, you can do it. And I sat there and saw him Baba and all the frustration going through my mind. Six o'clock in the morning we had to get up and catch a plane cause his guys isn't necessarily show up on time. He still was late to that and they was just like, I, if I'm the champ I don't want this.

Speaker 2:          07:47          Yeah, I mean I don't want no special treatment. If you tell me sign up ahead of time and keep your scheduled. I expect that if we get down to scale first come first. So first come, first serve. If I show up late, put me in the order I am, don't put me up front because I'm the chance because I was the first or second person there. I'm on my way to scale and John was walking down the stairs, fully dressed. We went back to the commission room and I remember people in blue shirt campaigns like hold up, hold up. Now all the sudden John come in, he could do all the paperwork, he wants scale and he was out. He was the last person down. How's the, he's first like, it wasn't that big of a deal, but the fact that I don't like that.

Speaker 2:          08:20          Well it's because he's headline in the card, right? Yeah. Giving them special tree is John Jones. There was, I got the phone with this John Jones. They hang up like, I don't like that. It's still, he's still a person. Well, he's a great person to be Corey Anderson. Hundred percent it's coriander and changed the tide. It's coriander score. Annison but treat me know, don't give me treatment. Beautiful. That you have that attitude. What? When you look at John, you look at John Skills, like what do you think you need to do, if anything different in your life or in your training or where do you need to get to where you think you could beat him? Just keep getting better. Leo. The TFA five must've been a big boost. 400% every fight. Lash, every fight. Even the ones I lost it. I had been a boost. Could you go back and seek, tell me a fight.

Speaker 2:          09:05          I've been getting beat up Joe, right? I've never been a fight where somebody, they're all core. You're too smart. You're not good. There's never been one fight in my career where somebody straight manhandled me and push me around. You know what I mean? I talk about this, this and this. Uh, he's the greatest issue. The greatest day. I was watching the UFC main event last night hotel and they had Dick Glover, Rasha fight and this and this and this note and closes clover that globally as Glover's at nothing like upbeat, Degas, you know, I use on, you're talking about hope. Don't give a little tip or Johnny Walker Blue TV. He's super good. This is nice. But at the same time, I was thinking when you said it, but what about Korea? And I was like, here we go. Finally. Somebody's always got to talk. They talk about how good these guys not in beat them all.

Speaker 2:          09:41          You're like, I'm that guy coming into the radar and they don't expect me to do nothing because I lost the Gian Volante my third four fight, UFC two years of my career. You know what I mean? Uh, Jimmy man with Jimmy Ma told wheel on the way here to Jimmy Manual. I was the only fight. I will say a guy beat me. He didn't man handle me, but in my head from his highlights and it's like you said on Instagram, Breen comments, and I'll let what people were saying in reading and seeing, get in my head to think that if there's got touches me, he's gonna put me out. And where are you going? So fight thinking there. I literally got touched in my mind was already set. Like if I get hit, I'm going out. And I, I think subconsciously, like I have myself so doubted that when he hit me in my mind, just like in panic kind of shut down because I remember when I hit the mat, like I wasn't, I was abroad.

Speaker 2:          10:30          I remember I was out. But I remember seeing his feet walk away and I remember when I can see clearly and I thought to myself, it happened exactly what I'll put them on my, if I got hit, it happened and that's right. That was it. Yeah. It was like I can take, I can take it to anybody. And I think Osp was more dangerous than Jimmy because he can kick, he explosiveness isn't the amp punch now did everything right and just slipped into the punch the wrong way. But I was manhandling don't put three rounds. I mean, it's simple mistakes because I didn't have the discipline yet. In three years of my career I hadn't learned the discipline and focus that it's a 15 minute fight. Right? I can win 12 minutes of it all, but one mistake and it's all gone.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Well, the experience of making those mistakes and realizing what they are. And, and then when those moments come up again, and you deviate from the game plan, and you do go to your right and you do move the wrong direction, you know, you'll, you'll catch yourself. You'll realize it's, it's the experience of competition for a fighter is there's nothing that substitutes it. He could have great talent. You can have a great mindset, but the experience of competition is like nothing else.
