This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Norton.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.190
Biometric scanning is the future - but how
secure is it really?

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.140
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.340
Hey guys, Tara here for DNews and with all
the recent technology made in biometric scanning,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.460
you might be wondering - what is the actual
risk involved in using these devices?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.120
And is it really impossible for someone to steal
my identity through them?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.060
The short answer is no - it's not impossible.
But it is significantly trickier.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.780
It's helpful to think of your fingerprint
in the same way you think of a credit card:

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.880
it's really just a string of numbers run
through a computer network.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.160
The difference is, unlike credit card numbers or passwords, your fingerprint can't be lost or misplaced.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.480
But it also can't be changed once it gets
stolen. And that's where the real security issue comes in.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.399
When you consider that all of that information
is stored in a database somewhere, then that's

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.809
what the hackers will target. And assuming
there's encryption involved, once that information

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.069
gets stolen, there are tons of ways to take
advantage of it.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.600
Many of the companies that manufacture fingerprint
scanners like to claim that their technology is unbreakable.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.180
But as the Mythbusters proved back in 2006,
all it takes to steal one is a little bit of dedication.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.600
In their episode, they successfully
cracked a scanner using three different methods.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.600
The first time, they copied someone's fingerprint
onto a latex glove and then used that to open a door.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.659
The second time, they managed to create
a copy of a fingerprint using ballistics gel,

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.229
which is just gelatin mixed with water. And
the third time, all it took was a photocopy

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.189
of someone's fingerprint and a little bit
of saliva.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.569
You may also remember how Apple's iPhone
5S, which came with a Touch ID fingerprint

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.409
scanner built in was hacked by researchers
just one day after it launched.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.300
Scientists managed to crack it using a cheap domestic
scanner to create a photograph of a print

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.320
left on the glass screen. Granted, it was not
an easy process,  but for the criminally inclined

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.120
who have a lot of time on their hands, it's
still doable.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.460
So what about eye scanners? Lots of companies
are currently dabbling in both retina and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.920
iris scanners, but how do they work, and
how secure are they?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.520
Retina scanners work by shooting an invisible
infrared light into your eyeball and measuring

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.220
the pattern of light that gets reflected back
which is unique for every person.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.140
Unfortunately some diseases, like glaucoma and diabetes, can change that pattern over time, potentially

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.940
locking you out of your own devices.
Iris scanners work in a similar way

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.010
in that they shoot near-infrared light into
your eye and use the light that reflects back

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.580
to replicate the intricacies of your iris.
For the most part, it's considered superior

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.599
to retina scanning. It can be done from a
greater distance, so it's less intrusive.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.600
And your iris isn't susceptible to disease
in the same way your retina is

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.500
so unless you suffer from a serious eye injury, it'll pretty much remain the same throughout your life.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.740
As far as biometric scanning goes, the iris
appears to be the "final frontier"

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.560
so we shouldn't be surprised if our phones
start coming with that technology built in,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.849
even a few years from now.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.379
Of course, it still brings up the same issues
as any fingerprint scanning. If the information

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.209
is stored somewhere, it's naturally vulnerable
to theft. And once it gets stolen, it's

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.420
pretty much stolen forever.
Fortunately, there's already software out

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.769
there to protect you from identity theft and
other dangers online, so a big thank you

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.129
to Norton for protecting the vulnerable among
us and for sponsoring the show.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.810
In the meantime, let us know what you think
about the future of biometric scanning, in

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.680
the comments down below, and as always, thank
you guys for watching!
