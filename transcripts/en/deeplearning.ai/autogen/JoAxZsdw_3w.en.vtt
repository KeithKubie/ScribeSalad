this process is called error analysis

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
this process is called error analysis
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.109
this process is called error analysis
let's start with an example let's say

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
let's start with an example let's say
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.519
let's start with an example let's say
you're working on your cat classifier

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
you're working on your cat classifier
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.509
you're working on your cat classifier
and you've achieved 90% accuracy or

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519
and you've achieved 90% accuracy or
 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.150
and you've achieved 90% accuracy or
equivalently 10% error on your deaf set

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
equivalently 10% error on your deaf set
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.099
equivalently 10% error on your deaf set
and let's say this is much worse than

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
and let's say this is much worse than
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260
and let's say this is much worse than
you're hoping to do maybe when your

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
you're hoping to do maybe when your
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360
you're hoping to do maybe when your
teammates looks at some of the examples

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
teammates looks at some of the examples
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.580
teammates looks at some of the examples
that the algorithm is misclassifying and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
that the algorithm is misclassifying and
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.790
that the algorithm is misclassifying and
notices that is miscarry writing some

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
notices that is miscarry writing some
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100

dogs as cats and you know if you look at

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
dogs as cats and you know if you look at
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170
dogs as cats and you know if you look at
these two dogs maybe they look a little

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
these two dogs maybe they look a little
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850

so maybe your teammate comes to you with

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
so maybe your teammate comes to you with
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.130
so maybe your teammate comes to you with
a proposal for how to make the algorithm

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
a proposal for how to make the algorithm

your cat classified do better on dogs so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
your cat classified do better on dogs so
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800

it stops miss recognizing these dogs as
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.310
it stops miss recognizing these dogs as
cats so the question is should you go

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
cats so the question is should you go
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.149
cats so the question is should you go
ahead and start a project focus on the

if you completely solve the dog problem
you only get five out of a hundred more

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350
you only get five out of a hundred more
 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.290
you only get five out of a hundred more
correct or in other words if only five

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300
correct or in other words if only five

percent of your errors are dark pictures
then the best you could easily hope to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860
then the best you could easily hope to
 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.410
then the best you could easily hope to
do if you spend a lot of time on the

do if you spend a lot of time on the
 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.510
do if you spend a lot of time on the
dark problem until your error might go

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520
dark problem until your error might go
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.400
dark problem until your error might go
down from ten percent error down to nine

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410
down from ten percent error down to nine
 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.100
down from ten percent error down to nine
point five percent error rate so dozens

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
point five percent error rate so dozens
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.590
point five percent error rate so dozens
a five percent relative decrease in

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600
a five percent relative decrease in

error from ten percent down to nine
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.720
error from ten percent down to nine
point five percent and so you might

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
point five percent and so you might
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.030
point five percent and so you might
reasonably decide that this is not the

this table of the spreadsheet will
 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.820
this table of the spreadsheet will
correspond to the IDS devaluating so the
