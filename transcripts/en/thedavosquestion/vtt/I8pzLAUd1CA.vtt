00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.420
Yes my name is Stephen Wassira, I'm minister
of agriculture for the security of cooperatives

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:15.179
from Tanzania. We're here taking the world
economic forum which is debating so many issues

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:24.689
pertaining to worldly, global issues. And
one letter in which I wish to contribute is

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.529
about a turna, a crisis that is going on in
the world is itchins. Not only the developed

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.420
countries where they are based are not doing
very well or they need to be restored. But

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.640
the need from the developing countries particularly
Africa south of the Sahara. Depend on the

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.680
west for our markets, markets for out commodities.
In Tanzania we produce coffee for export,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:03.800
we produce tea for export, we produce kitchen
knives. But the price for all these commodities

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:12.150
have gone down because of the crisis. So this
is a very serious problem not only to the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.430
developing countries and it is hurting even
more to the developing countries. That is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:27.750
one, but we live in the world of optimistic,
we are still optimistic that the ithchins

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.940
which are being taken by the developing countries
that developed. Particularly this tim nuts

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:43.440
which are being taking to restore the banks
and the other economic enterprise in the west.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.940
We'll eventually bring the economy there.
So we are not losing all but we are still

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.280
in hopes.
