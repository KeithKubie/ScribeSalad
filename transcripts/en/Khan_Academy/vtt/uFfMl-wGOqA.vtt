00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.660
Welcome back.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.180
Well we're now on number 4.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.000
And just so you know how
considerate I am of your time,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.510
I drew this very fancy graphic
before the video just so not

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.790
to waste your valuable time.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.970
So let's read the question.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.270
This is the graph that they--
and this X right here is

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.520
number of children.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.280
And these are years.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.120
So the question says, the graph
above shows how the

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.270
Jackson family continued to grow
between 1991 and 1998 by

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.980
indicating the total number of
children in the family at the

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.450
end of each year.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.070
The Jackson's have one set of
twins who were born to Miss

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.460
Jackson one year-- because they
couldn't have been born

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.850
to Mr. Jackson-- who
are born to Miss

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.700
Jackson one year in July.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.170
During what year were
the twins born?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.020
Well let's see, this graph, you
see the years, each year

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.320
they say how many children
are in the family.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.850
So we can figure out how many
children are born in each year

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.220
just by figuring out how much
does the graph move up.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.450
For example, there were-- let
me say children born.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.020
And you could do this in your
head during the exam because

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.270
you have to do it really, really
fast. But I'll explain

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.510
it a little bit more basically
so that you can make

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.680
sure you get it.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.610
So in 1991 were any
children born?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.290
Well no, because they
had no children.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.970
In '92 they went from
having 0 children in

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.520
'91 to having 1 child.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.150
So the 1 child was born in
'92, and then how many

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.700
children were born in '93?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.240
Well they had 1 child in '92 and
they had 1 child in '93,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.870
so no children were
born in '93.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.750
I think you see what
I'm doing.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.210
I'm getting the difference
between one year and the next

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.240
because that's how
many children are

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.420
born in that year.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.510
From '93 to '94, we went from
1 to 2 children, so 1 child

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.470
was born that year.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.170
So there was 1 child born.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.630
Same thing in '95.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.830
The number of children
increased by 1.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.710
So there was 1 child born.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.180
'96, the number of children
stayed the same.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.260
No new children were born.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.220
We had 3 at the end of
'95, and we had 3

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.100
at the end of '96.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.500
So no new children were born.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.199
So that's a 0.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.986
And then in '97, we go from
having 3 children at the end

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.300
of '96 to having 5.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.640
So 2 children must have
been born that year.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.620
And then in '98, we had the
same number of children.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.950
And of course, they should have
said in the question, but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.780
we can assume that no children
died during the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.650
course of this problem.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.320
I don't want to be morbid.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.890
But anyway, so no children
were born in '98, so 0.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.850
So the question is, what year
were the twins born?

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.930
Well twins, that's 2 children,
if my biology is correct.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.500
So the year is 1997, which
is choice number D.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.600
I feel very bad having to erase
this beautiful drawing,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.695
but the things I do in the
name of education.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.780
Number 5-- no drawing
for Sal in number 5.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.860
The average arithmetic
mean of X and Y is 5.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.940
So average-- let me write mean
because if has fewer letters.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.610
They should have another math
term called nice I think.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.270
But the mean of x and
y is equal to 5.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.100
And what does that mean?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.540
That means that the average-- so
we also know that x plus y

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.750
over 2 is equal to 5-- I just
took the average of them.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.100
And the average of
x, y and z is 8.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.870
What is the value of z?

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.950
Fascinating.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:42.790
So we also know that the mean
of x, y and z is equal to 8.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.930
And then they want to
know what is z?

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.750
Well the mean of x, y and z is
equal to 8-- that's just if we

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.580
took the average of them.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:59.190
That's x plus y plus z
over 3 is equal to 8.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.500
This is the exact same
way of saying this.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.470
You can review the average
play-- I think it's in my

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.630
pre-algebra playlist
if you don't

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.210
remember how to take averages.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.570
But how do we solve for z here,
because we have three

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.850
variables and only two
equations, it seems very

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.850
complicated.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.600
But I'll show you a trick,
and this is actually a

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.750
very common SAT trick.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.360
So you take this first equation
and we can't solve

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.380
for x and we can't solve
for y, but we can

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.790
solve for x plus y.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.590
So we just multiply both sides
of that equation by 2 and we

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.350
get x plus y is equal to 10.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.640
x plus y is equal to 10.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.960
And then we can substitute
the whole x plus y here.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.050
This is something you seldom
see in your algebra classes

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.540
because you're always solving
for one variable for other.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.170
Now you can almost use x
plus y as a variable.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.610
Like the whole thing
is a variable.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.200
It's kind of strange,
but that's

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.550
how you do this problem.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.050
Algebra, there's nothing
fancy here.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.510
I'm saying x plus y is equal to
10, literally in English.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.600
So we could say well this
x plus y is equal to 10.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.540
So we could re-write this top
equation as 10 plus z over 3

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.460
is equal to 8.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.250
And then if we multiply both
sides by 3 you get 10 plus z

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.750
is equal to 24.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.600
And then you subtract 10 from
both sides and you get z is

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.170
equal to 14, and we are done.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.620
That wasn't too bad, was it?

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.130
Good, the choice exists,
choice B for number 5.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.050
All right, number 6.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.540
So I'm drawing for Sal.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.490
I like these, these are fun.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.740
Let me draw in magenta.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.930
That's the big figure.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.900
In the figure above-- I don't
know how to change my

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.150
background color.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.500
In the figure above,
a small square is

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.990
inside a larger square.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.080
What is the area in terms of
x of the shaded region?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.390
Well let me just work with what
I have. So they have a

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.040
smaller one here,
then a smaller.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.040
And then let me use
this thing.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.270
Create a shaded region.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.400
Let me create a shaded region.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.665
Look at that-- look at the
amazing tool I'm using.

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:40.005
It's called paint.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.580
So what was I doing.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.380
Oh, this is x.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.040
Oh, I'm using the same color.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.480
Let me use a vivid color.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.300
One side of this is x, one
side of this is x.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.420
And then the sides of the
big square are 5 and 5.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.490
And they just want to know, what
is the area in terms of x

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.990
of the shaded region?

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.700
Well the shaded region, that's
this brown area, the area of

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.490
that is going to be the area
of this entire square minus

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.590
the area of the smaller square,
right, because we took

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.390
this out of the shaded region.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.180
So the area of the big square--
well the area of a

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.500
square or a rectangle is just
the height times the width.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.570
So that's 5 times 5, so it's
25, minus the area of the

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.880
smaller square.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.140
And that's just going to be x
times x, which is x squared.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.580
That equals the area, and
that is choice E.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.070
All that drawing for such
an easy problem.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.860
I hope you don't find that I'm
being cocky when I call it an

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.750
easy problem.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.820
If you find it difficult,
it wasn't that easy, I

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.440
understand.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.650
Anyway, number 7.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.810
Let me erase my drawing.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.130
If rstv equals 1.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.380
Let me write that down.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.455
And stuv equals 0.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.970
Which of the following
must be true?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.980
Let me write these down.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.130
So they're saying choice
A-- I'm going to

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.150
write all the choices.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:31.650
Choice A, r is less than 1.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.960
Choice B is s is less than 1.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:44.260
Choice C is t is greater
than 1/2.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.790
Choice D, u is equal to 0.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:57.480
And choice E, v is equal to 0.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.500
So which of the following
must be true?

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.890
Well the first thing we know,
we know rstv is equal to 1.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.270
So we know that none of rst or
v can be 0, because if any of

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.180
them were 0 than when you
multiply them out, they

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.190
couldn't equal 0, right?

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:19.310
So rstv all must be
some non-0 number.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.000
So if we go back here, we know
that s is non-- and then if we

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.940
go into this equation we know
that one of them must be 0, at

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.880
least 1, because when you
multiply them you get 0.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.430
Because 0 times any
number is 0.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:38.630
So we know that s is not
0 because it's up here.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.990
Because we said all of these
numbers cannot be 0.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.250
We know t cannot be 0 because
it's up here.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.230
Because if it was 0, this
would have been 0.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.800
And we know v cannot be 0
because it's up here.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.080
And all we're left with is
that u is equal to 0.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.460
I'll see you in the
next video.
