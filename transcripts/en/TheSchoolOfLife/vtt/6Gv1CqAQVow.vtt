00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.040
We’re surrounded by some powerful ideas
about the sort of things that will make us

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.540
happy. We tend to think that really to deliver satisfaction,
the pleasures we should aim for need to be:

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.220
Rare – we’ve inherited a Romantic suspicion
of the ordinary (which is taken to be mediocre,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.911
dull and uninspiring) and work with a corresponding
assumption that things that are unique, hard

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.560
to find, exotic, or unfamiliar are naturally
fitted to delight us more. Then we want things to be expensive, we

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.760
like economic endorsement. If something is
cheap or free, it’s a little harder to appreciate;

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.079
the pineapple (for instance) dropped off a
lot of people’s wish list of fruit when

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.960
its price fell from exorbitant (they used
to cost the equivalent of hundreds of pounds)

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.660
to unremarkable. Caviar continues to sound
somehow more interesting than chicken eggs.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.499
Then we want things to be famous, in a fascinating experiment a celebrated
violinist once donned scruffy clothes and

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.850
busked at a street corner and was largely
ignored, though people would flock to the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.110
world’s great concert halls to hear just the same man play just the same pieces.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
Lastly we want things to be Large Scale, we are

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.300
mostly focused on big schemes, that we hope
will deliver enjoyment: marriage, career,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.360
travel, getting a new house. These approaches
aren’t entirely wrong, but unwittingly they

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.190
collectively exhibit a vicious and unhelpful
bias against the cheap, the easily available,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.360
the ordinary the familiar and the small-scale.
As a result: if someone says they’ve been

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.560
on a trip to Belize by private jet we automatically
assume they had a better time than someone

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.540
went to the local park by bike; we imagine
that visiting the Uffizi gallery in Florence

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.720
is always going to be nicer than reading a
paperback novel in the back garden. A restaurant

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.130
dinner at which Lobster Thermidor is served
sounds a good deal more impressive than a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.780
supper of a cheese sandwich at home; it feels
more normal that the highlight of a weekend

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.660
should be a hang-gliding lesson, rather than
a few minutes spent looking at the cloudy

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.350
sky; it feels odd to suggest that a modest
vase of lily of the valley (the cheapest bloom

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.880
at many florists) might yield more satisfaction
than a Van Gogh original. And yet the paradoxical

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.819
and cheering aspect of pleasure is how weird
and promiscuous it proves to be. It doesn’t

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.980
neatly collect in the most expensive boutiques.
It can refuse to stick with us on fancy holidays.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.260
It is remarkably vulnerable to emotional trouble,
sulks and casual bad moods. A fight that began

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.510
with a small disagreement about how to pronounce
a word can end up destroying every benefit

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.370
of a five star resort. A pleasure may look
very minor – eating a fig, having a bath,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.180
whispering in bed in the dark, talking to
a grandparent, or scanning through old photos

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.849
of when you were a child and yet these pleasures can be anything
but small: if properly grasped and elaborated upon,

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.709
these sort of activities may be among the
most moving and satisfying we can have. Appreciating

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.530
what is to hand isn’t a slacker’s solution.
It isn’t an attack on ambition. But there

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.910
is no point in chasing the future until and
unless we are better at being more attuned

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.599
to the modest moments and things that are
presently or readily available to us. More fundamentally,

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.819
the smallness of small pleasures isn’t really
an assessment of how much they have to offer

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.319
us: it is a reflection of how many good things
the world unfairly neglects. A small pleasure

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.050
is a great pleasure in-waiting; it is a great
pleasure which has not yet received the collective

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.840
acknowledgment it is due. Appreciating small
pleasures means trusting our own responses

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.030
a little more. We can’t wait for everything
that is lovely and charming to be approved

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.530
by others before we allow ourselves to be
enchanted. We need to follow the muted signals

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.770
of our own brains and allow that we are onto
something important, even though others may

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.050
not yet be in agreement.
