00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.300
Is this good? The position? 
More like this, right?

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.960
O, it was you who made that video? 
I see. Okay.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.140
Well, I think that mathematicians learn this stuff at some point.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.220
And I learned it at some point. 
And then you kind of forget.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.880
So you kind of put it in a box somewhere and you put it in a closet.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.620
And you classify it under stuff which you have already understood.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.060
But I think actually, we don't really fully understand what's happening here.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.440
Let me recall what we are talking about.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.840
One plus two and so on.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.040
And the question is: What is the answer?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.760
Well, at first of course you say: 
"There is no answer" or "The answer is infinity".

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.080
And we say that because this series is what we mathematicians call a divergent series.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.440
- It's blowing up
It's blowing up, You get larger and larger.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.260
So there is no sense of it getting closer to anything.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.540
- So traditionally, what do we do with a divergent series? We just ignore them.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.020
We just ignore them, we just throw them away.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.220
The question is whether this is the right approach?

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.500
Whether there is actually something we can say about such a series,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.740
which is meaningful. In other words. "Can we assign a value to this series which is meaningful?"

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.140
- Professor, is it not meaningful to say that is blows up and goes to infinity? Is that not meaningful?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.980
It is meaningful in the standard context of such a series.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.420
The way you can think about it is as follows.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.120
Think of this, okay -- so we have to resign to the fact that it is infinite somehow.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.160
But imagine this whole series as a huge lump.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160
What if there is a way...

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.360
What if there is sort of a nice scalpel, which will allows us

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360
to surgically remove infinity.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.540
Kind of a bad infinity out of it. 
And then keep kind of a finite part.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.960
Then we would say we will assign that finite part as the true answer to this infinite series.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.500
Now, we have to realise that that may not be possible for any divergent series.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.300
For example, you could do something like 1 + 2 + 3 + 55 + 47 + 6 + 7 + 8 + something else.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.020
You know, it's kind of like a random infinite series, which blows up.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.360
It will just blow up. There is no hope or expectation that there would be a way to assign a meaningful value to it.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.080
But this is a very special series, because you see

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680
it's very regular. Kind of like 1, 2, 3, 4...

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.740
We are actually taking the sum of all natural numbers, without any gaps,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.820
including each of them exactly once.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.760
And what's interesting is that those kind of sums pop up all the time.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.720
In many different branches of mathematics and quantum physics.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.040
Mathematicians have thought for a long time about trying to develop a theory

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.000
in which one could actually make sense of this.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.680
And nowadays we have such a theory.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.460
And within that theory we could often times say that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.520
it is meaningful to think of this sum,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.360
or more precisely, that sort of finite piece after you remove the infinite part,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.680
that sort of "a regularised" sum.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.140
Maybe we should make a distinction between sort of a "naive" sum where it just blows up to infinity and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.960
a kind of "regularised" sum, where this regularised sum actually turns out to be

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.500
minus one over twelve. 
- Oh no, -1/12?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.240
-1/12. So you see, it's very counter intuitive, because it's actually a negative number

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.760
and you are summing up positive numbers. So it is certainly not the result of summation of these numbers.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.900
It is something else, but what is it?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.780
So mathematicians have developed ways to come up with this -1/12.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.200
And actually the first person to talk about this,
was the great mathematician Leonhard Euler.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.400
He was born in Basel in Switzerland.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.460
But also spent a lot of time doing research in Russia, my home country.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.440
Leonhard Euler was a kind of mathematical outlaw. 
A kind of a mathematical gangster.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.489
He did things which were unlawful an
illegitimate.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.799
And in particular he allowed himself to
manipulate with infinite series like this.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.419
In other words he was trying to guess
what could be a possible way to assign a value.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.029
In the process of trying to assign
values to this series and other similar series

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:15.489
he actually came up with the right
answers which were justified later

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.450
by other mathematicians, for example Bernhard Riemann. But that was

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.310
a German mathematician. 
But that was like a hundred years later.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.460
So, it seems that Euler was way ahead of his time.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.540
- You can get to -1/12 in more than one way?

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.160
That's right, in more than one way. 
So Euler gets to minus one over twelve in a particular way.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.740
Riemann explained later; giving a rigorous theory using his zeta function.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.910
A theory which involved

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.500
things like complex numbers. Something which was not yet fully developed at the time of Euler.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.340
Although, a lot of this already existed,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.510
and Euler himself was considering complex numbers. But also there are other ways.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.160
We now know other possible ways of thinking of

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.250
how to isolate this finite part in this infinite series.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.600
Euler was motivated by some questions
and in the process, he not only studied such sums.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.310
Here's an example. What else he studied.
He also studied things like

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:16.500
one cube plus two cube plus three cube plus four cube.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.060
That seems to diverge even faster than this one, right?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.700
Because you're now taking the sum of cubes.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.850
You see, so again within this context

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.430
of divergent series, you just approach
this the way,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.510
you know, we approach it when we study, you know, first year calculus.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.460
Definitely this blows up. Definitely divergent.
This is infinite, the answer is infinity.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.730
Period. There's no way around it.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.300
But Euler allowed himself to do some manipulations with such series

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.150
and came up with a different answer, which was... I don't even know

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.170
exactly but I think it was 1 minus 1 over 120.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.560
I don't remember exactly I think
it was that that was the answer

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.180
You might ask why did they skip squares?

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.160
Actually you can do that as well, but the answer is even more surprising.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.600
You actually get zero, within that scheme and so on.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.860
So he was actually studying all possible integer powers.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.160
Powers by natural numbers like here.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.570
You know, you can think of this as one to the first power, two to the first

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.310
power, three to the first power and so on

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.400
Here these are the square, the cubes,  into the fourth powers and so on.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.040
And so the funny thing happens, that for all even values you actually get zeros,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.500
and for odd values you get some
rational numbers.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.520
- On the original videos everyone got really upset

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.300
and said you cannot do this divergent series.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.680
- Are you saying you can?

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.250
- And you're saying they broke the rules and then you say they didn't. What is the rules here?

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.080
Well the rules, it depends. Rules within
which context?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.100
Okay. So let me ask you, to illustrate what I mean by this.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:57.040
Let me ask a question. Does the square root of -1 exist?

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.700
Come on Brady. - Well, I know that we call it "i". We have these imaginary numbers.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:08.120
Right. But does it really exist? Does it exist?  Does it make sense to speak of the square root of -1?

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.110
One possible answer is that: Absolutely not! Right.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.230
Because if we think about real numbers we know that a square of any real numbers is positive.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.610
So the square root of a positive number
is well-defined.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.510
Square root of 0 is also well defined: zero.  But there's no square root of a negative number

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.320
So we can stop there and say: the square root of -1 doesn't exist.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.040
Anyone who uses square root of -1 is an outlaw.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.740
Right? Because that's not legitimate.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.510
This is some dirty tricks.
But actually we now understand...

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.070
And that's how people viewed it for a long time.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.140
But actually now we understand that there is a rich

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.180
and consistent theory which includes a
square root of -1.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.020
That is the theory of complex numbers.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.580
And this theory provides us with a much more interesting,

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.340
much richer contex, much more fruitful context

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.670
in which in fact we could solve a lot of
problems about real numbers.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.900
So in other words we have to go outside of the realm of real numbers

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:14.680
Often times to get the best, most optimal or sometimes the only possible solutions about real numbers.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.890
So it is in that sense that now no mathematician in their right mind would say the square root of -1 does not exist.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.290
Yes, it exists, in the sense that we can add it to the real numbers.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.040
We obtain a well-defined numerical system, which is called complex numbers,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.700
which is just as legitimate as the system of real numbers.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.380
- Are you saying that manipulating a divergent series is in the same category as that?

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.880
Well, I would say that's a good analogy.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.460
Because... It shows that sometimes in a different context in which you can discuss different things.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.920
So in the case of square root of -1 there's a context of real numbers,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.060
where square root of -1 surely doesn't exist.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.600
Or there's a context of complex numbers where it does exist.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.120
And it's actually very useful. 
And likewise here, there is also obvious context of,

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:05.709
you know, the rules of analysis, the rules of calculus, the rules of infinite series in which

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:09.529
none of these series are well-defined. 
And therefore all the manipulations we do

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:11.970
with such infinite series are not well defined.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.759
But then there is another context in which we replace

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.019
this series by their sort of regularised values and

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:22.420
I really like to think all these regularised values as sort of like,

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.410
you know, removing sort of like -- 
imagine, like a piece of gold

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.999
which is surrounded by this infinite
amount of dirt and you kind of

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:34.019
throw away this dirt and you're left
with this little piece of gold.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:38.800
So what I'm trying to say is that each
of these infinite series contains inside, it seems,

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.040
this little piece of gold. And then we can say well that little piece of gold is the value,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.800
is a true value of that infinite series.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.019
And on the rest of it, it is kind of useless and we can just throw it away.

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:52.419
If you say that, and there is a rigorous mathematical framework for doing that,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:59.340
then some of the manipulations, in fact all the manipulations that Euler did, become legitimate.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:05.310
Because what you're doing is you're kind of carrying with you those little valuable pieces

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.740
on each side of the formula as well as those infinite things and you, kind of,

00:10:09.749 --> 00:10:14.620
you can throw the infinite things away and then whatever relations you find between the infinite series

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.399
will also be the value relations between
those valuable pieces.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:22.519
- Professor it seems it's very... My understanding of mathematics is:

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.980
- It's very rigid and rigorous and it's never arbitrary.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.660
- How can you just throw away dirt and keep the gold? It doesn't seem...

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.840
That's right. Well, in a way, it's a great question because I think that

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.360
it's a misconception to think of mathematics as a sort of linear process,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.930
where we are only doing things which are legitimate, which are allowed.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.310
If we were doing that, we would never discover square root of -1.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.670
We would never even discover the square root of two.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.020
For a long time people did not believe that 
the square root of 2 actually was a legitimate number,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.459
because it cannot be expressed as a fraction.

00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:00.089
Right, that cannot be expressed by a fraction and for a long time people thought

00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:02.209
the only legitimate numbers were fractions.

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:05.290
Right, so actually, every once in a while,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.800
there are people like Leonhard Euler

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.139
likely Riemann and others who actually... Ramanujan is another example,

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.550
who kind of jumped into the abyss of the unknown,

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.720
and break the rules and try to...

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.279
to kind of push the veil over the unknown and try to understand more.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.569
And sometimes they are actually doing
something maybe illegitimate at the time.

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:31.040
Maybe they're ahead of their time. 
But one thing which is important in mathematics,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.980
is that we can never leave, sort of, these things as "loose ends".

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.120
We have to find a justification. 
So you're right mathematics is rigorous.

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:43.499
And at the end of the day, we are
looking for a rigorous justification,

00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:45.290
a rigorous explanation of everything.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.259
In other words we're not content with just saying that there's some magic over there.

00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:49.610
There is magic.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.530
But we always want to explain it and that's what has happened to some extent with these series.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.019
The work of Riemann gave us a tool to

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:03.279
analyze this, sort of, the golden
parts of these infinite series.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:10.160
But I still think that the last word on the subject has not been said, because we still don't fully understand.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.680
Because I don't fully understand

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.399
why every time such a series pops up in mathematics or in physics.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.240
We get the right result by replacing it by precisely that value or by this value for this one.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.680
In physics for example these kind of calculations are done all the time.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.940
And in fact maybe, it is the best kept secret maybe in physics and quantum physics

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:35.100
is that most of the calculations that physicists do today are like this.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.500
That the answer they get is infinite at the outset.

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:42.059
On the face of it, it looks infinite, but they find ways

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:45.079
to assign meaningful values to this
infinity, so to speak.

00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:49.369
And they... and that is really..
I think it's a good analogy

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:52.999
to think about it is, kind of like surgically removing

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:56.189
some kind of infinite part which is redundant

00:12:56.189 --> 00:13:01.050
and superfluous and throwing it away and replacing the answer with this...

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.980
What you might find a remainder.  
And the interesting thing is that in physics...

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.410
Physicists are still kind of waiting for their own Riemann to come

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:14.930
and sort of... to justify these calculations but they've been incredibly successful in getting results

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.060
which they can then test experimentally.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.820
And some of this has been tested with an astonishing degree of accuracy.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.920
- Is there a sum is assigning the value  the same as the sum? Is that where things have gone wrong?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.629
- Or where things have become confused? 
I would say it's a it's not exactly the sum because

00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:36.980
...the exact sum is, you see, you
know it blows up it is infinite.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.619
It is a kind of regularised sum.
But I am surprised for example

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.309
why is it that every time we encounter such a sum

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:49.869
in mathematics, and there's so many
places where we do that,

00:13:49.869 --> 00:13:52.709
where we do encounter these kind of sums.

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:57.109
Every time we encounter these sums we always have this sort of reactions like

00:13:57.109 --> 00:14:00.700
Oh, we should replace it by -1/12.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:05.640
And every time we do that, we get the right answer and then maybe later on

00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:08.169
mathematicians find an alternative way.

00:14:08.169 --> 00:14:12.080
You know, because in mathematics you can often... you know, there are different approaches.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.450
There are different solutions. You have a problem but you can solve it in many different ways.

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:20.399
So that's an indication I think that if we come up with such an infinite sum...

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:22.839
It's an indication that maybe we're doing something not quite right.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.140
We' re kind of applying maybe kind of a naive approach.

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:30.759
But interestingly, every time it happens

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:33.949
if we replace it by that -1/12 we get the right result and then

00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:38.639
later on we can justify and choose a different route and have a different explanation.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:42.089
So what does it mean? 
Does it mean that in some sense it is.

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:46.920
There is a context in which this sum, this infinite sum, is mysteriously -1/12.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.320
I'm not sure. It's clearly, there is something in there which we still don't fully understand.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.600
For now, our understanding is that -1/12 is a sort of golden part.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.170
It is this sort of finite part in this infinite lump

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.540
which you get by throwing away some infinite dirt.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:07.020
I'm gonna give you an astounding result. - Astounding? 
An astounding result.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.840
So I was going to write down a little sum. 
I'm just going to see what answer it gives.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.820
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ......
