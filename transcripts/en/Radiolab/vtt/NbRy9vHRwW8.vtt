N y. S. T. E. N n.

12
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:46.380
P. R. Hello. We're going to start this show today.

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.490
Hey Mary with Mary Roach. Hey Tim here. Hi Tim. Hey,

14
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.900
let me see if I can.

15
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.800
Mary is one of our favorite authors mostly past cause she kinda writes about

16
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:59.320
stuff that's specific, yucky gross. I'm the kind of person who, if I'm,

17
00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:02.790
I'm I find myself in an operating room for whatever I'm reporting on in that

18
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:06.870
kind of a person where they, there'll be like Ms. Roach, you need to step back.

19
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:11.640
Your head is actually inside the body of family and a for her latest book called

20
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.650
Gulp. She got really, really into and inside cows. Yeah.

21
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.940
The fist related cows that the agricultural schools have and what's a Fistula

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.510
Fistula is a irregular anatomical passageway and officiated cow in this case has

23
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:32.130
a whole opening right in its size so that you can actually stick your hand into

24
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.630
its side and reach all the way down to the stomach. This is the living cow,

25
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:40.950
right? It's a moving live cow. And you've done this. Yeah, it was um,

26
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.890
it was this amazing, uh, because really the, you know,

27
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:47.100
a cow is about [inaudible] at the University of California Davis. You're just,

28
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.380
you're standing there and sort of normally, and I,

29
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:53.260
and for some reason I've worn a skirt and kitten heels and I'm,

30
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.020
my hosts are wearing manure in crusted muck boots and there is a source of great

31
00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.700
entertainment that I'm here

32
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.400
and it's packed really tightly. You had to really work your arm.

33
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.760
The Guy I was with Ed to Peters and he's like, no, keep going, keep going.

34
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.050
I'm like, I don't know. And I'm not sure really go further in or, yeah,

35
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:17.520
keep going, keep going. And I'm literally up to my shoulder inside this cow.

36
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.390
I still want to do that. Where are you guys? We're in New York. Yeah,

37
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:25.600
I know where there's one out there. I can get you a fist deflated cat.

38
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.930
Walk them down towards the barn and I'll go get the group. All right. Yeah.

39
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.410
I didn't actually get to do it unfortunately, but we sent our producer,

40
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:36.411
Tim Howard and Tim out to Rutgers university and closure where a bunch of high

41
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:41.520
schoolers had come to see how lily, lily, lily the fist elated cow.

42
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.040
Okay, let's give it a go. I'm gonna pop the court. Did he say Cork?

43
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:50.400
Yeah. You have to uncork the whole on the couch. All the steam coming out.

44
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.110
Ready. All right.

45
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.040
This is a Tim reaching his hand in for straight across the top to the far side.

46
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.560
Okay. Oh my God.

47
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.080
Powerful in there. Yeah. Oh God. I mean,

48
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:06.190
I was a little worried it was going to break my hand. [inaudible] pressure.

49
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.460
Yeah. It's a very muscular organism, squeezing my arms,

50
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.800
mixing and I can feel the side of the stomach pushing against squeezing and

51
00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:19.840
contracting and squeezing, cruelly squeezing it.

52
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.590
It's groping you back

53
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.900
<v 3>stuck. I'm just going to try to go a little bit,</v>

54
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.720
little bit deeper and it's hot. It's steamed. It's bubbly and physical.

55
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:33.710
It's very, Huh.

56
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.980
She is so calm right now. I can't believe it.

57
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 1>The cows board,</v>

58
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.330
and I've got this look on my face like I've seen God or something.

59
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.190
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

60
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.270
<v 1>Mary says that for all her times in morgues and in all the places she's been,</v>

61
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.690
this one, this one was was was really different.

62
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.370
It was the expression I was wearing. I'm sure I've never had cause to use

63
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.230
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

64
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.063
<v 1>and here's why.</v>

65
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.050
If you think about the stomach is a center of magical transformation.

66
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.800
That is Fred Kaufman who wrote a whole book about the stomach.

67
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.470
You take something outside of your body,

68
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.440
you put it in your body and it turns into you.

69
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.470
So it's like this conduit between what's outside you and what's inside.

70
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.880
The other thing that's weird is that the human body is a Taurus. We're donuts.

71
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.870
We've got a whole going through the middle of us all the way through us. So,

72
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.130
which seems to be inside us with seems to be inside our stomach actually is

73
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:38.160
always outside of us.

74
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:39.703
<v 4>Whoa.</v>

75
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.410
<v 1>Oh this is getting so deep. You don't like the dark? No, I,</v>

76
00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:47.050
I mean it's crazy. I can go. I'll,

77
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.870
I'll know cause I was thinking we could start that way cause that's what we're

78
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:50.740
kind of doing this out.

79
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:54.010
We're going to take this thing that's deep inside us and turn it inside out.

80
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.760
Yeah. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich.

81
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.790
This is Radiolab and today guts that mystery them lies between our mouth and our

82
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.033
butt.

83
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.440
We are these sacks of guts when we won any skeletons and we walk around and we

84
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:14.670
never even see them. We don't.

85
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:18.360
And for centuries nobody really knew what's going on in there.

86
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.840
But then something happened that uh, opened up a window. Yeah.

87
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.450
Do you want to start here? What I heard at the beginning of it? Yeah. Let's,

88
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:29.380
once upon a time it, okay. So once upon a time it all begins and witnesses,

89
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.260
they first met in 1822.

90
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.460
Once upon a time in 1822 there was a guy named William Beaumont.

91
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.670
William Beaumont is a farm boy from Lebanon, Connecticut, uh,

92
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.200
five brothers and six sisters, and William clearly is the smart one.

93
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.920
He was the one one with big dreams. So at an early age,

94
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:50.830
you leaves home and gets himself a job as a doctor,

95
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.520
an army doctor up north at Fort Mackinac, which is this,

96
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.060
it's a trading post, basically [inaudible].

97
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.680
He has a little doctor's office at the top of this hill and at the bottom

98
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.180
there's a general store for a, for traders who would come in from Canada.

99
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.780
Super Hardy. Dude's like, it's cold up there,

100
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.040
and they're going out in canoes and they're running with these huge packages of

101
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.720
furs on their backs and big beards. Sure. Yankees, that was all just set up.

102
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:22.430
Here's the actual story. One day, June 6th, 1822 normal morning,

103
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.300
all the fur traders come in and are unloading and loading and getting their

104
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:31.040
coffee, salted meat supplies to go out trips and for when all of a sudden

105
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.800
right outside the shop, somebody's gun went off. Somebody calls Beaumont,

106
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.340
Beaumont, dashes out the door, runs down the hill, finds this guy,

107
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.740
this 18 year old kid, really in bad shape.

108
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.563
<v 6>Woo.</v>

109
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.240
<v 1>The kids lying on the ground. He's a big guy, muscular,</v>

110
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.750
but he's covered in blood and he has eight hole right below his rib cage,

111
00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:57.990
about the size of the palm of a grown man's hand. Nobody was sure what happened,

112
00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:02.070
but someone's gun had gone off by accident and shot this boy point blank.

113
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.020
His lungs are dripping out. There's blood. This is what Beaumont sees,

114
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.740
but this is what's going on. Seeds. And the other thing Beaumont sees is food

115
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.360
coming out of his stomach. Meat and bread and coffee. Yeah.

116
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.450
These are the remnants of his breakfast spilled out on the ground right in front

117
00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:20.640
of.

118
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.910
You can kind of see the gears turning in Beaumont's head as if he's thinking,

119
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.410
whoa, there it is. Digestion. Inaction,

120
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.230
which was kind of disgusting,

121
00:07:31.231 --> 00:07:36.231
but it was also something of a revelation because in 1822 the stomach was an

122
00:07:36.301 --> 00:07:38.790
area of mystery. Just like today,

123
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:42.540
we're aware of the brain is an area of mystery and for centuries people believed

124
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:46.350
that the stomach more broadly, the gut was in a very real way,

125
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:49.350
the center of our beans. Yes, in Puritan Times,

126
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:52.380
the bowels are the seat of human sympathy. You know,

127
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.590
like where our deepest feelings come from. If you have bowels for somebody,

128
00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:58.470
that means you sympathize with that. It that something people will say,

129
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.280
absolutely no, we should bring that, turn it back. Yeah, I have bowels.

130
00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:06.390
For you point is medical science was pretty fuzzy on what happens down there.

131
00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:09.330
I mean, they knew it was important, but they had no idea how it worked.

132
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.140
Like how does food become us?

133
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.630
Nobody understood it because they can't see,

134
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.620
you can't directly observe it without opening the person up.

135
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.410
But here was a guy open right up.

136
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.660
But of course go on is a doctor. So he's like, wait, I've got to save this guy.

137
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:29.310
So he start sewing him up frantically.

138
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.710
Pretty sure this fellow's not gonna make it.

139
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.580
And he was surprised that two days later the guy was alive. Really surprised.

140
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.660
And as the months passed, this kid, St Martin, that was his name,

141
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.760
Alexis Saint Martin, he gets better.

142
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.960
But a year later he still has his hole in his stomach. The hole never closes.

143
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.740
What happened is he grew a fistula. No,

144
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.460
just like the cow we talked about earlier,

145
00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:56.940
except in this case he didn't have a cork where he was wounded.

146
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.730
He had a flap of skin covering the whole, if you want to use,

147
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.710
pull back the flap and look inside.

148
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.410
And we don't know if Beaumont left it that way on purpose.

149
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.510
What we do know is that he sees an opportunity to make the body give up its

150
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:12.510
secrets. He sees he's got something that nobody else has.

151
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:17.190
Maybe he even thinks this man could be my ticket out of being a lowly,

152
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:18.930
a Fort Mackinac doctor.

153
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.740
So Beaumont kind of hires him as a man around his house as a man servant,

154
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.440
you know, he said, all right, it was a charitable thing. I wanted to help him,

155
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.690
you know, cause he couldn't work. And I'm thinking, oh, maybe, maybe not.

156
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.120
And so about a year later, he starts,

157
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.710
he starts his experiments. Oh my Lord. This is straight out of movie.

158
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.111
While reporting this story,

159
00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:45.680
we ended up visiting the rare book room at the New York Academy of Medicine,

160
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.190
which is pretty much the coolest room ever. It's all Mahogany.

161
00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:52.040
And they've got an ancient skull sitting on top of bookshelves,

162
00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:54.800
and the books are hundreds and hundreds of years old. In any case,

163
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.480
the librarian, Arlene Shaner,

164
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.750
showed us around and then put on some white gloves,

165
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:04.310
disappeared between some stacks and came out with a little purple book.

166
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.680
Beaumont's observations.

167
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.330
Experiment one is on August 1st,

168
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.330
1825 so at 12 o'clock I introduced through the perforation into the stomach,

169
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.840
the following articles of diets. So what he does is he,

170
00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:24.050
he takes different foods, a piece of raw salted fat pork,

171
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.780
some corn beef, you know, like a one inch square of corn beef,

172
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:28.250
a piece of stale bread,

173
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.020
and he attaches them to a silk string and he inserts them through the artificial

174
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.080
opening into the stomach, into the stomach for an hour.

175
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.320
Then he takes it out like a fishermen. Yeah, yeah. He's fishing,

176
00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:42.710
he's doing stomach fishing and he takes it out and he records, you know,

177
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.160
so it was an hour later how much, uh, was digested,

178
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.380
withdrew and examined them, found the cabbage and bred about half the Justin,

179
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.440
the pieces of meat on this went on for hours,

180
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.500
turned to them into the stomach at 2:00 PM withdrew them again and hours we

181
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.790
turned them into the stomach. Gan for years. Over the next few years,

182
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.210
Beaumont puts anything he can possibly think of into that stomach. Pigs,

183
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.780
feet south, take an hour. Animals, brains spoiled.

184
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:14.720
Take an hour and 45 minutes. Fresh eggs, hard boiled.

185
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:19.400
Take three hours and 30 minutes. Soft boiled, take three hours. Fresh eggs,

186
00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:23.030
fried, take three hours and 30 minute fresh eggs roasted.

187
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.400
Take two hours and 15 minutes. Look,

188
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:28.730
it's just the totality of food in America at that point.

189
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:30.680
Whipped eggs take an hour and a half.

190
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.240
He's trying everything baked custard and takes two hours and 45 minutes. God,

191
00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:36.560
that goes on for pages.

192
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.330
Alexis St Martin is becoming increasingly irritable about this whole process,

193
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.410
I would imagine.

194
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.410
Because a lot of the times the things that Beaumont went sticking to his stomach

195
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.940
would make him sick, give him a fever, pain in his head, depressed, pulse,

196
00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:52.640
dry skin, coated tongue and numerous.

197
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:55.450
So in 1825 three years after the cell started,

198
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.130
St Martin finally bolts goes back to Canada, gets married,

199
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:01.300
even has a few kids.

200
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.690
All the while Beaumont is writing him letters trying to lure him back and he was

201
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:11.170
offering him, okay, I'll pay for your family. Okay, I'll give you $50 a year.

202
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:11.950
Okay, I'll give you,

203
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.060
I'll give you 75 I mean we kept and names like I'll throw in the land cause you

204
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:18.850
know, he's still wanting to know like, all right, fine,

205
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:23.710
it takes three hours and 15 minutes to digest a carrot oyster soup.

206
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:26.530
Three and a half hours or soup, whatever. But how does it work?

207
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:30.160
How does the stomach do it? And eventually because he needs the money.

208
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.050
Alexis St Martin does come back.

209
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.310
Beaumont starts his experiments again in one night while Beaumont is peering

210
00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:37.240
into the boys' stomach.

211
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.970
<v 7>He gets his answer.</v>

212
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:43.830
He says he applies a few crumbs of bread to the inner surface of the stomach.

213
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.690
Immediately afterwards, small, sharp papillary became visible.

214
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.070
He saw little pimples form on the wall of the stomach and out of the pimples.

215
00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.960
Zuta a clear, transparent liquor out some juice out. Squirt some juice.

216
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:01.470
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

217
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.540
<v 7>that was it. That's the magic juice. Clear. Almost transparent.</v>

218
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.890
Tasted a little salt dish and acid [inaudible] to the tongue.

219
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.260
<v 1>Yeah. Tasting.</v>

220
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.500
Lot of tasting went on and then he would collect the stomach acid and see if you

221
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:21.190
could digest outside the body because there was this theory that the body had

222
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.090
this vital force and that that was necessary for the bodily processes,

223
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:28.780
including digestion. So if you took the stomach acid out, what would happen?

224
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.690
<v 7>December 14th,</v>

225
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.500
1829 and 1:00 PM I took one and a half ounces of gastric juice fresh from the

226
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:38.430
stomach, put into it. 12 grams recently salted beef boiled.

227
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.120
<v 1>The theory at the time was, oh, it wouldn't work.</v>

228
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:43.300
You had to have the magical powers of the human body,

229
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.300
but digestion commenced

230
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:49.650
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

231
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.230
<v 1>in Beaumont, one of his big discoveries was, no, you don't actually,</v>

232
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:57.010
there are no secret forces of sympathy and excitement driving things.

233
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.970
It's a chemical. That's what it's all about. Now,

234
00:14:01.971 --> 00:14:04.250
Beaumont didn't know it, but that juice he was seeing,

235
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.200
which he called gastric juice,

236
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.740
those are enzymes and what enzymes are are like little chemical scissors.

237
00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:13.820
They break down food so that you can take something in from the outside like

238
00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:17.390
this carrot and absorb. It

239
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.490
comes literally a part of you. The key to the whole thing.

240
00:14:22.491 --> 00:14:26.390
The key to life are enzymes. In a way.

241
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.010
They are the magical force, Justin chemical form. That's it. That's the truth.

242
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.140
He was the first to understand it, the first to see it,

243
00:14:33.141 --> 00:14:35.960
the first to figure out the method of how to prove it and he proved it.

244
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:41.530
So Beaumont writes a book about this and this book is published in 1833 and he

245
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.900
becomes famous.

246
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.200
People were fascinated by Beaumont's experiments.

247
00:14:48.201 --> 00:14:52.430
He would kind of go on these tours. He's a called over to Yale University,

248
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:55.190
gets invited to speak in Europe with his, you know, wherever he goes.

249
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:58.490
He brings his gastric juice and he lets him there on the dude's stomach. Yeah,

250
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.160
yeah. He travels around with it and whenever he could,

251
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:04.780
he would take Saint Martin with them. St Martin was his PowerPoint, you know,

252
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.380
he's like, I need you man.

253
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:09.290
I need you on the stage so everybody else can come up and stick their tongue in

254
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:13.160
your stuff. For William Beaumont, this works out pretty great.

255
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.480
He's thought of as this, you know,

256
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.350
tremendous contributor to the understanding of digestion.

257
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.230
As for Alexis, St Martin, he was a curiosity

258
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:23.210
<v 9>[inaudible].</v>

259
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.140
<v 1>He was a medical curiosity for the rest of his life. The day he dies,</v>

260
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.880
even in death, his body is a hot commodity and his family was very aware of this

261
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.650
<v 9>[inaudible].</v>

262
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.650
<v 1>They let his body rot in the sun for three days and then buried him very deeply</v>

263
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.810
and put big rocks over him so he would not be exhumed.

264
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.220
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

265
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.600
<v 1>thanks to Arlene Shaner at the New York Academy of Medicine, and Fred Kaufman,</v>

266
00:16:03.601 --> 00:16:06.540
who wrote a book called a short history of the American stomach,

267
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.910
and a special thanks to Mary Roach, her forthcoming book is called, got it.

268
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.480
Tripped down the elementary canal.

269
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:15.060
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
