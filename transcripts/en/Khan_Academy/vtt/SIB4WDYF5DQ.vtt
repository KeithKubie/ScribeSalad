00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.500
What I want to go
over in this video

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.029
is a special case
of L'Hopital's Rule.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.031
And it's a more
constrained version

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:11.780
of the general case
we've been looking at.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.930
But it's still very powerful
and very applicable.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.060
And the reason why we're going
to go over this special case

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.180
is because its proof is
fairly straightforward

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.100
and will give you an intuition
for why L'Hopital's Rule works

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.100
at all.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.070
So the special case
of L'Hopital's Rule

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.510
is a situation where
f of a is equal to 0.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.520
f prime of a exists.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.780
g of a is equal to 0.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.890
g prime of a exists.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.600
If these constraints
are met, then the limit,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:59.810
as x approaches a of
f of x over g of x,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:10.150
is going to be equal to f
prime of a over g prime of a.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.870
So it's very similar
to the general case.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.330
It's little bit
more constrained.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.021
We're assuming that
f prime of a exists.

00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:16.520
We're not just
taking the limit now.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.740
We're assuming f prime of a and
g prime of a actually exist.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.490
But notice if we substitute
a right over here we get 0/0.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.940
But that if the
derivatives exist

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.390
we could just evaluate
the derivatives at a,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.500
and then we get the limit.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.480
So this is very close
to the general case

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.140
of L'Hopital's Rule.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.200
Now let's actually prove it.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.210
And to prove it, we're going
to start with the right hand

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.950
and then show that if we use
the definition of derivatives,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.390
we get the left hand
right over here.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.810
So let me do that.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.280
So I'll do it right over here.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.830
So f prime of a
is equal to what,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.660
by the definition
of derivatives?

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.550
Well, we could view
that as the limit

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:05.440
as x approaches a of f of x
minus f of a over x minus a.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.300
So this is literally just
a slope between two points.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.940
So like, if you have your
function f of x like this,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.500
this is the point a, f
of a right over here.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.000
This right over here
is the point x, f of x.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.600
This expression
right over here is

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300
the slope between
these two points.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.050
The change in our y value
is f of x minus f of a.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.970
The change in our f
value is x minus a.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.860
So this expression is just
the slope of this line.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.000
And we're just taking
the-- let me actually

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.470
do that in a different
color-- the line that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.475
connects these two points,
that's the slope of it.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.060
I'll do that in white.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.400
The slope of the line that
connects those two points.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.130
And we're taking
the limit as x gets

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.547
closer and closer
and closer to a.

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:52.129
So this is just
another way of writing

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.540
the definition of
the derivative.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.640
So that's fine.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.370
Let's do the same
thing for g prime of a.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.410
So f prime of a
over g prime of a,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.480
is going to be this
business which is in orange,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.950
f prime of a over g prime of a.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.400
Which we can write as
the limit as x approaches

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.944
a of g of x minus g
of a over x minus a.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.860
Well, in the numerator,
we're taking the limit

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.300
as x approaches a, and
in the denominator,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.230
we're taking the limit
as x approaches a.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.820
So we can just rewrite this.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.880
This we can rewrite as
the limit as x approaches

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.600
a of all this
business in orange.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.990
f of x minus f of
a, over x minus a,

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.600
over all the business in green.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.375
g of x minus g of a, all
of that over x minus a.

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:47.170
Now, to simplify this, we
can multiply the numerator

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.960
and the denominator by x minus
a to get rid of these x minus

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.460
a's.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.260
So let's do that.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.980
Let's multiply by x
minus a over x minus a.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.740
So the numerator, x minus a,
and we're dividing by x minus a.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.970
Those cancel out.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.650
And then these two cancel out.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.430
And we're left with this thing
over here is equal to the limit

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.530
as x approaches a
of, in the numerator

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.610
we have f of x minus f of a.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.970
And in the denominator, we
have g of x minus g of a.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.630
And I think you see
where this is going.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.330
What is f(a) equal to?

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.480
Well, we assumed f
of a is equal to 0.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.580
That's why we're
using L'Hopital's Rule

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.030
from the get go. f of a is equal
to 0, g of a is equal to 0.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.170
f of a is equal to 0.
g of a is equal to 0.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.340
And this simplifies to the
limit as x approaches a of f

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.290
prime of x, sorry of f of
x, we've got to be careful.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.720
Of f of x over g of x.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.390
So we just showed that if f of
a equals 0, g of a equals 0,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.405
and these two derivatives exist,
then the derivatives evaluated

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:03.420
at a over each other are
going to be equal to the limit

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.450
as x approaches a of
f of x over g of x.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.973
Or the limit as x
approaches a of f

00:05:08.973 --> 00:05:12.570
of x over g of x is going to
be equal to f prime of a over g

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.130
prime of a.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.480
So fairly straightforward
proof for the special case--

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.860
the special case, not
the more general case--

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.310
of L'Hopital's Rule.
