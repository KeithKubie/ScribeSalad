00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.560
Hello, and welcome to
GDL-IL, GDL Israel.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.050
Today we're going to speak
about Compute Engine.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.390
And I'll try to show you how
easy it is to start a new

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.990
instance of your own virtual
machine on Google

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.270
infrastructure.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.550
And since in most of the cases,
we're talking here in

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.350
Google Developer Live Israel
about entrepreneurship,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.820
start-ups, and front
end development.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.210
I'll try to show you how you
could quickly create a micro

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.800
instance, install Apache on it
and from there you could take

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.920
it and do some clever,
amazing things.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.610
Of course, you could take these
same exact steps and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.420
install any other piece of
software that you would like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.460
to install on a new
virtual Linux box.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.580
It could be node.js.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.190
It could be [? nyc.js. ?]

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.980
It could be lots of
other things.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.165
So let's jump and see.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.210
I'll show my screen.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.770
And as you can see here, if you
go to cloud.google.com,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.800
you'll have quite a lot of
different products that today

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.730
we are supporting.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.020
Right now, in this episode,
so we're going to focus on

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.420
Compute Engine.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.880
However, if you want platform
as a service, and you are

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.640
developing your service site in
Java, iPhone, [? GO, ?] or

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.110
PHP, App Engine might be an even
more suitable solution.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.170
Definitely if you're doing
something nice in terms of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.050
your ATI, so Cloud Endpoint
could be a

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.280
great product for that.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.000
Or you just want to build some
web service and support it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.520
from App Engine.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.300
With App Engine, you're
basically running in a certain

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.720
container that Google is
maintaining, scaling, and

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.520
taking care of all the quote,
unquote, "redundant" jobs that

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.759
you don't want to do as your
own system administrator.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.960
You want to focus on what you're
good at, and write your

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.780
amazing software.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.320
Other things that we have--
we'll try to touch them in the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.430
next few weeks-- will be cloud
storage and Cloud SQL.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.360
And, of course, BigQuery, the
ability to run clever queries

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.960
on billions of rows and
get the results in

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.880
less than a few seconds.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.090
So as we said, Compute Engine
basically lets you run Linux

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.260
virtual machines, and talking
to them, and do whatever you

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.070
want with those machines.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.240
Let's see how I could do it.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.600
If you'll go to Google Cloud
Console like I have here,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.580
probably you won't have
too many projects

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.210
like I do here but.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.980
But in this case, you're
just clicking

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.360
on Create New Project.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.340
And I did it already just to
save time, and you'll get all

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.510
the different options of what
you want to do in this

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.020
specific project.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.210
Now in our case, we choose
the Compute Engine.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.560
And, of course, we need
to enable billing.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.690
In App Engine, you have the
ability to run up to 12

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.800
projects without any billing.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.860
So if you want just to test
things inside App Engine, just

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.440
choose this far now.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.230
If you want to try Compute
Engine, you will need to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.870
enable billing.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.180
Lucky for us and to save time,
I already prepared a project

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.110
with billing enabled.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.520
And if we'll go into it, you
could see here that you have

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.060
several things that
you could do with.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.290
One, I already created a box.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.500
And I created a micro version
of it because we don't need

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.670
too much if you want just
to run one, let's say,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.380
development server, and testings
up in the cloud.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.710
If you click on this line,
you'll get quite a lot of

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.450
different things that
are attaching to

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.130
this specific box.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.580
And, for us, maybe what's
important here is the zone.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.330
So it could be in the United
States or in Europe and, in

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.250
our case, in Israel,
I choose Europe.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.620
The external IP so we could
reach this machine, and of

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.450
course, some other parameters,
like the disk and the network.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.200
Down here at the bottom, you
have the ability to see how

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.730
you want to communicate
with the specific box.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.470
In our case, we choose SSH, and
to work with SSH, we have

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.780
this nice GC SQL tool, that
after you install it--

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.120
and it's quite easy.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.120
Four steps, four clicks and
you're installing it--

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.660
you run this specific
command in order to

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.080
connect to your box.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.460
Now as I said, I already
attached to this box.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.770
Now let's see just
that I share the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.710
right screen with you.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.700
Let's cancel this screen share,
and I'll try to share

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.360
my desktop so you'll be able to
see everything that I do.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.305
Let's close this one, and here
we already connected basically

00:05:14.305 --> 00:05:15.870
to our box.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.680
And as you can see here, I first
just want to show all

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.600
the different packages
that I have.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.920
I have 230, so it's
not too much.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.150
All the essential packages that
you will want to see when

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.460
you start to do things.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.250
And here you could get, of
course, a more thorough look

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.710
of all the different packages
that you have.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.805
And as you can see up here, what
I previously did already

00:05:45.805 --> 00:05:50.580
is, I just run this one command
of Sudo, App Get,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.280
Install Apache 2.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.490
And now in our case, of course,
it's already there so

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.070
it's letting me know
that it's there.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.260
But if it wasn't, was just
downloading and installing it

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.870
for me, now that I have it, I
could go, of course, to this

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.250
location of var.dub.dub.dub.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:15.290
And here I just want to
see what files I have.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.320
I have, of course, a different
index HTML file that Apache is

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.460
bringing to me.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.840
And to make things a bit
nicer, I also put

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.560
that To Do List app.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.900
Of course, they have all of
the MV-Star frameworks.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.800
And with a little twist of using
a leverage IndexDB so

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.810
everything will be the same
for us locally as well.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.360
And if I'm going to now to,
let's take here, my instance.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.900
And in the instance I could
see the external IP.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.280
Right now I don't have any
DNS settings for it.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.590
I'll just go here, put it.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.000
And, of course, we're getting
the first Hello World of

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.230
Apache, but if I'll just go
here and try to go to the

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.040
special demo that I prepared.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.540
So you can see here that
we have all the nice

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.500
capabilities here.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.780
And, of course, if I'm
refreshing everything, it's

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.250
still working and I could delete
stuff, and it's a quite

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.660
nice application.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.750
If I want to change it or to
change anything, let's see how

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.140
this works.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.350
Of course, I'm just coming here,
and entering the file.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.103
Hello all.

00:07:39.103 --> 00:07:44.150
Should be L, I, L. Yours.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.570
Thank you for watching.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.760
After I saved it, and
I'm refreshing--

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.770
you could see here that I'm
having a full control.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.650
One thing that you want to
remember is that when you go

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.700
in here, you have the ability
and you should go to network

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.350
and basically make sure, if
you want to have certain

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.640
settings to your own network,
you have full control of it,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.180
if you want to take a snapshot
and save the data and the

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.630
state this specific instance,
you could create a new

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.240
snapshot, and it would basically
allow you to save

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.490
all the data that you
right now have in

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.450
this specific machine.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.560
And then replicate it and create
new machines out of

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.980
this instance.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.150
Another nice thing to note is,
when you're coming to this

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.150
console and on network, you
could go to the default.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.240
And here you have fewer
firewalls that you

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.030
might want to set.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.710
Of course, internal IPs
we are allowing.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.580
And then if you need the SSH
like we did here, of course,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.210
it's open by default.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.700
And then what you want to do in
this case is just to enable

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.360
the web server firewall.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.820
Because if you want to allow it
to access on TCP and heed

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.360
the server, you won't be able
to reach these pages.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:17.130
Let's just for fun try to
delete this firewall.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:22.030
And as you can see here,
it's now deleting it.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:30.600
And if I'm refreshing and I want
to check it again, I see

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.470
now that I don't have it here.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.640
And now if I try to reach our
Hello World page, you could

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.220
see that I can't do that.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:44.000
So very important to remember
to basically create a new

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.010
instance and to give it-- if
you'll try to put [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.440
it will let you know
that we're only

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.770
getting things like this.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.240
So in our case, I'll do TCP.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.380
And, of course, the name
will be Web Server.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.900
And I'll create it.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.790
You could see how quickly,
basically, it's creating

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.450
everything for you.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.990
And once this is done, I'm
coming again here and hitting

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.510
it, and everything is
back to normal.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:18.180
So I think we pretty much
covered the main things.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.430
As you saw, it's quite easy to
establish a new instance, run

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.490
with it, have new packages
and models that will

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.060
make you more efficient.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.270
And from that on, you have all
the nice abilities of taking

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:39.780
snapshots, controlling images,
and having all the metadata

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.060
and operations of what you do.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.190
You could choose quite a lot
of different images.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.780
I chose Debian but there's lots
of [INAUDIBLE] as well.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.100
And two other things that you
might want to check are, as I

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.990
mentioned, you're hitting
cloud.google.com, but you have

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.010
two other locations if you
could work and check what

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.790
you're doing.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.820
One will be called [INAUDIBLE]
google.com APIs.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.570
And here you could basically see
what you're doing on each

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.690
and every project and what
APIs you're using or

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.375
allowing for it.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:20.080
The other location is the App
Engine dashboard, so it would

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.330
be on AppEngine.google.com.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.280
And here you could see all your
projects and, of course,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.550
in our case, see exactly
what's going on

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.400
on the server itself.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.680
So I think we covered most of
the things that we wanted, and

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.950
I think next time.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.200
Thank you very much.
