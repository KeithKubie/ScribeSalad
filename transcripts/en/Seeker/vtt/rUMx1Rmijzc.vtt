00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.720
The electrons shuffling around inside our
computers move pretty fast, theoretically

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.730
their top speed in silicon is up to 100,000
meters per second.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.510
Which is good because the faster they can
move, the faster chips can do calculations,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.980
the faster I can refresh twitter.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.890
But there will always be something faster.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.890
Light.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.669
Why don’t we use photons in computers instead
of electrons?

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.279
We already use photons for communication;
fiber optic cables are what keep the globe’s

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.509
computers interconnected as they hurtle data
around at light speed.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.110
But when it comes time to process that data,
we convert light to electrons and run them

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.680
through transistors.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.430
The conversion uses energy and electrons are
comparatively slow, so researchers are exploring

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.820
how to build light based transistors instead.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.630
Transistors are the fundamental building block
of your computer’s central processing unit.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.800
They’re basically nanoscale switches that
will either stop current or let it flow.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.820
It’s important that a transistor’s output
can act as the input for the next transistor.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.970
Actually it has to be able to send the current
on to at least two transistors for logic signals

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.820
to propagate, and it has to preserve that
signal quality to keep errors to a minimum.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.740
We have made optical switches, but for one
reason or another they don’t work as a replacement

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.380
for the silicon transistors we use in electronics,
like because the output signal is a different

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
wavelength than the input, making controlling
the next switch in line difficult.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.780
Or the design for the switch is too big, in
the micron scale instead of the nanoscale,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.820
so gains in speed come at the expense of size.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.799
Or the design requires a cloud of supercooled
atoms, which isn’t exactly practical.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.049
Even though scientists have been trying since
the 60s, an optical transistor that can replace

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.740
an electrical one has never materialized.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.740
So instead of using our current approach to
computing and substituting light in for electrons,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.740
we might have to try something entirely different.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.159
Like trying to build a photonic chip that
mimics how a human brain performs calculations.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.810
Scientists at MIT have built a chip that uses
beams of light sent through channels of silicon

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.700
to mimic a neural network.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.350
The beams split and combine and travel at
different speeds as the silicon is heated

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.560
and cooled.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.360
Brighter beams represent bigger numbers, and
as these beams split, combine, and interfere

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.980
with each other, their brightness changes,
effectively performing several small multiplication

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.619
problems lightning fast.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.840
They’ve applied this photonic chip to train
a neural network to understand vowel sounds

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.970
and have had modest success.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.710
They think they can improve their results
dramatically by making a purpose built system,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.730
instead of the jury-rigged proof of concept
they tested.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.700
But given how optical computing has historically
failed to live up to expectations, skeptics

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.920
aren’t holding their breath.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.450
Before we see an all light chip, we’ll probably
see hybrid optoelectronic systems that take

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.770
advantage of light’s ability to transmit
data quickly across large distances.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.930
But until transistors reach their lower size
limit and can’t improve any more, it looks

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.830
like we’ll be relying on slow old electrons
to do the mathematical heavy lifting.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.970
We haven’t found our way to the future of
computing -- yet -- so make sure you’re

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.930

Take that first step in creating an identity
online and visit domain dot com.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.739
Why would transistors have a lower size limit?

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.300
Blame quantum weirdness.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.960
Trace explains why we might one day ditch
silicon here.Fun fact: there’s a disagreement

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.390
whether light based computers or quantum computers
are the future, but thanks to the nature of

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.790
light it’s possible future computers could
be both!Thanks for watching
