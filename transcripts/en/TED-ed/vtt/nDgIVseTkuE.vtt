00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:09.649
The idea of human rights 
is that each one of us,

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.345
no matter who we are 
or where we are born,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:16.528
is entitled to the same 
basic rights and freedoms.

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:18.348
Human rights are not privileges,

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:21.245
and they cannot be granted or revoked.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.787
They are inalienable and universal.

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:26.994
That may sound straighforward enough,

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:29.078
but it gets incredibly complicated

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:32.930
as soon as anyone tries 
to put the idea into practice.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.470
What exactly are the basic human rights?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.946
Who gets to pick them?

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:39.743
Who enforces them, and how?

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:43.460
The history behind 
the concept of human rights is a long one.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.966
Throughout the centuries and across
societies, religions, and cultures

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:52.230
we have struggled with defining notions
of rightfulness, justice, and rights.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.313
But one of the most modern affirmations
of universal human rights

00:00:55.313 --> 00:01:00.494
emerged from the ruins of World War II
with the creation of the United Nations.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.602
The treaty that established the UN
gives as one of its purposes

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:08.384
to reaffirm faith in 
fundamental human rights.

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:09.605
And with the same spirit,

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:16.029
in 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:20.425
This document, written by an international
committee chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:24.047
lays the basis for modern 
international human rights law.

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:26.052
The declaration is based on the principle

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:32.598
that all human beings are born
free and equal in dignity and rights.

00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:35.653
It lists 30 articles recognizing,
among other things,

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:39.924
the principle of nondiscrimination
and the right to life and liberty.

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:44.185
It refers to negative freedoms,
like the freedom from torture or slavery,

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:45.726
as well as positive freedoms,

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:49.011
such as the freedom 
of movement and residence.

00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.965
It encompasses basic civil
and political rights,

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:55.981
such as freedom of expression, religion,
or peaceful assembly,

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.033
as well as social, economic,
and cultural rights,

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:00.899
such as the right to education

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.427
and the right to freely 
choose one's occupation

00:02:03.427 --> 00:02:06.258
and be paid and treated fairly.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:10.140
The declaration takes no sides
as to which rights are more important,

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.882
insisting on their universality,

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.448
indivisibility,

00:02:13.448 --> 00:02:15.279
and interdependence.

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.106
And in the past decades,
international human rights law has grown,

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:22.346
deepening and expanding our understanding
of what human rights are,

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:25.078
and how to better protect them.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.264
So if these principles 
are so well-developed,

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:31.725
then why are human rights abused
and ignored time and time again

00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:34.592
all over the world?

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:38.474
The problem in general
is that it is not at all easy

00:02:38.474 --> 00:02:42.745
to universally enforce these rights
or to punish transgressors.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:46.817
The UDHR itself, despite being
highly authoritative and respected,

00:02:46.817 --> 00:02:49.702
is a declaration, not a hard law.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.702
So when individual countries violate it,

00:02:51.702 --> 00:02:55.841
the mechanisms to address 
those violations are weak.

00:02:55.841 --> 00:03:00.467
For example, the main bodies within the UN
in charge of protecting human rights

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:03.442
mostly monitor and investigate violations,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:10.156
but they cannot force states to, say,
change a policy or compensate a victim.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:13.731
That's why some critics say it's naive
to consider human rights a given

00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:18.213
in a world where state interests 
wield so much power.

00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:21.141
Critics also question the universality
of human rights

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:23.037
and emphasize that their development

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:27.688
has been heavily guided by a small number
of mostly Western nations

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:30.164
to the detriment of inclusiveness.

00:03:30.164 --> 00:03:31.480
The result?

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.985
A general bias in favor 
of civil policital liberties

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:36.455
over sociopolitical rights

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:40.786
and of individual 
over collective or groups rights.

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:43.159
Others defend universal human rights laws

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.143
and point at the positive role they have
on setting international standards

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:50.449
and helping activists in their campaigns.

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.417
They also point out

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:55.233
that not all international 
human rights instruments are powerless.

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:59.218
For example, the European Convention
on Human Rights establishes a court

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:03.446
where the 47 member countries
and their citizens can bring cases.

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:08.972
The court issues binding decisions
that each member state must comply with.

00:04:08.972 --> 00:04:11.225
Human rights law is constantly evolving

00:04:11.225 --> 00:04:16.040
as are our views and definitions of what
the basic human rights should be.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.570
For example, how basic or important
is the right to democracy

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.713
or to development?

00:04:21.713 --> 00:04:23.752
And as our lives are increasingly digital,

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:26.860
should there be a right 
to access the Internet?

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.926
A right to digital privacy?

00:04:28.926 --> 00:04:30.400
What do you think?
