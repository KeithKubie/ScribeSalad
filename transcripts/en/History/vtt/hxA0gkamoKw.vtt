00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.710
NARRATOR: Houston,
Texas, July 20, 1969.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.460
At NASA Mission Control Center,
the massive IBM System/360

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.040
Model 75 computer, which
boasts processing power

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.830
of 16.6 million
instructions per second

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.580
and up to 8 megabytes
of main memory,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.580
is employed to accomplish the
greatest feat in human history,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.420
putting a man on the moon.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.080
People across the
world marveled at

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.250
this technological achievement.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.500
But incredibly, only
six decades later,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.250
a handheld device weighing
less than half a pound

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.080
dwarfs the total technology
NASA possessed in 1969.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.460
Today's smartphone contains
a staggering 1 million

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.460
times the computing power used
to carry out the moon landing.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.080
What we had when
they went to the moon

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.790
is like nothing compared
to what an average teenager

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.960
carries around now.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.210
I mean, the kind
of computing power,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.460
the ability to
access information,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.120
the ability to
reach people, it's

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.960
an astonishing
technological achievement.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.460
You can only
imagine what's going

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.620
to happen 30 years from now.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.420
What we think is so advanced
is going to be so not advanced.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.290
NARRATOR: According to
ancient-astronaut theorists,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.290
at specific points in
history, extraterrestrials

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.290
have influenced certain
individuals to allow humanity

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.790
to make major leaps forward.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.670
And they propose that
this has continued

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.290
up until modern times.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
As evidence, they
point to the visionary

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.670
who jump-started
the microcomputer

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.330
revolution, Steve Jobs.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.750
KARA SWISHER: Steve Jobs
was one of the greatest

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.830
visionaries in Silicon Valley.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.000
The idea of what he was doing
is how you popularize computing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.170
A lot of people who
were early in computing

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.420
didn't think about
people using them,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.960
and he managed to deliver
into the hands of consumers

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.830
a device that was usable.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.170
It was intuitive.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.580
It was easy to use.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.080
It was easy to understand.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.580
And that is not a small thing.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.210
In the simplicity
and the beauty of it,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.790
he made something
that was just perfect.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.290
NARRATOR: Steve
Jobs and his team

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.380
of engineers at Apple
harnessed technology

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.460
that connected society
digitally and put

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.830
all the world's
knowledge literally

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.460
at mankind's fingertips.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.170
But the seeds of this
technological revolution

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.000
were planted in 1973 when
the 19-year-old college

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.880
student dropped out of school.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.580
Jobs was attending Reed
College in Portland, Oregon

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.580
when he, along with one of
Apple's first employees, Daniel

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.540
Kottke, made a decision
that would change not only

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.420
the course of their
lives but ultimately

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.540
the course of humanity.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.170
Fueled by his desire to find
spiritual enlightenment,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.080
Steve Jobs traveled
to India, with Daniel

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.380
following a few months later.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.670
Together, they
discovered a Hindu

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.670
guru known as Haidakhan Baba.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.500
He was discovered at about the
age of 18 doing yoga in a cave,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.710
but there are legends going
back that the same figure

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.250
had appeared all the
way back into the 1800s.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.420
NARRATOR: Haidakhan
Baba claimed that he

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.120
had no mother or father.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.250
But who was this character
who had no known history

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.960
before the age of 18
and was said to have

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.290
manifested out of thin air?

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.710
He professed that he
was an immortal being.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.380
LAYNE LITTLE: Steve Jobs did
spend some time with them.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.290
Haidakhan Baba actually
gave him an initiation

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.290
by giving him a spiritual name.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.960
This is a traditional
kind of initiation.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.790
So they were formally
initiated by this guru.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.750
Babaji had said that he was
a celestial being who had come

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.290
to earth to help
enlighten our planet

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.420
and to advance us forward.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.670
And we have to
wonder, is it possible

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.830
that Steven Jobs
was being influenced

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.000
telepathically by an
extraterrestrial entity named

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.460
Babaji?
