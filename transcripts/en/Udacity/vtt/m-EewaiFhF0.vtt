00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; So, here's in fact another theorem for you Michael. So, it turns out the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.070
theorem that we wrote down before is

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.480
still true in the case of non-deterministic games.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, cool.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.360
&gt;&gt; Of perfect information, right? By the

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.580
way, do you know whose theorem this is?

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.580
&gt;&gt; Charles' theorem?

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.160
&gt;&gt; No, although that would be cool.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.330
&gt;&gt; Von Neumann's theorem?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.830
&gt;&gt; Yes, this is von Neumann's theorem.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.210
&gt;&gt; Oh really?

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you just guess?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.730
&gt;&gt; Von Neumann, he's responsible for everything.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.540
&gt;&gt; Do you know, well, you going to remind everyone who von Neumann is?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.640
&gt;&gt; He's my uncle?

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.150
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.548
&gt;&gt; No, you're right. You're right. Von Neumann,

00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:32.445
so we talk about von Neumann architectures in computer

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:35.344
science, that the basic design of a microprocessor is

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:38.360
still following the ideas that that he worked out.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.110
&gt;&gt; Right, the von Neumann Machine. So there you go. So, this is pretty

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.430
good, right? So, what we did, so what did we learn so far? What we

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.090
learned so far is, the only thing that matters is the matrix. And once you

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.700
have the matrix, you used mini max, at least if you're in a two player

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.350
zero sum game of perfect information. At least if you're in a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.790
world of two player zero sum games of perfect information. We can

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.010
just write down this matrix, throw everything else away and use mini

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.340
max or maxi min and figure out what the value of the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.880
game is, which is the same thing as saying as, we know

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.810
what the policy is. The kind of joint policy, in a world

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.060
where everyone is being rational and trying to maximize their rewards and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.800
assumes everyone else is doing the same. That's pretty cool, I think.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.860
&gt;&gt; Awesome, so though, you know, I feel like

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.020
I could make a matrix that wouldn't have this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.120
property. This maxi min equals mini max. And, and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.650
that we couldn't make a tree out of it.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.310
&gt;&gt; You probably could, but I'm going to guess that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.325
it's going to require that it's no longer zero sum.

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:32.320
&gt;&gt; Nooo, I'm going to say no to that.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.540
&gt;&gt; Well, you know what, I, actually now that,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.060
I think I understand what you mean and the answer

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.270
is yes you could. And in fact, that's what we're

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.050
going to do next when we relax the next little bit.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.330
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.890
&gt;&gt; So, would you like

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.620
to do that?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.220
&gt;&gt; Sure, though I'm afraid if we get too relaxed, we might just fall asleep.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.330
&gt;&gt; In fact, why don't we do that, why don't we take a nap and then come back?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.970
the, the joy of being on video, asynchronous napping.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.170
&gt;&gt; Done. Okay, I'll see you in a second.
