00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.560
Now developer tools can also be a really great help to

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.720
you during the code test refine routine.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.230
You're able to test things on the fly and

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.280
see how it affects your page without actually changing the HTML and CSS files.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.180
So for example with the header 1 here I can

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.570
easily change the font size to make it bigger or smaller.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.400
I can change the font family say to Arial.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.240
I can also change the background colors of things.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.760
So, for example, say I might not have the hexadecimal color from the designer

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.440
but I just want to use the slider and find something that looks pretty close.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.640
You can also click over to the Sources tab and see the code, in the same place.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.230
And then also remember that you can reset any changes by just

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.360
clicking the Refresh button.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.290
So go ahead and play around a bit with Dev Tools and

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.190
see what you can change, and then let me know.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.760
Just how cool is it to play with Dev Tools?

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.500
Let me know on a scale from one to ten with one being

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.610
a total snooze fest and ten being totally awesome.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600
Personally, I hope you choose ten.
