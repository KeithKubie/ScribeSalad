00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.460
When threatened the Hairy frog acts like wolverine
from X-men.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.169
It's able to break the bones of its toes and
protrude them out of its skin to act as claws.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.490
WHAT THE FAK

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.219
The Facts and knowledge on Animal Defenses

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.170
The Pangolin looks like an anteater covered
in scales and is found across Asia and Sub

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.680
Saharan Africa.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.690
When in danger it curls into a small ball,
protecting its defenseless underbelly, using

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.539
the scales to create an impenetrable shield
around them, that looks similar to an artichoke

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:33.670
or pinecone.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.590
The scales are sharp around the edge, creating
an added line of defense when attacked.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.649
They're made of keratin, just like the hair,
skin, and nails of humans.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.469
They are one of the most endangered groups
of mammals in the world as they are considered

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.149
a delicacy in certain parts of the world.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.859
STOP EATING THEM - THEYRE AWESOME.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.670
The Pistol shrimp has the ultimate hand gun.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.699
One of its claws is about half the size of
its entire body, and that claw packs a powerful

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:55.699
weapon.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.089
When in danger or hunting prey the Pistol
shrimp is able to snap it's claw shut so quickly

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:08.110
it ejects a jet of water that travels 60 MPH
and the sound of the snap is 218 decibels.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.220
A bubble is formed behind the stream of water
called a cavitation bubble that implodes and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.330
creates a flash of light and temperatures
close to the temperature of the surface of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.330
the sun.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.820
This jet of water and bubble stun predators
and fish and easily kills them at close range,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.560
which the Pistol shrimp then carries into
burrow to feed on.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.790
The pistol shrimps snapping has even been
known to interfere with the sonar of submarines.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.420
The Bombardier beetle basically shoots napalm
at enemies.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.270
They live at soil level, making them a constant
target for ants to prey on.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.390
The time it takes to unfurl their wings from
under the wing covers is slower than most

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.700
insects and can cost them their lives.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.700
So they've developed a defense mechanism to
buy enough time to fly away.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.020
They produce diverse toxins like acid, aldehydes,
phenols, and quinones in sacs next to their

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.759
abdomen and they aim and shoot the liquids
in the form of a spray.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.060
The spray is ejected at 100 degrees Celsius.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.440
This is caused by the explosion generated
at the moment of ejection by the mixing of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.450
the chemicals.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.100
Hagfish have the ability to create massive
amounts of slime in order to suffocate their

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.100
predators.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.840
It turns the water around the enemy into a
gelatinous goo that clogs their gills and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840
chokes them.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.720
They also have the ability to tie themselves
into a knot and slide in and out of it.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.830
This helps when escaping predators and also
cleans themselves of their own slime.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.830
If that doesn't work they have the ability
to sneeze and unclog their nostrils of slime.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.819
The mimic octopus was discovered in 1998 in
Indonesia and has the ability to mimic other

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.970
sea life in order to defend itself from predators.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.140
Scientists have seen it imitate the sole fish,
a flat poisonous fish, the Lion fish that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.340
hovers above the sea floor and has poisonous
fins, and the sea snake which is very toxic.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.450
They have seen the octopus change into various
other shapes but are not exactly sure what

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.450
they are emulating, but they assume they can
take the shape of sand anemones, stingrays,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.450
mantis shrimp, and jelly fish.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.310
The octopi are able to figure out what creature
to change into depending on the predator and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.580
its surroundings.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.550
The boxer crab has a symbiotic relationship
with their boxing glove hands made of sea

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.550
anemones.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.880
They attach the anemones to the ends of their
claws and use them as defense against predators

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.690
because of their stinging power.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.959
The crabs often wipe the anemones along the
sea bed to collect food particles which it

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.960
then removes with its mouth.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.450
In return the anemones get to feast on the
particles of food the crab leaves behind while

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.450
feeding.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.989
The goblin shark is one of the most unusual
looking creatures in the sea.

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.190
Very little is known about this particular
species of shark but it lives in the very

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.959
deep waters around 4000 feet deep and in many
different seas around the world.

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.950
They were first discovered in the waters around
Japan.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.940
The goblin shark hunts by sensing the presence
of prey by electro sensitive organs in the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.940
snout.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.099
Once it finds its prey the shark is able to
protrude it's lower jaw and uses it tongue

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.140
like muscle to suck the prey into it's sharp
front teeth.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.280
I'm gonna leave you with this creature.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.970
What is it and how does it escape its predators?

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.930
Before we go here's last video's winner.
