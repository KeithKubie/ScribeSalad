Hello and welcome to season four of Crash Course Literature! That's right,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.250
we're back to talk about books. So this season, for no particular reason, we're gonna be talking about a lot of dystopias -

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.520
You know, future worlds where things have gone terribly wrong - as opposed to the present when everything is going fantastically.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
So we're gonna be reading George Orwell's 1984. We've got The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood -

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.859
I know that you like the TV show. I agree with you that it's excellent, but the book, as usual, even better.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.349
We've got my personal all-time favorite dystopia Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler. If you haven't read this book,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.000
you need to read it immediately because how else are you gonna have nightmares for the next six months?
I'm kidding, although

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.170
I do actually sometimes have nightmares set in the world of Parable of the Sower.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.180
And we're also going to be reading Candide by Voltaire, which is kind of a dystopian book

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.590
but mostly like an aggressively anti-Utopian book. The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is also kind of a dystopia although

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.729
it was written about a world that was actually happening. Macbeth is not quite dystopian

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.229
but let me submit that life under the Macbeth regime wouldn't have been ideal.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.909
We're also gonna read To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf which is inarguably the best book ever written

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.339
partly from the perspective of a house. And lastly we're gonna read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen -

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.689
the most requested book at Crash Course Literature over the last three seasons.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.390
I'm so excited for when we finally get to Pride and Prejudice because it is a book in which no one gets murdered or gets

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.439
syphilis or gets imprisoned in their own home and also there is love in it.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.149
But before the love, my friends, will come much suffering of almost every variety. This year in Crash Course Literature,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.790
we're going to be talking about genre and gender roles and governments and the question of free will.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.569
I hope you'll join me in reading or rereading all of these books, so head over to your local library

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.799
and check them out.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.610
Thanks for watching

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.860
and I'll see you next week when we begin our discussion of George Orwell's 1984. Well actually I won't see you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.800
but don't worry. Google's ad tracking software will.
