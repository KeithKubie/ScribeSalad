00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160
of years ago right it was largely about
 

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.960
of years ago right it was largely about
people communicating the results and so

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:53.970
people communicating the results and so
 

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.930
people communicating the results and so
I wish for a sort of neoclassical you

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940
I wish for a sort of neoclassical you
 

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.400
I wish for a sort of neoclassical you
know return to the part where we are

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:58.410
know return to the part where we are
 

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.870
know return to the part where we are
communicating the results in ways that

00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880
communicating the results in ways that
 

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.120

we will be able to reproduce and you

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.130
we will be able to reproduce and you
 

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.650
we will be able to reproduce and you
know four pages of dead tree is not

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660
know four pages of dead tree is not
 

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.090
know four pages of dead tree is not
necessarily the right format for the

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100
necessarily the right format for the

the government is going to shut down
 

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.699
the government is going to shut down
again and I think this week it was

again and I think this week it was
 

00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:23.549

an environment that is so chaotic a
 

00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:43.319
an environment that is so chaotic a
dynamic and so it's difficult to make

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:43.329
dynamic and so it's difficult to make
 

00:15:43.329 --> 00:15:45.600

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:33.610
statistics to students it is really
 

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.460

data and nowadays well perhaps when I
 

00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:49.290
data and nowadays well perhaps when I
first started teaching and maybe this

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:49.300
first started teaching and maybe this
 

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.669
first started teaching and maybe this
was just because when you first start

00:16:50.669 --> 00:16:50.679
was just because when you first start
 

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:54.090
was just because when you first start
teaching you suck at it but when I first

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:54.100
teaching you suck at it but when I first
 

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.980
teaching you suck at it but when I first
started teaching it felt pretty it felt

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:55.990
started teaching it felt pretty it felt

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240
role was to bring that in to the
 

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.240
role was to bring that in to the
statistics department so my last year

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:36.250
statistics department so my last year
 

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.300
statistics department so my last year
UCLA I let our seminar series it had

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.310
UCLA I let our seminar series it had
 

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.210
UCLA I let our seminar series it had
been dominated the previous year well we

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:42.220
been dominated the previous year well we
 

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.170
been dominated the previous year well we
don't need to go in the previous year

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.180
don't need to go in the previous year
 

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.670
don't need to go in the previous year
but my ear was we had journalists

humanities people that left the students

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120
humanities people that left the students
 

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.020

excited to be in the discipline to think

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.030
excited to be in the discipline to think
 

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.300
excited to be in the discipline to think
about the potential that data had left

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:57.310
about the potential that data had left
 

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.800
about the potential that data had left

what we do about this when they were
 

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.200
what we do about this when they were
maybe more invested in delta's and

the nature and the role that data play

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:12.340
the nature and the role that data play
 

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.120

in the Academy and out in society has
 

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.930
in the Academy and out in society has
radically changed and so so the ways in

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:18.940
radically changed and so so the ways in
 

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.340
radically changed and so so the ways in
which data circulate the ways in which

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:20.350
which data circulate the ways in which
 

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.200
which data circulate the ways in which
we talk about data the with the ways in

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.210
we talk about data the with the ways in
 

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:22.950
we talk about data the with the ways in
which

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960

compute with and share those

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:24.070

computations are all all parts of my

an exercise in the field you may not be

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:44.380
an exercise in the field you may not be
 

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.500
an exercise in the field you may not be
aware but statistics has a chip on its

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:46.510
aware but statistics has a chip on its
 

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.600

shoulder about mathematics and often

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:48.610
shoulder about mathematics and often
 

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.399
shoulder about mathematics and often
thinks of itself as a can think of

00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:50.409
thinks of itself as a can think of
 

00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:54.299
thinks of itself as a can think of
itself as a branch of mathematics in my

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:54.309
itself as a branch of mathematics in my
 

00:19:54.309 --> 00:19:56.580
itself as a branch of mathematics in my
mind that's a very dangerous place to go

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:56.590
mind that's a very dangerous place to go
 

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.260
mind that's a very dangerous place to go
because statistics left without

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.270
because statistics left without
 

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.240
because statistics left without
application and data is a very ugly

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.250
application and data is a very ugly
 

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:05.340
application and data is a very ugly
thing and so we're seeing increasingly a

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:05.350
thing and so we're seeing increasingly a
 

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.779
thing and so we're seeing increasingly a
respect for data analysis and and encode

00:20:09.779 --> 00:20:09.789
respect for data analysis and and encode
 

00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:12.450
respect for data analysis and and encode
but what that mean what that respect for

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:12.460
but what that mean what that respect for
 

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.130
but what that mean what that respect for
code means or that respect for data

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:14.140
code means or that respect for data
 

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.760
code means or that respect for data
analysis means is that that functions of

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:17.770
analysis means is that that functions of
 

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.279
analysis means is that that functions of
the discipline like tenure like

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:20.289

publication also have to have respect

00:20:22.049 --> 00:20:22.059
publication also have to have respect
 

00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:24.779
publication also have to have respect
for those for those exercises and that

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:24.789
for those for those exercises and that
 

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:26.610
for those for those exercises and that
we have to have publication standards

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:26.620
we have to have publication standards
 

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.230
we have to have publication standards
for those what does it mean to publish

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240
for those what does it mean to publish
 

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.169
for those what does it mean to publish
code how do you credit it my personal

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:31.179
code how do you credit it my personal
 

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:33.240

feeling is that every piece of software

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.250
feeling is that every piece of software
 

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.560
feeling is that every piece of software
you put out there should count for to

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:34.570

public hate but you come up with and

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.260
public hate but you come up with and
 

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.430
public hate but you come up with and
come up with a arithmetic later but but

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440
come up with a arithmetic later but but
 

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.010
come up with a arithmetic later but but
um so there's there's the idea that code

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.020
um so there's there's the idea that code
 

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.260
um so there's there's the idea that code
and data are becoming more respected and

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:46.270
and data are becoming more respected and
 

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.810
and data are becoming more respected and
less transparent and I think that that's

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:48.820
less transparent and I think that that's
 

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.549
less transparent and I think that that's
something that maybe goes to chris's

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559
something that maybe goes to chris's
 

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:52.139
something that maybe goes to chris's
point about reproducibility there's a

computational field I know I learned
 

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.830
computational field I know I learned
computation because my advisor said

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840

here's the book it was a Fortran here

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:01.299

isn't something we're going to take the

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:06.850
isn't something we're going to take the
 

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.730
isn't something we're going to take the
time to teach you so there really isn't

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:08.740
time to teach you so there really isn't

anything good to do here is just

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360
anything good to do here is just
 

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.840
anything good to do here is just
something you do but then secondly you

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:12.850
something you do but then secondly you

don't have an opportunity to learn any

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:14.289
don't have an opportunity to learn any
 

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:15.810
don't have an opportunity to learn any
of the best practices and so the code

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:15.820
of the best practices and so the code
 

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:21.180
of the best practices and so the code
that I wrote was god-awful and so so so

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:21.190
that I wrote was god-awful and so so so
 

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.889

with the fact that the paper controlled
 

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.990
with the fact that the paper controlled
the channel of the information right so

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000
the channel of the information right so
 

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.690
the channel of the information right so
the the information versus the control

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:12.700
the the information versus the control

of the information
 

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:15.460
of the information
right and it wasn't that people were

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:15.470
right and it wasn't that people were
 

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.749
right and it wasn't that people were

it was also that it controlled the
channel through which him and there's

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159
channel through which him and there's
 

00:32:22.159 --> 00:32:23.769

not quite the same so I'm in the same in
 

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.970
not quite the same so I'm in the same in

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980
history and so on so anyway I think that
 

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.859

would be that's that there must be a way
to solve the problem but I think that's

to solve the problem but I think that's
 

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.410

the biggest for me that's the biggest

the biggest for me that's the biggest
 

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.270

they're actually able to do ok that's
 

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.960
they're actually able to do ok that's
very hard to answer and part because it

what what all that what you end up
 

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.550
what what all that what you end up
supporting and what all that means so

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:17.560
supporting and what all that means so
 

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.510
supporting and what all that means so
the the other thing I think just least

out what what they're teaching in

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:53.950
out what what they're teaching in
 

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:55.890
out what what they're teaching in
reporting classes and they had just this

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:55.900
reporting classes and they had just this
 

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.030
reporting classes and they had just this
one pretty cool classic just had their

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040
one pretty cool classic just had their
 

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.330

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:00.340
data class and I asked them about you
 

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.370
data class and I asked them about you
know the you know what did you learn

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:02.380
know the you know what did you learn
 

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.770

ethnicities in New York so you know what

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:07.630
ethnicities in New York so you know what
 

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:08.970
ethnicities in New York so you know what
did you what data did you look at what

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:08.980
did you what data did you look at what
 

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.740
did you what data did you look at what
did you learn what exciting stories did

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:10.750
did you learn what exciting stories did
 

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.030

you find in the data

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040
you find in the data
 

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.060
you find in the data
and you know one student said well I

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:15.070
and you know one student said well I
 

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:16.770
and you know one student said well I
learned that there were more people from

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:16.780
learned that there were more people from
 

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.450
learned that there were more people from
Puerto Rico living in New Jersey than in

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:18.460
Puerto Rico living in New Jersey than in
 

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.950
Puerto Rico living in New Jersey than in
New York and I learned that from the

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960
New York and I learned that from the
 

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.450
New York and I learned that from the
Census and I'm thinking if the census

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:21.460
Census and I'm thinking if the census
 

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.710
Census and I'm thinking if the census
can't tell you that then I don't know

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720
can't tell you that then I don't know
 

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.750
can't tell you that then I don't know
what it can tell you and that's great um

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760
what it can tell you and that's great um
 

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.570
what it can tell you and that's great um
but what was a surprising thing give me

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:27.580
but what was a surprising thing give me
 

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.310
but what was a surprising thing give me
something that shocked you were and it

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:29.320
something that shocked you were and it
 

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.110
something that shocked you were and it
there wasn't anything right they had all

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:31.120
there wasn't anything right they had all
 

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.170

basically done a pulldown menu for for
 

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.570
basically done a pulldown menu for for
the census and came up with tables and

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:36.580
the census and came up with tables and
 

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.790
the census and came up with tables and
those tables floated into which is

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800
those tables floated into which is
 

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.040
those tables floated into which is
nothing bad about that at all but what

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:41.050
nothing bad about that at all but what
 

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:43.500
nothing bad about that at all but what
it means is that the story about how a

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:43.510
it means is that the story about how a
 

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.480
it means is that the story about how a
particular neighborhood came to be the

they work with it right and I think some

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440
they work with it right and I think some
 

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.840
they work with it right and I think some
of that how you manipulated it comes

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:09.850
of that how you manipulated it comes
 

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:12.090
of that how you manipulated it comes
back to us and maybe not you although it
