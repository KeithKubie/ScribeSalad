00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.169
NARRATOR: University

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.801
at Irvine, April 2017.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:13.722
Aerospace Engineer Travis
Taylor has obtained a model

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.642
of an aircraft whose design
specifications are based solely

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:21.104
on information gleaned
from ancient Indian text

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.772
that are believed to
have been formally

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:27.652
set to writing in 500 BC.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.738
He is going to
subjected to wind tunnel

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:35.702
analysis to determine if it
is a viable flying machine.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.830
So explain to
me what we've set

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.373
up here with that wind tunnel.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:44.043
OK, so this is our
air space vehicle model.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.462
It's connected to this boom.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.505
The armature has a
force gauge on it.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.758
But we're going to have
airflow go past it at about

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.593
50 miles per hour or so.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.345
And then we're going to
measure forces against it

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:57.098
to determine if it's
going to fly or not.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:01.394
And so what are the signs
that you're looking for in order

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.647
to determine whether this is,
in fact, aerodynamically sound?

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.193
Right, so we're going to
measure the normal force.

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.069
And the normal
force is up or down.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.780
If it starts to
move up, then that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.365
will be exciting, because it's
actually going to be rising.

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:15.992
And that's how you get flight.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.494
You know, when an airplane
turns up and starts to move,

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.245
it's because it's getting lift.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.706
The other thing is I don't want
to see it going real bad, side

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.417
to side or real bad,
chatter up and down,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.668
because that would
mean it's unstable.

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:27.086
All right, well, let's do it.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.588
Let's fire her up
and see what happens.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.631
Yeah, let's do it.

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.967
[suspense music]

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.765
The flow is
coming up in speed.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.433
Yep.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:44.312
NARRATOR: While being subjected
to 50-mile-an-hour winds,

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:46.856
the craft exhibits a
slight lift upwards,

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.108
yet remains relatively steady.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.152
TRAVIS TAYLOR: No
side-to-side wobble.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.987
OK.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:57.033
NARRATOR: Sensors record the
measurements of various forces,

00:01:57.033 --> 00:02:00.119
as well as torque and
pitch to determine just

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.581
how aerodynamic the body is.

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.166
It looks very stable.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.002
[suspense music]

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.631
[craft noise]

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.093
All right, so let's
look at the results.

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:17.387
So what happened
during the test

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:21.224
was the normal force, which
is where we measure the lift,

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:25.603
it was positive between 0.03
and 0.06 pounds of force.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.689
That means we were
measuring lift.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.317
So our vehicle in the
wind tunnel experiment

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:34.279
was showing positive lift
like an aircraft would.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.658
Did you expect these results
from a shape that's like that?

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:42.078
Well, the shape looks
like a lifting body to me.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.330
But you never know until you
actually do the experiment.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.083
And we have experimental
results now that says it is.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.835
So that's the exciting part.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.630
And what do you say to
anyone who questions the idea

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.467
that this information has
been taken from a text that's

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:59.345
at least 1,800 years old?

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.015
The only thing you
can say is we performed

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:05.310
a good scientific experiment.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.898
And the results were that the
shape made from those tags

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.649
is a viable
aerodynamic structure.

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.402
[suspense music]

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.571
NARRATOR: The aircraft
model created,

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.283
using details garnered from
the ancient Indian texts

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.953
has proven to be flight worthy.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:27.999
Is it possible that by studying
the ancient Indian texts,

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:31.502
we may be able to recreate
advanced technology that

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:36.549
existed thousands of
years ago in India?

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.010
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.096
that the texts may
also contain details

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.389
for advanced spacecraft.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.309
