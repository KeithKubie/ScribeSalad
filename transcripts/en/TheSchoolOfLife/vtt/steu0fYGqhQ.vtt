00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:06.000
A major obstacle to self-knowledge,
and in turn to a flourishing life

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is the tendency of one part
of our minds to lie to the other.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.142
We lie for what might initially seem like a very understandable reason,

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:17.625
because we want to avoid pain.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:22.042
But in so doing, we hugely damage
our chances of happiness.

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.792
There are four things we particularly
like to lie to ourselves about.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.125
We lie about all the problematic aspects.

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:33.087
It would take so much effort to alter
our jobs, our relationships,

00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:36.380
our friendships, our health, our
habits, and ideas.

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:40.375
We lie because we need
to think well of ourselves,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.683
and devoted to imagining that
we are essentially normal,

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:46.958
without peculiar loves, hates,
and deviant thoughts.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.792
We lie because we don't
want to feel so inadequate.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.934
And yet because
we lack so many good things.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.542
We lie because we're furious with
certain people we're supposed to love.

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:01.291
And we lie because what we furious about

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.458
feels so minor and pathetically petty
for a grown-up to care about.

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:10.291
Given how risky the truth
about us can feel,

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.916
we had to learn to be masters of deception.

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:18.092
Our techniques are wide-ranging, devilish, and often hugely imaginative.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:23.417
Here are some of the leading maneuvers we
employ to pull the wool over our own eyes.

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:26.479
Distraction/Addiction

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.375
We identify something that
can powerfully keep our thoughts away

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:32.625
from troubling inner confrontations.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:36.017
Online pornography's a favorite.
The news another.

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:38.084
Alcohol, a third. Work, a fourth.

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:41.751
We don't so much like these elements
in and of themselves.

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:45.750
We like them for their ability to
keep us away from what we fear.

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:48.646
Manic Cheeriness

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.375
A sadness we haven't been able to admit to,

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:55.707
is often covered up with exaggerated
doses of manic cheeriness.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.623
We aren't happy, so much as incapable
of allowing ourselves to feel

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.458
even the slightest sadness.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.375
In case we were to be overwhelmed
by our buried grief.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.083
We develop a brittle insistent tendency
to say that,

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:10.667
"All is very well",
"This is lovely, isn't it?"

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:14.458
We might press leaving no room
for any ideas to the contrary.

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:17.521
Irritability

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:21.208
Denied anger with
a particular personal situation

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.583
often seeps out into a
generalized irritability.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:27.708
So successful is the lie,
we don't really know what's up.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.708
We just keep losing our tempers.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.875
Someone moved the TV remote.
There are two eggs in the fridge.

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:36.167
The electricity bill is slightly higher
than we expected.

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:37.558
Anything can set us off.

00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:41.000
Our brains are so filled with
how frustrating, annoying things are.

00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:46.625
We have cleverly left no space at all for
focusing on the true and very sad issue.

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.937
Denigration

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.375
We tell ourselves that we simply
don't care about something.

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:57.042
Love or politics, career success
or intellectual life.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.916
That beautiful student or
the house we can't afford.

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.208
And we are very emphatic about
our lack of interest and complete disdain.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.792
We go to great lengths to make
it very clear to others and ourselves

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.250
how absolutely unconcerned we are.

00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:13.062
Censoriousness

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:18.584
We grow censorious and deeply disapproving
of certain kinds of behavior and people.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.583
What we don't admit is
that was so full of condemnation,

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.792
only because we need to ward off awareness

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:28.042
that a part of us in fact really
likes the condemned element.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:32.541
We attack certain sexual tastes
as utterly deviant and beyond the pale,

00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:35.708
precisely because we have known
that we share them,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.708
somewhere inside ourselves.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.886
So we're delighted when particular people
are arrested or shamed in the press.

00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:44.917
What they did was utterly awful,
we insist are outraged

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.833
shielding us from any risks spotting
the connection between them and us.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.312
Defensiveness

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:57.583
When there's unwelcomed news, we may resort
to a highly successful diversionary tactic,

00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:58.625
taking offense.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:01.208
A colleague tries to give us
a bit of feedback.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.917
Instantly, we accuse them of rudeness,
arrogance in a sense of entitlement.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.544
A partner points something out.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:09.958
We get furious that they're piling
pressure on us at a difficult point.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.125
Feeling offended takes up
all our attention.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:14.833
It muddies the waters.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.792
We no longer have to pay
attention to information

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.542
that is it heart correct but challenging.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:24.125
Cynicism, Despair

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.709
We're sad about particular things.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.917
But confronting them would be so arduous,
we generalize and universalize the sadness.

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.375
We don't say that X or Y has made us sad.

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:38.834
We say that everything is rather terrible
and everyone is rather awful.

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:40.208
We spread the pain,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.792
in order that its
particular specific causes

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:44.792
can no longer be the focus of attention.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.083
Our sadness gets, to put it metaphorically,
lost in the crowd.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.583
Why is lying to ourselves a problem?

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:55.542
We need to tell yourself the truth
when we can,

00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:59.291
for the simple reason that
we often pay a very high price

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.791
for the short-term calm of our lies.

00:05:02.542 --> 00:05:05.042
We miss key opportunities
for growth and learning.

00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:06.750
We're not very nice to be around.

00:05:06.792 --> 00:05:08.959
We develop harmful systems.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.167
And not least, the truth will be out.

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:12.500
When we don't let it emerge,

00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:17.209
it has a tendency to reveal itself through
involuntary often physical symptoms.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.667
We become insomniac or impotent. An eyelid starts twitching.

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:24.375
We acquire a stutter, and scream
in our sleep and lose energy.

00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:25.667
We fall into depression.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:31.542
We owe it to ourselves to dare
to start to confront our real nature.
