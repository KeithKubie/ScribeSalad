they're gonna do this and stuff like

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 align:start position:0%
it I'm kinda glad they didn't because I
 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.699 align:start position:0%
it I'm kinda glad they didn't because I

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 align:start position:0%
think it would've been too predictable
 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.070 align:start position:0%
think it would've been too predictable
if<00:03:17.100><c> anything</c><00:03:17.580><c> the</c><00:03:17.700><c> way</c><00:03:17.820><c> this</c><00:03:18.060><c> works</c><00:03:18.360><c> is</c><00:03:18.600><c> it</c>

if anything the way this works is it

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
kind of works backwards where the purge
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.789 align:start position:0%
kind of works backwards where the purge
is<00:03:21.090><c> gonna</c><00:03:21.390><c> happen</c><00:03:21.840><c> and</c><00:03:21.959><c> then</c><00:03:22.049><c> you</c><00:03:22.110><c> see</c><00:03:22.410><c> kind</c><00:03:22.709><c> of</c>
