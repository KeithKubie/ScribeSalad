RUCHIKA SIKRI: My
name is Ruchika Sikri,

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:09.462
and I'm a G+ program manager.

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:13.944
We are delighted to have
Irene join us today.

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:17.430
She's an ex-Googler, and I
saw she was exchanging cards

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.414
and notes with a lot of people
already, so that's great.

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:24.568
I just wanted to do a
quick intro for Irene,

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:29.880
and then I plan to defer to
her to share her experiences

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.366
with mindfulness
and product design.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.350
Irene is an operating partner
at Khosla Ventures, a VC

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.840
firm known to most of
us in Silicon Valley.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.828
She works over there with
hundreds of startups,

00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:45.816
and continues to make
great design happen.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:49.800
Prior to Khosla Ventures, Irene
ran product design at Audacity,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.282
and also led user experience
at Google for six years,

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:56.772
so no wonder many
of us know her.

00:00:56.772 --> 00:01:00.756
Before that, Irene established
and led the user experience

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:01.752
group at Yahoo.

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:03.744
For eight years she was there.

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:07.230
And she began her career
as an interaction designer

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.724
at Netscape Communications.

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.710
Actually, my husband and
I, we worked there together

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.210
as a pair.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.198
I know her from
back in those days.

00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:17.688
Irene also teaches
yoga and meditation

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:21.672
at Avalon Art and Yoga Center,
one of Palo Alto's oldest yoga

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:22.668
studios.

00:01:22.668 --> 00:01:25.905
She passionately believes
in the transformative power

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:28.644
of mindfulness practices
which have helped

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:31.632
defined how she approaches
life and design.

00:01:31.632 --> 00:01:34.620
Without further ado,
I present to you

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.604
Irene Au, who will share with us
how cultivating focus, empathy,

00:01:38.604 --> 00:01:43.584
and creativity can help
with better product design.

00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:48.539
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.830
IRENE AU: Thanks for having me.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.440
So I'm miked up
here for the video.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.080
And I miked-- actually,
this is-- is this even on?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.580
It is?

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.413
OK, so I'm miked up
here so you can hear me.

00:01:57.413 --> 00:02:00.140
Actually, can you hear me even
if I don't have the microphone?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.640
Here?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.139
Yeah, OK.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:03.130
I'm going to try
ditching this because I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.020
have too many things in my hand.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.270
Thanks so much for
coming to hear me speak.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.400
It's really an honor and
a delight to be back here.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.090
So as Ruchika mentioned, I was
a Googler from 2006 to 2012.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.680
Here's a picture of me from
"Fast Company Magazine" when

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.230
they decided to feature a
couple of notable Googlers.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.560
They dressed us up
with funny props.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.990
And that's me with all the
Post-It notes, because I think

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.180
for all of the work
that we did here

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.070
and the US team continues
to do here at Google,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.970
we probably are responsible
for a huge portion

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.290
of 3M's sales of Post-It notes.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.340
My personal story,
it's somewhere along

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.460
the way in the midst
of all the-- I mean,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.970
managing design at
Google, to be honest,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.110
was not a very easy job.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.580
And so somewhere along the way
while I was here at Google,

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.980
I realized how
unsustainable my wife was.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.910
Like, work/life balance
meant that I was waking up

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.050
at 5:00 in the morning
to go to the gym,

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.710
and so then I could see
my kids in the morning.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.899
And when I realized
that my hips were

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.440
so tight I couldn't on the floor
to play with my kids, that's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.106
when I realized, well,
I should probably

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:20.960
commit to some kind
of stretching or yoga.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.620
And I had been exposed to
yoga from an early age, when

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.570
I was about 16, even
though I was growing up

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.820
in South Carolina.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.050
Very unusual.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.730
So I had practiced on and off.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.040
And yet, meditation had
eluded me for a long.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.260
Time But it wasn't until I
combined my yoga and meditation

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.580
practice that I've
really realized

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.815
the transformative
benefits of the practice.

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:50.610
So I left Google in
2012 to focus on yoga

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.910
and started teaching regularly.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.730
In fact, I first started
teaching here at Google.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.420
And I did that like
every Wednesday at noon.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.640
Some of you have
been in my classes.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.647
And I love the opportunity
to combine my passions

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:08.230
and interests.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.610
But what I found after
practicing regularly and then

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.570
joining Udacity was
that I experienced

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.510
some of the most creative
periods of my life.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.967
And some of those stories
are really deep and personal,

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:22.300
and others are confidential too.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.820
You'd ask these, I can't
really go into too much detail.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.870
But I really believe in how
yoga and meditation have

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.800
made me a better designer,
and how it's really

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.259
contributed
tremendously to the way

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.466
I think about product design
and product development.

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:39.650
So that's what I'd like
to share with you today.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.954
So mindfulness
plus design-- Yes?

00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:43.370
TECHNICIAN: Can
you move that way?

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.016
IRENE AU: Move this way, OK.

00:04:45.016 --> 00:04:46.890
All right, OK.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.412
There's all this stuff
hanging from the ceiling here.

00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:51.870
As Ruchika mentioned, I just
joined as an operating partner

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.120
at Khosla Ventures where I'm
working with startups now

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.720
on design, making design great.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.980
I also teach yoga and
meditation at Avalon.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.570
So this is like up a mirroring
of two passions and interests

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.070
of mine.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.150
But they really intersect.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.650
So for example, how many of you
have been in this situation?

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.310
Like, you're working
really hard on a problem.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.830
Maybe you're trying to design a
clever solution to a hard user

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.960
problem.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.700
And it seems like the
more you think about it,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.980
the more the
solution is elusive.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.020
And the more you reach for it,
the harder it is to attain.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.070
So maybe that's happened to you.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.390
Product development requires an
abundance of analytic thinking.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.146
We are constantly
immersed in technology.

00:05:35.146 --> 00:05:37.270
So even those of us who
are not software developers

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.990
have to think logically,
think algorithmically,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.750
so that we can design and
conceive technical solutions

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.200
to user problems.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.200
And as designers, even designers
learn methods and practices

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.680
like task analysis and heuristic
evaluation, card sorting,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.540
things like that.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.030
We've turned the act of
design into a science.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.890
And we run experiments
to gather data

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.850
to inform design decisions.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.120
And so we've turned the act of
design so much into a science

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.730
that we've cast
innovation as a process,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.550
and terms like
data driven design

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.250
have become part
of our vernacular.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.042
But product design and product
development and computer

00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:21.750
scientists, the best
computer scientists,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.110
will also say that development
and design is both a science

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.530
and an art, and yet far
less time and energy

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.980
is spent on teaching people
how to be more creative.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.320
We've kind of
mystified creativity.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.040
And we see people as being
like creative geniuses,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.920
naturally-born creative
geniuses, or not.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.220
And it's possible that
some people are naturally

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.960
born more creative than others.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.630
But more realistically,
we all lie along

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.680
some spectrum between analytic
thinking and creative thinking.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.530
So the question is like
for us mere mortals,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.770
how might we learn
the skills that we

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.900
need to be more creative
and more effective

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.480
at product design and
product development?

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.690
So for example, how
can we be more focused

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.270
so that we can deliver the
one or two key features that

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.690
would be most
useful to our users?

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.295
How can we cultivate empathy
and compassion for our users

00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:19.920
for the people who are using the
products so that we can design

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.720
the products to be more usable?

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.320
And how can we be
more innovative

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.670
and bring more
inspiration and delight

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.780
to the people who are using the
products that we're creating?

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.540
So those are three
things I want to focus

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.960
on today-- focus,
empathy, and creativity.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.940
Those are all skills
that can be learned.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.910
And there are concrete
things that we can all

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.890
do to become better at that.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.820
And that's what we're
going to talk about,

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.360
is how to cultivate focus,
empathy, and creativity

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.780
through mindfulness practices
like yoga and meditation.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.840
So what is mindfuness?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.960
Mindfulness is a way of paying
attention to and seeing clearly

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.430
what is happening in our lives.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.880
That attention
paid is purposeful.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.860
It's in the moment,
without judgment.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.520
And it's about having the
time and space to tend

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.980
to whatever is in front of us in
spite of any distractions that

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.250
might be competing
for our attention

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.840
and any kind of
past history that

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.640
might shape how we think
and perceive the world.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.860
And one of the best ways
to cultivate mindfulness

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.950
is through attention training.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.490
And we train our attention
through meditation.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.830
Now, meditation is a broad term.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.340
It's like the word "sports."

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.289
Sports can refer to a variety
of things like tennis, swimming,

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.309
cycling.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:43.110
Similarly, meditation can
refer to a lot of activities.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.860
There are a lot of
ways to meditate.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.140
But the simplest and most
widely form of meditation

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.270
is to sit and focus
on the breath.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.120
The breath is the
foundation for meditation.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.200
And this is because it's free
and it's easily accessible.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.010
It's there when you need it.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.470
And it calms the
nervous system down.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.390
So just to demonstrate,
so let's try this now.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.210
So come to a comfortable seat.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.240
And find like some
kind of posture

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.070
that allows you to be relaxed
and alert at the same time.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.490
One word that I like
to use is dignity.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.420
So if you think
about what it means

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.590
to feel dignified
in your posture,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.890
it's not like you're
erect and stiff.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:30.440
You're relaxed,
but you're also on.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.100
OK?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.100
And you can choose
to close by the eyes,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.140
or you can keep them open.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.520
You can have than half
open, half closed.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.460
And then bring the
awareness within.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.670
Just rest the mind.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.510
If you choose to
keep your eyes open,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.970
you can gently
gaze at something,

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.410
softly gaze at something, maybe
18 inches in front of you.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.220
And just pause for a moment.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.500
And then shift into
focused attention

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.870
by bringing the
awareness to the breath.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.900
OK, you could also choose any
other object of meditation.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.495
Sometimes people focus
on a candle or a mandala.

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:20.850
You can notice the
rising and falling

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.120
of the breath in the body.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.070
And in this form of
meditation, your awareness

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.660
is steady and focused.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.480
So if the mind wanders,
just notice the thoughts

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.067
without judgment, and then
gently bring the awareness back

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:39.650
to the breath.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.490
Take a few more breaths
in stillness here.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:55.727
And then slowly open the eyes,
bring the awareness back.

00:11:55.727 --> 00:11:56.226
OK.

00:11:59.904 --> 00:12:01.320
Now, I don't know
about you, but I

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.216
find meditation to be incredibly
difficult, particularly

00:12:05.216 --> 00:12:07.590
in this day and age when we
have so many things competing

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.610
for our attention.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.370
We are constantly
distracted, and our minds

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.370
are notorious at wandering
from thought to thought.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.080
So it is really hard
even just to string

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.470
a few moments of uninterrupted
thought together.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.830
And for years I tried
meditation off and on,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.350
hoping that it would give me
some refuge from the stress

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.180
that I experienced.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.580
And I thought that meditation
was about relaxing the mind

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.740
and cleansing the
mind of all thoughts.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.200
But I found that to
not be true for me.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.080
Meditation is really hard work,
and it takes a lot of practice

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.080
to get there.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.500
But that hard work is worth it.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.570
We're are getting better insight
into how meditation affects

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.730
the brain thanks to
advances in FMRI technology.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.020
So a study of people who
meditate versus people

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.540
who don't found that brain
areas linked with attention

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.070
and sensory processing are
thicker in people who meditate.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.970
And it's not just a correlation.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.590
They found that the longer
that people meditated,

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.760
the thicker those parts
of the brain can become.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.910
So we can really change our
brains through mental training.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.330
And even though focusing
the mind is hard work,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.030
it doesn't take
long to experience

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.320
the benefits of meditation.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.820
So just meditating for 20
minutes a day for four days

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.010
can result in
significant improvements

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.460
in cognitive skills.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.000
But it's not just
cognitive skills

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.265
that improve with meditation.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:31.990
So in 2009, Antoine
Lutz and his team

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.310
tested participants before
and after participating

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.160
in an intensive three-month
meditation retreat.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.480
And they practiced mindfulness
meditation on a daily basis.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.160
Meditators were found to
be significantly better

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.630
at selectively training their
attention compared to people

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.130
who were just
starting the practice.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.360
And just earlier
this year, there

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.890
was a study published from
the University of Miami

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.770
that reported that students who
took a seven-week mindfulness

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.680
based training course showed
significant improvement

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.940
in attention and
diminished mind wandering

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.980
compared to a control group
that didn't participate in this.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.660
And they had increased
mind wandering

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.680
over time and diminished
attention and focus over time.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.400
So when we create this habit of
practicing focused attention,

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.220
it becomes easier with practice.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.780
Focused attention
is like a muscle,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.670
one that gets stronger
with exercise.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.330
Just like core, when you
practice forearm plank, which

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.195
is one of my favorite
strengthening exercises to do.

00:14:33.195 --> 00:14:36.890
So the more you do it,
the easier it becomes.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.360
And it's this clarity of
mind, this focused attention,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.760
that is paramount to the
active product development.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.940
A cluttered mind leads to
cluttered UI and design.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.400
And an unfocused mind leads
to a confused experience.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.010
Focus refers to paying
attention to what

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.230
is most important and
meaningful in the moment,

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.530
but it's also an
act of letting go.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:06.350
Simplifying and decluttering
are also mindfulness practices.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.080
And there are ways to practice
living in the present moment.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.910
In product development,
lack of focus

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.300
often stems from a
deeper issue around ego.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.830
So for example,
maybe we don't want

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.080
to cut features
because we don't want

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.750
to disappoint early adopters
who want power and flexibility.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.100
Or maybe we don't want to
give up potential revenue

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.466
opportunities, even though
it doesn't make sense

00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:30.840
for the product
or for the users,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.310
because we don't want to
leave money on the table.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.620
Or maybe we want to add
functionality to a product

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.130
because it's
technically possible.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.180
And in any of these cases,
it all comes back to ego.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.030
So mindfulness
practices help people

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.430
let go of their ego
and deal with whatever

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.390
is getting in the way of
simplifying and decluttering.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.660
And then simplification
then becomes

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.010
less of an act of
ruthless elimination

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.230
and more an act of
love and compassion

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.890
for the users who ultimately
benefit from the product.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.630
Now let's talk about empathy.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.670
Empathy, like focus, is crucial
for great product design.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.350
In fact, many design leaders I
talk to-- including ones here

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.350
at Google-- will say
that the number one

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.570
skill that they look for when
interviewing potential people

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.230
to join their team is empathy.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.700
It's one of the top things
they look for when hiring.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:33.320
And yet empathic thinking is
increasingly difficult for us.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.830
Our constant connection
to digital technology

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.499
skews us away from real face
to face human interaction,

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.790
to the point where we're not
communicating so much face

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.880
to face but more by computer
mediated communication.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.620
And moreover, many of us
are designing and developing

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.220
technology for human use.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.930
And we are inside these
companies like Google

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.220
where it's dominated by
analytic thinking, right?

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.780
It's run by engineers.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.700
And this is where people
are rewarded and motivated

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.369
to think analytically.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.079
Designers, for example, are
rewarded for their ability

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.119
to rationalize design
based on data and reason--

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.940
hence the term
"data-driven design."

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.790
And that's all very valuable.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.329
But it turns out
that as we engage

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.935
in analytic thinking,
which most of us

00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:22.310
are doing in the
workplace, we're

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.040
less able to engage in
empathetic thinking.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.640
So Anthony Jack from
Case Western University

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.000
found that when people
think analytically,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.100
when they think about the
technical details of how

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.820
something works, they are
less able to really get

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.560
inside someone's brain
and empathize with them.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.270
And then conversely, the more
we try to relate to others

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.310
and really feel their
experience, the less able

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.680
we are to think analytically.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.240
So there's a neurological
divide between these areas

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.110
of the brain.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.350
And that represents
a cognitive tension

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.810
between these two
modes of understanding.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.060
So what does this have to
do with product development?

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.950
Well, product
development, good design

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.670
requires both modes
of thinking, right?

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.430
It requires
technical excellence.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.870
But that technical
excellence have

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.200
to be directed towards a
great user experience, which

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.200
takes empathetic imagination.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.582
And as user experience
people, and those of us

00:18:19.582 --> 00:18:21.040
who work in product
development, we

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.197
try to build empathy for our
users either in the field

00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:25.780
or in the lab.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.520
So we have lots of usability
labs throughout the campus.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.210
We go out on field studies.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.090
These endeavors are really
important and worthwhile.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.520
But they're still
analytic endeavors.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.880
We take notes, we
code the behaviors,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.620
we synthesize what we've seen.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.530
And then we analyze
what we've observed.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.060
But true empathy goes
beyond observation.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.980
It's about feeling their
experience in your bones.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.280
Psychological testing
shows us that people

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.662
tend to be better at one mode
of thinking than the other.

00:18:57.662 --> 00:18:59.370
So you may not be
surprised, for example,

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.750
to learn that women, on
average, tend to be stronger

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.060
at empathetic thinking, and men,
on average, tend to be stronger

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.100
at analytical thinking.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.730
But it's not just a
gender difference.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.940
Like even if you look just
at women or just at men,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.540
there's still a
range of inclination

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.340
towards one mode or the other.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.040
But we can train both networks.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.880
A lot of recent work
suggests that we

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.900
can train our analytic, spatial,
visual abilities by playing

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.090
fast action violent video games.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.450
So women, you might
be pleased to learn

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.980
that if you play violent,
fast action, violent video

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.240
games for two weeks,
you can catch up

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.170
to men in their average
visual spatial skills.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.280
But playing violent,
fast action video games

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.915
was also found to
decrease empathy.

00:19:45.915 --> 00:19:50.170
So training the network in
one direction comes at a cost.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.810
We can also train the
network in another direction.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.270
We can train the
empathetic network.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.840
Much research has proven that
yoga and meditation boosts

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.610
one's empathy and
compassion for others.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.580
So researchers at the University
of Rochester Medical Center

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.480
found that training doctors
in mindfulness meditation

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.530
practices resulted in doctors
being less judgmental,

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.770
both at home and at work.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.050
And another study found
that people's ability

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.880
to recognize people's
subtle facial expressions

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.580
improved dramatically
after practicing yoga.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.410
And this effect was
even more pronounced

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.200
among people who had a
regular yoga practice

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.930
and among people who practiced
a flow sequence for some reason.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.830
Yay, vinyasa flow!

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:40.640
OK, so in addition to being
a meditative practice,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.380
yoga boosts one's
empathy because

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.720
of the mind/body connection.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.550
So we're all familiar with what
tension in the body feels like.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.110
Like when you're
stressed out, maybe

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:53.230
feel tension in the shoulders
or your neck gets stiff.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:59.511
So we understand that our mental
condition affects the body.

00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:01.260
But now there's a
growing body of research

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.370
that suggests that it works in
the opposite direction as well.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.080
The relationship
is bi-directional.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.170
Changes in the body can
change one's motions,

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.390
mood, hormone and
gene expression.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.030
For example, we smile
when we feel happy.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.450
But we also feel happier
when we're forced to smile,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.849
like when we hold a
pencil between our teeth.

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:23.640
And it turns out the
converse is true, too.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.120
So Dr. Eric Finzi ran a
study where he injected Botox

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.840
into the frown muscles
in people's faces

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.720
so they were literally
paralyzed from frowning.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.560
These were among people who
were diagnosed with depression.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.010
And in this case,
27% of the patients

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.790
got better from depression
compared to a 7% improvement

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.500
rate in a control group that
wasn't treated with the Botox.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.860
So paralyzing the face
and preventing people

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.414
from frowning literally
cured people from depression.

00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:58.330
The relationship between
the mind and the body

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.670
is not just limited to the face.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.830
So at Harvard University,
Amy Cuddy and her colleagues

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.510
have studied the
effect posture has

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.580
on hormone production
and gene expression.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.500
And she has given one of
the most watched TED Talks

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.310
out there, so some of you may be
familiar with her work already.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.490
So Cuddy and her team
put research participants

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.200
in different kind of postures
and measured their hormone

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.980
levels.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.830
So some people were put in
high power poses-- so like,

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.140
legs apart, hands on the
hips, that sort of thing,

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.320
like gigantic movements
that take up a lot of space.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.990
And then other people
were put in low power

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.850
more submissive poses,
like legs crossed,

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.900
arms crossed, people
shrinking within themselves.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.280
And after just two minutes, they
found that testosterone levels

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.960
shot upwards amongst the people
who were in high power poses,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.234
and cortisol levels
decreased among these people.

00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:49.900
And then they gave
these people a chance

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.350
to play a gambling
game and found

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.160
that being in a high power
pose made them much more

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.810
aggressive later on.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.080
So what she found was that our
non-verbal language governs

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.850
how we think and feel,
and that our bodies

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.527
can change our minds.

00:23:04.527 --> 00:23:06.860
And so if you think about
this in the context of product

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.240
development, changing the body
and changing the postures,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.400
the postures that we assume
during different phases

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.000
of product
development and design

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.380
can totally change
how we think, how

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.830
we approach the act of design.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.834
So like in today's modern age,
we are doing a lot of this.

00:23:23.834 --> 00:23:25.750
In fact, a lot of us are
doing this right now.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.200
We are constantly in
a defensive posture.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.660
And this defensive posture
reinforces our natural tendency

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.260
to protect ourselves,
especially our egos.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.640
And this can lead to
tension in the body that

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.950
builds up and
inhibits our openness

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.200
to new ideas, new
people, new situations.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.640
And so to counteract that,
we have to open up the body

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.460
and release the
tension that builds up.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.360
The spaciousness that
we create in the bodies

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.550
helps create spaciousness
in the minds-- so

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.490
like an open body, an open mind.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.870
Yoga poses that help
open up the shoulders

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.700
and the chest are
often referred to

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.540
by yoga teachers as chest
openers or heart openers.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.730
In the same way that they
help create spaciousness

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.670
in the chest cavity, they
create spaciousness in the heart

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.020
and are thought to help people
deal with challenging situation

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.360
like difficult
relationships or relating

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.060
to other people
or new situations.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.370
So let's try opening up
the body for a few moments.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.300
So let's all stand
up for a moment.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.990
OK.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:36.235
And nothing too fancy.

00:24:36.235 --> 00:24:37.610
I'm wearing a
dress, so we're not

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.070
going to go into
downward dog or anything.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.010
But just take a deep breath in
and inhale, bring arms that in

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.430
and then grab the left
wrist with your right hand.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.090
And then as you exhale,
lean over to your right.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.880
So you guys are going to
be leaning over there.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:59.200
And you can make your breath
long and smooth and steady.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.120
And if you want to
exaggerate this opening

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.790
along the left side body, press
that left heel into the floor.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.142
And at the same time,
lengthen the right side body.

00:25:08.142 --> 00:25:10.100
And then come back to
center, change your grip,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.520
and then go on the other
side on the exhale.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.020
Press the right
heel into the floor.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.190
And then inhale,
come back to center.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.200
Now interlace your
hands behind your back.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.760
So start with the collar
bones and widen them,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.390
roll the shoulders
back, and squeeze

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.690
the tips of the shoulder
blades together.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.400
OK, and then lift your
sternum up towards the sky.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.390
Lengthen the tailbone
towards the heels.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.940
Lift your chest, lift your gaze.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.980
And then maybe move your hands
away from the sacrum just

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.240
to open up the chest and
counteract the rounding

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.740
that we do all day.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.410
And then exhale, release.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.380
Now you can sit back down again.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.390
And one final thing,
you can take a twist.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.320
So as you sit down, maybe
grab the back of your chair.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.870
Or for those of you who
are sitting on these cubes,

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.370
grab onto the stool
or just anything

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.690
that gives you leverage.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.757
Take a breath, inhale,
and then get tall.

00:26:09.757 --> 00:26:12.215
And then exhale, give yourself
a little twist to the right.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.380
And then inhale, come back
to the center, change sides.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.220
Exhale, twist to the left.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.820
And if catch anybody's eye,
you can give them a smile.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.880
And inhale, come back to center.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.350
Now didn't that feel good?

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.180
Yes.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.295
OK, all right.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.810
Now let's talk about creativity.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.950
We can exploit the
mind/body connection

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.970
to help build empathy
toward others.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.630
And in the same way, we can
use the mind/body connection

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.570
to improve our creativity.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.285
So I want talk about
the psoas for a moment.

00:26:54.285 --> 00:26:55.910
I talked about the
mind/body connection

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.660
as it relates to the
face, the neck, the chest

00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.410
and the shoulders.

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.034
But there's also a
mind/body connection

00:27:01.034 --> 00:27:03.300
as it relates to the hips.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.760
The psoas muscle
is the only muscle

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.790
to connect the spinal
cord to the legs.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:16.120
And it's responsible
for holding us upright.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.190
It helps us lift our legs
in order to walk or run.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:23.110
And a healthy functioning
psoas stabilizes the pelvis

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:28.700
and provides a protective
core for the abdominal organs.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.670
And the psoas is
connected the diaphragm

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.400
through fascia, or
connective, tissue which

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.880
affects both our breath
and our fear reflex.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.500
And that's because the
psoas is directly connected

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.500
to the reptilian brain.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.230
It's the most
ancient interior part

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.230
of the brain stem
and spinal cord.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.620
And our fast-paced modern
lifestyle constantly

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.730
triggers and
activates the psoas.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.480
So the psoas is
constantly tight.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.530
Because it's connected
to the reptilian brain,

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.510
we are ready to fight
or flight, like it's

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.280
ready to trigger you to curl
up into a protective ball

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.510
or to launch you into
action to run away

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.010
from that tiger
that threatens you.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.980
And in this modern
day and age, we're

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.140
constantly contracting
the psoas because we're

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.320
sitting all day, either
behind the driving wheel

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.070
or behind the computer.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.760
And it causes the
muscle to shorten.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.760
When it's short, it can lead to
a whole host of painful issues,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.120
painful situations, like
low back pain, sciatica,

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.927
disk problems, hip degeneration.

00:28:33.927 --> 00:28:35.510
Sometimes people
believe it can relate

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.370
to menstrual
problems, infertility,

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.660
and digestive problems.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.900
So a very critical muscle,
and a lot of people

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.080
have never heard of it.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.850
And this situation
is exacerbated

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.070
by our modern lifestyle.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.410
And we have
ill-defined chairs that

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.050
distort our posture,
high-heeled shoes that

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.960
lead us to distort
our posture as well.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.510
And it just curtails
our natural movement

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.850
and further
constricts the psoas.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:04.920
So why is this relevant?

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.420
Well, a relaxed psoas
is the body's mark

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:15.660
of play and creativity,
instead of a contracted psoas,

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.170
ready to run or fight.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.660
The open release psoas is
ready to lengthen and dance.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.100
This is called dancer's pose.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.120
You can see how open
the psoas is here.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.460
So a mobile, healthy psoas gives
us the benefits of mobility

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.380
and also the physical comfort
of just being in the world.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.000
So it leads to a more
calm way of being.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.180
Yoga teachers will
often anecdotally report

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.710
that people with more
open hips are naturally

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.180
more creative and playful.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.785
And the physiology
of the body suggests

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:50.480
that there could be
something to that.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.010
By releasing our
hips and hip flexors,

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:56.190
we release our stored anger
and negative emotions.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.210
And by letting go of our
anger and negative emotions,

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:04.270
we free ourselves to become
more playful and creative.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.000
So meditation also
affects creativity.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.710
But how it affects
creativity depends

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.484
on what kind of
meditation you engage in.

00:30:10.484 --> 00:30:11.900
So remember when
I said that there

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.830
are multiple forms
of meditation?

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.590
What we practiced
before is a form

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.754
of focused attention meditation.

00:30:18.754 --> 00:30:20.170
There's another
form of meditation

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.430
called open
monitoring meditation.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:28.210
And in focused
attention meditation,

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.340
this is a very common
practice in Hindu traditions.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.870
Open monitoring
meditation is more

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.652
common in Vipassana practices.

00:30:36.652 --> 00:30:38.110
And in this form
of meditation, you

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.150
practice monitoring your
experience from moment

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:41.880
to moment.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.880
And you let your mind wander
without any kind of reaction.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.030
So you're entering the world
with curiosity, acceptance

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:56.150
and openness, and without
reaction or judgment

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.400
or the need to hold on
or do anything about it.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.400
So we're going to try that now.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.880
So come to a comfortable seat.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.450
Again, take a posture that
allows you to hold with dignity

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.880
or be relaxed and
alert at the same time.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.180
And close the eyes for a
moment and direct your breath,

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.840
direct your attention to the
abdomen, maybe an inch or two

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.160
above the navel.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:29.130
And find that point that
seems the clearest to you.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.230
Just notice it in your
mind, you don't actually

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.430
have to look at it.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:38.670
Notice how as you breathe
in, the abdomen expands.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.400
And as you breathe
out, it contracts.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.400
Notice the rising and the
falling of the breath.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:53.580
And as the abdomen
rises and falls,

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.690
observe the motion
with your mind

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:58.940
from the beginning to the end.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.250
Just keep watching the
rising and falling.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.730
You don't have to do
anything or control anything.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.340
You don't have to describe
them or judge them.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.700
And then bring your attention
to whatever experience

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.130
or thought comes to your mind.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.440
In this form of
meditation, your attention

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.431
is flexible and malleable.

00:32:29.431 --> 00:32:34.840
It's kind of like paper
flowing in the wind,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.910
or like a feather drifting off.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.610
And anything that
comes to your mind

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:52.100
is fair game as a focal
point for meditation.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.100
You can choose to
train the attention

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.460
on that thought or
that experience,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.580
or you can allow your mind to
drift off and get carried off

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.330
to something else.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.320
Slowly bring the awareness back.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:50.340
Take a few more breaths here.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:57.804
And then come back into the
room and open your eyes.

00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:04.000
OK, so research done in
2012 in the Netherlands

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.470
at Leiden University compared
open monitoring meditation

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.920
with focused
attention meditation

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.900
and looked at those
effects on creativity.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.520
And what they found was that
open monitoring meditation

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.250
helps foster people's
ability to think divergently.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:26.139
And this is exactly what we want
to do in design brainstorms is

00:35:26.139 --> 00:35:26.930
divergent thinking.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.740
That's the ability to
generate a lot of ideas

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.857
in a period of time.

00:35:31.857 --> 00:35:33.440
This is also the
kind of thing that we

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.280
do we design sprints or in
workshops that are often

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.820
hosted here at The Garage.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.000
So we want to generate
as many ideas as possible

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.230
when we're brainstorming.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.060
And open monitoring
meditation helps with that.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.530
You can practice both
focused attention meditation

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.990
and open monitoring
meditation at the same time.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.900
The simplest way to do this is
just to focus on the breath.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.640
And then as the
mind wanders, you

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.190
notice the thoughts
without judgment,

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.670
and then gently bring the
attention back to the breath.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.620
And in this way, it's very
similar to circuit training

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.930
at the gym, where you're
mixing in high intensity

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:16.100
cardio with resistance training
and alternating between them.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.480
So this is a nice way to
cultivate the ability to focus

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.510
and the ability to be
creative and think divergently

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:23.280
at the same time.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.720
Yoga starts, out for many
people, as a physical product,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.600
and then naturally evolves
into the art of living well.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.020
As negative habits,
thoughts, behaviors,

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.910
influences within
ourselves and outside start

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:45.320
to progressively
get dropped in favor

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.830
of healthier ways of thinking
in being in the world, yoga

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:53.250
becomes a way of life and
moving through the world.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.490
It becomes not about what
we do, but how we do things.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.260
And this is where the impact
of yoga and meditation

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.240
is the most profound and
is most transformative.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.270
Mindfulness practices
help you let

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.880
go of fear-- fear
of being judged,

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.330
fear of trying new things.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.800
When you let go of fear,
you can truly be present.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.000
When you're present, you
are more able to fully enjoy

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.620
the experience of whatever
activity you're engaged in.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.740
And being able to
enjoy the journey more

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.750
than the destination is
one of the best things

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.800
that you can do for
your creativity.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.880
Stanford psychologist Philip
Zimbardo studied this effect

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.520
and demonstrated this
phenomenon through his research.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.220
He studies what
happens to people

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.250
when they're engaged in creative
activities that are focused

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:44.940
on the final outcome as
opposed to just enjoying

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.689
the process of making.

00:37:46.689 --> 00:37:48.230
And so in this study,
what he did was

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.680
he took Stanford
college students

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.890
and had them paint pictures
of a basket of flowers.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.240
And in one condition,
he told them

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.890
that judges from
the art department

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.920
would evaluate the
quality of the paintings

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.666
based on different criteria.

00:38:03.666 --> 00:38:05.040
And the other half
with told just

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.580
to focus on the
artistic process itself.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.230
And after participants finished,
several graduate students

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.390
from the art department came
and evaluated the paintings

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.070
based on different criteria--
such as technical merit,

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.540
such as best uses of colors,
space, and layout, and then

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:25.120
also on creativity, such
as originality and novel

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.560
use of color and design.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.370
You may not be
surprised to find out

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.760
that the people
focused on the present

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.740
were judged to be
the most creative.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.450
And people in the
product condition,

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.620
the people who were focused
on the final outcome,

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.986
produced paintings with
the most technical merit.

00:38:39.986 --> 00:38:41.735
And these findings
suggest that creativity

00:38:41.735 --> 00:38:46.680
is fostered when people are
disposed towards the present,

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.780
and that technical
merit is cultivated

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.030
when people are focused
on the final outcome.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.640
And here are a
few examples here.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.540
So this painting
in the top left is

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.250
painted by somebody who is in
the product condition, focused

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:00.590
on the final outcome.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.850
The paintings on the
bottom are painted

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:04.970
by people who are in
the process condition,

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:09.002
so they were told to just
enjoy the act of painting.

00:39:09.002 --> 00:39:10.460
And this one in
the upper right was

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:15.600
painted by somebody who was told
to focus on the final outcome,

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.060
but self-describes
as somebody who

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.000
just enjoys the act of painting.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.380
You can see he was a little
bit frustrated there.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.440
So successful design
requires both creativity

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.630
and technical merit.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.689
So we need both.

00:39:29.689 --> 00:39:31.480
We need to be focused
on the final outcome,

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.180
and we need to just
enjoy the act of making.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.142
And so as we engage in design
and product development,

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:39.600
it's important for
us to understand

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.740
what mindset we
should be in depending

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.480
on what phase of product
development we're in.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.340
So when we're
ideating, it's crucial

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.390
that we let go of
judgment of ideas

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.960
so that we can free ourselves
to be more creative and playful

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.870
and generate a lot of ideas.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.990
And then when our egos
are not put on the line,

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:59.180
we can then be more
playful and relaxed.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.160
And when you're more
fully engaged in play,

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.360
you lose some of those
psychological barriers that

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:09.050
inhibit you from
generating your new ideas

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.880
or editing your thoughts.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.850
And then knowing that the
mindset around product

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:18.510
orientation is crucial
when it comes to converging

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:22.040
and narrowing down the choices
and refining the product

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.680
and focusing on the details.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.660
So concretely, what can
you do to prime your body

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.940
and your mind for
product development?

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.665
Well, nothing beats a regular
yoga and meditation practice.

00:40:35.665 --> 00:40:38.040
So there's this [INAUDIBLE]
that you should be practicing

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.081
for 20 minutes a day--
unless you really need it,

00:40:40.081 --> 00:40:42.079
then you need to
practice for an hour,

00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:43.620
and if you can't
find the 20 minutes.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.600
But more seriously,
like everybody

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.910
can find five minutes.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:49.860
So I would encourage you, if you
don't have a regular practice,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.900
just to start there
and find five minutes.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.800
And then maybe over
time, that five minutes

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.960
can grow to ten minutes
and maybe twenty minutes,

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.850
just to sit with yourself.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.540
And in terms of yoga,
practicing for at least an hour

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.690
per day, three days
a week, can lead

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.840
to significant improvements
in opening up the body.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.150
But if you don't have time
for regular yoga practice,

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.740
here are some simple
things that you

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.060
can do to prime the
body for design.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.110
When you're seeking
inspiration-- such

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.070
as you're in the
ideation process,

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.090
maybe you're trying to
generate, brainstorm,

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.630
and come up with a lot of ideas.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:32.260
Chest and shoulder openers
and side body stretches

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.440
help open up the
body to new ideas,

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.520
new thoughts, new people,
help prime the body

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.290
for that openness that
we talked about before.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.555
Simple poses like
supported fish pose--

00:41:41.555 --> 00:41:44.910
this is a nice, passive pose--
or standing crescent pose help

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.590
create that spaciousness
in the body.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.920
And then stretching
also prepares the body

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.450
for the design process
for design brainstorm.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.290
So in addition to opening up
the shoulders and the chest,

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.600
opening up the hip
flexors with pigeon

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.830
or opening up the psoas
with a low crescent

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:06.700
lunch or a cobbler's pose helps
facilitate divergent thinking,

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.330
and it open the psoas, allows
for playfulness and creativity.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.120
And then when you're ready to
execute and refine your design

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.310
ideas, focused
attention meditation

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:19.660
helps improve your ability to
focus, simplify, and declutter.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.930
Forward folds turn you
inwards so that you

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.710
can find the introspection
that you need to synthesize.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:30.700
Now, I know that this
idea of doing yoga at work

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.110
might be discomforting at first.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.410
I've actually led hackathons
at startups and school board

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:40.550
meetings, like strategic
outsides, with some stretches.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.510
And even though people feel this
is a little awkward and weird,

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:46.440
it actually-- people are so
grateful for that opportunity

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.850
to breathe and to
open up the body

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.440
before they go into
these brainstorms.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.240
It just gets them
into the right mindset

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.780
around playfulness
and creativity.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.180
So it might seem awkward.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.940
Out of any company
in the world, this

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.890
is the place to do it,
because the whole [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.380
and all the support
we have here.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.260
So it may not be as
awkward as you think.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.070
But even outside of
Google, companies

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.900
are really embracing this.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.730
General Mills, Aetna are
embracing yoga and meditation

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.370
at work.

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.990
Twitter cofounder Evan
Williams meditates regularly,

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.160
and now at his new
startup, Medium,

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.210
they sponsor people to
go on yoga retreats.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.675
Justin Rosenstein, who used
to work here at Google, then

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:34.140
at Facebook, and now is
the co-founder of Asana,

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.430
sees mindfulness not just
as a way to improve oneself

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:41.820
but uses these as principles
to run his company

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.440
and informs how they
develop products.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.260
So the principles of
yoga and brain science

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.670
are now converging.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:55.850
And together, they can create
a blueprint for transformation.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.520
With meditation
and yoga, you can

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.760
change your brain and how
you move into the world.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.360
And that, in turn,
affects how you

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.068
approach product
development and design.

00:44:05.068 --> 00:44:06.443
Personally, I've
experienced some

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:09.900
of the most creative
periods of my career

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.420
since adopting a regular
yoga and meditation practice.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.940
And while I haven't
done concrete AB studies

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:19.150
on anybody or myself, I
can only have my experience

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.890
to share, which I feel
so passionately about.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:25.610
So back to that scenario that we
talked about at the beginning,

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.600
where you're working
on a hard problem.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.000
Sometimes when you
just relax and let

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.070
your mind wander
and release yourself

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.250
from working on that solution,
some insight might reach us.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:39.610
And the solution
then becomes obvious.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:43.320
And we can train our minds
to be better at this.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.990
Focus, empathy,
and creativity-- we

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:48.930
all have the capacity
to strengthen

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:53.660
these skills and the
means to do that better.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.240
Mindfulness practices
are techniques

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.950
that allow us to
dive within the mind

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.650
and transcend the intellect
so that we can experience

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.790
that deepest level within
ourselves, which we can bring

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:07.230
forward to the work that we do.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:08.580
Thank you.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.599
Any questions?

00:45:18.599 --> 00:45:20.390
Here's my contact
information if any of you

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:21.540
want to contact me later.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.260
OK?

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
where you're talking,

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.112
but I hadn't heard
that before about--

00:45:36.112 --> 00:45:38.554
you had that one scientist or
whatever who said that when

00:45:38.554 --> 00:45:40.920
people are really analytic--

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.438
IRENE AU: Yeah,
Anthony Jack, yeah.

00:45:43.438 --> 00:45:45.146
AUDIENCE: Did I
understand you correctly,

00:45:45.146 --> 00:45:47.230
it's like if you focus
on developing one,

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.890
it actually weakens the other?

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.540
IRENE AU: Yes, it
weakens the other.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:50.357
Yeah.

00:45:50.357 --> 00:45:51.790
AUDIENCE: That's sad.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:52.800
IRENE AU: Yeah.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.060
It also made
tremendous sense to me

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.410
in the kind of as I reflected
on my own experience

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.620
at Google, because we're a
very highly analytical culture.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.850
And it's why I'm so grateful
for programs like SIY,

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.300
because they help strengthen
people's emotional intelligence

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.700
and ability to empathize
and relate to other people.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:16.070
These were similar
initiatives that we advocated

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.880
for within the user
experience team

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.060
too, through user research,
and helping people.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.110
Many of you who
joined Google might

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:25.580
have gone through the
new hire program where

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.030
we had life of a user.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.740
I don't know if we still run
that now, but when I was here

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.140
we have life of a
user, where we tried

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:37.390
to put people in the
mindset of user's shoes

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:41.770
and help them use that as
stimulus to inform and inspire

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:44.670
product ideas and innovation.

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:49.970
And so it's very much akin
to what SIY is trying to do.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:54.810
It's trying to boost empathic
thinking and imagination,

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:57.626
because when we naturally
think analytically here.

00:47:00.345 --> 00:47:00.845
Yeah?

00:47:00.845 --> 00:47:03.720
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
muscle in our hip that--

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.200
IRENE AU: Yeah, the psoas.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.674
It's spelled P-S-O-A-S.

00:47:08.674 --> 00:47:11.048
AUDIENCE: Do you have where
we can learn more about that?

00:47:11.048 --> 00:47:11.950
That's so interesting.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:13.825
IRENE AU: There is a
whole book on the psoas.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.230
And the name of the author
escapes me, but I will--

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:20.360
AUDIENCE: Liz Koch.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:20.620
IRENE AU: What's that?

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:21.540
AUDIENCE: I think it's Liz Koch.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.581
IRENE AU: Yes, that's it.

00:47:22.581 --> 00:47:23.165
Liz Koch.

00:47:23.165 --> 00:47:23.915
AUDIENCE: K-O-C-H.

00:47:23.915 --> 00:47:25.750
IRENE AU: Yeah.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:26.250
Yeah.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.210
AUDIENCE: She also does
workshops on the psoas

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.525
periodically in the area, so
you could look her up too.

00:47:30.525 --> 00:47:31.150
IRENE AU: Yeah.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.566
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's a great read.

00:47:32.566 --> 00:47:34.430
IRENE AU: Yeah, an
entire book on the psoas.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:35.430
AUDIENCE: It's worth it.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.360
IRENE AU: It's funny, I learned
about this phenomenon called

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.280
gluteal amnesia also, in
which some people have trouble

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.550
like folding forward
and touching their toes.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.030
And a lot of that is
related to tightness

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.760
in the lower back,
which is related

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.220
to tightness in the hip flexors.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.060
And some of us, over
time, lose connection

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.920
to the gluteal muscles
and the hamstrings which

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.130
fire in order to fold forward.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.520
And there are a lot of exercises
that you can do in order

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.120
to retrain yourself and get
those muscles to fire again.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.420
But that alone is often
responsible for a lot

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.370
of low back pain that
people experience.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.180
And especially
amongst the community,

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.276
because we are sitting
at our computers so much.

00:48:20.276 --> 00:48:20.942
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:48:20.942 --> 00:48:24.844
I was just describing my dad
and, lower back pain in life.

00:48:24.844 --> 00:48:27.790
Super, super, show me
your resources and data

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:30.736
on back pain [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:30.736 --> 00:48:32.700
That's a good start.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.680
IRENE AU: Right, yeah.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.090
It's hard to do AB studies
though, so a lot of it

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.970
is anecdotal.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:41.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you for that.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.250
I wonder how much of it
is to do with our body's

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:48.410
system, that generally
although yoga is becoming sort

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:53.232
of trendy and interesting
now, our value is still

00:48:53.232 --> 00:48:55.200
placed so strongly on
the analytical side,

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.436
so that if you introduce
mindfulness and all

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:02.340
these things, people might
still discount it as, that's

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:06.346
just a little bit weird,
you know, hippy or whatever,

00:49:06.346 --> 00:49:08.050
especially like at Google.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.915
How do you deal with
that, and how do you

00:49:09.915 --> 00:49:11.660
introduce it in your startups?

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.486
I'm really curious
on your [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:13.486 --> 00:49:15.270
Do you they just trust
you because you're

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:16.359
their design partner?

00:49:16.359 --> 00:49:17.900
IRENE AU: I'm not
doing this with any

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.085
of the companies
in the portfolio,

00:49:20.085 --> 00:49:22.130
so the whole yoga thing
is a separate thing.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.338
I just started last week.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:29.669
Yeah, and both modes of
thinking are important.

00:49:29.669 --> 00:49:31.710
And I don't mean to
disparage data-driven design,

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.230
because it is
important to use data

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:34.580
to inform design decisions.

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:39.760
But it's also important
to go into this other mode

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.710
of thinking, like the
creative mind is not

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:42.790
the analytical mind.

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.810
And I hope that people
understand that more

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:49.430
and appreciate the different
mindsets that you can engage in

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:53.260
so that you go into the
appropriate frame of mind

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.980
during different parts of
product development and design.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.960
It was quite a revelation to
me as we developed this design

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.030
sprint methodology when
we deliberately said, OK,

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:08.240
in this mode we are now entering
divergent thinking mode.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.800
And whoever's facilitating
these design sprints,

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.370
we trained the facilitators
to embrace every idea

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:18.540
and to not judge
anything as they get

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.490
generated so that you
can kind of encourage

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:25.075
a lot of playfulness and a
lot of ideas being generated.

00:50:25.075 --> 00:50:27.450
And then there's a deliberate
break in that design sprint

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.930
phase, where we say,
OK, now is the time

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.320
to prioritize and converge.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.130
And so it's a way of sneaking
in these different modes

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:41.500
of thinking without calling on
like anything that might seem

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.570
eerie [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.560
And so as facilitators,
like anyone

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.200
who's facilitating
designs for brainstorms,

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:56.060
kind of has some ability
to kind of facilitate that

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.680
by saying like, OK,
let's just take a moment

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.350
to be with ourselves as we go
into this phase of the design

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.570
brainstorm, for example.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.560
AUDIENCE: You're always
making it analytical.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.970
IRENE AU: I know, because I'm
speaking to this audience.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:10.500
Speaking to this audience, yeah.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:18.519
But that's the culture
that we're in, yeah.

00:51:18.519 --> 00:51:19.954
Yeah?

00:51:19.954 --> 00:51:20.954
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:51:20.954 --> 00:51:25.824
What kind of meditation do you
practice regularly, and then

00:51:25.824 --> 00:51:28.989
do you have any advice for
when you kind of get to a point

00:51:28.989 --> 00:51:33.052
where you plateau a little bit
in meditation and mindfulness?

00:51:33.052 --> 00:51:34.260
IRENE AU: That's interesting.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.330
I never thought of
the word "plateau"

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:40.100
to describe my own
practice, because I

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.940
don't think of it in terms of
like trying to get anywhere

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:46.170
or trying to measure it or
evaluate it in some ways.

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:48.860
It's really about
taking a few moments

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:55.900
to just sit and be with myself
in a mode where I'm not judging

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.790
or processing or
reacting to anything.

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:04.480
And in terms of
what forms, I mean,

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.230
really what I think
about it, I have

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.660
been practicing this for much
longer than I even recognized.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.950
I started journaling
when I was nine years old

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:17.580
and continued that regularly
up until a few years ago.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.065
And so that's a
form of meditation

00:52:19.065 --> 00:52:21.980
in a way as a
mindfulness practice.

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.100
I practiced
meditation off and on.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.860
But honestly, it really
did not resonate with me

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.070
until just a few years ago
when I combined it with yoga.

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.400
So for a long time
for me personally,

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.140
sitting alone and
just being with myself

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.580
was really, really hard to do.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:40.150
And so I just directed
a lot of that energy

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:41.850
into physical energy.

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:45.410
So a lot of the
exercise that I do

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.840
becomes meditative
in its own way,

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.060
because I'm training
my mind to-- I

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:53.100
engage in really highly
choreographed, high intensity

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.300
cardio stuff.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.150
So that choreography
requires me to stay focused.

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:03.020
Otherwise, if I go off thinking
about work or something,

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:06.340
then I'll mess up and I won't
get the routine or whatever.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.010
So that's one way that
I use to train my mind.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.080
And then I also just
sit with myself.

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:18.320
And even if it's in a moment
where I just don't have time

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:24.040
to deliberately sit and om, just
taking a few mindful breaths

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:27.836
is sometimes all it takes
to re-center myself.

00:53:27.836 --> 00:53:30.870
So I don't really think
of in terms of plateauing.

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.715
It's a way of coming
back to center.

00:53:32.715 --> 00:53:33.590
Does that make sense?

00:53:40.338 --> 00:53:41.800
Anything else?

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:47.250
OK, well thank you so much
for you coming and sharing.

00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.700
And feel free to contact me
if you have any other thoughts

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.360
or questions.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.900
I really appreciate
your attention.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.850
[APPLAUSE]
