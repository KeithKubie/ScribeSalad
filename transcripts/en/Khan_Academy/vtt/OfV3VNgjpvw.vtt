00:00:00.853 --> 00:00:02.311
- [Voiceover] We're now
going to start looking at

00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:05.941
ecology, which is just the
study of how life interacts

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:08.274
with other life or how
living things interact

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.540
with each other and their environment.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.427
And you you could think of it well how

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.477
is life interacting with living beings?

00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:18.265
So that's the technical term often given

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:20.133
as biotic factors,

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.966
biotic factors, you have
the word bio in there

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:26.546
signaling life,

00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:29.629
or non-living things, abiotic factor.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.967
A is the prefix often for not,

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:36.324
so abiotic is not living,

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:40.122
not living factors, and those
are just the technical terms,

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:43.518
but if you even think about
yourself as you watch this video

00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:47.433
you are in an environment,
you are interacting with it.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.178
There are many abiotic
factors around you that you

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:53.261
might notice, the air
that you are breathing,

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:56.909
the temperature, your access to water,

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.112
but there's also biotic factors.

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:01.024
Even if you think you're in a room alone,

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:03.521
you're not fully, you're
not completely alone.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.794
There is bacteria around you that

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:07.145
you might not see.

00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:08.539
There might be other forms of life,

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:09.890
you might have a plant in the room.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.017
Those are the biotic factors
that you are interacting with.

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:14.683
That plant in that room
might be producing oxygen

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:16.415
that you are then breathing,

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:18.395
or you're producing carbon
dioxide which that plant

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:20.308
is able to fix and grow.

00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:22.783
And it might be interacting
with abiotic factors

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:25.663
like sunlight to in
order to that it uses in

00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:27.621
photosynthesis in order to fix the carbon.

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.444
We study all of that in
some depth in biology,

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:33.718
and really ecology is a
bit of a synthesis of a lot

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:36.598
of what we learn, if
anything, all of what we learn

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:39.906
in biology because it's taking life,

00:01:39.906 --> 00:01:43.259
it's studying life at another level

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.689
where it's not just the
individual organism anymore,

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.425
and it's not even just the
population or the community,

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:53.092
but we're talking about
an even bigger system that

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:55.974
is incredibly complex and that's why it's

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:57.525
a really interesting thing to study.

00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:00.833
Now all of these images here
are things that folks would

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.690
associate with an ecosystem.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.490
Over here you have a coral reef,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.966
and some of the life is obvious,

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.868
you see the coral, you see the fish here,

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:13.839
but there's also life
that you're not seeing.

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.403
There's going to be bacteria in this water

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.316
that's not visible at
least in the picture.

00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:21.196
And the abiotic factors are going to

00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:22.884
be things like the water temperature,

00:02:22.884 --> 00:02:24.707
or frankly, just even
the existence of water,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:27.205
or the salt content of the water,

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:29.567
or other minerals that are in the water.

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:30.894
In these pictures over here,

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:33.010
you don't necessarily see the animal life,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.811
but there is for sure
going to be if you were

00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.689
to dig into this grass or
look through those bushes

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.991
you will find animal life,

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:42.421
you will find insects, you
will find other animals.

00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:44.198
The trees are life,

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:46.320
so that's going to be
part of the ecosystem.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.631
If we're studying ecology we think about

00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.051
well how do these trees
interact with the water,

00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.784
how do they interact
with the other species?

00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:54.999
How do they provide shelter for them?

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.082
Or food?

00:02:56.082 --> 00:02:58.151
Or how are they dependent
on the other life

00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.342
in some way to grow?

00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:01.479
Same thing for in this case the mushrooms.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.845
How does the fungus living
on this tree branch,

00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:10.278
or in conjunction with the
moss and whatever else?

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:12.843
All of this is the study of ecology,

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:15.115
the study of ecosystems.

00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:17.163
Now when folks are talking about ecology

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.300
they like to talk about different scales.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.071
And so let's now think
about the different scales

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.468
within an ecosystem, or
even beyond an ecosystem.

00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:31.879
So I have some pictures that
if you watch a wildlife show

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.395
you typically see some images like this,

00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:37.276
and so since we at least
are familiar with it,

00:03:37.276 --> 00:03:39.615
at least on TV hopefully we
get to visit this at some

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:42.337
point in our life, let's just
think about the different

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:45.398
characters here on the
different ecological scales.

00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:49.148
So at the most basic
scale is the individual.

00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:51.968
So let me write this down,

00:03:51.968 --> 00:03:54.781
you have the individual.

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:57.212
So if we were talking
about these elephants,

00:03:57.212 --> 00:04:01.082
the individual would be
one individual elephant

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:02.634
right over there.

00:04:02.634 --> 00:04:05.717
Now the next scale is the population,

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:11.109
the next scale is the population,

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.995
and if we were to stick with
our African savanna theme

00:04:13.995 --> 00:04:16.581
right over here, the population,
you have an individual

00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.889
elephant, the population
would be the members

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.994
of that same species
that live in that area.

00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.717
So in this case the population would be,

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:28.034
would at least include
these elephants that we see

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.127
in this picture, there might
be a couple of elephants

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:32.062
that are off the picture,

00:04:32.062 --> 00:04:33.683
and I should say in
particular these are going to

00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:35.032
be the African elephants.

00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:36.519
So it's the members of the same species

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:39.490
that are living in the same place.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.097
And it's up for the classifier,

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:43.178
or the scientist,

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:44.370
whoever is studying it to define

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.823
what do we mean by
living in the same place?

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:49.005
We might define it as the people,

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.436
you know, the people
(laughs), the elephants

00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:55.261
that live within a few
miles of this watering hole.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.871
You might define it as
the elephants that live

00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:00.213
within a broader area,
it could be you know,

00:05:00.213 --> 00:05:02.956
that live in East Africa, or South Africa,

00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:04.329
whatever it might be.

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:06.264
And so defining the population is

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.739
all the members of a species
that live in an area,

00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:12.249
but that area is up for definition.

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.064
Now the next level up is the community,

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:16.481
is the community.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.520
And that is all the living things that

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.873
might live in that area
however we define the area.

00:05:24.873 --> 00:05:28.068
So for example, if this
lion and this giraffe

00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:31.600
lives in the area that we
used to define the population

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.121
they would be members of the community.

00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:36.806
Let me circle that,

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:39.464
so they would be members of the community.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.600
And it wouldn't even
just be the big animals

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.984
that you see here, it
would include all the life

00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:46.010
that is in that area.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.835
So it would include the
vegetation that is in the area,

00:05:49.835 --> 00:05:52.625
it would include the bacteria,
it would include the fungus,

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:54.492
it would include any animals that

00:05:54.492 --> 00:05:57.440
are living inside of this
water that you would see there.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.468
Now if you go even one more
level of kind of inclusion,

00:06:01.468 --> 00:06:03.801
then we go to the ecosystem.

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.138
So then we go, I'll go down here,

00:06:07.138 --> 00:06:08.892
then you go to an ecosystem.

00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:11.502
And what an ecosystem is,

00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:13.752
it's all of the living
things in that community,

00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:16.115
so all of the living things in an area,

00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:18.590
and then you're also adding
the non-living things,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.593
the abiotic factors.

00:06:20.593 --> 00:06:22.164
So you're including the rock,

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:25.022
and the air, and the
weather, and the clouds,

00:06:25.022 --> 00:06:28.555
and the water itself that is
part of that watering hole.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.557
And a lot of times you
might think that the

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:34.247
abiotic factors well they for sure affect,

00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:37.580
they for sure affect the biotic factors.

00:06:38.928 --> 00:06:40.795
If you don't have water,
or if the temperature

00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:43.405
is too cold or too hot
it might be hard for a

00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:46.308
certain type of life to thrive,

00:06:46.308 --> 00:06:47.658
but it goes both ways.

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:50.741
The biotic factors affect
the abiotic factors.

00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:54.521
We have oxygen in our
environment due to life on Earth.

00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:57.491
They might also affect the various,

00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:01.706
the chemical composition of
certain parts of the abiotic

00:07:01.706 --> 00:07:05.967
factors, say the water, or
the soil, or whatever else.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.993
And if you want to get a
level above an ecosystem,

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:12.908
then sometimes you'll hear
people talk about a biosphere.

00:07:12.908 --> 00:07:16.241
Biosphere, which is, you can think of it

00:07:17.543 --> 00:07:20.603
as a meta-ecosystem, or
oftentimes in my head

00:07:20.603 --> 00:07:24.518
I view it as a fully, it
contains all of the ecosystems

00:07:24.518 --> 00:07:26.701
that are in some way
connected to each other.

00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:30.444
So a fully enclosed,
fully contained ecosystem.

00:07:30.444 --> 00:07:31.816
And biospheres are actually,

00:07:31.816 --> 00:07:35.484
well I guess the most
famous biosphere (laughs)

00:07:35.484 --> 00:07:38.432
or the one that we're
typically referring to

00:07:38.432 --> 00:07:40.682
is we could refer to the
whole Earth as a biosphere.

00:07:40.682 --> 00:07:42.148
It has multiple ecosystems,

00:07:42.148 --> 00:07:44.283
and once again,
ecosystems, it depends what

00:07:44.283 --> 00:07:46.060
the researcher wants to
define as an ecosystem.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.400
They could define it as you know,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.180
just something around a certain
river in a certain area,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.475
just like that, or they might define the

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:56.321
ecosystem as a broader region.

00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:58.615
But all of the ecosystems in the world

00:07:58.615 --> 00:08:01.902
are part of the biosphere that we know as

00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:03.735
that is part of Earth.

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:07.301
And it's self-contained
because we don't think

00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:08.786
that there are that many influences

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:10.136
from outside of the earth.

00:08:10.136 --> 00:08:12.882
Although, even there, we
have to give some credit to

00:08:12.882 --> 00:08:16.369
the Sun that is providing
abiotic factors for sure.

00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:18.147
We wouldn't have life
on Earth as we know it

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:19.521
without the Sun.

00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:21.213
And there's also things like the Moon

00:08:21.213 --> 00:08:22.355
the gravitational effect,

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:24.245
you could consider that an abiotic factor,

00:08:24.245 --> 00:08:26.517
without the tides we would
not have life as we know it.

00:08:26.517 --> 00:08:27.912
But one thing that's really fun,

00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:30.434
and as many of you all know
I enjoy science fiction,

00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:32.593
is to think about well
what kind of biospheres

00:08:32.593 --> 00:08:35.158
could you have if you think
about beyond the Earth?

00:08:35.158 --> 00:08:36.511
And this is a depiction here,

00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:38.556
this is actually from NASA's website.

00:08:38.556 --> 00:08:42.316
How humans could create
biospheres outside of a planet,

00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:44.023
and it's this interesting thing where

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.836
you know that's quote,
unquote land up here.

00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:49.155
Artificially created, and
then you would rotate it

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:52.911
so that there's the perception of gravity.

00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:55.206
But anyway, the study of ecosystems,

00:08:55.206 --> 00:08:58.312
the study of biospheres, the
study of ecology in general

00:08:58.312 --> 00:09:00.405
is incredibly, incredibly fascinating

00:09:00.405 --> 00:09:02.744
because when you have
all of this complexity,

00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:05.692
each living thing is incredibly complex.

00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:06.862
In fact if you want,

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:09.158
you could even sometimes
consider part of a living thing

00:09:09.158 --> 00:09:11.115
as an ecosystem in and of itself.

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:12.803
If you were to look even on
the surface of your hand,

00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:14.717
you have bacteria living
there that's dependent

00:09:14.717 --> 00:09:16.470
on you in some way, and
you might actually benefit

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.293
from the bacteria, or actually get hurt

00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:20.408
from the bacteria in some way.

00:09:20.408 --> 00:09:21.938
So there's all sorts of different scales,

00:09:21.938 --> 00:09:24.661
but once you start factoring
everything in together

00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:26.529
it becomes these incredibly
beautiful, complex,

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:28.728
often balanced, sometimes
imbalanced systems

00:09:28.728 --> 00:09:32.095
that have emergent
properties that start to,

00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:34.428
that start to have behaviors

00:09:37.251 --> 00:09:39.504
and I want to use that word very loosely

00:09:39.504 --> 00:09:42.195
that are somehow described,

00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:43.631
or I guess you could say properties

00:09:43.631 --> 00:09:47.631
that somehow describe
the ecosystem as a whole.
