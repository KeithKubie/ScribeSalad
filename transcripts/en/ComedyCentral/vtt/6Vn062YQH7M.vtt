00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.801 line:92%
Do you have a celebrity crush?

00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:03.169 line:92%
Lots of celebrity crushes.

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.370 line:92%
Who's like the one.

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:06.305
So there's this light skinned
black girl who was in

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:09.242
Saved By The Bell in New Class,
she's still an actress now,

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:12.678
her dad is married
to Beyonce's mom,

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.148
so you got to put all
the math together and find her

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.649
because I don't even remember
her name,

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.952 line:92%
she's so obscure but she's hot.

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.523
What's up everybody,
I'm Chris DiStefano,

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:27.093
AKA Chrissy Hazelnut Spread,
and this is live from the limo,

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.862
Stupid Questions,
it is stand up month,

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.898
I am with James Davis,
his special airs tonight

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.266
it's called Live
From

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.801
The Town,
you're going to like it,

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.903
you're going to love it,
let's get naked.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.707
What would you say
is your weirdest

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.443 line:92%
recurring nightmare or dream?

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.678
I have this dream that
I'm still in college,

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:48.281 line:92%
and that there is a class

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.349
that I just have not been
showing up to,

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.285 line:92%
and it haunts me like,

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.687
"Yo you're failing this class,
you just don't go.",

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.556
maybe I have unfinished
business or something but-

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.824 line:92%
Well did you graduate college?

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.058 line:92%
Absolutely not.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.326 line:92%
Yeah well I feel like-

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.561 line:92%
I'm a comedian.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:02.862
Look at this,
now in the back of the limo,

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.597
(bleep)
with hour specials.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.832
Yeah, yeah,
See that?

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.034 line:92%
Yeah take that tuition money.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.106
Listen if you know me,
you know that I like fun facts

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.341
so what is a fun fact
about your special

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:16.742 line:92%
that people need to know?

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:20.146
Show one, not that high,
show two, high off my ass.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.581
Woo, and show two
is what most people

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:22.782 line:92%
are going to be seeing, right?

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.117
It's a mix.
Oh really?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.585
So there's going to shots
where I'm like,

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:26.986 line:92%
"Oh I'm locked in.",

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.521
and then there's a cut away
and it's like,

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.156 line:92%
"Oh look at those eyes."

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.524
Does your mom
like your special?

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:32.758 line:92%
My mom was at my special.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.327
So you don't mind performing
in front of your parents?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.595 line:92%
Actually no, I don't mind.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.796 line:92%
You don't mind.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.931
I feel like, they've seen me
at my worst,

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:41.767
they know all my secrets,
there's nothing I can do

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.504
to really embarrass myself
in front of them,

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.539
because I mean
they cleaned my poop.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.808
My mom has picked me up
from a party

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.144
where I was drunk,
you know like-

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.079
Is that when she cleaned up
your poop?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.017
Here we go, if your life
was a cocktail,

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.920
actually know you know
what let's be honest,

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:02.588
if your life was a type of weed
what would it be,

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:03.956 line:92%
let's just be real here.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.258 line:92%
Let's be real here.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.893
Let's be real, what kind
of weed is your life?

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:11.364
A indica dominate hybrid,
goodness gracious

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:12.798 line:92%
I hate how specific that is.

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:15.802
Listen you're having a problem
and America knows.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.640
Now a strand,
I would just say Green

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.942
Crack, I just like the name
Green Crack.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.177 line:92%
Green Crack!

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.279
Heres the thing green,
I'm making money,

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.247
crack,
that's like my jokes,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.950
they're addictive,
they have you coming back,

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:34.187
"I need more of that James
stand up comedy.",

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:36.255
I don't know ...
you don't put the crack.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:37.489 line:92%
No you don't.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.793
I think not, but we've already
established weed is my drug,

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.963
now that is something
I don't want my mom to see.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.700
That was Stupid Questions limo
edition stand up month edition,

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:50.603
it's kind of like a new kind
of deal that we have this month,

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.171
you still get
a stupid gift, okay?

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.439 line:92%
Okay.

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:56.409
Now it's January,
we're in New York,

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.645
you're from L.A.,
you like hats, so I thought,

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:03.049
"Why not get you a New York
a hat that does look

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.351
like the colors
of a certain New York team,

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.387
but it is not, we just bought it
as a 99 cents store.",

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.856
and it's for you and I know
you're swagged out,

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.093
so that I figured
is the hat for you.

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:19.232
It reminds me of the beanies
that Eddie Murphy and Arsenio

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.301
Hall were wearing in
Coming To America

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:23.636 line:92%
when they got to New York.

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.671
There you go, now you've got
something new

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.407 line:92%
to masturbate into, perfect.

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:28.208 line:92%
Genius.
