00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.429
We could actually do this calculation,

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.383
the circumference over diameter, for
any circle and get the same number.

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:13.492
Its true value is actually 3.141592, and

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:20.900
actually it just keeps going on and
on and on pretty much forever.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.220
But usually it just
gets rounded to 3.14.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.312
We give this number the name pi,
which we write like this.

00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:35.290
So this is the symbol for pi and
we can also write it like this, P-I.
