- You know, I really--

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.003 size:81% position:41%
I hate to waste your time,

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:07.106 align:start position:0%
but I'm really not looking to do
more advertising right now.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:08.174
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, no.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:09.342 align:start position:0%
- Okay? I'm so sorry.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.810 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, no worries.
I hear that.

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:12.879 align:start position:0%
- Okay, that gives me
a certain amount of relief.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.113
- Definitely hear that.
- Thank you.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.114 align:start size:56% position:44%
- How you feeling?

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:16.382 size:75% position:38%
- I'm in the sweet spot,

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.384 align:start position:0%
not too drunk,
not too sober.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:21.054 align:end position:100%
- Me, too, baby.
Let's go in for the kill.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.056 align:start position:0%
- You got it, pal.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.491 align:end position:100%
- Jack, you're known
all over town as the guy

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:26.693 align:start size:78% position:22%
with a dick in his mouth.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.866
- Well...it's not just dicks.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.034
- No, it's not.
- It's not.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:36.736
- I've seen boobs.
- Yes.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.037
- I've seen poop.
- I have too.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.539 align:start position:0%
- I've seen a butt
pooping boobs.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.340
- Yup, yup.
- I've seen Andre the Giant.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.009
- I've seen that.
Don't get it, but I've seen it.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.044 align:end position:100%
- And let's not forget
about the speech bubbles.

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:47.480
- Yup, yup.
- "I'm hungry for turds."

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:48.915 size:88% position:44%
- That's right by my church.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.349
- "I'm thirsty for dongs."
- Mm-hmm.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.152 align:start size:63% position:38%
- "Feed me wieners."

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.357 align:start position:0%
- Do you think
it's just one guy?

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:00.827 align:start size:34% position:66%
- No, Jack.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.929
- But we at Cramblin-Duvet

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.098
can put an end
to all that nonsense

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.033
by rebranding you

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.902
in a television commercial.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.205
- To be honest, the billboards
don't really bother me, okay?

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.841 align:start position:0%
I actually--I think
they're kind of funny.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.109 align:start position:0%
You know what I mean?

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.578 align:start position:0%
Young man, I know
what you're doing.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.546 align:start position:0%
You're busted.
Yeah, that's great.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.115 align:start position:0%
You're using
forced perspective

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.250 align:start position:0%
to make it look like
I'm fellating that bread stick.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.519 align:start position:0%
Grow up. Grow up.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.921 align:start position:0%
Oh, and there we go.
Dinner roll balls.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.858 align:start position:0%
Dinner roll balls,
really original.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.094 align:start position:0%
You know what?
I am tired of this.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.863 align:start position:0%
Sign me up.
Let's do this.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.965
- All right.
- Oh, man, okay.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.234 align:start position:0%
- Champagne...of beers.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.869
- You've already had
five drinks each.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.770
- Just bring them!
- What's your problem, man?

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.439
- Oh, I am really excited
right now.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.641 line:0%
This feels good.
- It's gonna be great, Jack.

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:49.742 align:start position:0% line:0%
- Whoo!

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.044 align:start position:0%
[laughs]
