[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:27.790
TIM BRAY: Hey, everyone.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.535
My name is Tim Bray.

00:02:28.535 --> 00:02:30.260
I'm with the identity
group at Google.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.570
And with me today, I have Eric
Sachs who's the lead PM in the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.890
identity group and sort of our
thought leader on this whole

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.670
identity and login stuff.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.040
And you don't have to dig very
hard to uncover a deep level

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.230
of dissatisfaction in the user
experience of the internet and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.140
how people feel about passwords,
and how this makes

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.880
everybody's life online
a little less pleasant

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.810
than it could be.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.390
So Eric, how bad is it really?

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.450
ERIC SACHS: How bad is it?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.280
Well, bad enough, and
getting worse.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.710
So there are different
forms of bad.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.090
thought is on Google's site,
we did a blog post a couple

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.280
months ago where we mentioned
that we see periods of time

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.660
where a single hijacker using
stolen passwords based on

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.800
password reuse is trying to
break into a million different

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.130
Google accounts every
day for weeks.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.050
That's just a single guy.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.520
And the reason that it's getting
worse and worse is

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.640
password reuse.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.590
The hackers have realized,
you know what?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.090
They don't need to break
into Google anymore.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.470
And hopefully most of
you all know this.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.010
They go on break into other
websites that are less secure.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.150
And the press has started to
talk about this more and more.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.180
And those of us who run websites
are probably starting

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.220
to feel more and more
embarrassed.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.820
To be honest, Google and a
foundation called the OpenID

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.320
Foundation, we want to ratchet
up that embarrassment level a

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.090
little bit.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.120
There's actually a website the
OpenID Foundation is putting

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.370
together called
accountchooser.net.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.830
And if you go there, you'll
notice on the left is a link

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.510
for this user's page which has
a lot of visuals and text

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.210
explaining the password reuse
problem because we find, for

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.650
the average non-technical
user, they don't really

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.800
appreciate what's happening.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.130
And for those of you watching
who don't, the general idea is

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.910
that the attackers don't go
directly to banking websites,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.200
Google, social networks and try
to break past all of our

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.360
security layers because
we have lots.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.660
Instead, they go to websites
where they might be able to

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.180
even break into the back end
of the websites, get the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.450
password lists and email lists
of these websites.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.070
And now that they have those,
great, now they can go and try

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.600
to use those against websites
that have more valuable

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.570
information.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.180
So the first problem is this
password reuse thing is making

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.070
it easier for these hijackers
to get into accounts.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.870
The other worst thing is that
they're making more and more

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.610
money from it, which is
the next thing this

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.600
website talks about.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.270
It gives the example of the
hackers sending fake mails to

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.280
the friends and contacts of
someone whose accounts they've

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.720
taken over, tricking them into
saying, oh, I was traveling.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.490
I lost my wallet.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.470
I can't pay the hotel bill.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.580
I know we haven't
talked a while.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.530
Will you wire me money?

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.760
And people do.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.640
It's embarrassing for them.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.390
They lose a lot of money.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.160
It's embarrassing for you.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.500
Your friends are tricked.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.410
And this is because
of password reuse.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.590
And if you read the press, our
best advice to end users is,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.970
well, use a different password
at every website.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.420
And I don't know about you all,
but I'm embarrassed if

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.580
that's the best advice
we can give.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.990
And so this is where Google and
other companies are trying

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.400
to help websites move away from
that model into using

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400
identity providers.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.590
TIM BRAY: Well, I think we've
got pretty good consensus that

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.540
the best way out of the password
trap is to go to

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.460
federated identity and use
identity providers rather than

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.500
building your own fragile

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.230
infrastructure on your own site.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.280
So is it that easy?

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.230
You just push a button
and you're

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.670
doing federated identity?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.960
ERIC SACHS: Yeah, I really wish
it was, to be honest.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.180
As soon as we get to the point
where it's that easy, we're

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.500
going to be more aggressively
getting this message out to

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.350
the industry to put more
pressure on websites to make

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.100
that change.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.120
But I'd say right now, there are
two classes of websites.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.730
One class of websites who gets
fire from identity providers

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.530
not just for getting rid of
passwords, but actually they

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.930
get other values from API
integration from these

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.540
identity providers.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.760
So social login is a big
example, enterprise API

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.190
integration is another one.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.930
For those websites, sure, it's
a lot of work to support

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.180
identity providers.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.640
But they got a lot of bang for
the buck from it, not just

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.220
getting rid of passwords.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.220
A lot of other API
[? probably. ?]

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.990
But what about all the
rest of the websites?

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.580
They may be just trying to get
out of the password business.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.630
They're not ready to do all that
fancy API integration.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.500
So for them, a lot of work.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.900
Not as much value.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.450
And in fact, what we find is
they don't even recognize

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.840
upfront necessarily
how hard it is.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.270
There are hard problems that
lead to a lot of users calling

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.000
help desks.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.980
And that drives websites
crazy because it

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.280
drives up their costs.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.590
There are also really hard
questions and edge cases to do

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.410
with what we refer to
as account linking.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.200
So you may have seen
this yourself.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.390
You go to a website
that added one of

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.590
these buttons for login.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.020
You click it, and the website
says, oh, you have an existing

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.510
account here.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.920
Why don't you go through this
wizard to bind your existing

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.400
account to this new account
and connect them together?

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.890
Building those flows and
handling all the edge cases is

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.390
a lot of work.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.830
Now fortunately, there are
vendors who are starting to

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.310
provide software and services
to make this easier.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.910
So in fact, this same website,
accountchooser.net, it has a

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.110
link for website owners.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.400
And down at the bottom, a link
to more information about

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.770
identity providers and
vendors who can help.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.820
And we're getting better
and better at this.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.820
But not to the point
that it's easy.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.780
We're also doing further
optimizations to the protocols

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.320
like OpenID Connect and other
tricks to address some of

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.570
these user experience problems
and make it simple.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.160
But to be honest, there is
still some ways to go.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.250
TIM BRAY: And bear in mind, the
cost of not doing it, as

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.330
you pointed out, is
still pretty high.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.570
ERIC SACHS: Yes.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.830
TIM BRAY: So where
do you start?

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.490
What's the first step?

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.660
ERIC SACHS: So there
at least there is

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.220
some pretty good news.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.660
This website we referred
to, it's called

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.100
accountchooser.net.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.640
And you might be wondering,
OK, well what the heck is

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.240
Account Chooser itself?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.390
What we've found is that to
address these problems a

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.610
website is having, I mentioned
one set of problems is users

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.120
calling help desks
with confusion.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.200
A lot of that is around
the user experience.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.830
And so the industry, actually
a bunch of what we like to

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.420
call backstabbing competitors,
Google and others, have

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.850
actually developed a user
experience we're happy with

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.190
that actually helps a website
who's purely password based,

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.730
not doing anything with
identity providers.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.070
And once actually a website is
[INAUDIBLE] that, they tend to

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.100
really like that, then it's
actually pretty easy for them

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.560
to do staged deployment of
identify providers in a more

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.610
controlled manner.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.720
But before we talk about that,
Tim, why don't you just run

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.260
through a demo?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.500
TIM BRAY: Sure.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.020
Yeah, this is one of my
favorite little demos.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.970
I've got this little website
called favcolor.net

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.780
that does one thing.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.310
It remembers your
favorite color.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.360
And when I go there,
you see this thing.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.660
This is not favcolor branded
except in the right side of

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.180
the screen there.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.975
This is the cross-account
Account Chooser.

00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:34.429
It remembers all the accounts
I've used to log in to one

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.390
thing or another.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.559
So you can see I have
my personal address,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.070
textuality.com.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.179
And I can log into that
using Facebook.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.270
And it went to the
Facebook IDP.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.910
And it says, oh, I know
your favorite color.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.665
It's this nice royal purple.

00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:50.230
We'll just turn it into a lurid
pink and save that.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.980
So that's now my favorite
color, a lurid pink.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.370
So I can switch over and log in
to that same textuality.com

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.170
email address via Google as
opposed to via Facebook.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.520
And it goes to Google.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.215
And pop, there I am logged in
with that sort of puce,

00:09:04.215 --> 00:09:06.810
whatever favorite color.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.080
So what you're seeing there is
one click sign in with the aid

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.920
of an identity provider.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.040
Now, Account Chooser, as Eric
says, works even if you don't

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.490
have an identity provider.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.420
It still helps you log in with
passwords and so on.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.100
But I want to show you one other
thing, which is in the

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.070
Account Chooser, you see also I
have access through my Gmail

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.250
account here.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.360
Now, if I click on that one, it
says, oops, I haven't been

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.000
there before.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.830
So Google pops up and
says, is it OK to do

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.100
this with this account?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.130
And I say, yeah, sure,
that's OK.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.900
And it goes back to
Account Chooser.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.400
Now, if you look carefully at
the fine print here, it says,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.690
we don't know your
favorite color.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.210
So we're picking
one at random.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.160
So what I was showing
you there was not

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.936
one click sign in.

00:09:43.936 --> 00:09:47.040
It was one click sign up, which
is starting to become

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.040
possible with the combination
of identity providers and

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.590
front end technology like
Account Choosers.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.470
Now, we're not there yet.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.750
Account Chooser is available.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.370
We're still working on
technologies to get it better

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.160
bootstrapped for a better
end user experience.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.370
But it's really starting to
be a potential reality.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.570
So we do make process.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.520
ERIC SACHS: Yes.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.210
And so one of the key things
that Tim mentioned is while

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.800
this works great, once your
website is in this future

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.340
world with identity providers,
think about a website who's

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.870
still doing everything
with passwords.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.150
A user comes to a site
like this one.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.650
They click an email address that
the operating system, the

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.760
browser, whatever it is, and
there are cross platform ways

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.350
to do this, knows
are frequently

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.640
used on this device.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.420
The user clicks their
email address.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.930
That email address comes
to this website.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.230
And now your website gets
to start being smart.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.560
The first thing it can do is
say, oh, I've seen that email

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.640
address before.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.360
So let me ask the user
for a password.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.480
Or it can say, well, I haven't
seen it before.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.130
So let me show a sign-up form.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.245
Let me pre-fill the email
address and get the user to

00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:40.890
fill it out.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.783
So all of a sudden, you've at
least avoided the need for the

00:10:42.783 --> 00:10:45.810
user to remember sign in, to
sign up, and you've avoided

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.950
the need for them to retype
the email address, which

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.770
especially on mobile devices,
is a huge win.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.770
It ends up this is a very
small amount of work for

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.540
websites to get deployed.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.250
And I think Tim can
speak to that.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.710
However, what really becomes
powerful is now you get to do

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.520
what we call percentage
experiments, controlled

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.180
experiments with identity
providers.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.700
Where what you could
do on your website,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.610
say, you know what?

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.800
Let me pick all the users who
are, say, Gmail email

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.370
addresses who start with the
letter A. And any time one

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.280
comes to our website and clicks
an email address that

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.280
meets that criteria, then I'm
going to do as Tim described.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.620
I'm going to bounce them over
to Google, use Google as an

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.000
identity provider, and
bring them back.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.310
And I was mentioning before that
the industry as a whole

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.980
is working to the user
experience, the technology,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.020
Google supports the latest
versions of OpenID Connect.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.710
And in fact, in that, there's
this optimization we have

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.340
where the website can say, hm,
I already know the email

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.760
address the user is using.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.650
So let me start a flow
with Google.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.565
And tell them, hey, I already
got the user's email address.

00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:46.450
I just want to know whether that
email address is logged

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.710
in here. yes or no,
[? nothing like ?] that.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.100
And that's what Google
responds back.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.460
We just respond back to
the website yes or no.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.760
And if the website sees yes,
then it says, oh, OK.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.430
Well, the user clicked the email
address they wanted.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.160
I know they're logged into
that email address.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.550
Let me just log them in.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.440
There's no user experience
change for users here.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.480
They just go to the site, click
the account they want.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.900
And instead of being asked for a
password and then logged in,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.450
they're just logged in.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.560
So you can do this with, say,
a small percentage of users.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.060
And start to see, OK,
does it impact other

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.940
parts of your website?

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.800
And then you can try to, say,
delete passwords from some of

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.380
those users.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.820
And you'll probably find
things in your

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.585
website that do break.

00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:25.080
Your mobile apps might be hard
coded for passwords.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.690
Your account management page
might be hard coded for that.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.060
And you can go and start
tracking those things down,

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.760
fix them, get it changed.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.410
And then, over time, add support
for more fancy things

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.080
like identity providers who
are not email providers or

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.740
social network providers
or enterprise

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.240
providers, et cetera.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.910
And so we believe that most
websites who want to at least

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.400
show that they're starting to
get out of the password

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.580
business, this is a first
step you can take.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.040
Because as Tim mentioned, for
all you know, next week is the

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.475
week that your security guys are
going to tell you you've

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:56.500
been hacked, and you have to
announce to the world that

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.980
everybody has to reset
the passwords.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.230
That is huge branch damage.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.810
Somebody's getting fired.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.590
If you can at least show that
you've taken this as a first

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.860
step and you're headed in the
right direction, that's a good

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.770
level of insurance that you can
buy yourself without doing

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.380
as much work and sets you up to
do some of the experiments

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.730
we provide as the industry and
the vendors in this space try

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.070
to work to make it easier and
easier for websites to make

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.540
this happen.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.230
TIM BRAY: So we kind of know
what the future looks like.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.510
And we are actually providing
something of an on ramp.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.210
Start working here, and that's
where you'll get there.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.970
One thing we're saying is that
while Google is standardizing

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.330
on OpenID Connect, this
technology we've been showing

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.170
you would work with a legacy
provider that uses SAML, or if

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.780
they were using Mozilla Persona
or something like

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.780
that, it would all fit
together that way.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:36.530
ERIC SACHS: Yup.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.740
TIM BRAY: So that's kind of a
snapshot of where we are.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.200
Frankly, we're not in a terribly
good situation.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.600
But I think we do have a pretty
clear vision of where

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.280
we need to get to and
the first few steps

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.170
to take to get there.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.460
So I think that's about all we
were going to say today.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.860
Do we have any questions there
that we should be looking at

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.180
from people watching
out there?

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.790
Nothing really?

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.470
ERIC SACHS: All right.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.970
TIM BRAY: OK.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.660
ERIC SACHS: They're all going
to take our advice.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:02.930
TIM BRAY: That's great.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.295
ERIC SACHS: I'd say one last
piece of advice is to say if

00:14:05.295 --> 00:14:06.830
you're listening to this,
hopefully you have some of

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.100
your own ideas in this.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.210
And a lot of the work in this
area are done in organizations

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.400
like the OpenID Foundation, like
these OAuth Community,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.330
OpenID Connect Community,
accountchooser.net working

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.050
group, et cetera.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.160
All these groups are looking
for feedback, in particular

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.100
from websites to tell us what
is hard for them, what is

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.790
keeping them from getting out
of the password business.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.820
We spent a lot of time the last
few years running events

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.610
all over the world to collect
feedback from websites about

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.120
what it takes to get them
out of that business.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.750
We think we've identified the
key problems, the key themes.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.010
But if there are some issues
we didn't talk about here,

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.910
please take a look at some
of these resources on

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.940
accountchooser.net, openid.net,
et cetera.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.850
And let us know either your
suggestions how to do it

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.950
better, or what are some of the
problem that we haven't

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.290
solved that we should
as an industry.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.800
TIM BRAY: Because we haven't
solved all the problems yet.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.520
ERIC SACHS: Nope, not yet.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.480
TIM BRAY: Lots more left.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.350
Thank you, everybody.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.600
ERIC SACHS: Bye-bye.
