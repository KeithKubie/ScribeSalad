00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:03.891
- [Instructor] There are
170 deer on a reservation.

00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:06.851
The deer population is increasing

00:00:06.851 --> 00:00:09.434
at a rate of 30% per year.

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:14.873
Write a function that gives
the deer population P of t

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:17.873
on the reservation t years from now.

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:20.411
All right, let's think about this.

00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:21.684
And like always, pause this video,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:23.706
and see if you can work
it out on your own.

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:26.283
Well, let's think about what P of zero is.

00:00:26.283 --> 00:00:27.644
P of zero, this is going to be

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:29.408
the initial population of deer,

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.822
the population at time zero.

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:35.345
Well, we know that, that's
going to be the 170 deer

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:38.081
that we start on the reservation.

00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:40.033
Now, let's think about what P of one is.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.332
What's going to be the
population after one year?

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:46.550
Well, it's going to be our
original population, 170,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.633
but then it increases at
a rate of 30% per year.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:54.614
So it's going to be 170
plus another 30% of 170.

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:58.495
So I could write that as 30% times 170.

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.407
Or I could write this as 170

00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:02.240
plus 0.3

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:04.140
times 170.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.768
30% as a decimal is the same
thing as 30/100 or 3/10.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:12.242
Or I could write this as,

00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:14.522
if I factor out 170,

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:16.573
I would get 170

00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:18.061
times

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:18.894
one plus

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:22.948
0.3, which is the same thing as 170

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:24.936
times 1.03.

00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:29.971
And this is a really good
thing to take a hard look at

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:31.228
'cause you'll see it a lot

00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:32.983
when we're growing by a certain rate,

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:34.263
when we're dealing with

00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:37.821
what turns out to be
exponential functions.

00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:39.374
If we are growing,

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:43.609
well, I almost made a
mistake there, it's 1.3.

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.334
So here you go, 1.3.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.001
One plus 0.3 is 1.3.

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:51.553
So once again, take a hard
look at this right over here

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:52.924
because it's going to be something

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:55.839
that you see a lot with
exponential functions.

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:58.006
When you grow by 30%,

00:01:59.428 --> 00:02:03.145
that means you keep your
100% that you had before,

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:05.750
and then you add another 30%.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.917
And so you would multiply your
original quantity by 130%,

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:14.971
and 130% is the same thing as 1.3.

00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:18.336
So if you are growing by 30%,

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:21.248
you are growing by 3/10,

00:02:21.248 --> 00:02:25.204
you would multiply your
initial quantity by 1.3.

00:02:25.204 --> 00:02:27.447
So let's use that idea to keep going.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:31.019
So what is the population after two years?

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.480
Well, you would start that second year

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.347
with the population at
the end of one year.

00:02:35.347 --> 00:02:38.447
So it's going to be that 170

00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:39.280
times 1.3.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.353
And then, over that year,
you're going to grow

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:44.120
by another 30%.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.156
So if you're gonna grow by another 30%,

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:49.825
that's equivalent to
multiplying by 1.3 again.

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:53.992
Or you could say that this
is equal to 170 times 1.3

00:02:54.976 --> 00:02:56.643
to the second power.

00:02:57.492 --> 00:02:59.515
And so I think you see
where this is going.

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.466
If we wanted to write a general P of t,

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:06.104
so if we just want to
write a general P of t,

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:10.086
it's going to be whatever
we started with, 170,

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:13.366
and we're going to multiply that by 1.3

00:03:13.366 --> 00:03:17.669
however many times, however
many years have gone by.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.554
So to the t power

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:22.833
because, for every year, we grow by 30%,

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:26.546
which is equivalent mathematically
to multiplying by 1.3.

00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:28.679
So after 100 years,

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.429
it would be 170 times
1.3 to the 100th power.
