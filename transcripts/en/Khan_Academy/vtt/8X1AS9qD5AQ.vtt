00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.750
In this video, I
want to expose you

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.330
to a special class of mirrors
called parabolic mirrors.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.420
Or sometimes called
parabolic reflectors.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.340
And what's neat about
parabolic mirrors--

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.660
and I'll draw a cross
section of one right here.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.360
And if you're familiar
with the algebra,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360
they are essentially-- the
cross section, especially,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.470
is in the shape of a parabola.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.210
So let me draw a
parabola right here.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.200
So it's in the
shape of a parabola.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.440
Just like that.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.190
And what's neat about
a parabolic mirror--

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.231
and I'm not going to go
into the math right here.

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.160
I just want to give
you the general idea.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.560
And let me just draw
its principal axis.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.640
So this is the line of
symmetry of the parabola.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.810
So this is its principal
axis right over here.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.442
It divides it in two.

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:51.650
This is just a cross section.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.066
You could imagine
if this was spun

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.144
around that principal
axis, you would

00:00:56.144 --> 00:00:57.810
get something that
would look like this.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.800
You would get something
that would look like a bowl.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.180
But it's actually the
shape of a parabola.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.475
It's not an actual sphere shape.

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:09.850
So if you rotate
this around, you

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.020
would get a circle
around the edge.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.390
So this would be a
circle right over here.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.450
But this shape down here
is not a hemisphere.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.400
It's not spherical.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.977
It's actually a parabola.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:22.810
And the reason why we
care about a parabola,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.620
or what's neat about
parabolic mirrors,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.850
is if I have parallel
light rays coming

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.730
into a parabolic
mirror-- I'll do

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.370
my best to draw a
parallel light ray.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.550
So parallel to its central axis.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.860
So if I have a light ray
that comes like that,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.610
it will reflect off
of the-- it's parallel

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.300
to this principal axis--
it will reflect like that.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.630
And I'll tell you what's
neat about this in a second.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.260
Now let me draw
another parallel ray.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.843
Let's say I have a
parallel ray that's

00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:58.000
coming in right over there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.830
So it hits the parabolic
mirror at that point.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.150
It's going to reflect--
so it comes in like that.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.449
And if I have another ray
that comes in like this,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.740
it will reflect so that
the reflection goes right

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.270
over there.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.660
So what's neat about this?

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.980
Well, what's neat is
any light ray that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.660
comes in parallel-- any incident
light ray that's parallel

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.250
to the principal axis of
this parabolic mirror--

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.497
the reflected ray is going
to go through the same point.

00:02:28.497 --> 00:02:30.080
I don't care where
you hit the mirror.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.610
As long as it was parallel
to the principal axis,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.420
the reflected ray is
going to hit this point.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.855
And this point right
here is the focus.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.910
This is the focus of
the parabolic mirror.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.170
Now, what's neat about this?

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.670
Well, let's say
that you were trying

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.860
to capture heat from the sun.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.390
You were trying to concentrate
the electromagnetic radiation

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.100
from the sun.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.641
So what you could
imagine-- you could

00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:02.710
go to the middle of the
desert-- and people do do this--

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.490
and you set up of
parabolic mirrors

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.660
like this that are
pointed at the sun.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.412
And the sun's rays come in.

00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:10.870
And the sun is so far away,
they're essentially just coming

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.650
in parallel because they
are radiating from the sun.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.130
But the sun is 93
million miles away.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.770
So the rays for our purposes are
essentially coming in parallel.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.290
And what's neat
about them is, is

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.740
when they hit the surface
of the parabolic mirror,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.449
they all get reflected
to one point.

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.990
So if you have a
ray coming in there,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.620
it's going to get
reflected there.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.550
If you have a ray
coming in like that,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.280
it's going to get
reflected like that.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.380
And so all of the energy can be
focused on a point like that.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.940
And so could imagine you might
have a water pipe running

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.209
into the screen here.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.750
And so all of that
light energy would

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.630
be used to heat up
that water pipe.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.340
So it's a pretty neat way
to concentrate energy.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.910
Another thing you
might want, maybe

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.720
instead of taking
in energy, maybe you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.450
want to give out energy so
that all the beams of light

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.200
are parallel.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.167
For example, let's say you
have a light for a car.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:04.750
If you have a light,
you could imagine

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.670
if car headlights were just--
if I drew a car like this--

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.810
let me scroll down a little bit.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.210
If I drew a car like
this-- let me draw--

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.420
have a reasonable
attempt at a car.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.889
So let's say this is
a car right over here.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:20.930
I think you get the idea.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.460
This is the wheel housing.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.230
That's the wheel.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.460
So forth and so on.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.370
This isn't about the
drawing of the car.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.760
But you could imagine if
we just stuck light bulbs

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.590
at the front of cars.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.600
So you could imagine
just a light bulb

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.360
sitting at the front of a car.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.890
So that's a light bulb.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.640
And that would provide light
but it would provide light

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.377
in all directions
radially outward.

00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:45.710
And it would be kind of useless.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.489
First of all, the
way I drew it here,

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:49.280
it would probably show
up in the dude's eye

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.510
who's trying to drive the car.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.843
But it's a lot of wasted energy.

00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:54.200
A lot of the light is
coming back onto the car.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.720
And it's pointing in all
sorts of random directions.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.720
It's not so useful.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.590
When you are driving
a car, you want

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.320
all of the light pointed at the
road or maybe the stuff that's

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.050
directly above the road.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.810
So how could you
point the light?

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.640
Well, you could use
a parabolic mirror.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.470
And any car you
look at will have

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.630
a light inside of
a parabolic mirror.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.100
And what does that do?

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.400
Let's say instead
of this situation

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.090
that I just drew--
let me clear this out.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.410
And I'll draw it
on a larger scale.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.840
Let's say I had a
parabolic mirror here.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.732
So I have a parabolic mirror.

00:05:29.732 --> 00:05:32.190
Obviously, this looks more like
a snow shovel or something.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.180
But I'm drawing it way huge just
so you get the general idea.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.800
So this is a parabolic mirror.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.480
And let's say we put the light
bulb now at the focal point.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.950
At the focus.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.030
At the focus of this
parabolic mirror.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.517
Now what's going to happen?

00:05:47.517 --> 00:05:49.600
Well, light that has to
go in this direction, that

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.060
comes radially
outward, that's good.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.351
Because that's light that's
being useful to the driver.

00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:55.620
It's actually
illuminating the road.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.810
But light that's going
backwards-- light that's

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.990
radiating outward from that
focus of the parabola--

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.760
it's going to do the exact
opposite of that solar energy

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.470
collector.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.750
It's going to be
reflected out parallely.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.760
Or a parallel way.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.470
And so all of the
light-- because

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.950
of this parabolic reflector,
or parabolic mirror-- all

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.150
of the light that this
light source is generating,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.620
or most of it, is going
to be emitted parallel

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.895
to the principal
axis of the parabola.

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:28.520
And actually you
could point the light.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.770
If you actually moved
this parabola around,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.970
you can point which
direction the light's in.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.770
So it's actually a pretty
useful thing to have.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.240
Now the other thing
about parabolic mirrors

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.385
is that they actually
form real images.

00:06:41.385 --> 00:06:43.260
In the last video, we
talked about the notion

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.130
of a virtual image.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.839
You think something
is there because it

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.880
looks like the light is
converging at some point.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.213
But that point isn't even there.

00:06:49.213 --> 00:06:51.520
It's actually from some other
point getting reflected.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.320
But a real image-- let
me draw it over here.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.910
So let me draw a
parabolic mirror.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.440
Let me draw big
parabolic mirrors

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.640
to make the diagram clear.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.900
And let me draw
its principal axis.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.290
This is a side profile of it.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:13.850
Let me draw its principal
axis, just like that.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.990
And let's put an object.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.730
So I'm going to define a couple
of interesting points here.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.440
So first of all, we
have our focal point.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.970
I'll call that F.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.002
And then there's something
called the center of curvature.

00:07:25.002 --> 00:07:26.960
And the curvature I always
imagine as a sphere.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.440
But for the center of curvature
of a parabolic mirror,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.990
it's actually going to be
two times the focal length

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.240
of this distance right here.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.960
Let me make it clear.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.720
I'll call that-- this
distance right here

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.720
is F. Then this
distance right here,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.150
to the center of curvature,
we'll just call that point C.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.470
But this distance over here
is going to be F as well.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.160
Or it's going to be 2F
from-- you could imagine

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.810
that vertex, or that minimum
point of the parabola,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.599
depending on how
you want to view it.

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.640
Now, what I want to do is
put a couple of objects

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.210
in front of this
parabolic mirror.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.270
And just think
about what happens

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.010
to the light rays
of that object.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.229
So let's first put
an object here.

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:12.270
So I'm just going to draw
the object as an arrow.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.990
And maybe some light
is shining on it

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.462
from who knows what direction.

00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:21.420
But it's going to reflect
that light diffusely.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.920
Assuming it's not shiny.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.090
And I'm just going to
pick points on this object

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.010
to radially emit
light outward from.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.680
Or reflect light outward from.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.080
And see what happens
to those light rays.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.500
And for the sake of simplicity,
whenever you do something

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.809
with a parabolic mirror,
it's good to emit

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.604
one radial ray that's parallel
and one that goes to the focus.

00:08:42.604 --> 00:08:44.770
Because we know what they're
going to do after that.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.695
So let's do one that's parallel.

00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:48.070
And of course,
these are just two

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.667
of the gazillions
of light rays that

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.750
are being emitted from
every point of this object.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.374
But we're just doing
this to understand

00:08:53.374 --> 00:08:55.890
what will the image of this
object actually look like.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.260
So let's do one parallel.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.030
It hits the surface of
the parabolic mirror.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.510
And then it reflects and
goes through the focus.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.280
We know that already.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.815
And then let's make another
light ray go through the focus.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.220
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.850
Another light ray going
through the focal point.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.060
Just like that.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.310
And then it reflects.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.580
And it'll be reflected
in a parallel way.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.000
So what just happened here?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.310
Those two rays that were emitted
by the same point on this arrow

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.510
object, they radially
emit outward.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.340
They reflect on this parabolic
mirror at two different points,

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.280
but then they converge again.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.750
They converge right over there.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.630
And actually if you put-- and we
could do that with every point.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.880
If you did the stuff that
leaves that point-- actually

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.860
both of those are going
to go and come back--

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.970
go through the focal point and
then come back right over here.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.080
They'll keep going.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.580
But you could
imagine, you could use

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.694
with every point on this arrow.

00:09:57.694 --> 00:09:59.110
And what you're
going to do is get

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.700
an image that looks like this.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.840
This point up here
corresponds to that point.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.870
This point corresponds
to that point.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:15.410
And so if you were to put
a screen right over here--

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.620
this is a screen.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.020
It could just be a, I don't
know, white tablecloth.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.670
Or if there was a
wall right over here.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.250
Then it would actually
show the image.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.330
You would actually be
projecting the image

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.740
onto this wall right over here.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.537
It would actually be
a projected image.

00:10:31.537 --> 00:10:33.620
And that projected image
that we're talking about,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.220
where the light is converging--
so the light comes radially

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.580
outward from each
point of this arrow.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.060
And then it converges on
a point on the screen.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.360
That image that gets formed,
we call that a real image.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.590
It's real image.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.044
This is a real image.

00:10:51.044 --> 00:10:52.460
And you might want
to compare that

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.800
to what we call a virtual image.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.350
A virtual image is
an image that looks

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.683
like it's coming from someplace.

00:10:56.683 --> 00:11:00.070
Because it looks like things
are diverging from some point.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.790
But they've really been
reflected off of some surface.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.706
So what we think is
there, really isn't there.

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:07.930
A real image is an image
that's actually projectable.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.460
We could put a screen
right over here

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.920
and then these guys are going
to be hitting the screen

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.620
and essentially defusing
the exact same light

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.700
as this point of
the actual object.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.420
And because of that, the screen
will look just like the object.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.984
This is a projectable image.

00:11:26.984 --> 00:11:28.650
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.450
I realize I've gone
longer than I like to

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.533
with some of these videos.

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:34.220
We'll talk a little bit
more about parabolic mirrors

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.550
in the next video.
