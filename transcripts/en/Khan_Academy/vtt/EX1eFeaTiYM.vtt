00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.340
Let's see if we can understand
the structure of a hedge fund

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.610
a little bit, and also how the
management and the performance

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.140
fees work out.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.940
So most hedge funds,
the funds themselves

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.080
are set up as
limited partnerships.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.330
So this is the hedge
fund that Pete set up,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.620
we'll call Pete Capital Fund 1.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.420
He's maybe in the future going
to start Fund 2, and Fund 3,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.760
and all of the rest.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.210
And he's able to
raise $100 million.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.420
10% of that $100 million,
or $10 million of it,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.590
is coming from him.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.380
Or I guess to be
more exact, it's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.180
coming from Pete Capital
Management, LLC, limited

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.850
liability company,
which he starts off

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.136
as the general
partner of this fund.

00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:41.760
And it might be a
little bit confusing,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.450
but this is one company.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.450
This is another
company over here.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.070
This company is going to manage
the assets of that company.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.160
And in return, it will be
able to get management fees.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.410
And it will be able to
get the performance fees.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.010
And we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.000
And probably, Pete owns
this entire company.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.550
But he might have a couple
of employees, probably four

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.151
or five.

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:04.150
Now, the way it works
with a limited partnership

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.510
is they don't call it
necessarily shares,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.190
but it's essentially
the same thing.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.110
Someone who, out of
this $100 million

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
contributed $30
million, would get 30%

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.940
in the limited partner interest.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.950
Someone who contributed
10% would get $10 million

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.970
in limited partner interests.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.370
So let's just say that he does
really good over the next year.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.890
That he's able to, on a gross
basis, before we take out

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.570
his management fee
or anything else,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.240
grow the fund by $20 million.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.290
So roughly on a
gross basis, 20%.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.370
But this is net of the
trading fees and all the stuff

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.800
that he has to pay, the broker
and all of that type of thing.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.340
To understand what goes to
Pete Capital Management,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.770
that Pete can use to pay himself
and his handful of employees,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.360
first to guess the
management fee.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.807
And the management fee will be
on the average net asset value.

00:01:50.807 --> 00:01:53.390
And I'm going to do it a little
bit back-of-the-envelope right

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.690
over here.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.280
It's normally done
on a monthly basis.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.113
But I want to go into
all of the accounting.

00:01:57.113 --> 00:01:58.984
But if he did this
fairly linearly,

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:00.650
or if you does this
fairly consistently,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.425
the average net asset
value over the year

00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:05.110
would be about $110 million.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.060
So average would be
approximately $110 million.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.790
And so he'll get
about 2% of that.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.310
We're assuming he gets a 2%
management and 20% performance

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.200
fee, or 20% carried interest,
it's sometimes called.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.640
So if the average net asset
value is $110 million,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.170
you multiply that times 2%.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.060
And then that means that he's
going to get $2.2 million

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.940
in management fees.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.360
And this is for his salary,
his employee's salary,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.990
to pay the rent,
to I don't know,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.360
get some fancy computers,
whatever it might be.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.230
This is kind of viewed as the
cost just to manage the fund.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.160
So we need to subtract that from
the total amount in the fund,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.118
because that's going to
the management company.

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:51.559
So instead of $120 million
over here we're going to have,

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.100
what is that?

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.595
$117 million 0.8,
$117.8 million.

00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:03.470
And then we'll have to
calculate how much she

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.310
gets in a performance fee.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.650
So in this situation, net
of his management fee,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.029
we have a $17.8 million gain.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.320
So let me write that over here.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.200
We have $17.8
million in profits.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200
The way that we've
set up the performance

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.030
fee, or the carried interest,
is it Pete gets 20% of it.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.610
Or more particular,
the general partner,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.250
the Pete Capital
Management, LLC,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.370
the partner that is controlling,
that as managing this fund,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.980
will get 20%.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.500
So let's multiply
that times 20%.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.650
And what does that give us?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.900
That gives us $3.56 million.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.210
So $3.56 million will also go
to Pete Capital Management.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.850
So not bad.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.860
In this year he made a
little-- almost $6 million.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.020
And that's probably
going to go to him

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.290
and probably four
or five employees.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.710
So it can, if someone
performs well,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.030
it can be a very
profitable business.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.260
And just to make it clear
how the mechanics work here

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.070
is that these funds tend
to be open end funds,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.520
like open end mutual funds.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.269
Well not like them,
they have to be private.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.630
They could only take money
from accredited investors.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.112
They can't market themselves.

00:04:20.112 --> 00:04:21.820
They don't have to
register with the SEC.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.600
But when I say that they can
be open-ended it means that

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.300
at any point-- well
not at any point,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.640
usually this is restricted--
at certain points

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.870
in time the
investors are allowed

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.339
to redeem, or kind
of add investments,

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:34.630
to what's going on in the fund.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.630
So let's say after the end of
the year, so instead of $117.8,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.660
we're going to have to
subtract $3.56 from that

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.499
for Pete Capital Management.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.290
So what's left in the
fund is going to be--

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.810
and he could leave it
in there to reinvest,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.460
but that would just
increase his share.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.920
But let's say Pete Capital
Management takes it out.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.830
So we'll be left
with-- let's see

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:11.370
we have 117.8 minus
it gives us 114.24.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.580
So over here, what's left
of the fund is 114.24.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.340
And let's say this
period, investors

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.500
are allowed to redeem
their interest.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.410
And let's say this
guy right over here,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.540
this guy with the 30% interest,
he says, you know what?

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.950
That was a pretty good year.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.181
I want to take 10%
of my interest out.

00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:29.680
So instead of having
a 30% interest,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.780
he wants to have a 10% interest.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.860
So what happens is,
so instead of a 30%

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.740
this is now 20% interest.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.260
He'll take 10% out.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.850
So he'll take 10% of 114.24.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.860
So he's going to take
out-- that's essentially

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.010
going to be-- we just have
to move the decimal places

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.750
one over.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.977
So he's going to take
out $11.424 million.

00:05:50.977 --> 00:05:52.310
That's this guy right over here.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.270
He's going to take
out $11.424 million.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.580
And then the fund will
decrease by that amount.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.479
So he can, at these specific
periods, people can redeem.

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.020
Usually it's at the
end of the month,

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.062
at the end of the quarter,
or the end of the year.

00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:08.520
So then the fund
will be left with,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.650
what's 114-- let me take
the calculator out again.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:21.880
The fund will now be left
with 114.24 minus 11.424

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.814
which is going to be 102.816.

00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:29.230
And at the same
time, other people

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.200
might say, hey, that was
a pretty good return.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.480
I'm going to now
contribute to the fund.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.030
So either way,
it's not like it's

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.250
a closed-end fund where
just at the beginning,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.700
people can commit their capital
and they can't take it out

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.100
until the end of the fund,
or they can't add more.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.630
During the life of most hedge
funds, at specific periods,

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.410
people are allowed to
redeem their funds.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.370
Or they're allowed
to add more funds.
