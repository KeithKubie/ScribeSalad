00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.040
In this diagram we have two
arcs centered at point p.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.641
Arc AB.

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:06.140
And you could imagine
this arc could

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.120
be part of a circle like this
that is centered at point AB.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.070
And then you have
this larger arc

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.059
cd that would be part of a
larger circle, just like that,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.670
centered at point P.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.300
And we don't know the
actual angle measure

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.112
of angle P. Right over here.

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:24.570
But without even
knowing that, just

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.340
knowing the lengths of
these segments here,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.990
I want to think about
whether we can figure out

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.580
the ratio of the length
of arc AB, not angle AB,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:52.000
to the length of arc--
I'll do that in green-- CD.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.600
And I encourage you to pause
this video now and think

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.310
about this on your own.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.790
Well, they didn't give us
the radian measure here,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.640
or any type of
angle measure here,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.520
but let's just imagine
that it is x radians.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.970
We've already seen that one
way to think about an angle

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.100
measure in terms of
radians is that this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.000
is a count of the number
of the length of the arc

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.130
that it intercepts
in terms of radii.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.650
So if this has an angle
measure of x radians

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.810
then that means
that this arc length

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.200
is going to be x
times the radius.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.760
It's going to be x radii long.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.540
The radii is 5
units long so this

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.245
is going to be 5-- I'll
do that in that, this

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:38.970
is the right color-- this is
going to be 5x units long.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.710
Well, same argument for this
arc length right over here.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.360
It has a radius of 9.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.680
5 plus 4.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.320
And so this is going
to be x radii long.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.500
Each radius is 9 units.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.080
So it's going to
be 9x units long.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.730
So what's the ratio
of these two lengths?

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.660
Well, the smaller arc AB
would have a length of 5x.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.890
Arc CD would have
a length of 9x.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.672
So the ratio is 5 to 9.

00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:16.880
Now let's say someone says,
oh, that was pretty good,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.130
you were able to
figure out this ratio.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.290
Let's say we were to give
you one of these lengths.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.970
Let's say that they were to tell
you that the length of arc AB

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.140
is 25/8.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.920
Given that, what else could
you figure out about it?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.760
Well, you could
actually figure out

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.960
everything else you
would want to know.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.376
You could figure out the angle
measure in terms of radians

00:02:37.376 --> 00:02:39.877
and you could figure out
the arc length of CD.

00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:42.460
And I encourage you to pause the
video now and figure them out

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.070
on your own.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.770
Well, let's work
through each of them.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.310
We already figured out
that ab's length is 5x.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.740
So we could just say that 5x
is going to be equal to 25/8.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.370
Divide both sides by
5. x is equal to 5/8.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.500
And so the measure of this
angle right here is 5/8 radians.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.400
So what's going to be the
measure of this arc length?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.280
So this is going
to be 9 times x.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.310
That's just 45/8.
