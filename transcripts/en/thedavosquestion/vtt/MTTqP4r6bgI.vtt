&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is Bono.
I'm a rock star, sort of and, umm, yeah.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.089
I think there's something everybody can do
and I won't tell, umm, I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.160
won't tell you where you can hook up to fight
against extreme poverty

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.210
in your own neighborhood 'cause I don't know
what the organizations

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:30.070
are but you can find them out.
But I will say this: In 2008 if we're to get

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.809
anywhere, umm, on the
fight against extreme poverty or the climate

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.010
crisis, we have to prove
that we can keep the promises that we've already

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.300
made.
So we call them the millennium development

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.429
goals and right now
politicians are slipping back in their commitments

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:55.199
to half extreme
poverty by 2015 so my message to you today

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.729
is do not let them and, uh,
I love that line, uh, of Tom Freedman's about

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.589
climate change: Don't
change your lightbulbs.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.590
Change your leaders.
Thank you.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.840
Bye.
