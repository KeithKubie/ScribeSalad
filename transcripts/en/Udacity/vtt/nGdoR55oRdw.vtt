00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.720
Going back to the wireframes.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.556
In the phone layout, 
we wanted the Today item

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:04.922
to be a little bit bigger,

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.800
but on the tablet's, we just want it
to look like all the other items,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.910
because we have an 
expanded detail pane here.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.520
To do this in the forecast adapter 
newView method,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.146
we should return the layout 
for a list item forecast

00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:18.932
not for the today layout.

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:21.520
Then in the bindView method, 
for the today item,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.350
we should use the gray icon
instead of the colored icon.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.643
These decisions get controlled 
by the return value

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:28.586
of the getItemViewType method.

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:30.734
Therefore we modify 
the getItemViewType method

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.472
so that at the zero position,

00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:34.260
if we have to use 
the special today layout,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.456
then we return View type today.

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:38.772
Otherwise, if we shouldn't use 
the special today layout,

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.230
then we should just return
the View type for all future days.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.640
This Boolean is controlled 
by the setter method.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.790
To access this Boolean, 
we created a public setter method

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.443
on the forecast adapter.

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:50.356
But who knows how 
to set this value properly?

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:53.710
Well the main activity knows 
whether it's one-pane or two-pane UI.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.210
So, it can decide whether we should use
the special today layout or not.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.750
We don't have access 
to the forecast adapter here,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.020
but we can plumb the values
through the ForecastFragment.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.159
To get access to the ForecastFragment, 
we can ask the fragment manager

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.030
and pass it the fragment ID.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.210
Finish changing the code
so the app looks like this.
