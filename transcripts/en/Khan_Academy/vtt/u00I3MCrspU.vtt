00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.220
As a hint, I will take the
determinant of another 3

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.240
by 3 matrix.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.890
But it's the exact same
process for the 3 by 3 matrix

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.880
that you're trying to
find the determinant of.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.100
So here is matrix A.
Here, it's these digits.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.020
This is a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.672
And now let's evaluate
its determinant.

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:19.880
So what we have to remember
is a checkerboard pattern

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.770
when we think of
3 by 3 matrices:

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.470
positive, negative, positive.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.490
So first we're going to
take positive 1 times 4.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.245
So we could just
write plus 4 times 4,

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:35.045
the determinant of 4 submatrix.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:36.670
And when you say,
what's the submatrix?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.320
Well, get rid of the column
for that digit, and the row,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.700
and then the submatrix
is what's left over.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.670
So we'll take the
determinant of its submatrix.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.620
So it's 5, 3, 0, 0.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.550
Then we move on to the
second item in this row,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.806
in this top row.

00:00:57.806 --> 00:00:59.180
But the checkerboard
pattern says

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.850
we're going to take
the negative of it.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.060
So it's going to be
negative of negative 1--

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.080
let me do that in a slightly
different color-- of negative 1

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.190
times the determinant
of its submatrix.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.970
You get rid of this
row, and this column.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.520
You're left with 4,
3, negative 2, 0.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.750
And then finally, you
have positive again.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.340
Positive times 1.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.330
This 1 right over here.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.890
Let me put the positive
in that same blue color.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.330
So positive 1, or plus
1 or positive 1 times 1.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.580
Really the negative is where
it got a little confusing

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.550
on this middle term.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.200
But positive 1 times 1 times the
determinant of its submatrix.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.170
So it's submatrix is
this right over here.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.045
You get rid of the row,
get rid of the column

00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:55.365
4, 5, negative 2, 0.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.724
So now we just have to evaluate
these 2 by 2 determinants.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.140
So the determinant
right over here

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.170
is going to be 5 times
0 minus 3 times 0.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.590
And all of that is going
to be multiplied times 4.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.110
Well this is going
to be 0 minus 0.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.510
So this is all just a 0.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.740
So 4 times 0 is just a 0.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.960
So this all simplifies to 0.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.860
Now let's do this term.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.080
We get negative negative 1.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.550
So that's positive 1.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.000
So let me just make
these positive.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.587
Positive 1, or we
could just write plus.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.670
Let me just write it here.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.000
So positive 1 times
4 times 0 is 0.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.510
So 4 times 0 minus
3 times negative 2.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.310
3 times negative
2 is negative 6.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.570
So you have 4-- oh, sorry,
you have 0 minus negative 6,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.100
which is positive 6.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.940
Positive 6 times 1 is just 6.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.330
So you have plus 6.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.310
And then finally you have
this last determinant.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.860
You have-- so it's going
to be plus 1 times 4 times

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.580
0 minus 5 times negative 2.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.789
So this is going to be
equal to-- it's just

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:17.830
going to be equal with--
1 times anything is just

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.680
the same thing.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.320
4 times 0 is 0.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.390
And then 5 times negative
2 is negative 10.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.140
But we're going to
subtract a negative 10.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.100
So you get positive 10.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.670
So this just simplifies
to 10, positive 10.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.710
So you're left with,
let me be clear.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.480
This is 0, all of this
simplifies to plus 6,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.640
and all of this
simplifies to plus 10.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.540
And so you are left with, if
you add these up, 6 plus 10

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.050
is equal to 16.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.970
So the trick here
is to just make

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.880
sure you remember the
checkerboard pattern,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.510
and you don't mess up with all
the negative numbers and all

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.738
of the multiplying.
