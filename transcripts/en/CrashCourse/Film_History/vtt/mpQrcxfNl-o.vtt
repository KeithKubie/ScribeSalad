00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.820
News flash: the world’s a big place. WHAT!?!?!

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.069
Huh!

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.760
And humans have been making films in almost
every corner of it for more than a hundred years.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.200
While Hollywood dominated the global film
market in its first six or seven decades,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.530
lots of profoundly influential film movements
arose all over the world.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.610
Now, there’s way too much to cover in just
two videos.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.520
But, hopefully, these overviews will inspire
you to explore more on your own.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.120
To start, let’s look at a few key movements
and filmmakers throughout Asia that were born

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.520
out of intense political change and had a
lasting impact on world cinema.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:42.520
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.760
During the 1930s, the Japanese government

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.979
placed stringent controls over domestic film
production through its Ministry of Propaganda.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.300
They censored content that didn’t uphold
the values of the Imperial government, and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.979
promoted movies that celebrated the Japanese
military.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.739
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Ministry
of Propaganda borrowed a page from the Nazi

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.089
playbook and actually took over the country’s
ten largest film studios.

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.100
Then, they consolidated these studios into
two main production companies and forced them

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.490
to make pro-war movies.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.280
Now, real battle footage from the Pacific
was hard to come by, so these wartime Japanese

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.870
filmmakers got really good at creating special
effects.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.840
And that experience would come in handy after
the war, when they were given more artistic freedom.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.880
Yasujiro Ozu is widely acknowledged
as one of the masters of classical Japanese

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.320
cinema, a period that stretched from 1926
to the 1950s.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.520
Ozu began his career making quiet, humanistic
films about family relationships and intergenerational conflicts.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.760
He grew up admiring American studio films,
especially those by Ernst Lubitsch and D.W. Griffith.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.200
Ozu’s first film to achieve wide acclaim
was a comedy called I Was Born, But….

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.649
The film follows a pair of brothers who lose
faith in their father when they discover he’s

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.009
not standing up to his boss.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.659
A lot of Ozu movies embed this kind of gentle
social critique into their very personal stories.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.780
Aesthetically, Ozu is known for his long,
wide shots that allow entire scenes to play

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.320
out, sometimes very slowly.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.400
This is often considered to be a reflection
of the power of ritual in traditional Japanese life.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.800
He also innovated the use of offscreen space,
having characters exit the frame for surprisingly

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.539
long periods of time, and letting the camera
linger on the now-empty space.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.420
These moments echo certain Zen aesthetics
about emptiness and patience.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.410
And they root Ozu’s films in ancient Japanese
customs and beliefs, even though his stories

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530
take place in what was then the present day.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.580
After the war, Ozu went on to make three masterpieces:
Late Spring, Early Summer, and his most famous

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.620
film, Tokyo Story.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.060
Now, the end of the war brought profound changes
to the Japanese film industry.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.000
Much of the country was scarred, both physically
and psychologically, having suffered a massive

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.610
firebombing campaign and atomic explosions
at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.350
One kind of postwar Japanese cinema dealt
with the aftermath of these atomic bombs in

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.190
very direct, explicit ways.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.300
It’s impossible to watch Ishiro Honda’s
1954 film Godzilla and not see the parable

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.000
underneath the sci-fi monster movie.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
...and also not try to mimic Godzilla's noise.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.720
Craig: ahhhh... ahhhh
Nick: You're not doing a very good job.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.240
No, I'm not doing a very good job.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.000
The creature is unleashed by careless atomic

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.090
explosions, and the human characters spend
the movie wrestling with the potentially apocalyptic

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.960
consequences of scientific research.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.730
Godzilla and its sequels also show off the
sophistication of the Japanese special effects

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.820
industry, as all that work during the war
was now beginning to pay off.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.730
After the war, General Douglas MacArthur led
the American Occupation forces which oversaw

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.430
the “democratization” of Japan from 1945
to 1952.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.940
And this brought a new kind of censorship
to Japanese films.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.440
They were forbidden from glorifying imperialism,
feudalism, and militarism.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.680
The Occupation forces rounded up and destroyed
hundreds of films that were deemed anti-democratic.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.540
Under the Occupation, the state-run film companies
were broken up to foster competition, and

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.370
filmmakers were encouraged to make movies
that celebrated democratic values

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.370
and personal freedoms.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.720
One filmmaker who flourished in this postwar
period was Akira Kurosawa, who would go on

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.080
to become one of the most influential filmmakers
in the history of cinema.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.800
For real. He's a big deal.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.730
Kurosawa became an international star with
his 1951 revolutionary film Rashomon.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.680
It tells the story of the murder of a samurai
warrior through the eyes of four unreliable

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.680
narrators.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.770
We see the events of the film four times,
each time from a different point of view.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.590
And the film never tells us which version
of events actually happened.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.850
Kurosawa seems to imply that truth and reality
are subjective, in both cinema and life, and

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.920
that our only hope is to be as good to one
another as we possibly can.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.840
YA, NICK!

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.040
Unlike Ozu, Kurosawa kept his camera moving,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.570
a style he would bring to many of his later
samurai films.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.750
And he was often borrowing stories from other
cultures.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.150
His samurai movie Yojimbo was based on an
American detective novel by Dashiell Hammett.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.120
Throne of Blood was a Japanese re-telling
of Shakespeare’s Macbeth.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.920
And he used King Lear as the basis for his
samurai epic Ran.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.090
In turn, Kurosawa inspired many foreign films
based on his work.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.940
George Lucas famously lifted elements of
Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress for the first

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.960
Star Wars film.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.570
And Kurosawa’s masterpiece Seven Samurai
has been remade twice in the United States

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.760
as The Magnificent Seven.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.560
I guess that makes it the "Magnificent Fourteen." *giggle*

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.400
From anime to horror and period dramas to
Kaiju films, stories from the Japanese movie

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.620
industry continue to resonate around the globe.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.850
Now, in mainland China, the film industry
also underwent some significant changes because

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.850
of political pressures.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.000
The first domestic films emerged in 1905.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.150
And within five years, a stable industry began
to form, starting in Shanghai and spreading

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.570
to other coastal cities.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.120
Sound was introduced in 1929 and China’s
film industry continued to grow, until the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.690
Japanese invaded in 1937, occupied Shanghai,
and shut down domestic production until the

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.690
end of the war.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.341
When Mao Zedong’s Communist Party took over
the country in 1949, they placed control of

00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:13.430
film production under the Minister of Culture.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.180
During the 1950s, the Chinese government built
a dozen major film studios throughout the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.600
country and produced a lot of pro-Communist
films.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.510
In the early 1960s, the government censors
relaxed enough to allow film adaptations of

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.290
several operas and novels.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.410
Before this, works like Su Li’s Third Sister
Liu and Early Spring in February by Xie Tieli

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.720
would have been considered too bourgeois to
produce.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.700
Then in 1966 came the Cultural Revolution,
a violent, decade-long purge of most cultural

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.800
and economic institutions in China.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.260
Professionals of all kinds, including filmmakers,
were driven from their jobs and homes by the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.720
Chinese government, and sent off to be “re-educated”
in the countryside.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.670
As a result, film production came to a halt
in 1967 and wouldn’t resume for another

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.670
three years.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.680
And even then, only amateur filmmakers were
allowed to make movies at first.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.400
Eventually, through fits and starts, professional
filmmakers emerged from their re-education

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.620
camps or graduated from new film schools and
began making movies again.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.640
One of the most notable directors from mainland
China is Zhang Yimou.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.880
His first film, the sumptuously shot Red Sorghum,
won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival in 1987.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.800
Known for his striking visuals and painterly
style, Zhang made several notable martial

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.790
arts films in the early 2000s – movies like
Hero and House of Flying Daggers – before

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.270
overseeing the Opening Ceremonies for the
Beijing Olympics in 2008.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.010
Zhang has even worked with American movie
stars.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.750
Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe play lead roles
in his 2017 film The Great Wall.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.560
This collaboration may be the first of many,
since well-financed Chinese production companies

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.400
have begun to partner with American studios
to make films for audiences in both countries

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.610
and beyond.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.920
Outside of mainland China, Hong Kong has a
long tradition of kung fu and swordplay films.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.660
I just kung fu'd the eagle.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.280
Its film industry elevated these violent genres
to art in the 1960s and ‘70s, through precisely

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.040
choreographed action and rapid editing.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.380
Figures like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan popularized
this authentic martial arts cinema outside

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.380
Hong Kong.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.660
And directors like John Woo even went on to
make blockbusters within the American studio

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.370
system – films like Face/Off and Mission:
Impossible II.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.750
Wong Kar-wai is another superstar director
from the Hong Kong film industry.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.090
His elliptical, post-modern films often examine
unrequited love and the deep interior lives

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.090
of their characters.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.610
From the dreamlike lyricism of In the Mood
for Love, to the martial arts grandeur of

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.790
The Grand Master, his films have had a profound
influence on filmmakers throughout the world.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.380
As big as China and Hong Kong loom on the
world stage, the largest film industry in

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.510
the world is located in India.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.440
All told, the country produces eight- to nine-hundred
movies a year,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.400
roughly a quarter of the world’s films.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.389
So India had a growing film industry under
British Colonial Rule in the early part of

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.820
the 20th century, prior to winning their independence.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.389
They ran into trouble, though, when sound
film arrived.

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:37.520
Because India makes films in more than sixteen
languages!

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.169
When you hear the term Bollywood, for instance,
that refers to film production centered in

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.169
Bombay.

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.250
These Hindi-language films make up 25 percent
of Indian cinema.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.161
Bengali-language film production occurs mostly
in Calcutta, while facilities in Madras produce

00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:51.330
Tamil-, Kannada-, and Telugu- language films.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.050
Despite the language differences, what unifies
most Indian films is their style.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.590
Most Indian cinema consists of lavish musicals
or mythological romances, all following relatively

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.590
strict formulas.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.810
For the musicals, the saying goes, all you
need is “a star, six songs, and three dances.”

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.820
The Indian star system actually resembles
the American studio era of the 1930s.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.340
Actors are chosen and groomed by the film
studios, and plugged into movies built around

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.340
their personas.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.760
Now, the most profitable movie ever produced
in India is Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 film Sholay.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.000
It’s an action-adventure film heavily influenced
by Hollywood westerns, but also has its share

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.669
of over-the-top song-and-dance numbers.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:27.300
The film was so popular when it was released
that it ran continuously in movie theaters

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.600
for five years! I can't even hold a job for five years.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.800
Meanwhile, the universally-acknowledged master

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.959
of Indian cinema was Satyajit Ray, whose style
was different than most Indian films.

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:41.129
After studying as a painter, Ray found his
filmmaking inspiration in Italian Neo-Realism,

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:45.110
especially Vittorio De Sica’s classic The
Bicycle Thieves, the intimate story of a father

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.830
and son struggling to survive poverty in post-war
Italy.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.100
In 1955, Ray made his first film, The Song
of the Road, which tells the story of a young

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.670
Bengali boy coming of age.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.310
Unlike the spectacle of most Indian cinema,
Ray’s film focuses on the emotions of its

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.149
fully-realized characters, and intimate moments
of everyday life.

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:04.220
The film became a surprise international hit
and won the Jury Prize at the 1956 Cannes

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.220
Film Festival.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.939
In his next two films, 1957’s The Unvanquished
and 1959’s The World of Apu, Ray continued

00:09:09.939 --> 00:09:13.079
to follow the main character from his first
film as he matured into adolescence.

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:16.579
These three films together are known as the
“Apu Trilogy” and cemented Ray’s international

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:18.760
reputation and low-key, contemplative style.
