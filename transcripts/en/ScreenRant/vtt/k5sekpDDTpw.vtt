00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.960
Whether we realize it or not, acting can be
kind of a dangerous job.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.340
Some performers will put themselves through
hell all for the benefit of their character.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.140
Even with everyone’s best intentions, things
go wrong and bones get broken.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.980
Somehow, these actors pulled off awesome performances
in spite of the pain.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.500
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Most Dangerous
Movie Scenes Of All Time.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.280
The Wizard of Oz
The 1939 cinematic marvel The Wizard of Oz

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.210
is as beloved today as it was back then.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.949
Even though the movie is relentlessly optimistic,
the production was troubled right from the

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:45.949
start.

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.010
Effects makeup was in its infancy at the time,
and was the downfall of a few actors.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.299
All sorts of ingredients would be mixed together
to achieve the desired look.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.430
. And though something bad seemed to happen
to everyone, Margaret Hamilton got it the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430
worst.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.750
During a spectacular fiery exit, the copper
in the makeup she was wearing as the Wicked

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.430
Witch of the West badly burned her face and
hands.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.330
She was even hospitalized because of it.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.450
Django Unchained
Over the course of his career, Leonardo DiCaprio

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.200
has cemented his reputation as a serious actor.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.850
He’s a bankable Hollywood commodity and
he’s been in some of the best films of the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.119
past decade.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.120
While his roles have been varied, his turn
as Calvin Candie in Django Unchained was the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.060
first time the experienced actor got to be
the bad guy.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.470
And ohhhhh what a bad guy he was.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.450
DiCaprio got so deep into the character that
when he sliced his hand open on a broken glass

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.259
during a rant, he didn’t even notice.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.980
Obviously that’s the take Tarantino chose
to be in the final cut.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.030
Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
Of all the minor day-to-day injuries we could

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.880
sustain, stubbing one’s toe always seems
extra painful.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.399
Especially when you’re trying to look badass
in front of your friends.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.390
When Viggo Mortensen reprised his role as
Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings: The Two

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.700
Towers, he took the injury to a whole new
level.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.150
The actor broke two of his toes in one scene
after kicking a helmet.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.160
And falls to the ground in pain.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.450
Given that helmets are designed to take a
blow, we can’t say we’re surprised.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.110
Since there’s nothing like the real thing,
that take was the one included in the movie.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.190
The 40 Year Old Virgin
The 40 Year Old Virgin is loaded with memorable

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.650
scenes and embarrassing situations.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.250
Having sex for the first time is awkward in
real life, but watching a full-grown adult

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.900
man try to figure it out is almost harder.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.990
Given that the writers are Judd Apatow and
Steve Carell, we know that’s exactly what

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.990
they wanted.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.760
In an effort to be more appealing to the ladies,
Carell’s character goes for a wax.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.560
And if the actor looks like he’s genuinely
in pain, it’s because he definitely is.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.590
Carell wanted the scene and his reaction to
feel authentic, so his hair got ripped out

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.370
for real.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.440
Now You See Me
Audiences love a good underwater trick.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.950
But because of their environment, safety crews
sometimes have a difficult time figuring out

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.310
where the acting ends and real distress begins.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.370
During the filming of her scene in the opening
montage of Now You See Me, actress Isla Fisher

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.230
nearly drowned after getting caught up in
her submerged chains.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.940
Since that’s also what’s happening to
her character at the time, people on set have

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.220
admitted to not knowing if Fisher needed assistance
for real.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.480
If you want something done right you have
to do it yourself, and the actress was able

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.460
to untangle her own chains before the situation
turned fatal.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.230
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
In his time as Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise has

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.301
done a lot of his own glorious stunt work.

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.900
So when the franchise’s fifth installment
rolled around, the actor wasn’t sure what

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.140
to expect.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.120
Director Christopher McQuarrie was under the
gun to find new ways to blow audience minds.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.610
He and Cruise decided together that Hunt should
hang from the side of a plane as it takes

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.610
off.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.000
And with only a couple of straps to protect
him, the actor did exactly that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.720
Production had a hard time finding a company
willing to let them use their aircraft for

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.560
filming, but Airbus stepped up to the plate.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.520
Along with a few dozen military advisors and
safety personnel.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.840
Rocky IV
Stage combat is hard, and what people don’t

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.330
realize is that it takes a lot of practice.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.580
Meticulously choreographing every single move
the actors are supposed to make can interrupt

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.199
the flow of a performance.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.530
Plus, when it’s done poorly, it’s obvious
to the viewer.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.219
When Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren
were filming their infamous showdown from

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.240
Rocky IV, both men quickly grew tired of the
phony fighting.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.250
After a couple of takes, the two decided that
if the hits were going to look real, they

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.770
would have to be real.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.789
Stallone may have been ready to rumble, but
his body wasn’t.

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.610
And after taking a hard punch to the chest,
the actor’s heart swelled so much that he

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.039
had to spend over a week in the hospital because
of it.

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.650
The Abyss
Ed Harris has stated in no uncertain terms

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.449
that he will never work with James Cameron
again.

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.580
And after hearing this story, we can’t say
we blame him.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.580
While filming his 1989 thriller The Abyss,
Cameron used some downright dangerous tricks

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.550
to get performances out of his actors.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.330
Since you can’t have a water movie without
the near-constant threat of someone drowning,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.530
the logical solution is to drown them in earnest.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.389
Harris says the director knowingly gave him
a nearly empty oxygen tank because he wanted

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.340
the scene to appear authentic.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.290
Apparently Cameron didn’t let the safety
team in on the little secret either, because

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.250
they were equally surprised when the actor
ran out of air so quickly.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:58.699
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
As far as safety standards go, the 1970’s

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.229
were kind of a grey area.

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.780
And filmmakers could get by with the bare
minimum.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.199
To a lot of horror directors, part of the
genre’s charm comes from it’s low budget.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.210
And since safety costs money, it’s usually
one of the first things to go.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.650
When you consider all these things together,
it’s easy to understand why the team behind

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.330
1974’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre would
choose to use a real chainsaw during most

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.279
scenes - because it was cheaper!

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:27.020
Miraculously, everything was fine until the
actor wielding it tripped, and the running

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.930
chainsaw landed inches from his face.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.969
Pulp Fiction
Even if (by some miracle) everything goes

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.520
perfectly on set, some scenes are just downright
painful for the audience.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.349
If you’re the squeamish type, we suggest
skipping over this scene from 1994’s Pulp

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:46.349
Fiction.

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:51.259
While the movie has it’s fair share of questionable
content, watching John Travolta stab Uma Thurman

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.310
in the heart with an adrenaline needle is
easily one of the most traumatic things we’ve

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.059
ever seen.

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:00.960
The audience is nervous because the characters
are nervous.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.740
And the characters are nervous because the
situation is messed up.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.360
Thankfully though, the scene isn't without
humor, and is exactly the sick mix Tarantino’s

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.900
known for.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.229
What do you think of our list?

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:18.309
