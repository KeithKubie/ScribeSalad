00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.730
Reviews have become a common part of everyday software development practice.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.260
As such, much has been learned about how to perform them.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.530
What follows in this lesson are some dos and don'ts of gleaned from

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.000
actual experience. We begin with some about the participants. First off,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.390
reviews should not be used for personnel eva, evaluations.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.650
If participants feel that what they say about someone else's code will affect

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.360
their performance rating or salary, they may be reluctant to speak. For

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.340
this reason managers should in general not attend review meetings unless they

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.620
have participated technically in the production of the artifact being reviewed.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.710
Or they're outside of the participant's reporting hierarchy. Similarly,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.500
in general it is not a good idea to allow non-participant observers in

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.770
review meetings as they can provide distractions. Don't treat a review as

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.140
an opportunity for training new staff members. This will reduce the productivity

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.750
of the review session. Instead, hold a separate meeting with the trainee.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.900
The author of the artifact being reviewed should not be the moderator or

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.150
recording. These are specialized tasks that require full concentration.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.960
Some organizations also require that the author not be the reader.
