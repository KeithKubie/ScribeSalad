00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.710
Guys, futbol may BE the biggest thing going
on right now on EARTH.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.520
But what about in Space?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.130
Do they get to see the matches too?

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.140
Hey world, Trace here for DNews and this is
our Weekly Space Update!

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.510
You can be sure the astronauts flying on the
ISS are trained both physically and mentally

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.510
for their journey.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.750
They are required to exercise daily, and run
experiments, perform spacewalks and fulfill

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.129
duties at all hours of the day... but NASA
ensures they're not just worker bees, but

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.100
that they take care of their psychological
needs as well.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.309
They have a way to uplink movies that aren't
already up there, but what about for other

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.089
things... like...the Super bowl, Olympics,
World Cup, US Open, the World Chess Championship

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.519
-- Dude, Magnus Carlsen is defending his title
this year!!!

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:52.519
AAHH!! // *cut mid-freakout*

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.760
Everyone in the world, and some people in
the United States are going balls-on-the-pitch

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.469
crazy about the largest, most-watched sporting
event on the planet, the World Cup.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.340
And seeing as this is the INTERNATIONAL space
station, we've probably got some fÃºtbol loving

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.340
astronauts!

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.350
So, NASA's Johnson Space Center is on the
case to make sure these intrepid explorers

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.190
get their psychological needs met!

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.500
A NASA representative told us, "the final
match of the World Cup falls during off-duty

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.150
time on a Sunday, so they might choose to
watch some of the game live."

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.320
So they DO get to watch it.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.700
Another press release showed astronauts enjoying
a ten minute highlight reel earlier this week.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.170
So they are definitely up on the biggest sports
Earth news this week.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.630
But technology isn't magic.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.230
They can't just swipe a TV show up into the
clouds and have it fly to the space station!

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.050
The ISS has to have Ku-Band connection with
mission control.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.710
It's called the Ku because it's directly below
the K-band on the electromagnetic spectrum;

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.710
Ku...

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.830
K-Under... get it?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.930
The 12-18 gigahertz Ku band isn't just for
sending "Fast n' Loud" marathons to the ISS,

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.010
it's also used for satellite communications
and television broadcasting.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.120
The ISS uses the Ku because it has a higher
bandwidth than their normal internet uplink,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.890
so it's ideal for sending large amounts of
information, like a live broadcast.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.370
Johnson Space Center has a special license
from their satellite cable company to re-direct

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.340
channels that astronauts want to see directly
to the station.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.751
Like cell phone service on the ground, the
Ku coverage in space varies, but the ISS is

00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:26.469
usually able to connect to Johnson Space Center
for 80 minutes during each 90 minute orbit.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.019
That's a long 10 minute blackout during an
exciting sportsball match, but if they're

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.689
not streaming something live they can use
it for other things too.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.950
So let's just say, for kicks, that no one
was interested in the World Cup.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.730
Astronauts don't just sit around watching
the tube, they also can use their computers

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220
to surf the web, or call home.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.810
THey play musical instruments, read and so
on.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.790
These are all "important aspects of psychological
support for astronauts on long-duration missions."

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.750
That's according to our friendly NASA representative.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.510
They can even watch movies together in their...
*snicker* makeshift Movie Theatre.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.579
In fact, according to NASA there's a growing
collection of DVDs brought up by past missions.

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.640
Watching the "Star Trek" series was a weekly
event for former ISS astronaut Greg Chamitoff.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.599
If you could take three movies with you to
the ISS, which three would you take?

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.599
Tell us the movies you'd take in the comments,
and subscribe!

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.599
But before you go...

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.630
If you're a space-geek who likes to space
out and learn about space...

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.599
NEXT Tuesday, June 24 we doing our monthly
Google Hangout with NASA/JPL.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.859
DID you know they don't just look up to the
stars - they also care a lot about good old

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.159
terra firma!

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.120
We're going to talk with some of the scientists
working on Earth science missions!

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.260
It's going to be so great!

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.620

and get your questions ready!
