00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.251
Now that we've covered more information about mixed numbers and improper

00:00:03.263 --> 00:00:06.890
fractions, let's revise our guess on our second chocolate math problem. How many

00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:10.412
batches of brownies can you bake if a recipe calls for 4 5ths of a cup of sugar

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:13.888
and you have 3 and a half cups of sugar at home? You can put your answer here as

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.583
a mixed number, put the whole number here and the fraction part here. Remember,

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.002
use any of your math reasoning. It's okay, you might not have all the tools to

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:24.371
solve this problem yet, but just give your best guess, and use any reason that

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:25.299
you've learned so far.
