00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.730
So I think my favorite app would be Sound Hound.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.390
And basically your out at a party or a store.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.310
And the song comes on and you're like "oh, this

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.900
song is awesome but I don't know what it is". And

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.080
you pull out the Sound Hound and it listens to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.676
a little bit and it tells you it's Jay-Z and

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.030
BeyoncÃ©, Bonnie and Clyde. I can't think of anything about

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.100
it that really annoys me. If they could improve it there's

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.270
songs that it doesn't recognize. Like they're building the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.760
library the whole time and I'm sure it, you know,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.540
they can make it faster but if say as they're

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.640
building their library later on. And it recognizes one of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.570
the songs they didn't recognize earlier if it would

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.300
just text me and it would be like that song

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970
that you were listening to eight months ago? This is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.910
what it was and then I, that would be amazing.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.240
&gt;&gt; I think my favorite app is C25K and the C

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.010
stands for couch potato and it's basically where you.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920
&gt;&gt; If you have no running experience, it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.530
gets you up to running 5k in eight weeks.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.980
&gt;&gt; Some of my favorite features in this app is that it allows you to play

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.465
music while you're running and then whenever the

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:09.070
app talks to you, it pauses the music.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.160
&gt;&gt; So I never have to worry about running over

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.570
the time that it allotted for me or anything like that.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.550
&gt;&gt; It uses the playlists

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.870
that are already in my phone, so if I create playlists, like, I

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.950
love Justin Timberlake, so I have a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.040
running Justin Timberlake playlist and if I'm

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.200
in the mood, then I put that o, or if I'm into like some

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.170
nineties music, I have my nineties running

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.310
playlist, so I love having that option.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.860
&gt;&gt; So one of my favorite apps is Pinterest, it's a service that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.092
allows you to collect digital images you like and put them into boards.

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:42.270
&gt;&gt; So, there's various uses of it and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.960
personally I've been trying to come up with a visual theme for our website.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.850
&gt;&gt; And I use that board to collect different

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.590
images on robots cause that's a theme were pursuing.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.210
&gt;&gt; And I just put them into a board and I can quickly see

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.760
like patterns and like, things I like in one place so that's very powerful.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.440
&gt;&gt; And I can use that for inspiration, mobile and desktop across

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.160
various different platforms.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.200
&gt;&gt; So, an app that I didn't like that I downloaded a while back.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.480
&gt;&gt; I think it was called SleepBot and basically, it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.760
uses an an accelerometer to track your movements as you sleep.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.450
&gt;&gt; And it figures out when, how deep of a sleep

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.720
cycle you're in and wakes you up when you're not in

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.920
such a deep sleep cycle. It wasn't very reliable the way

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.460
it works is that you say you want to wake up, let's say

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.470
at say 6:30 and it'll either wake you up up to 15

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.030
minutes before or up to 15 minutes after that didn't always happen.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.090
&gt;&gt; It could have been an hour, two hours or it would just never ring.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.555
&gt;&gt; It's not a good idea when you have a job.

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:49.460
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]. So last app I remember uninstalling

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.610
I think was called Public Bike SF. It

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.380
gave you biking routes through the city. So,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.530
San Francisco's a very hilly city and it tells

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.440
you like you're going here to here. Take these streets so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.730
you don't have to you know, climb up this crazy hill and

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.470
go back down it but I'm not using my phone while I'm

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.720
on my bike. So, it was basically just useless and really slow.
