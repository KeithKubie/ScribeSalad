00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.651
- [Voiceover] You're probably
familiar with the general term

00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:03.818
factor.

00:00:03.818 --> 00:00:08.217
So if I were to say: What
are the factors of 12,

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:10.285
you could say: Well what
are the whole numbers

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:14.318
that I can multiply by another
whole number to get 12?

00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:17.286
So for examples, you
could say things like,

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:22.051
well I could multiply
one times 12 to get 12.

00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:24.384
So you could say that
one is a factor of 12.

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:26.484
You could even say that
12 is a factor of 12.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.384
You could say two times
six is equal to 12,

00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:31.984
so you could say that
two is a factor of 12

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:34.452
and that six is also a factor of 12.

00:00:34.452 --> 00:00:37.584
And of course three times four is also 12,

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:40.618
so both three and four are factors of 12.

00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:42.118
So if you said well what
are the factors of 12

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:44.097
and you've seen this
before, well you could say:

00:00:44.097 --> 00:00:47.917
one, two, three, four, six, and 12,

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.117
those are all factors of 12.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:51.884
And you could also phase
it the other way around,

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.085
so let me just give an example.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.217
So if I were to pick on
three, I could say that three

00:00:56.217 --> 00:01:01.217
is a factor of 12.

00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:05.284
Or to phrase it slightly
differently, I could say that 12

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:09.618
is divisible,

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:12.684
12 is divisible by three.

00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:15.784
Now what I wanna do in this
video is extend this idea

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:20.684
of being a factor or divisibility
into the algebraic world.

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:23.017
So for example,

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:24.971
if I were to take

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.671
3xy.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.185
So this is a monomial with
an integer coefficient.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:34.518
Three is an integer right over here.

00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:37.085
And if I were to multiply
it with another monomial

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:39.184
with an integer coefficient,

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:42.385
I don't know, let's say times negative two

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:46.418
X squared, Y to the third power,

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:48.718
what is this going to be equal to?

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:50.784
Well this would be equal to,

00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:54.951
if we multiply the coefficients,
three times negative two

00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:58.884
is going to be negative six.

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:03.884
X times X squared is X to the third power.

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:06.484
And then Y times Y to the third

00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:09.651
is Y to the fourth power.

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:12.951
And so what we could say is,
if we wanted to say factors

00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:15.851
of negative six X to the
third, Y to the fourth,

00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:18.817
we could say that 3xy is a factor of this

00:02:18.817 --> 00:02:20.551
just as an example; so
let me write that down.

00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:25.001
We could write that 3xy

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.220
is a factor of,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.220
is a factor of...

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.084
of negative six X to the
third power, Y to the fourth,

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:39.951
or we could phrase that
the other way around.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.384
We could say that negative
six X to the third,

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:47.184
Y to the fourth, is divisible by,

00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:52.054
is divisible

00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:54.244
by 3xy.

00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:56.418
So hopefully you're seeing the parallels.

00:02:56.418 --> 00:02:59.450
If I'm taking these two monomials
with integer coefficients

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.218
and I multiply 'em and I get
this other, in this case,

00:03:02.218 --> 00:03:05.285
this other monomial, I could
say that either one of these

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.618
and there's actually
other factors of this,

00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:09.551
but I could say either
one of these is a factor

00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.214
of this monomial, or we
could say that negative six

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:14.518
X to the third, Y to the four is divisible

00:03:14.518 --> 00:03:17.185
by one of its factors.

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:21.351
And we could even extend this
to binomials or polynomials.

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:24.748
For example, if I were to take,

00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:26.318
if I were to take,

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:28.168
let me scroll down a little bit,

00:03:28.168 --> 00:03:32.085
whoops, if I were to take,

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:36.384
let me say X plus three

00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:39.685
and I wanted to multiply it times

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:43.298
X plus seven,

00:03:43.298 --> 00:03:45.818
we know that this is going to be equal to,

00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:47.417
if I were to write it as a trinomial,

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:50.551
it's gonna be X times X, so X squared,

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:53.117
and then it's gonna be
three X plus seven X,

00:03:53.117 --> 00:03:55.917
so plus 10x; and if any
of this looks familiar,

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:57.617
we have a lot of videos
where we go in detail

00:03:57.617 --> 00:03:59.985
of multiplying binomials like this.

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:02.751
And then three times seven is 21.

00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:05.255
Plus 21.

00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:08.917
So because I multiplied these
two, in this case binomials,

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.484
or we could consider
themselves to be polynomials,

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:14.684
polynomials or binomials
with integer coefficients.

00:04:14.684 --> 00:04:17.951
Notice the coefficients
here, they're one, one.

00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.018
The constants here, they're all integers.

00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:23.084
Because I'm dealing with all
integers here, we could say

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:26.918
that either one of these
binomials is a factor

00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:28.618
of this trinomial,

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:30.785
or we could say this
trinomial is divisible

00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:32.318
by either one of these.

00:04:32.318 --> 00:04:33.351
So let me write that down.

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:35.618
So I could say, I'll just
pick on X plus seven.

00:04:35.618 --> 00:04:38.584
We could say that X plus seven

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:40.848
is a factor,

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:44.398
is a factor

00:04:44.398 --> 00:04:48.187
of X squared

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.757
plus 10x plus 21;

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:56.058
or we could say that X squared plus 10x

00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:59.845
plus 21 is divisible by,

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:04.845
is divisible by

00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:07.285
I could say X plus three
or I could say X plus seven

00:05:07.285 --> 00:05:09.318
is divisible by,

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:12.085
X plus seven.

00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:14.284
And the key is, is that
both of these binomials,

00:05:14.284 --> 00:05:16.151
or even if we were
dealing with polynomials,

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:18.951
we are dealing with
things that have integer,

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:23.734
we're dealing with things that
have integer coefficients.
