00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.105
- [Voiceover] Let's take a look at a

00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:03.602
United States one dollar bill.

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:05.758
What is it that gives this thing value?

00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:07.217
You can give it to people and get back,

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:09.066
ya know food that you can
eat, or things that you

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.051
can use, and things of hard value.

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:13.009
But what is it about this
little piece of paper

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.398
that makes it valuable?

00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:16.524
Or I guess it's not paper, as it's cotton,

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:17.856
something like that, right?

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:19.521
But the questions stands, right, like what

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.697
makes this flimsy little
thing, that doesn't

00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:24.670
seem to have any use in
it's own right, valuable?

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.665
Well, one kind of interesting exercise is

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.501
to step back in time a little bit

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.856
and take a look at what
the very, very first

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:33.143
United States dollars looked liked.

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:35.574
So I have here one of the
very first that was printed,

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:37.444
and let's zoom in on it and kind of read

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:39.333
some of the words associated with it.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.512
So if we zoom in, let's just
say towards the very top here.

00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:45.205
Notice that it says silver certificate,

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:48.021
silver certificate up at the top.

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:49.721
So what does that mean?

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.039
Well, if we zoom out
a little bit, it says,

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.783
it says that this certifies
that there has been

00:00:55.783 --> 00:00:59.923
deposited in the treasury of
the United States of America

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.678
and then the sentence kind of continues

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:06.355
in an awkward way below,
one silver dollar payable

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:08.267
to the bearer on demand.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:11.871
So what that means, what this
dollar originally represented

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.004
was the fact that you
were gonna be able to

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.396
turn in this bill for a silver dollar.

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:19.704
This piece of paper in
theory, could be turned in

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:22.261
to the United States
treasury, which guaranteed

00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.369
that it had in its
deposits a silver dollar,

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.958
an actual piece of
silver, and I'll show what

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.684
one of those looked like in just a moment,

00:01:28.684 --> 00:01:31.812
It would return to you for this bill.

00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:34.579
So in a sense what gave it
value was this guarantee

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.918
that you could turn it
into silver if you wanted.

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.894
So this way you could trade
this with other people

00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:40.787
as if it were a piece of
silver, 'cause if you gave

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:45.074
it to someone that person, now
being the bearer on demand,

00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:47.133
could then in theory, turn this in

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.264
and get a silver dollar as a result.

00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:51.083
And the reason for even
having this paper money,

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:53.005
and printing these bills
is that it was pretty

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.076
inconvenient to always lug
around actual pieces of silver,

00:01:56.076 --> 00:01:57.507
and actual pieces of metal.

00:01:57.507 --> 00:01:58.849
And this would be
especially true in the case

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.267
of even higher amounts.

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.863
So for example, here we
have a 10,000 dollar bill.

00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:06.701
Something you don't really see too often.

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.745
And if we zoom in and
kind of see the guarantees

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.626
that are written on this guy,
it's actually very similar,

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:14.267
but its this is instead
in gold instead of silver.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:18.100
It says that $10,000 in gold
are payable to the bearer

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.111
on demand, as authorized by law.

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:23.330
So kind of legally backing up
the idea that this could be

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.406
turned in for $10,000 worth of gold.

00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:29.235
So that way people could
actually treat this as if it was,

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:31.746
ya know $10,000 worth
of gold, without having

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:33.726
to lug around that much money.

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:35.666
So what is it that you actually
got when you turned in,

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.491
ya know for one silver dollar
or something like that.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.658
What is it that was payable on demand?

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.243
Well you have, what's
another form of money,

00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:45.127
what you can use in
commerce and kind of trade

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:47.221
with people as a medium of exchange.

00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.765
Officially United States
money, but the difference is

00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:52.726
that the piece of money
itself, is the valuable metal.

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:55.418
It actually is the silver,
so in theory if you ya know,

00:02:55.418 --> 00:02:57.620
didn't trust the United
States Government anymore,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.082
you could melt it down
for just the pure silver

00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:02.618
and maybe other countries
still value that silver.

00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:05.050
And similarly there was
gold coins like this

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.117
that people would use.

00:03:06.117 --> 00:03:07.952
Like this right here is a gold coin

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:09.797
worth two and a half dollars.

00:03:09.797 --> 00:03:12.090
So, this is something
where the value is held

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.633
within it because presumably
people value gold,

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:16.557
and even if this didn't
have a fancy you know,

00:03:16.557 --> 00:03:18.819
United States symbol all stamped onto it,

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.698
it would be something
valuable, because it's gold.

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:23.512
And this kind of money,
this ya know gold coins

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:26.651
or these silver coins has
a special kind of name.

00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.990
It's called commodity money.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.569
Let's see, commodity money.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.484
And basically what this
means is that the thing

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.154
that you're using for
money, the thing that you're

00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:37.753
trading around, has some
value in it's own right.

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:39.481
Even if it wasn't money, it would still

00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:40.760
be something valuable.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.789
This word here, commodity,
basically means just

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.677
anything valuable, it
could not only be ya know

00:03:45.677 --> 00:03:48.458
silver or gold, but things
like food or furniture

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:49.541
or livestock.

00:03:50.384 --> 00:03:52.199
These are commodities.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.228
And you know you could
argue that silver and gold

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:57.270
aren't valuable other
than the fact that people

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.702
just like using them for trading.

00:03:58.702 --> 00:04:00.808
I mean they're kind of pretty
and useful for jewelry,

00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:02.581
and there's some
electronics that use them,

00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:04.247
but on the whole, the
main reason that people

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:07.315
value silver and gold is because
they're used for trading.

00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:09.326
It's kind of because
other people value them.

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:10.759
So it's a little bit
weird that these are the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.783
quintessential examples
of commodity money,

00:04:13.783 --> 00:04:16.004
when in fact other
commodities ya know like wheat

00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:19.790
or oranges feel much
more real, hard valuable,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.458
something you can use in its own right,

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:22.692
than the pieces of metal.

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:25.019
But never the less, these
are, these are commodities.

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:27.146
And the other form of
money here, where you have

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:29.672
something that you could in
theory exchange to a bank,

00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:31.637
and then the bank would return to you,

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.969
ya know the actual silver
that it represents,

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.044
the commodity that it represents,

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:38.688
ya know in this case silver.

00:04:38.688 --> 00:04:40.886
These are called commodity-backed money.

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:42.303
Commodity-backed.

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:48.169
Because their value is being
backed up by the value of

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.523
whatever commodity they represent.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:51.697
Another term that you
might hear for them is

00:04:51.697 --> 00:04:54.732
representative money,
because they are representing

00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:57.598
another good, representative.

00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.015
In this case, silver or gold.

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:05.674
But in the early days of money,
like thousands of years ago,

00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:08.000
you would have representative
money like the shekel,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.563
which represented a
certain weight of barley.

00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.054
So it doesn't just have
to be silver or gold,

00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:15.985
sometimes you have money
that represents a different

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:18.831
sort of commodity, so
commodity-backed, representative.

00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:21.391
This is the kind of old
style United States,

00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:22.813
or other countries money.

00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:25.920
A lot of people had
commodity-backed money.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.909
But in modern terms, it's common

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:28.957
not to have either of those.

00:05:28.957 --> 00:05:30.956
You can just have this bill
that's not backed up by silver.

00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:33.980
You could not turn this in
and get silver as a result.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.615
And this, this is termed fiat money.

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:38.532
Fiat money.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.427
And this word fiat kind of means a decree

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:44.632
or a declaration, so it's
like the United States

00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:46.728
Government has declared
that this is money.

00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:48.248
And just by declaring that it's money,

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.258
presumably that gives its value.

00:05:50.258 --> 00:05:52.341
So it kind of feels much
more hollow in comparison

00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:54.913
to commodity money, or
commodity backed money.

00:05:54.913 --> 00:05:57.488
But there's a couple, a couple
hard things backing this up.

00:05:57.488 --> 00:05:59.723
One of them, if we kind of zoom in on

00:05:59.723 --> 00:06:02.275
some of the words here.

00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:05.556
If you go you see that it says
this note is legal tender.

00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:06.915
So here, I'll write that down.

00:06:06.915 --> 00:06:10.707
This note is legal tender for
all debts public and private.

00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:12.384
And I talked about the
idea of legal tender

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:14.520
in the last video and
how that actually ya know

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.609
gives a little bit of clout
to this being valuable

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:19.377
as long as you trust that the government

00:06:19.377 --> 00:06:23.238
will enforce it's laws,
as it claims that it will.

00:06:23.238 --> 00:06:27.183
But for the most part, what
makes this stuff valuable

00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:29.266
is the fact that other
people trust it, right?

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:31.686
The reason that you value
having a dollar bill

00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:33.728
is because you know you
can give it to most people

00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:36.268
and they are willing to trade
you valuable things for it.

00:06:36.268 --> 00:06:38.791
And at the end of the day,
that's what was making,

00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:41.717
ya know silver dollars or these $10,000

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:44.756
ya know gold notes valuable.

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:46.383
'Cause almost no one would actually trade

00:06:46.383 --> 00:06:48.360
it in for the silver,
'cause why would you?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.411
It's just as good, and it's a little bit

00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:51.866
more convenient to just
trade around the bill itself.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:54.756
So once that's actually in
the psychology of a society,

00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:57.100
and once everyone kind
of is used to the idea of

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.947
trading around this paper
representative money

00:06:59.947 --> 00:07:02.444
in order to get things of
value, it's not actually

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:04.864
a huge leap to just have the
paper that you're trading

00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:06.943
around as long as everyone else trusts it.

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:09.478
And it still serves
those functions of money

00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:10.949
that I talked about in previous videos.

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.293
It's a medium of exchange,
and you can store this

00:07:13.293 --> 00:07:14.126
for value, right?

00:07:14.126 --> 00:07:15.802
The paper's not going to
degrade, it's something

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.770
you can store, and it
does give a unit of value.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.405
Assigning a number to
various goods out there.

00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:24.606
But it is, it is just
something that was declared,

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:26.239
it's not an actual hard good,

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:27.913
and this is kind of an
important distinction

00:07:27.913 --> 00:07:31.345
to recognize is that fiat
money really does mean

00:07:31.345 --> 00:07:34.383
it's just trusted, it's
just taken on faith

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:36.520
that people will find this valuable.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.704
But for that matter, that's also true of

00:07:37.704 --> 00:07:39.068
silver and gold, right?

00:07:39.068 --> 00:07:41.682
Like, it's just taken on
faith that if you melted

00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:44.902
down the silver other people
would find that valuable.

00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:47.555
And same goes for gold,
and in fact in some,

00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:49.139
ya know even though a
lot of western cultures

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:51.319
valued gold a lot, there
were other cultures

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.350
that they might find like in Asia,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.812
that didn't value gold in the same way.

00:07:55.812 --> 00:07:57.438
And just thought why is everyone getting

00:07:57.438 --> 00:07:59.814
all up in a fuss about this fancy metal?

00:07:59.814 --> 00:08:02.229
So this idea of having
money that we use basically

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:04.600
because we trust that others
will find it valuable,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.776
isn't actually that absurd,
and as long as it serves

00:08:06.776 --> 00:08:09.150
the same three basic functions of money,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.066
you can have a working society.

00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:13.137
Ya know barring things
like hyperinflation,

00:08:13.137 --> 00:08:15.286
that makes it so that it no longer serves

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.853
those functions of money.

00:08:16.853 --> 00:08:17.739
See you next video!
