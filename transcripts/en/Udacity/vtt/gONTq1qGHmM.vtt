00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There is this new setup--a new level of existing,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is like the Google App Engine/Heroku model, which is completely managed.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You don't even really think the concept of machines.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
With Google App Engine, you just upload your code.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You don't think about OS. You don't think about anything.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You just give it a wad of Python, and they just run it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They run machines with databases. They do the charting.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They do the replication on this basically zero sysadmin,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is a great way to get started and depending on

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
how you like to work on your technical sophistication, on the complexity of your website,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
this may work fine. A lot of big websites have been built in this system.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Udacity, being one of them, runs on Google App Engine, but it also means

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
when you want to customize things, it's really difficult to do things that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the providers of these services haven't thought of ahead of time for you.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And that's kind of the continuum of setups.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There is no penalty for choosing wrong when you start because you can always switch in between.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's not always easy--when we switched from colocation to AWS,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Reddit was a fairly large website at that time, so that was a little bit tricky.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We had two infrastructures and slowly migrated traffic from one to the other

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
at a very high level, which actually worked okay.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'd suggest when you feel like you've outgrown Google App Engine or you want to do something

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that App Engine won't quite allow you to do

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
take a look at some of these other services and see if they get the job done right and then

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
maybe as you should get really, really big you hire a dedicated sysadmins,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and maybe you want to have your own machines because it's a little bit cheaper

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and bandwidth requirements are higher than what Amazon can do,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
for example, or your storage requirements or data needs, you need more, more, more.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's when you start thinking about having your own cage or having your own data center.
