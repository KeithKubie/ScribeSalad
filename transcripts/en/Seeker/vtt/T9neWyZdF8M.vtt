00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:09.429
I used to be a coal miner, but now I’m a
full grown coal adult!

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.099
Hey there dirty dozens, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.539
At the second presidential debate, Donald
Trump brought up clean coal.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.870
Now, we saw some tweets from you guys wondering
what clean coal actually is!

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.020
But before we can explain clean coal, you
kind of have to understand why we use coal

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.430
in the first place.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.340
Coal is incredibly important.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.900
It's cheap -- one of the cheapest sources
of energy available.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.129
It is amazingly efficient for making electricity,
and it’s one of the most abundant energy

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.190
sources in the world, even more so than oil.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.179
But it has one huge drawback.

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.789
It is so dirty that people regularly die from
its pollution.

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.460
When coal is burned it releases chemicals
like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, a little

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.010
mercury, and carbon dioxide, not to mention
a bunch of various particulates.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.760
These leak into the air and water and result
in smog, soot, acid rain, global warming,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.640
and toxic air emissions.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.440
Those can cause asthma, lung cancer, various
heart diseases, and other health problems.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.440
Not good.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.400
So, in an effort to placate people worried
about dying just to get a little electricity,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.660
the coal industry heavily invested in clean
coal.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.570
But Clean Coal is still coal.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.080
It’s not a different kind of coal.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.720
It’s just handled differently in the process
of turning it into energy.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.310
The term Clean Coal is actually shorthand
for Clean Coal technologies, which are designed

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.910
to lessen the number of pollutants released
in the production of energy.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.440
One such method is called carbon capture and
storage, which is exactly what it sounds like.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.200
Carbon dioxide is separated from the air before
it leaves a power plant or other production

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.060
plant using a process called “absorption”
or carbon scrubbing.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.000
This is where chemicals called amines are
used to bind to the carbon dioxide and pull

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.260
it out of the air.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.830
This gas is then piped underground, or “sequestered”
so that it can’t leak into the atmosphere.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.940
It can even be used to help depleted oil fields
coax their last bits of oil to the surface.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.110
We have a whole video about CO2 scrubbing
if you want to know more.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.410
Another popular method to end the infamous
acid rain scares of the 70s and 80s was to

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.230
wash all the sulfur out of coal before it
made its way into a plant.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.450
And when I say wash, I mean literally, they
would break it down into chunks and run it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.620
through a water tank which could include minerals
like magnetite to increase the density of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.620
the liquid.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.170
The coal floats, because it is less dense,
while the sulfur and other impurities sinks.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.050
A third clean coal technology is called “oxy-fuel
combustion”.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.480
When coal is burned at a power plant, the
exhaust, also called “flue gas”, is usually

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.410
just pumped into the atmosphere.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.260
But oxy-fuel combustion actually reroutes
this flue gas back into the plant, where it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.980
is paired with pure oxygen and reused to burn
more coal.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.950
The reason they do this is because the normal
air we breathe air has a ton of nitrogen in

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.650
it, and when it’s heated with the coal,
it reduces its efficiency and creates more

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.050
nitrogen byproducts.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.250
But when we reuse flue gas and combine it
with pure oxygen, this solves both of these

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.730
problems and allows for hotter temperatures
and more energy extraction.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.349
There are a number of other methods, but despite
these efforts, environmental activists call

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.370
“clean coal” an oxymoron, since it’s
not quite the anti-pollution miracle that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.430
coal companies make it out to be.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.420
The problem is that these methods are incredibly
expensive and energy intensive, and that money

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.760
and energy has to come from somewhere.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.430
Some estimate that the addition of capture
carbon and storage to a coal fire plant increases

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.460
coal use by 25% while keeping electricity
output the same.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.480
Another huge problem is that these byproducts
aren’t so much being eliminated as they

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.090
are being moved elsewhere, which is more of
a storage solution than an environmental one.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.450
And on top of all that, for those reasons,
clean coal technologies are not particularly

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.959
widespread, at least not enough to make a
significant difference for the time being.

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.209
In the end, clean coal helps stem pollution
at the source, but it seems to help coal companies

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.910
maintain their image more than it helps the
environment maintain itself.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.680

So, coal burning can contribute to acid rain.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.550
But we don’t really hear about acid rain
anymore.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.770
We used to a lot in the 70s and 80s.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.120
Is it still a big deal?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.329
What ever happened to acid rain?

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:36.340
