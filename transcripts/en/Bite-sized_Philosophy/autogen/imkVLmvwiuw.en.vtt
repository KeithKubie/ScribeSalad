the being is not just a particle well
that's a hell of a conclusion I would be

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220
that's a hell of a conclusion I would be
 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.340
that's a hell of a conclusion I would be
very careful before I made it because

you're tough enough you can do it and
you can do it right and it

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460
you can do it right and it
 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.240
you can do it right and it
they can and if you if you fortified it

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250
they can and if you if you fortified it
 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.660

of suffering that makes existence
intolerable and so the answer is it not

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080
intolerable and so the answer is it not

can have a tragedy if you can get tough
enough so you can outride in fact I

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350
enough so you can outride in fact I
 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.630
