00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.570
So to recap, we've learned what is UX and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.520
we've come up with some really good examples of user

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.990
experience. And we've learned about the difference between UI and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.440
UX. And also we've learned that UX is everyone's responsibility.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.650
So now, as promised, we're going to give you

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.850
two concrete examples of how you can improve user experience

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.430
of your app today. So the first one is login.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.280
So let's look at this login or account creation form.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.670
So, an account creation form is usually the first

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.730
thing your user sees right after they download your application.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.470
So take a minute and think about some things

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.290
you might do to improve the UX of this form.
