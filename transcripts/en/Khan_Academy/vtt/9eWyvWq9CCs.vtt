00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.000
What I want to do
in this video, is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.850
figure out if
there's any fast way

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.830
to figure out the sum of
the roots of any polynomial.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.555
And actually, there actually is.

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:12.180
And so that's why
I'm doing this video.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.138
So let's start with a
second degree polynomial.

00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:22.970
So let's say it's x squared
plus a1x, plus a2 is equal to 0.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.390
So this is just a standard set
quadratic equation, right here,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.485
second degree equation.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.860
And you might be saying, hey,
but you put the coefficient

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.640
on the x term being equal to 1.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.490
And in general, you can
always convert any polynomial.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.370
And I'll do it with
a second degree,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.960
but if you have ax squared
plus bx plus c is equal to 0,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.772
you can just divide both
sides of this equation by a.

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:49.480
And you're going to
have something that's

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.860
in this form, where the
coefficient on the x squared

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.330
term is going to be equal to 1.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.320
And you can do that
with any polynomial.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.780
You can do that
with any polynomial

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.160
that's set equal to 0.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.050
So with that out of
the way, let's think

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.383
about what the sum of the
roots of this are going to be.

00:01:04.383 --> 00:01:07.990
So this is a second
degree polynomial.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.780
It's a quadratic equation.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.780
So it'll have two roots.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.780
They could be real or complex.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.282
So let's call the
roots r1 and r2.

00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:17.990
And that tells us,
since these are roots,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.160
that x minus r1 times x minus
r2 is going to be equal to 0.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.710
And if we multiply this out,
we get x times x is x squared.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.580
x times negative
r2 is negative r2x.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.660
And then we have negative
r1 times x, so negative r1x.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.080
And then we have negative
r1 times negative r2,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.285
which is plus r1r2
is equal to 0.

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:46.410
Then we can simplify this
middle term a little bit.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:55.830
It becomes x squared minus
r1 plus r2 x plus r1r2

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.930
is equal to 0.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.920
So let's think about what
the sum of the roots are.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.090
So based on what we're
looking at right over here,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.490
what is r1 plus r2?

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.440
Well, we see it
right over here when

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.460
we multiplied out
these two expressions.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.150
r1 plus r2 is the negative
of this second coefficient

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.010
right over here.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.420
Or it's the negative of the
coefficient on the first degree

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.920
term.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.210
So if we look at the first
degree term over here,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.530
a1 must be the same thing
as negative r1 plus r2.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.030
Or another way to
think about it is,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.980
r1 plus r2 must be
equal to negative a1.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.360
So that wasn't too bad for
the second degree case.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.100
Let's try the third degree case.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.730
Let's see, if we have x to
the third plus a1x squared

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.510
plus a2x, plus a3 is equal to 0.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.130
Let's think about what the
sum of its roots might be.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.767
Well, this guy is now going
to have one more root.

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:01.600
I'm not saying it's the
exact same equation,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.780
but let's say we're
keeping everything general.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.190
So now we could say we
have roots r1, r2, and r3.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.670
Or we could say that x minus
r1 times x minus r2 times x

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.430
minus r3 is equal to 0.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.240
Now we could multiply
all of this out,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.880
but we already figured out what
x minus r1 times x minus r2 is.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.060
It's this business over here.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.424
So we just have to multiply
this times x minus r3.

00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:36.840
And actually, I'm not even
going to do the full expansion,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.110
because we have a hunch
here that it always deals,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.730
it seems, with the
coefficient on the term that's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.040
one degree lower than the
degree of the polynomial.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.290
This was a second degree,
we looked at the coefficient

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.500
on the first degree term.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.800
Maybe to find the
sum, we only have

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.550
to look at this
coefficient over here.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.510
So I'm only going to figure out
this product up to this point,

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.350
and then we can just
ignore the rest of it

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.960
and see if get something
that is useful.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.130
So let's do the expansion.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.540
Let's multiply this right over
here times this over here.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.360
And what do we get?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.480
To get the x to the
third term, the only way

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.850
to get that is to multiply
this x times this x squared.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.500
So we're going to
get x to the third.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.910
And that's the only way to
get the x to the third term.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.100
That's the only way to
get the third degree term.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.740
Now how do we get
this term over here?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.573
How do we get-- let me
do this a new color--

00:04:31.573 --> 00:04:34.210
how do we get the x
squared term over here?

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.390
Well, we could multiply
this x times this

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.400
over here, because
the x times the x

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.250
is going to give us x squared.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.929
So it'll be negative r1 plus
r2 x squared times that term.

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:52.720
And then if you multiply
this x times that,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.750
you'll get r1r2 x,
and all of that.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.460
But I'll just write,
so on and so forth.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.240
And then, what other ways can
we get an x squared term here?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240
There's no other way to
get x to the third term,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.580
but what other ways could
we get an x squared term?

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.090
Well, when we multiply
this times this,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.420
you have the negative r3.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.850
Let me do this in another color.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.177
You have the negative
r3 three times this.

00:05:15.177 --> 00:05:16.760
Your obviously going
to take this term

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.910
multiplied by everything.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.160
And then add it to this term
multiplied by everything.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960
But we only care
about the things--

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.650
I did this just to show you that
it's there-- but I only care,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.722
because we have a
hunch that what matters

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:28.430
is the coefficient on
the x squared term.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.846
So we just want
to see, how do you

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:33.550
build the x squared
term in our, I guess,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.325
our expanded polynomial?

00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:37.700
The other way to
get an x squared

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.920
is to multiply the negative r3
times this x squared over here.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.959
So this is going to be
negative r3 times x squared.

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.750
And then when you
multiply this times this,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.160
you're going to
get something else.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.360
Then when you multiply
this times this,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.960
you're just going to get
the negative product of all

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.020
the roots.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.680
So that's just something else.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.390
And so when we add
everything together

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.057
you get x to the third.

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:00.890
And then what's the sum
of these two things?

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.185
It's negative r1 plus
r2 plus r3 x squared.

00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:09.560
And then you're just going to
have a bunch of other stuff

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.270
that we didn't take
the time to add.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.000
But it looks like
our hunch paid off,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.700
because what is now
the sum of the roots?

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.074
r1 plus r2 plus r3.

00:06:19.074 --> 00:06:19.990
What is that equal to?

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.560
Well, that's sitting
right over here.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.101
That's equal to the negative
of this coefficient right

00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.600
over here.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.450
That's once again
equal to negative a1.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.230
It's equal to the negative of
the coefficient on the degree

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.144
term that's one less than
the degree of our polynomial.

00:06:37.144 --> 00:06:38.310
So we already see a pattern.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.610
Let's say if we can
prove it generally.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.180
So we've already proven,
essentially, two base cases.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.620
We proven it for a degree
of two, a degree of three.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.090
Let's assume that it's
true for degree of n,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.159
and then we can prove it
for degree of n plus 1.

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.700
And essentially,
this will be a proof

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.520
by induction for
polynomials of any degree.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.090
So let's just say we have
an nth degree polynomial.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.280
So let's just assume this.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.760
So we're going to
assume this step,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.960
and this gives a little proof
by mathematical induction

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.970
practice.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.070
So let's just assume that we
have a polynomial x to the n--

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.780
it's nth degrees-- so x to the
n, plus a1x to the n minus 1,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.150
and it just goes on and
on and on all the way down

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.730
to the 0th degree term.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.220
It has roots, obviously, r1,
r2, all the way to r sub n.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:39.160
And we're going to assume
that r1 plus r2 plus all

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.180
the way to r sub n is
equal to negative a1.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.260
Or another way to
think about it,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:54.260
if we were to multiply x
minus r1 times x minus r2,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.570
and just keep multiplying all
the way to x minus r sub n

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:03.760
is equal to 0, this should
give us x to the n minus r1,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:10.960
plus r2, plus all the way
to rn x to the n minus 1,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.540
and then plus a
bunch of other stuff

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.956
that we're not
going to calculate.

00:08:13.956 --> 00:08:15.850
So this tells us this.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.680
That this coefficient
right over here

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.520
is going to be equal to
this right over here.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.190
So that is what we
are going to assume.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.630
So now let's think
about-- and we're not

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:35.880
assuming this part-- given that,
let's think about the situation

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.190
where we have a polynomial
x to the n plus 1,

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.350
plus a1x to the n, plus--
and it just keeps going.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.210
You get all the
degree terms there.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.060
So now this is going
to have the roots

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.260
r1, r2, all the way to rn.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.340
And then it'll have rn plus 1.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.810
It'll have these n roots, and
then it'll have an rn plus 1.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.650
So essentially, that tells
us that we're going to have,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.287
essentially, this product
times x minus rn plus 1

00:09:06.287 --> 00:09:06.870
is equal to 0.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.440
Let me write it out.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.460
I don't want to skip steps.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.360
So this tells us, if
these are all the roots,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.770
that x minus r1 times x
minus r2, blah, blah, blah,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.000
all the way to x
minus rn times x

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.180
minus rn plus 1 is
going to be equal to 0.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.050
It has one more root than
the previous example,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.080
than the one where we
made the assumption.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.430
So if we were to expand this
thing out, how can we do that?

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.980
Well, this thing, if we
were to multiply it out,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.620
it's just this thing over
here times this new binomial,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.570
because this thing
over here is--

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.690
let me set it up, let me use
color coded-- this thing,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.960
let me do a different color.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.480
This thing over here
we already established.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.860
We assumed is this
thing over here,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.010
which is this thing over here.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.860
So if we want this
entire expansion,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:00.720
we just have to multiply
this times this.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.470
So how can we get an x
to the n plus 1 term?

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.350
How can we get to the
x to the n plus 1 term?

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.440
Well, there's only one way to
get the x to the n plus 1 term.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.000
And that's by multiplying
this x times this x to the n.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.520
So that will give us
x to the n plus 1.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.750
That's the only way to do it.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.800
That's the only way this
highest degree term.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.100
Now how can we get--
let me do it in purple--

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.275
how can we get at
the x to the n term?

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.700
Well, we can multiply this
x times this second term

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.260
over here.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.350
So if you multiply this x
times this business over here,

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.050
you're going to get negative
r1 plus r2, plus all the way

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.020
to rn.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.667
x times x to the n minus 1, is
just going to be x to the n.

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:50.500
And then obviously,
you're going to multiply

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.930
this x times all
the other terms,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.055
so you're just going to
get a bunch of other stuff.

00:10:54.055 --> 00:10:56.320
So that's how we can get
these two terms using the x.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.069
And then can we get
either of these degree

00:10:58.069 --> 00:11:01.240
terms using the r sub n plus 1?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.690
Well, we can multiply
r sub n plus 1,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.550
or negative r sub n
plus 1 times x to the n.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.660
And then we'll also get
a similar degree term.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.569
So we'll have negative r sub
n plus 1 times x to the n.

00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:18.360
And then obviously,
we're going to multiply

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.920
this times all of the other
characters in this polynomial.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.820
So you're going to have all
this plus so on and so forth.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.860
But this will suit our
purposes, because when

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.516
you add these two
things, what do we get?

00:11:28.516 --> 00:11:33.510
We get x to the n
plus 1, and then we

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.640
get minus-- well,
this and this are

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.890
the coefficients on
the x to the n term.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:45.060
So this is going to be minus
r1 plus r2 plus all the way

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.160
to plus rn.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.240
And then this is
minus rn plus 1.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.920
We have the minus out front.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.050
So this is plus r sub
n plus 1 x to the n.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.810
And then we're going to have
a bunch of other lower degree

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.200
terms that don't matter.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.490
But we've just proven our case.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:09.360
What is r1 plus r2 plus all
the way to plus r sub n plus 1?

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.710
What is this equal to?

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.900
Well, in our expansion we
have it right over here.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.350
That's equal to that over there.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.170
That is equal to the
negative of this coefficient.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.080
It's equal to the
negative of a1.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.640
Now the reason why this
works out no matter what--

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.470
you say, hey, if I
have complex roots,

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.710
how does it always end
up being a real number?

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.530
And that's because the
imaginary parts cancel out

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.172
when you take their sum.

00:12:34.172 --> 00:12:35.130
So let's just apply it.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.140
We've proven it.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.770
We've proven, actually,
two base cases.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.900
We've proven it for a
degree 2, for degree 3.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.960
And then we showed that if
it's true for any degree n,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.800
then it's definitely true
for any degree n plus 1.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.150
So we know if it's
true for degree 3,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.600
then it's definitely
true for degree 4, which

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.000
means it's definitely
true for degree 5.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.150
So A mathematical induction
is kind of this domino proof

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.760
that if it's true for 3,
which makes it true for 4,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.810
then assuming it's true
for 4 makes it true for 5.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.620
And it just keeps
going to any n.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.300
So in general, if
someone gives you

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.540
a polynomial-- let me think
of some crazy polynomial.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:18.020
If I were to give you x
to the seventh, minus pi x

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:25.340
to the sixth plus ex to the
fifth, minus square root of 2 x

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.410
to the fourth, minus-- I
won't write out all the terms.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.210
So minus 3 is equal to zero.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.970
If someone were to give you this
polynomial, and they were say,

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.470
what do the seven roots of
this polynomial add up to?

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.780
You say, oh, well,
the sum of these roots

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.040
is going to be the negative
of this coefficient right

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.740
over here.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.667
So r1 plus r2 plus all the
way to r7, all seven roots

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:50.000
are going to add up to the
negative of this coefficient.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.314
They're going to be equal to pi.

00:13:52.314 --> 00:13:54.480
And one other thing, you
might be saying, hey, wait.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.431
Every polynomial you
did had a 1 coefficient

00:13:56.431 --> 00:13:57.930
in front of the
highest degree term.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.700
You know, not all
polynomials have that.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.200
And the answer there
is-- let's say,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.120
if I were to give you a
polynomial, I don't know,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:11.970
7x to the fifth, minus 6x to
the fourth, plus, I don't know,

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.137
pi x to the third, plus a
bunch of stuff other stuff

00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:16.720
is equal to 0-- and
you wanted to find

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.060
the sum of this
polynomials roots.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.210
You'd first divide
everything by 7.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.200
So it becomes x to
the fifth, minus 6

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.200
over 7x to the fourth, plus
pi over 7x to the third,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.560
plus so on and so forth, is
equal to 0/7 which is just 0.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.060
And now you look
at this polynomial,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.460
well the sum is going to be the
negative of this coefficient

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:38.960
here.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.490
So it's going to be the
sum of all five roots.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.390
Or it's going to be 6/7.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.850
Anyway, hopefully
you enjoyed that.
