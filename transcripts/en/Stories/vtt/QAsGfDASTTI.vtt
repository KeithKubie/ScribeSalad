00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:04.560
LAURA LING: Growing up,
you were African American,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120
socialized as a girl,
adopted by a white family.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.790
That must have been
extremely confusing for you.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.670
KINGSTON FARADY: It was
really, really hard.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.970
And there was a
lot of questioning

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.706
around how did I get here, and
who am I, and how do I do this.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:27.680
I always felt--
or not even felt,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.780
I knew that I was different.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.920
It made me very quiet
and introverted and sad.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.000
I remember in my childhood
just always thinking

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.360
this isn't going to be my life.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.627
LAURA LING: When you
finally come to the decision

00:00:42.627 --> 00:00:43.210
to transition?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.100
KINGSTON FARADY: I started
thinking about transitioning

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.470
around 17, 18 years old.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.950
So it was around
that time that I

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.160
started to ask myself questions
around could this be me.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.940
Am I really a man
that had been assigned

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.250
at birth the wrong gender.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.510
I finally made the decision
when I was about 25.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.360
I still remember receiving
my first testosterone shot,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.830
and how happy I was.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.601
I knew I made the
right decision.

00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:15.600
LAURA LING: What was it
like the first few years

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.576
after you transitioned?

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.190
KINGSTON FARADY:
They were tough.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.890
They were very hard.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.440
So much shifted quickly.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.850
You're learning new emotions.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.450
You're learning how to
deal with new thoughts.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.750
You're learning how to
deal with a changing body.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.860
And then on top of that,
you're engaging with the world

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.928
in a brand-new way.

00:01:38.928 --> 00:01:42.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.540
LAURA LING: Tell
me about the ritual

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.364
that you have adopted to help
you in this life's journey.

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:52.530
KINGSTON FARADY: There are
so many different aspects

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.820
of a human being.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.760
Mind, body, spirit, will.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.190
And for me, transitioning,
I had to figure out

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.259
who am I now in terms of these
different aspects of my being.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.020
And so I created Love
Your Vehicle, your vehicle

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.975
being your body, your temple.

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:17.570
I created that
physical routine that I

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.630
needed to build my body into
what I wanted it to look like.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.300
And I love trail run,
I love the obstacle

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.150
of having to leap
over roots of trees

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.250
and run up hills and feel
dirt and breathe the air.

00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:39.470
The mind component
is about learning.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.620
It's critical that every
single day I spend time

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.860
really enriching my
understanding of what's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.040
happening around me.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.355
And the spiritual component
is about meditation.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.700
When I meditate, I
will really focus

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.490
on just keeping my mind calm.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.410
And I get to
experience that peace

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.480
and realize that there is a
peace that is a part of life

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.671
that we can have.

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:08.610
LAURA LING: How has
this ritual of yours

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.240
of loving your vehicle
changed you as a person?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.240
KINGSTON FARADY: It has
made me a lot stronger.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.130
And it's also allowed
me to be OK with myself

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.030
as a transgender person.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.350
It's allowed me--
it's helped me to walk

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.850
in the world with strength
and pride and confidence.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.030
And it's allowed me to believe
that not only are transgender

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.220
people real, but
we are important,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.886
and we are a part of
the fabric of life,

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:41.177
despite anything else that
I might hear during the day.

00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:47.160
LAURA LING: Be sure to
watch this next episode.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.140
When you look in the mirror now,
who's the person that you see?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.700
SPEAKER 3: So I see a lot
more confident person.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.870
I see someone who's
made a lot of progress.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.470
And most of all, I see
someone who's on a journey.
