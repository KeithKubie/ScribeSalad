00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:14.665
Michael Jordan once said,

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:16.478
"I don't know whether I'll fly or not.

00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:18.870
I know that when I'm in the air

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.736
sometimes I feel like I don't ever
have to come down."

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:23.302
But thanks to Isaac Newton,

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:27.091
we know that what goes up
must eventually come down.

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:31.762
In fact, the human limit 
on a flat surface for hang time,

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:36.379
or the time from when your feet leave
the ground to when they touch down again,

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.654
is only about one second,

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:41.583
and, yes, that even includes his airness,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.436
whose infamous dunk 
from the free throw line

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:48.517
has been calculated at .92 seconds.

00:00:48.517 --> 00:00:53.658
And, of course, gravity is what's making it
so hard to stay in the air longer.

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:58.506
Earth's gravity pulls all nearby objects
towards the planet's surface,

00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:03.418
accelerating them 
at 9.8 meters per second squared.

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:08.882
As soon as you jump,
gravity is already pulling you back down.

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:10.777
Using what we know about gravity,

00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:15.296
we can derive a fairly simple equation
that models hang time.

00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:19.735
This equation states that the height
of a falling object above a surface

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:25.185
is equal to the object's initial height
from the surface plus its initial velocity

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.685
multiplied by how many seconds
it's been in the air,

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.664
plus half of the 
gravitational acceleration

00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:37.026
multiplied by the square of the number
of seconds spent in the air.

00:01:37.026 --> 00:01:41.102
Now we can use this equation to model
MJ's free throw dunk.

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:45.250
Say MJ starts, as one does,
at zero meters off the ground,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.508
and jumps with an initial vertical
velocity of 4.51 meters per second.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:55.393
Let's see what happens if we model
this equation on a coordinate grid.

00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:57.388
Since the formula is quadratic,

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:00.820
the relationship between height
and time spent in the air

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.290
has the shape of a parabola.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.830
So what does it tell us about MJ's dunk?

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.366
Well, the parabola's vertex shows us
his maximum height off the ground

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:13.759
at 1.038 meters,

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.752
and the X-intercepts tell us 
when he took off

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:22.470
and when he landed,
with the difference being the hang time.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.034
It looks like Earth's gravity
makes it pretty hard

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:28.213
for even MJ to get some solid hang time.

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:33.126
But what if he were playing an away game
somewhere else, somewhere far?

00:02:33.126 --> 00:02:37.973
Well, the gravitational acceleration
on our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus,

00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:43.822
is 8.87 meters per second squared, 
pretty similar to Earth's.

00:02:43.822 --> 00:02:47.829
If Michael jumped here with the same
force as he did back on Earth,

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.140
he would be able to get more 
than a meter off the ground,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.972
giving him a hang time 
of a little over one second.

00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:59.070
The competition on Jupiter
with its gravitational pull

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.829
of 24.92 meters per second squared
would be much less entertaining.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.781
Here, Michael wouldn't even
get a half meter off the ground,

00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:13.309
and would remain airborne
a mere .41 seconds.

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.649
But a game on the moon
would be quite spectacular.

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.526
MJ could take off from behind half court,

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:22.097
jumping over six meters high,

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:25.413
and his hang time of over 
five and half seconds,

00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:29.199
would be long enough for anyone
to believe he could fly.
