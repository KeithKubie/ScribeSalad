know this administration priorities
 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.839
know this administration priorities
clearly we're tremendously important

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:50.849
clearly we're tremendously important
 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.209
clearly we're tremendously important
players there and here some of our

now move from the research you know

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:07.889
now move from the research you know
 

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:09.529
now move from the research you know
pushing forward the research frontiers

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539
pushing forward the research frontiers
 

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:12.110
pushing forward the research frontiers
in these areas to just a couple of words

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120
in these areas to just a couple of words
 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.510
in these areas to just a couple of words
about economic competitiveness and and

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520
about economic competitiveness and and
 

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.879
about economic competitiveness and and
the importance of our field for the

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:16.889
the importance of our field for the
 

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:21.230
the importance of our field for the
country in that sense so I know I feel

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240
country in that sense so I know I feel
 

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.339
country in that sense so I know I feel
like I'm bringing coals to Newcastle

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:22.349
like I'm bringing coals to Newcastle
 

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:25.899
like I'm bringing coals to Newcastle
here right so you all get how important

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:25.909
here right so you all get how important
 

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:29.540
here right so you all get how important
information technologies has been to the

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:29.550
information technologies has been to the
 

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.550
information technologies has been to the
economy and here are just a couple of

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560
economy and here are just a couple of
 

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.159
economy and here are just a couple of
figures that come from National Academy

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.169
figures that come from National Academy
 

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.709
figures that come from National Academy
reports but I want to focus not just on

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719
reports but I want to focus not just on
 

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:39.079
reports but I want to focus not just on
the impact but sort of how that impact

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:39.089
the impact but sort of how that impact
 

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:41.510
the impact but sort of how that impact
happens and I'm curious here how many

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520
happens and I'm curious here how many
 

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.089
happens and I'm curious here how many
people know what the tire tracks diagram

00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:44.099
people know what the tire tracks diagram
 

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:46.480
people know what the tire tracks diagram
is

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:46.490
 

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.160
how about Brooks Sutherland diagram

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.170
how about Brooks Sutherland diagram
 

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.620
how about Brooks Sutherland diagram
that's what it was so I gave a talk at

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:51.630
that's what it was so I gave a talk at
 

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.870
that's what it was so I gave a talk at
Stanford last week they have a higher

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880
Stanford last week they have a higher
 

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.790
Stanford last week they have a higher
percentage of people who have heard of

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800
percentage of people who have heard of
 

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.350
percentage of people who have heard of
it than you folks but now you'll all

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360
it than you folks but now you'll all
 

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.420
it than you folks but now you'll all
have heard of it and I said how many

00:08:59.420 --> 00:08:59.430
have heard of it and I said how many
 

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.890
have heard of it and I said how many
people heard of the tire tracks diagram

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:00.900
people heard of the tire tracks diagram
 

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.090
people heard of the tire tracks diagram
and I think about a quarter of the

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100
and I think about a quarter of the
 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.430
and I think about a quarter of the
people and then I showed it which is

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440
people and then I showed it which is
 

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.230
people and then I showed it which is
this and I'll talk about it in a second

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240
this and I'll talk about it in a second
 

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.970
this and I'll talk about it in a second
and then a couple people shouted oh

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980
and then a couple people shouted oh
 

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.920
and then a couple people shouted oh
that's Brooks Sutherland which it is

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:09.930
that's Brooks Sutherland which it is
 

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.630
that's Brooks Sutherland which it is
that's where it first came from and then

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640
that's where it first came from and then
 

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.370
that's where it first came from and then
50 percent said they they'd seen it

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380
50 percent said they they'd seen it
 

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.170
50 percent said they they'd seen it
before but I want to the reason I'm

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180
before but I want to the reason I'm
 

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.900
before but I want to the reason I'm
putting it up here is I wanted to to

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:17.910
putting it up here is I wanted to to
 

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.790
putting it up here is I wanted to to
show you I mean this is a graphic

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800
show you I mean this is a graphic
 

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.280
show you I mean this is a graphic
illustration of something incredibly

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.290
illustration of something incredibly
 

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.510
illustration of something incredibly
important and really a beautiful

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:23.520
important and really a beautiful
 

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.630
important and really a beautiful
illustration I think of the interplay

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640
illustration I think of the interplay
 

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.450
illustration I think of the interplay
between what we do as University

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:29.460
between what we do as University
 

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.860
between what we do as University
researchers and the role of federal

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:30.870
researchers and the role of federal
 

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.370
researchers and the role of federal
government and in funding an enabling

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380
government and in funding an enabling
 

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.020
government and in funding an enabling
University researchers what happens in

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.030
University researchers what happens in
 

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.030
University researchers what happens in
industry and product lines here so you

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040
industry and product lines here so you
 

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.800
industry and product lines here so you
see these lines going up I'm going to

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:39.810
see these lines going up I'm going to
 

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.170
see these lines going up I'm going to
focus on networking here it's my area

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.180
focus on networking here it's my area
 

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.750
focus on networking here it's my area
and so what you see here is sort of in

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760
and so what you see here is sort of in
 

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.600
and so what you see here is sort of in
networking starting in the 1970s the

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.610
networking starting in the 1970s the
 

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.270
networking starting in the 1970s the
notion of packet switching and you know

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.280
notion of packet switching and you know
 

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.770
notion of packet switching and you know
really DARPA was making the primary

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:51.780
really DARPA was making the primary
 

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.590
really DARPA was making the primary
investments here at the time and then

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600
investments here at the time and then
 

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.140
investments here at the time and then
sort of going up through now this is

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:57.150
sort of going up through now this is
 

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.970
sort of going up through now this is
when industry started picking up on it

00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980
when industry started picking up on it
 

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.840
when industry started picking up on it
the Green Line is when this area became

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:02.850
the Green Line is when this area became
 

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.570
the Green Line is when this area became
a 1 billion dollar product area and when

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580
a 1 billion dollar product area and when
 

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.430
a 1 billion dollar product area and when
it gets fatter that's when it's it's 10

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440
it gets fatter that's when it's it's 10
 

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.530
it gets fatter that's when it's it's 10
billion and unfortunately what you can't

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540
billion and unfortunately what you can't
 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.900
billion and unfortunately what you can't
see here quite as well is there are

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.910
see here quite as well is there are
 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.600
see here quite as well is there are
arrows going back and forth there and

arrows going back and forth there and
 

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.690
arrows going back and forth there and
those arrows that come from university

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:17.700
those arrows that come from university
 

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.000
those arrows that come from university
to industry and industry back to to

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.010
to industry and industry back to to
 

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.580
to industry and industry back to to
universities that is the flow sort of

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:22.590
universities that is the flow sort of
 

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.850
universities that is the flow sort of
the documented flow of ideas and people

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860
the documented flow of ideas and people
 

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.100
the documented flow of ideas and people
that go back and forth and this is sort

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.110
that go back and forth and this is sort
 

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.270
that go back and forth and this is sort
of getting at the economic

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.280
of getting at the economic
 

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.490
of getting at the economic
competitiveness aspect of what I was

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500
competitiveness aspect of what I was
 

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.320
competitiveness aspect of what I was
saying that ideas that are starting in

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.330
saying that ideas that are starting in
 

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.060
saying that ideas that are starting in
universities are maybe starting in

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.070
universities are maybe starting in
 

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.910

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.220
going to be and jobs are incredibly
incredibly important especially to our

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.230
incredibly important especially to our
 

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.530
incredibly important especially to our
students learn more these days and so

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:16.540
students learn more these days and so
 

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.930
students learn more these days and so
again I think it speaks to the central

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:18.940
again I think it speaks to the central
 

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.420
again I think it speaks to the central
role that we play not just in research

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:21.430
role that we play not just in research
 

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:27.269
role that we play not just in research
now but in education as well so when I

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279
now but in education as well so when I
 

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.650
now but in education as well so when I
go out and talk about computer science

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:28.660
go out and talk about computer science
 

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.900
go out and talk about computer science
sight you know or sorry computer and

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:30.910
sight you know or sorry computer and
 

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.200
sight you know or sorry computer and
information science and engineering you

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.210
information science and engineering you
 

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.120
information science and engineering you
know I always like to leave this message

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.130
know I always like to leave this message
 

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.740
know I always like to leave this message
with folks that it's an exciting

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:37.750
with folks that it's an exciting
 

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.100
with folks that it's an exciting
obviously important impactful time to be

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.110
obviously important impactful time to be
 

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.920
obviously important impactful time to be
in our discipline okay so what I'd like

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:43.930
in our discipline okay so what I'd like
 

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.560
in our discipline okay so what I'd like
to do next is I'd like to dive down a

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:46.570
to do next is I'd like to dive down a
 

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.970
to do next is I'd like to dive down a
little bit sort of a little bit deeper

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:47.980
little bit sort of a little bit deeper
 

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.740
little bit sort of a little bit deeper
into some of the programs that we're

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:49.750
into some of the programs that we're
 

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:54.269
into some of the programs that we're
doing within size at NSF but I've been a

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279
doing within size at NSF but I've been a
 

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:55.560
doing within size at NSF but I've been a
teacher long enough to know you

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:55.570
teacher long enough to know you
 

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.110
teacher long enough to know you
shouldn't just get up and start talking

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120
shouldn't just get up and start talking
 

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.850
shouldn't just get up and start talking
talking talking talking so any any

00:15:59.850 --> 00:15:59.860
talking talking talking so any any
 

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:11.760
talking talking talking so any any
comments are great oh hey arrow is going

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:11.770
comments are great oh hey arrow is going
 

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:19.470
comments are great oh hey arrow is going
back and forth yeah

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480
 

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.879
okay okay

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:22.889
okay okay
 

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:25.470
okay okay
great point I guess I've I've learned

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480
great point I guess I've I've learned
 

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.970
great point I guess I've I've learned
that as a faculty member when

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:26.980
that as a faculty member when
 

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.759
that as a faculty member when
interacting with industry sometimes I

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:29.769
interacting with industry sometimes I
 

00:16:29.769 --> 00:16:31.199
interacting with industry sometimes I
think when I was younger I used to think

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:31.209
think when I was younger I used to think
 

00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:33.599
think when I was younger I used to think
it's the brilliance of my research

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:33.609
it's the brilliance of my research
 

00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:35.729
it's the brilliance of my research
that's sort of attracting industry and

00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:35.739
that's sort of attracting industry and
 

00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:37.949
that's sort of attracting industry and
stuff like that and then I think over

00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959
stuff like that and then I think over
 

00:16:37.959 --> 00:16:39.749
stuff like that and then I think over
time I realized like okay they thought

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759
time I realized like okay they thought
 

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.879
time I realized like okay they thought
that was reasonable but what they really

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:41.889
that was reasonable but what they really
 

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:43.499
that was reasonable but what they really
wanted was access to my graduate

00:16:43.499 --> 00:16:43.509
wanted was access to my graduate
 

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:45.539
wanted was access to my graduate
students and and sort of the the

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:45.549
students and and sort of the the
 

00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:47.400
students and and sort of the the
workforce side of things I don't maybe

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.410
workforce side of things I don't maybe
 

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.960
workforce side of things I don't maybe
you folks have different experiences but

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:48.970
you folks have different experiences but
 

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.369
you folks have different experiences but
it's it's absolutely true yeah any other

00:16:53.369 --> 00:16:53.379
it's it's absolutely true yeah any other
 

00:16:53.379 --> 00:17:05.879
it's it's absolutely true yeah any other
comment what about sustainability for us

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:05.889
comment what about sustainability for us
 

00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:07.980
comment what about sustainability for us
and we are not moving in the right

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:07.990
and we are not moving in the right
 

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.759
and we are not moving in the right
direction in this country for instance

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:11.769
direction in this country for instance
 

00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:13.110
direction in this country for instance
in Pittsburgh and you mentioned the

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120
in Pittsburgh and you mentioned the
 

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.090
in Pittsburgh and you mentioned the
mayor yup we have three treys a day I

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:15.100
mayor yup we have three treys a day I
 

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.549

we don't have to fly to Paris we take a

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880
we don't have to fly to Paris we take a
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.000
we don't have to fly to Paris we take a
train which goes faster and the United

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.010
train which goes faster and the United
 

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.680

States is not pursuing this kind of

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:28.690
States is not pursuing this kind of
 

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.240

vision and when I was in a bar in the

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.250
vision and when I was in a bar in the
 

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.549
vision and when I was in a bar in the
Chinese after we makenai there yeah I

00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:35.559
Chinese after we makenai there yeah I
 

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:37.110
Chinese after we makenai there yeah I
remember when the airport in Hong Kong

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120
remember when the airport in Hong Kong
 

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.210
remember when the airport in Hong Kong
was being built a new airport in Hong

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:39.220
was being built a new airport in Hong
 

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.070
was being built a new airport in Hong
Kong thinking wow when's the last time

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080
Kong thinking wow when's the last time
 

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.950
Kong thinking wow when's the last time
we in the US undertook an infrastructure

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960
we in the US undertook an infrastructure
 

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.440
we in the US undertook an infrastructure
project of that size so I mean I guess I

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:46.450
project of that size so I mean I guess I
 

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.000
project of that size so I mean I guess I
agree with you I'm gonna get a little

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.010
agree with you I'm gonna get a little
 

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.500
agree with you I'm gonna get a little
bit I mean sort of coming back to what's

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:49.510
bit I mean sort of coming back to what's
 

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.240
bit I mean sort of coming back to what's
happening in cities and also

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.250
happening in cities and also
 

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.560
happening in cities and also
specifically what's happening here in

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:52.570
specifically what's happening here in
 

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.419
specifically what's happening here in
Pittsburgh and I want to touch on smart

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:54.429
Pittsburgh and I want to touch on smart
 

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:56.730
Pittsburgh and I want to touch on smart
cities and and that's only part of the

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:56.740
cities and and that's only part of the
 

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.049
cities and and that's only part of the
investment that I know you're talking

00:17:58.049 --> 00:17:58.059
investment that I know you're talking
 

00:17:58.059 --> 00:18:08.850
investment that I know you're talking
about okay and absolutely right and

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:08.860
about okay and absolutely right and
 

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.310
about okay and absolutely right and
that's gonna be driven by the kinds of

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320
that's gonna be driven by the kinds of
 

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.779
that's gonna be driven by the kinds of
applications that are going to be using

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:12.789
applications that are going to be using
 

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:16.830
applications that are going to be using
that so an industry interest - so I'm

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840
that so an industry interest - so I'm
 

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.779
that so an industry interest - so I'm
gonna I'm gonna spend I do want to spend

okay uh all right so I haven't worked
 

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.029
okay uh all right so I haven't worked
hard I'm sorry but you never want to see

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039
hard I'm sorry but you never want to see
 

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.680
hard I'm sorry but you never want to see
an org chart but but just so that you

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:28.690
an org chart but but just so that you
 

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.799
an org chart but but just so that you
know that we at NSF divide ourselves up

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:31.809
know that we at NSF divide ourselves up
 

00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:32.670
know that we at NSF divide ourselves up
in

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:32.680
in
 

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.070
in
NSF size we divide ourselves up into

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080
NSF size we divide ourselves up into
 

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.520
NSF size we divide ourselves up into
four four divisions so the division of

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:38.530
four four divisions so the division of
 

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.260
four four divisions so the division of
advanced cyber infrastructure that's

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:40.270
advanced cyber infrastructure that's
 

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.450
advanced cyber infrastructure that's
actually a division that serves all of

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:42.460
actually a division that serves all of

that receive significant support so we

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:55.390
that receive significant support so we
 

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.690
that receive significant support so we
do have HPC but there's a lot of as you

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:57.700
do have HPC but there's a lot of as you
 

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.700
do have HPC but there's a lot of as you
just mentioned a lot of interest in data

00:18:59.700 --> 00:18:59.710
just mentioned a lot of interest in data
 

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.460
just mentioned a lot of interest in data
networking and cyber security so we have

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:02.470
networking and cyber security so we have
 

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.400
networking and cyber security so we have
programs for high bandwidth connectivity

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:04.410

important and I'll come back to that
 

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.130
important and I'll come back to that
when we talk about the BNs CI this is

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.140
when we talk about the BNs CI this is
 

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.050
when we talk about the BNs CI this is
our computing and communications

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:19.060
our computing and communications
 

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.000
our computing and communications
foundations this is where hardware and

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.010

of course the algorithmic foundations

of course the algorithmic foundations
 

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.400
of course the algorithmic foundations
and then finally I guess this is sort of

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:32.410
and then finally I guess this is sort of
 

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.680

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:44.260
interested in things like the success
 

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.290
interested in things like the success
rate so a success rate of

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:46.300
rate so a success rate of
 

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.320
rate so a success rate of
three percent and that's across all of

the programs that we have taking out
 

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.730
the programs that we have taking out
like workshop reports and travel grants

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:53.740
like workshop reports and travel grants
 

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.820
like workshop reports and travel grants
for students and Eagers and things like

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:56.830
for students and Eagers and things like

hundred percent hit rates are very high
 

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.090
hundred percent hit rates are very high
hit rates you know I'll say it's been

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:03.100
hit rates you know I'll say it's been
 

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.300

going down slowly over time our career

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:06.310
going down slowly over time our career
 

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.830
going down slowly over time our career
numbers tend to be a little bit higher

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840
numbers tend to be a little bit higher
 

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.540
numbers tend to be a little bit higher
than that some of the other ones because

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:09.550
than that some of the other ones because
 

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.580
than that some of the other ones because
we've been really pushing hard to make

some of the other programs it's

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:16.510
some of the other programs it's
 

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.750
some of the other programs it's
certainly lessened less than 23 percent

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760
certainly lessened less than 23 percent
 

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.020
certainly lessened less than 23 percent
but that's what it is

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.030
but that's what it is
 

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.750
but that's what it is
across all of sighs maybe I'll just

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760
across all of sighs maybe I'll just
 

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.550
across all of sighs maybe I'll just
focus here a little bit on people

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:26.560
focus here a little bit on people
 

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.800
focus here a little bit on people
because in the end as Andrew mentioned

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:28.810
because in the end as Andrew mentioned
 

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.880
because in the end as Andrew mentioned
it's all about people right and so

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:31.890
it's all about people right and so
 

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.740

number of graduate students and a large

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.070
number of graduate students and a large
 

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.710
number of graduate students and a large
number of undergraduate students that

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720
number of undergraduate students that
 

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.960
number of undergraduate students that
are funded also so I know you all

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:42.970
are funded also so I know you all
 

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.850
are funded also so I know you all
probably aware of our research

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:44.860
probably aware of our research

experience from undergraduate program

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:46.600
experience from undergraduate program
 

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.360
experience from undergraduate program
which is a you know really very

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:48.370
which is a you know really very
 

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.340
which is a you know really very
important to but I mean it's across the

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:50.350
important to but I mean it's across the
 

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.320
important to but I mean it's across the
whole foundation and incredibly

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.330
whole foundation and incredibly
 

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.300
whole foundation and incredibly
important so that's a little bit of size

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:54.310
important so that's a little bit of size
 

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.580
important so that's a little bit of size
by the numbers I want to show you a

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:56.590
by the numbers I want to show you a
 

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.530
by the numbers I want to show you a
graphic just sort of to show you what

00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:58.540
graphic just sort of to show you what
 

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.860
graphic just sort of to show you what
the these are the budget realities that

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:01.870
the these are the budget realities that
 

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.470
the these are the budget realities that
we live in and so you know what you can

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480
we live in and so you know what you can
 

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.090
we live in and so you know what you can
see here is that actually in some of

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:06.100
see here is that actually in some of
 

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.010
see here is that actually in some of
these years the NSF budget actually went

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:08.020
these years the NSF budget actually went
 

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.050
these years the NSF budget actually went
down the size budget has been doing

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:10.060
down the size budget has been doing
 

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.030
down the size budget has been doing
relatively well

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:11.040
relatively well
 

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.890
relatively well
comparatively and so you see three four

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:13.900
comparatively and so you see three four
 

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.000
comparatively and so you see three four
five percent increases per year and

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.010
five percent increases per year and
 

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.770
five percent increases per year and
that's just showing the breakdown over

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:19.780
that's just showing the breakdown over
 

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.410
that's just showing the breakdown over
the different divisions people say sort

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:22.420
the different divisions people say sort
 

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.060
the different divisions people say sort
of jokingly that you know five percent

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.070
of jokingly that you know five percent
 

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.300
of jokingly that you know five percent
is the new doubling you know it's just

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:27.310
is the new doubling you know it's just
 

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.890
is the new doubling you know it's just
the budget reality that we face right

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:28.900
the budget reality that we face right
 

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.660
the budget reality that we face right
now and I want to come back later to

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:30.670
now and I want to come back later to
 

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.520
now and I want to come back later to
this issue of how we can expand the

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:35.530
this issue of how we can expand the
 

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.070
this issue of how we can expand the
opportunities for four pís in particular

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080
opportunities for four pís in particular
 

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.310
opportunities for four pís in particular
by by teaming with other other agencies

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320
by by teaming with other other agencies
 

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.830
by by teaming with other other agencies
and and with industry as well I believe

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840
and and with industry as well I believe
 

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.410
and and with industry as well I believe
okay and there's the number you can't

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:46.420
okay and there's the number you can't
 

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.930
okay and there's the number you can't
quite see it but for fiscal 2016 our

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:48.940
quite see it but for fiscal 2016 our
 

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.200
quite see it but for fiscal 2016 our
budget request is 954

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.210
budget request is 954
 

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.419
budget request is 954
and I think this is the last graphic on

00:22:54.419 --> 00:22:54.429
and I think this is the last graphic on
 

00:22:54.429 --> 00:22:57.570
and I think this is the last graphic on
on numbers where does our money go where

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:57.580
on numbers where does our money go where
 

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.980
on numbers where does our money go where
are the where does the funding go well

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:58.990
are the where does the funding go well
 

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.580
are the where does the funding go well
first of all I guess the point here is

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:02.590
first of all I guess the point here is
 

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.519
first of all I guess the point here is
that 66 so two-thirds of the funding

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:05.529
that 66 so two-thirds of the funding
 

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:08.279
that 66 so two-thirds of the funding
that goes out from size goes to computer

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:08.289
that goes out from size goes to computer
 

00:23:08.289 --> 00:23:09.389
that goes out from size goes to computer
and information science Computer

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:09.399
and information science Computer
 

00:23:09.399 --> 00:23:11.789
and information science Computer
Engineering departments but a full third

00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799
Engineering departments but a full third
 

00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:13.919
Engineering departments but a full third
of it is going to other engineering

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:13.929
of it is going to other engineering
 

00:23:13.929 --> 00:23:15.480
of it is going to other engineering
departments that the sciences and

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:15.490
departments that the sciences and
 

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.190
departments that the sciences and
humanities and some of the

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200
humanities and some of the
 

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.080
humanities and some of the
interdisciplinary centers and so I think

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.090
interdisciplinary centers and so I think
 

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.570
interdisciplinary centers and so I think
again I had a wonderful conversation

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:21.580
again I had a wonderful conversation
 

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.580
again I had a wonderful conversation
with a number of folks here right before

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:23.590
with a number of folks here right before
 

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.259
with a number of folks here right before
coming coming here about the

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:25.269
coming coming here about the
 

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:29.220
coming coming here about the
interdisciplinary nature of research and

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:29.230
interdisciplinary nature of research and
 

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.549
interdisciplinary nature of research and
I think especially here it's another one

00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559
I think especially here it's another one
 

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:35.009
I think especially here it's another one
of these coals to Newcastle I mean the

00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:35.019
of these coals to Newcastle I mean the
 

00:23:35.019 --> 00:23:36.539
of these coals to Newcastle I mean the
amount of interdisciplinary research

00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:36.549
amount of interdisciplinary research
 

00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:39.899
amount of interdisciplinary research
that goes on here pretty seamlessly as

00:23:39.899 --> 00:23:39.909
that goes on here pretty seamlessly as
 

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:41.340
that goes on here pretty seamlessly as
far as I can tell me people just

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:41.350
far as I can tell me people just
 

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.779
far as I can tell me people just
naturally work together across

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:42.789
naturally work together across
 

00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:44.100
naturally work together across
disciplines

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.110
disciplines
 

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.810
disciplines
you know I think that's where our

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:45.820
you know I think that's where our
 

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.060
you know I think that's where our
discipline you know a third of our

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.070
discipline you know a third of our
 

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.029
discipline you know a third of our
funding is going to disciplines outside

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039
funding is going to disciplines outside
 

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:53.340
funding is going to disciplines outside
sort of the traditional computer science

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:53.350
sort of the traditional computer science
 

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:59.909
sort of the traditional computer science
discipline ok uh ok so I want to talk a

00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919
discipline ok uh ok so I want to talk a
 

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:01.619
discipline ok uh ok so I want to talk a
little bit now more about some technical

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:01.629
little bit now more about some technical
 

00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:04.739
little bit now more about some technical
topics and and I was I was challenged by

00:24:04.739 --> 00:24:04.749
topics and and I was I was challenged by
 

00:24:04.749 --> 00:24:08.159
topics and and I was I was challenged by
our our director to give her one slide

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:08.169
our our director to give her one slide
 

00:24:08.169 --> 00:24:12.600
our our director to give her one slide
about what size was about in one slide

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:12.610
about what size was about in one slide
 

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.239
about what size was about in one slide
and you had to explain all of computer

00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:15.249
and you had to explain all of computer
 

00:24:15.249 --> 00:24:18.060
and you had to explain all of computer
science and where it was going over 15

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.070
science and where it was going over 15
 

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.519
science and where it was going over 15
years how would you do that ok so I want

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:20.529
years how would you do that ok so I want
 

00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:22.830
years how would you do that ok so I want
to I I love comments on this guy I've

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840
to I I love comments on this guy I've
 

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.739
to I I love comments on this guy I've
shown it to her already but it was a

00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:25.749
shown it to her already but it was a
 

00:24:25.749 --> 00:24:26.700
shown it to her already but it was a
little bit of a challenge to put

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:26.710
little bit of a challenge to put
 

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.139
little bit of a challenge to put
together it's got an animations of

00:24:28.139 --> 00:24:28.149
together it's got an animations of
 

00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:29.580
together it's got an animations of
course because you can't do it just one

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:29.590
course because you can't do it just one
 

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.549
course because you can't do it just one
slide right but it's visually one slide

00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559
slide right but it's visually one slide
 

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:38.070
slide right but it's visually one slide
okay so we were talking about this in an

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080
okay so we were talking about this in an
 

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.619
okay so we were talking about this in an
earlier meeting here about yeah we're

00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:40.629
earlier meeting here about yeah we're
 

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:43.619
earlier meeting here about yeah we're
very interdisciplinary right but to be

00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:43.629
very interdisciplinary right but to be
 

00:24:43.629 --> 00:24:46.710
very interdisciplinary right but to be
interdisciplinary you need strengths in

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720
interdisciplinary you need strengths in
 

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.019
interdisciplinary you need strengths in
your foundational areas right so we have

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:49.029
your foundational areas right so we have
 

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:52.109
your foundational areas right so we have
the core that of computing that we fund

00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:52.119
the core that of computing that we fund
 

00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:55.799
the core that of computing that we fund
through through through course

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:55.809
through through through course
 

00:24:55.809 --> 00:24:57.539
through through through course
solicitations and and these are just

00:24:57.539 --> 00:24:57.549
solicitations and and these are just
 

00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:59.190
solicitations and and these are just
some of them I hope I haven't left

00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200
some of them I hope I haven't left
 

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.039
some of them I hope I haven't left
people out when I showed this to some of

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:02.049
people out when I showed this to some of
 

00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:05.629
people out when I showed this to some of
the other folks at NSF and

00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:05.639
the other folks at NSF and
 

00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:07.279
the other folks at NSF and
and one person didn't see themself in

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:07.289
and one person didn't see themself in
 

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:09.709
and one person didn't see themself in
there I immediately had somebody in my

00:25:09.709 --> 00:25:09.719
there I immediately had somebody in my
 

00:25:09.719 --> 00:25:11.989
there I immediately had somebody in my
office like 30 seconds after I walked

00:25:11.989 --> 00:25:11.999
office like 30 seconds after I walked
 

00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:13.729
office like 30 seconds after I walked
out of the room and they're in there now

00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:13.739
out of the room and they're in there now
 

00:25:13.739 --> 00:25:18.469
out of the room and they're in there now
I won't tell you who it is so so so we

00:25:18.469 --> 00:25:18.479
I won't tell you who it is so so so we
 

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:20.839
I won't tell you who it is so so so we
have the core okay and and here's a

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:20.849
have the core okay and and here's a
 

00:25:20.849 --> 00:25:22.669
have the core okay and and here's a
thought experiment and and I know you

00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679
thought experiment and and I know you
 

00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:24.680
thought experiment and and I know you
folks do these kind of thing project

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:24.690
folks do these kind of thing project
 

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.579
folks do these kind of thing project
yourself to 2030 and look back and say

00:25:28.579 --> 00:25:28.589
yourself to 2030 and look back and say
 

00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:31.219
yourself to 2030 and look back and say
what are the changes what are the big

00:25:31.219 --> 00:25:31.229
what are the changes what are the big
 

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:33.440
what are the changes what are the big
sort of macroscopic changes in the

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.450
sort of macroscopic changes in the
 

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.859
sort of macroscopic changes in the
discipline that you see in 2030 looking

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:36.869
discipline that you see in 2030 looking
 

00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:38.839
discipline that you see in 2030 looking
back to 2015 right so it's another way

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:38.849
back to 2015 right so it's another way
 

00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:40.069
back to 2015 right so it's another way
of thinking about where's our discipline

00:25:40.069 --> 00:25:40.079
of thinking about where's our discipline
 

00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:43.599
of thinking about where's our discipline
going over over that timeframe and and

00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:43.609
going over over that timeframe and and
 

00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:45.739
going over over that timeframe and and
well let me just show you sort of how

00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:45.749
well let me just show you sort of how
 

00:25:45.749 --> 00:25:48.289
well let me just show you sort of how
I've been talking about this right so

00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:48.299
I've been talking about this right so
 

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:51.469
I've been talking about this right so
you know certainly we have sort of the

00:25:51.469 --> 00:25:51.479
you know certainly we have sort of the
 

00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:54.619
you know certainly we have sort of the
technical hardware building blocks and

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:54.629
technical hardware building blocks and
 

00:25:54.629 --> 00:25:57.440
technical hardware building blocks and
and so far you know it's primarily

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:57.450
and so far you know it's primarily
 

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.359
and so far you know it's primarily
electrical and based on CMOS technology

00:25:59.359 --> 00:25:59.369
electrical and based on CMOS technology
 

00:25:59.369 --> 00:26:01.699
electrical and based on CMOS technology
and I think that you know thinking

00:26:01.699 --> 00:26:01.709
and I think that you know thinking
 

00:26:01.709 --> 00:26:04.129
and I think that you know thinking
further ahead so you've all heard you

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:04.139
further ahead so you've all heard you
 

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:07.430
further ahead so you've all heard you
know you all know about sort of Moore's

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440
know you all know about sort of Moore's
 

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.979
know you all know about sort of Moore's
law and maybe it's running out of steam

00:26:09.979 --> 00:26:09.989
law and maybe it's running out of steam
 

00:26:09.989 --> 00:26:11.359
law and maybe it's running out of steam
and we have different technologies

00:26:11.359 --> 00:26:11.369
and we have different technologies
 

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:12.589
and we have different technologies
actually for pushing CMOS technology

00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:12.599
actually for pushing CMOS technology
 

00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:15.409
actually for pushing CMOS technology
forward more but we're not sort of

00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419
forward more but we're not sort of
 

00:26:15.419 --> 00:26:17.599
forward more but we're not sort of
getting the the gains that we used to

00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:17.609
getting the the gains that we used to
 

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.339
getting the the gains that we used to
get simply by miniaturization so

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:19.349
get simply by miniaturization so
 

00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:22.549
get simply by miniaturization so
thinking you know on beyond electrical

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559
thinking you know on beyond electrical
 

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:24.829
thinking you know on beyond electrical
if you will the physicalness of

00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:24.839
if you will the physicalness of
 

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:27.680
if you will the physicalness of
computing may very well change and so

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:27.690
computing may very well change and so
 

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.379
computing may very well change and so
certainly you know molecular computing

00:26:30.379 --> 00:26:30.389
certainly you know molecular computing
 

00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:32.589
certainly you know molecular computing
quantum computing here are some ideas of

00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:32.599
quantum computing here are some ideas of
 

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:35.299
quantum computing here are some ideas of
what computing might look like it you

00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:35.309
what computing might look like it you
 

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:38.329
what computing might look like it you
know sort of far out in the 2030 time

00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:38.339
know sort of far out in the 2030 time
 

00:26:38.339 --> 00:26:40.609
know sort of far out in the 2030 time
frame this one I think is much easier to

00:26:40.609 --> 00:26:40.619
frame this one I think is much easier to
 

00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:43.639
frame this one I think is much easier to
realize if you ask depending on how old

00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:43.649
realize if you ask depending on how old
 

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:45.409
realize if you ask depending on how old
you are or think about this how do you

00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419
you are or think about this how do you
 

00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:47.839
you are or think about this how do you
think your grandkids or your kids if

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:47.849
think your grandkids or your kids if
 

00:26:47.849 --> 00:26:50.839
think your grandkids or your kids if
you're young we'll think about computing

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:50.849
you're young we'll think about computing
 

00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:56.419
you're young we'll think about computing
in 2030 right in 15 years so for me I

00:26:56.419 --> 00:26:56.429
in 2030 right in 15 years so for me I
 

00:26:56.429 --> 00:26:59.089
in 2030 right in 15 years so for me I
think about my grandkids my yet unborn

00:26:59.089 --> 00:26:59.099
think about my grandkids my yet unborn
 

00:26:59.099 --> 00:27:01.699
think about my grandkids my yet unborn
grandkids you know we think about

00:27:01.699 --> 00:27:01.709
grandkids you know we think about
 

00:27:01.709 --> 00:27:03.440
grandkids you know we think about
platforms right think about servers and

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:03.450
platforms right think about servers and
 

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.440
platforms right think about servers and
pizza boxes and and racks and PCs and

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:06.450
pizza boxes and and racks and PCs and
 

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.209
pizza boxes and and racks and PCs and
and and maybe phones and things like

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:08.219
and and maybe phones and things like
 

00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:11.869
and and maybe phones and things like
that but that I know already that part

00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:11.879
that but that I know already that part
 

00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:14.659
that but that I know already that part
of the big vision here is that you know

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:14.669
of the big vision here is that you know
 

00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:18.529
of the big vision here is that you know
computing I firmly believe that my

00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539
computing I firmly believe that my
 

00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:19.650
computing I firmly believe that my
grandkids will know

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:19.660
grandkids will know
 

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.210
grandkids will know
think of computers as you know this

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:21.220
think of computers as you know this
 

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.590
think of computers as you know this
thing here that I type into but

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600
thing here that I type into but
 

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.620
thing here that I type into but
something that just infuses the entire

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:25.630
something that just infuses the entire
 

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.030
something that just infuses the entire
environment right in this vision has

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:27.040
environment right in this vision has
 

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.330
environment right in this vision has
been around you know from Mike Weiser

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:30.340
been around you know from Mike Weiser
 

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.850
been around you know from Mike Weiser
and and others for quite a long time I

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:32.860
and and others for quite a long time I
 

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.160
and and others for quite a long time I
think we're finally beginning to realize

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.170
think we're finally beginning to realize
 

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.440
think we're finally beginning to realize
that as we see computing embedded more

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:37.450
that as we see computing embedded more
 

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.540
that as we see computing embedded more
and more and so I think this is a pretty

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:39.550
and more and so I think this is a pretty
 

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.470
and more and so I think this is a pretty
sure thing

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480
sure thing
 

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.120
sure thing
smart vehicles and buildings I know

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:42.130
smart vehicles and buildings I know
 

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.540
smart vehicles and buildings I know
heard that a building that's going up I

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:44.550
heard that a building that's going up I
 

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.890
heard that a building that's going up I
forget what's being housed over there

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:46.900
forget what's being housed over there
 

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.110
forget what's being housed over there
but one of your buildings is going to be

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120
but one of your buildings is going to be
 

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.870
but one of your buildings is going to be
completely completely sensor eyes

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880
completely completely sensor eyes
 

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.530
completely completely sensor eyes
cyber-physical system smart cities so I

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:55.540
cyber-physical system smart cities so I
 

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.540
cyber-physical system smart cities so I
think this is changing if you will you

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:57.550
think this is changing if you will you
 

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.980
think this is changing if you will you
know the notion of what computing means

00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:58.990
know the notion of what computing means
 

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:04.530
know the notion of what computing means
computing beyond the box here this is

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:04.540
computing beyond the box here this is
 

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.650
computing beyond the box here this is
sort of the interaction between humans

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:07.660
sort of the interaction between humans
 

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.080
sort of the interaction between humans
and computers so this I actually I

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.090
and computers so this I actually I
 

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.000
and computers so this I actually I
showed at my departmental retreat so

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.010
showed at my departmental retreat so
 

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.950
showed at my departmental retreat so
last fall I was a faculty member at

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960
last fall I was a faculty member at
 

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.300
last fall I was a faculty member at
UMass and we're sitting around thinking

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:15.310
UMass and we're sitting around thinking
 

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.550
UMass and we're sitting around thinking
okay where should we we do this every

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:17.560
okay where should we we do this every
 

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.690
okay where should we we do this every
year where should we be making

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:18.700
year where should we be making
 

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.880
year where should we be making
investments what are really important

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:20.890
investments what are really important
 

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.450
investments what are really important
areas and when I got my five minutes to

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:24.460
areas and when I got my five minutes to
 

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.910
areas and when I got my five minutes to
pound on the table I was talking about

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:26.920
pound on the table I was talking about
 

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.640
pound on the table I was talking about
you know this was an area that I think

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:29.650
you know this was an area that I think
 

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.830
you know this was an area that I think
if we're gonna see the most profound

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840
if we're gonna see the most profound
 

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.850
if we're gonna see the most profound
changes between now and 2030 it's likely

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:35.860
changes between now and 2030 it's likely
 

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.480
changes between now and 2030 it's likely
to come in these these areas where

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:38.490
to come in these these areas where
 

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.390
to come in these these areas where
computing assistive technologies for

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:42.400
computing assistive technologies for
 

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.490
computing assistive technologies for
people effective computing societal

informatics man man-machine interface of
 

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.590
informatics man man-machine interface of
brain machine interfaces and so I called

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600
brain machine interfaces and so I called
 

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.230
brain machine interfaces and so I called
just called that on beyond HCI and then

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240
just called that on beyond HCI and then
 

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.160
just called that on beyond HCI and then
finally I'm not sure we have stove-piped

00:28:59.160 --> 00:28:59.170
finally I'm not sure we have stove-piped
 

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.050
finally I'm not sure we have stove-piped
applications but I wanted to sort of set

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:01.060
applications but I wanted to sort of set
 

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.770
applications but I wanted to sort of set
this up so I said we did you know this

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:04.780
this up so I said we did you know this
 

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.280
this up so I said we did you know this
this notion that integration exactly the

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.290
this notion that integration exactly the
 

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.250
this notion that integration exactly the
kind of things that I know are central

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:11.260
kind of things that I know are central
 

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.770
kind of things that I know are central
to what you folks are doing here that we

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:13.780
to what you folks are doing here that we
 

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.330
to what you folks are doing here that we
don't have stovepipe systems if you

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:15.340
don't have stovepipe systems if you
 

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.200
don't have stovepipe systems if you
think about smart and connected

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.210
think about smart and connected
 

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.020
think about smart and connected
communities the essence of that is to

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:19.030
communities the essence of that is to
 

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.600
communities the essence of that is to
get a network effect among all of these

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:21.610
get a network effect among all of these
 

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.880
get a network effect among all of these
different sectors that are united by

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:23.890
different sectors that are united by
 

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.450
different sectors that are united by
their use of

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:27.460
 

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.430
okay so that's my one slide that I

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440
okay so that's my one slide that I
 

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.890
okay so that's my one slide that I
showed to the director any yes I was

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:32.900
showed to the director any yes I was
 

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.919
showed to the director any yes I was
gonna ask if there are any comments so I

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:35.929
gonna ask if there are any comments so I
 

00:29:35.929 --> 00:29:38.529
gonna ask if there are any comments so I
I'm a self-proclaimed geek I like the

00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:38.539
I'm a self-proclaimed geek I like the
 

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:42.060
I'm a self-proclaimed geek I like the
toys and shiny objects I wonder where

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:42.070
toys and shiny objects I wonder where
 

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.440
toys and shiny objects I wonder where
there are so many sort of human problems

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:44.450
there are so many sort of human problems
 

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.700
there are so many sort of human problems
and all of this sort of starts with the

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:47.710
and all of this sort of starts with the
 

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.919
and all of this sort of starts with the
opportunities for technology and science

00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:50.929
opportunities for technology and science
 

00:29:50.929 --> 00:29:53.950
opportunities for technology and science
but it's not where does the sort of the

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960
but it's not where does the sort of the
 

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.130
but it's not where does the sort of the
challenges to sort of humanity sort of

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:57.140
challenges to sort of humanity sort of
 

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.020
challenges to sort of humanity sort of
come in here and effect it only it's

00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.030
come in here and effect it only it's
 

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.039
come in here and effect it only it's
sort of like okay now we've got to

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:00.049
sort of like okay now we've got to
 

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:01.899
sort of like okay now we've got to
figure out how to right question two or

00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:01.909
figure out how to right question two or
 

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:04.180
figure out how to right question two or
is there a way that it's brought in more

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.190
is there a way that it's brought in more
 

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.360
is there a way that it's brought in more
holistically so are you saying in the

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:07.370
holistically so are you saying in the
 

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.820
holistically so are you saying in the
sense if I think about how computing is

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:09.830
sense if I think about how computing is
 

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.970
sense if I think about how computing is
impacting house you know how our

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:12.980
impacting house you know how our
 

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.240
impacting house you know how our
societies form and functions or like

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.250
societies form and functions or like
 

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.159
societies form and functions or like
there's you know there are problems with

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:18.169
there's you know there are problems with
 

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:19.930
there's you know there are problems with
hunger there's problems with war there's

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:19.940
hunger there's problems with war there's
 

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.760
hunger there's problems with war there's
problems with that do we have anything

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:21.770
problems with that do we have anything
 

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.850
problems with that do we have anything
to say starting with that where do we

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:24.860
to say starting with that where do we
 

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.529
to say starting with that where do we
wait until we invent something cool and

00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:26.539
wait until we invent something cool and
 

00:30:26.539 --> 00:30:28.390
wait until we invent something cool and
then see where it can be applied yeah

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:28.400
then see where it can be applied yeah
 

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.270
then see where it can be applied yeah
well I I guess it's it's certainly the

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:31.280
well I I guess it's it's certainly the
 

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.100
well I I guess it's it's certainly the
case that if we think about you know

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.110
case that if we think about you know
 

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.260
case that if we think about you know
food energy and water systems for

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:35.270
food energy and water systems for
 

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.640
food energy and water systems for
example I'll talk about that in a little

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:36.650
example I'll talk about that in a little
 

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.680
example I'll talk about that in a little
while but there are many many

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:38.690
while but there are many many
 

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.600
while but there are many many
applications of computing here and I

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:40.610
applications of computing here and I
 

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.220
applications of computing here and I
guess I probably would have put that up

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:42.230
guess I probably would have put that up
 

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.130
guess I probably would have put that up
in societal application so I think

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:45.140
in societal application so I think
 

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.700
in societal application so I think
absolutely computing I mean first of all

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:48.710
absolutely computing I mean first of all
 

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.460
absolutely computing I mean first of all
just in terms of understanding

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:50.470
just in terms of understanding
 

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.899
just in terms of understanding
understanding climate understanding the

00:30:52.899 --> 00:30:52.909
understanding climate understanding the
 

00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:55.149
understanding climate understanding the
coupled systems that that form the

00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159
coupled systems that that form the
 

00:30:55.159 --> 00:30:58.779
coupled systems that that form the
climate and then you know if I'm gonna

00:30:58.779 --> 00:30:58.789
climate and then you know if I'm gonna
 

00:30:58.789 --> 00:31:01.720
climate and then you know if I'm gonna
talk in a little bit about the Nexus of

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:01.730
talk in a little bit about the Nexus of
 

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.370
talk in a little bit about the Nexus of
food energy and water systems which is

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:03.380
food energy and water systems which is
 

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.899
food energy and water systems which is
actually a priority and computing plays

00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:04.909
actually a priority and computing plays
 

00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:06.909
actually a priority and computing plays
a very important role there so I guess

00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919
a very important role there so I guess
 

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:08.529
a very important role there so I guess
if I had to shoe her I mean I did have

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:08.539
if I had to shoe her I mean I did have
 

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:10.390
if I had to shoe her I mean I did have
that idea sort of up there in the top

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:10.400
that idea sort of up there in the top
 

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.760
that idea sort of up there in the top
right hand corner but I think you're

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:12.770
right hand corner but I think you're
 

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.130
right hand corner but I think you're
right in the sense that maybe because

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:15.140
right in the sense that maybe because
 

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.880
right in the sense that maybe because
I'll agree with you that I'm a geek too

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:18.890
I'll agree with you that I'm a geek too
 

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:21.549
I'll agree with you that I'm a geek too
that I sort of start from the center and

00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559
that I sort of start from the center and
 

00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:25.450
that I sort of start from the center and
work out as opposed to thinking from you

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:25.460
work out as opposed to thinking from you
 

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.250
work out as opposed to thinking from you
know the bigger picture and top down

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:27.260
know the bigger picture and top down
 

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.740
know the bigger picture and top down
after the technology yes

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:30.750
after the technology yes
 

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:37.010
after the technology yes
a little bit and so a lot of things

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020
a little bit and so a lot of things
 

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.850
a little bit and so a lot of things
awkward

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860
awkward
 

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.180
awkward
a lot of these while engineering

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:40.190
a lot of these while engineering
 

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.890
a lot of these while engineering
advances a lot of you know what you have

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:42.900
advances a lot of you know what you have
 

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.320
advances a lot of you know what you have
hearing interaction Rob's only give

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:45.330
hearing interaction Rob's only give
 

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:51.730
hearing interaction Rob's only give
access to the data drives it yeah

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:51.740
 

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.430
companies large companies and they are

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440
companies large companies and they are
 

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.110
companies large companies and they are
usually very happy if you go there and

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120
usually very happy if you go there and
 

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.000
usually very happy if you go there and
work there for a year or two but then

00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.010
work there for a year or two but then
 

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.720
work there for a year or two but then
after you go back it's a lot harder to

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:01.730
after you go back it's a lot harder to
 

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.850
after you go back it's a lot harder to
work on this data to actually experiment

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860
work on this data to actually experiment
 

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.010
work on this data to actually experiment
because people get upset if they are

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020
because people get upset if they are
 

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.080
because people get upset if they are
experimented upon his Facebook found out

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:09.090
experimented upon his Facebook found out
 

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:12.560
experimented upon his Facebook found out
the hard way and so how do we solve this

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:12.570
the hard way and so how do we solve this
 

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.380
the hard way and so how do we solve this
okay so I'm glad you raised that

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:15.390
okay so I'm glad you raised that
 

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:17.540
okay so I'm glad you raised that
actually for two reasons so first of all

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:17.550
actually for two reasons so first of all
 

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.910
actually for two reasons so first of all
I want to talk about that later under my

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:19.920
I want to talk about that later under my
 

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.830
I want to talk about that later under my
challenges and opportunities part but

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840
challenges and opportunities part but
 

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.790
challenges and opportunities part but
but I want to say also

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:22.800
but I want to say also
 

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.130
but I want to say also
so you mentioned data I you know one

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140
so you mentioned data I you know one
 

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.800
so you mentioned data I you know one
could say software one could say

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:26.810
could say software one could say
 

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.150
could say software one could say
security for instance and so there are

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:29.160
security for instance and so there are
 

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.040
security for instance and so there are
elements of computing that sort of cut

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.050
elements of computing that sort of cut
 

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.050
elements of computing that sort of cut
across this I mean when you have only

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:33.060
across this I mean when you have only
 

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.490
across this I mean when you have only
one slide you sort of have to take a

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500
one slide you sort of have to take a
 

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.620
one slide you sort of have to take a
certain cut through it and there are

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:36.630
certain cut through it and there are
 

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.690
certain cut through it and there are
these kind of tech you know and maybe

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700
these kind of tech you know and maybe
 

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.840
these kind of tech you know and maybe
technologies areas like data and the

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:41.850
technologies areas like data and the
 

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.580
technologies areas like data and the
importance of data I mean in all four of

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:43.590
importance of data I mean in all four of
 

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.800
importance of data I mean in all four of
these right and also the importance of

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:45.810
these right and also the importance of
 

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.380
these right and also the importance of
software throughout all of this security

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:48.390
software throughout all of this security
 

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.000
software throughout all of this security
throughout all of this so there is sort

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.010
throughout all of this so there is sort
 

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.010
throughout all of this so there is sort
of another orthogonal you know there's

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020
of another orthogonal you know there's
 

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.240
of another orthogonal you know there's
another hyperplane going through this

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:53.250
another hyperplane going through this
 

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.130
another hyperplane going through this
that I could have talked about but but

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.140
that I could have talked about but but
 

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.660
that I could have talked about but but
didn't and I'll come back to that

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:56.670
didn't and I'll come back to that
 

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.740
didn't and I'll come back to that
question because I want to talk a little

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:57.750
question because I want to talk a little
 

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.910
question because I want to talk a little
bit towards the end about interactions

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:01.920
bit towards the end about interactions
 

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.240
bit towards the end about interactions
between universities and industries and

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.250
between universities and industries and
 

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.030
between universities and industries and
picture brains here okay so I'll come

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.040
picture brains here okay so I'll come
 

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.379
picture brains here okay so I'll come
back to that

00:33:09.379 --> 00:33:09.389
back to that
 

00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:13.169
back to that
okay all right so what I want to do is

00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:13.179
okay all right so what I want to do is
 

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:16.470
okay all right so what I want to do is
next is I just like to dive down into a

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480
next is I just like to dive down into a
 

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.080
next is I just like to dive down into a
couple of areas and give you just a few

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.090
couple of areas and give you just a few
 

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:21.749
couple of areas and give you just a few
examples I mean you don't want me to be

00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:21.759
examples I mean you don't want me to be
 

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:23.759
examples I mean you don't want me to be
up here and telling you about all of the

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:23.769
up here and telling you about all of the
 

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.710
up here and telling you about all of the
programs that we have I mean actually it

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720
programs that we have I mean actually it
 

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.019
programs that we have I mean actually it
doesn't even fit in a slide with small

00:33:28.019 --> 00:33:28.029
doesn't even fit in a slide with small
 

00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:30.659
doesn't even fit in a slide with small
fonts but so I'm just gonna I want to

00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:30.669
fonts but so I'm just gonna I want to
 

00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:33.210
fonts but so I'm just gonna I want to
sketch at a high level a couple of the

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:33.220
sketch at a high level a couple of the
 

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.200
sketch at a high level a couple of the
areas in which size is making

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.210
areas in which size is making
 

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.330
areas in which size is making
significant investments and so let me

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:39.340
significant investments and so let me
 

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.919
significant investments and so let me
start with smart systems because I know

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:40.929
start with smart systems because I know
 

00:33:40.929 --> 00:33:43.560
start with smart systems because I know
that this is a priority item here and

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:43.570
that this is a priority item here and
 

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.139
that this is a priority item here and
certainly something that builds on

00:33:46.139 --> 00:33:46.149
certainly something that builds on
 

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:48.240
certainly something that builds on
really ten years of work that's been

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:48.250
really ten years of work that's been
 

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.909
really ten years of work that's been
going on in cyber-physical systems at

00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:50.919
going on in cyber-physical systems at
 

00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:52.619
going on in cyber-physical systems at
the National Science Foundation and

00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:52.629
the National Science Foundation and
 

00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:55.289
the National Science Foundation and
within size and so these are the these

00:33:55.289 --> 00:33:55.299
within size and so these are the these
 

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:57.360
within size and so these are the these
are the areas that actually we've talked

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:57.370
are the areas that actually we've talked
 

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.820
are the areas that actually we've talked
about a number of these before so smart

00:33:59.820 --> 00:33:59.830
about a number of these before so smart
 

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.549
about a number of these before so smart
cities this notion here of a appear on

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559
cities this notion here of a appear on
 

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:04.680
cities this notion here of a appear on
the top left-hand side of sort of a

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:04.690
the top left-hand side of sort of a
 

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.560
the top left-hand side of sort of a
closed loop system where we're sensing

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:07.570
closed loop system where we're sensing
 

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.329
closed loop system where we're sensing
we're bringing in data we're computing

00:34:09.329 --> 00:34:09.339
we're bringing in data we're computing
 

00:34:09.339 --> 00:34:11.280
we're bringing in data we're computing
over that and then there's some kind of

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.290
over that and then there's some kind of
 

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.500
over that and then there's some kind of
action whether it's steering sensors or

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:13.510
action whether it's steering sensors or
 

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.780
action whether it's steering sensors or
whether it's positioning resources or

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:15.790
whether it's positioning resources or
 

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:20.069
whether it's positioning resources or
allocating resources sort of that sense

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079
allocating resources sort of that sense
 

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:24.000
allocating resources sort of that sense
compute actuate cycle smart and

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.010
compute actuate cycle smart and
 

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:25.800
compute actuate cycle smart and
connected health and we've talked about

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:25.810
connected health and we've talked about
 

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.169
connected health and we've talked about
both both of these two just a little bit

00:34:28.169 --> 00:34:28.179
both both of these two just a little bit
 

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:31.260
both both of these two just a little bit
before so the foundations behind

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:31.270
before so the foundations behind
 

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.659
before so the foundations behind
underneath that there's a long history

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:33.669
underneath that there's a long history
 

00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:36.000
underneath that there's a long history
of investment with in size in the areas

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.010
of investment with in size in the areas
 

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.190
of investment with in size in the areas
of cyber physical systems so we're about

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200
of cyber physical systems so we're about
 

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.059
of cyber physical systems so we're about
to celebrate the 10th anniversary this

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:42.069
to celebrate the 10th anniversary this
 

00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:45.629
to celebrate the 10th anniversary this
coming year of a program in cyber

00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639
coming year of a program in cyber
 

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.550
coming year of a program in cyber
physical systems and you know I think

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560
physical systems and you know I think
 

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.909
physical systems and you know I think
the key words here pervasive computing

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919
the key words here pervasive computing
 

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:52.260
the key words here pervasive computing
sensing in control of course but this

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:52.270
sensing in control of course but this
 

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.230
sensing in control of course but this
notion of high assurance right and and

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240
notion of high assurance right and and
 

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.059
notion of high assurance right and and
so I think when we have these embedded

00:34:57.059 --> 00:34:57.069
so I think when we have these embedded
 

00:34:57.069 --> 00:35:01.620
so I think when we have these embedded
systems safety and security by design

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:01.630
systems safety and security by design
 

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.790
systems safety and security by design
has been sort of a theme here of cyber

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800
has been sort of a theme here of cyber
 

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.559
has been sort of a theme here of cyber
physical systems and so that's where a

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:07.569
physical systems and so that's where a
 

00:35:07.569 --> 00:35:09.089
physical systems and so that's where a
lot of formal methods are coming into

00:35:09.089 --> 00:35:09.099
lot of formal methods are coming into
 

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:12.300
lot of formal methods are coming into
play in terms of design the National

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:12.310
play in terms of design the National
 

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.950
play in terms of design the National
robotics initiative so folks here I know

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960
robotics initiative so folks here I know
 

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.420
robotics initiative so folks here I know
know a lot about that this is about to

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:18.430
know a lot about that this is about to
 

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.550
know a lot about that this is about to
celebrate its fifth anniversary in the

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560
celebrate its fifth anniversary in the
 

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:20.980
celebrate its fifth anniversary in the

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.480
nose
of NRI 2.0 and maybe a continued

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:25.490
of NRI 2.0 and maybe a continued
 

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.300
of NRI 2.0 and maybe a continued
evolution so NRI was primarily you see

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:28.310
evolution so NRI was primarily you see
 

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.430
evolution so NRI was primarily you see
Co robots here that worked beside and

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440
Co robots here that worked beside and
 

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.380
Co robots here that worked beside and
work cooperatively with people I think

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:32.390
work cooperatively with people I think
 

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:37.150
work cooperatively with people I think
probably a focus on autonomy will be you

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160
probably a focus on autonomy will be you
 

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.730
probably a focus on autonomy will be you
know be integrated into this picture and

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:39.740
know be integrated into this picture and
 

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.920
know be integrated into this picture and
this is a great example where there are

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:41.930
this is a great example where there are
 

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:45.820
this is a great example where there are
a lot of cross agency efforts

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:45.830
a lot of cross agency efforts
 

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.670
a lot of cross agency efforts
so certainly NSF is very involved in

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680
so certainly NSF is very involved in
 

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.010
so certainly NSF is very involved in
this not just size but engineering and

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:51.020
this not just size but engineering and
 

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.050
this not just size but engineering and
other directorates working with NASA

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:53.060
other directorates working with NASA
 

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.150
other directorates working with NASA
with USDA and also with NIH and I think

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160
with USDA and also with NIH and I think
 

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.810
with USDA and also with NIH and I think
you know again thinking about relative

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:01.820
you know again thinking about relative
 

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.430
you know again thinking about relative
well thinking about two things right

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440
well thinking about two things right
 

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.710
well thinking about two things right
thinking about budget growth which is

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720
thinking about budget growth which is
 

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.260
thinking about budget growth which is
you know upwards but modest but also

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:08.270
you know upwards but modest but also
 

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.540
you know upwards but modest but also
thinking about how interdisciplinary we

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:10.550
thinking about how interdisciplinary we
 

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.720
thinking about how interdisciplinary we
are it's really these kinds of

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:12.730
are it's really these kinds of
 

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.160
are it's really these kinds of
collaborations that are going to be very

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:15.170
collaborations that are going to be very
 

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:22.690
collaborations that are going to be very
important in the future and thank you

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:22.700
important in the future and thank you
 

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.510
important in the future and thank you
for without being critical

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520
for without being critical
 

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.760
for without being critical
I would allege that within something

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:27.770
I would allege that within something
 

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.609
I would allege that within something
like any ROI NSF clearly gets it I think

00:36:30.609 --> 00:36:30.619
like any ROI NSF clearly gets it I think
 

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:31.570
like any ROI NSF clearly gets it I think
NASA does too

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:31.580
NASA does too
 

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.490
NASA does too
I'm not sure about the next two on the

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:33.500
I'm not sure about the next two on the
 

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:44.040
I'm not sure about the next two on the
list USDA and NIH I guess I could say

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.050
 

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.720
you know in talking I will tell you that

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:46.730
you know in talking I will tell you that
 

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.450
you know in talking I will tell you that
in talking with the program managers

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:49.460
in talking with the program managers
 

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.359
in talking with the program managers
here the USDA is relatively new and

00:36:52.359 --> 00:36:52.369
here the USDA is relatively new and
 

00:36:52.369 --> 00:36:54.340
here the USDA is relatively new and
something that people are excited about

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:54.350
something that people are excited about
 

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.990
something that people are excited about
I don't to say I don't know if they if

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000
I don't to say I don't know if they if
 

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.500
I don't to say I don't know if they if
they sort of get that or not in the NIH

00:36:59.500 --> 00:36:59.510
they sort of get that or not in the NIH
 

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:02.859
they sort of get that or not in the NIH
and robotic surgery and again I don't so

00:37:02.859 --> 00:37:02.869
and robotic surgery and again I don't so
 

00:37:02.869 --> 00:37:04.390
and robotic surgery and again I don't so
maybe I could ask you and what's what

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400
maybe I could ask you and what's what
 

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:17.430
maybe I could ask you and what's what
what's the in what sense don't they get

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440
 

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.160
and the the notion of robotics to do

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:20.170
and the the notion of robotics to do
 

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.190
and the the notion of robotics to do
something as delivered at surgery is

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200
something as delivered at surgery is
 

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.330
something as delivered at surgery is
pretty disconnected from that

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:24.340
pretty disconnected from that
 

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.060
pretty disconnected from that
fundamental notion right because they're

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.070
fundamental notion right because they're
 

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.100
fundamental notion right because they're
primarily more disease oriented and

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.110
primarily more disease oriented and
 

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.770
primarily more disease oriented and
mechanism oriented so you know I think I

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:31.780
mechanism oriented so you know I think I
 

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.250
mechanism oriented so you know I think I
I guess I understand that comment and I

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:35.260
I guess I understand that comment and I
 

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.380
I guess I understand that comment and I
guess one thing that I've heard is that

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:37.390
guess one thing that I've heard is that
 

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.810
guess one thing that I've heard is that
NIH is sort of continuing to evolve and

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:39.820
NIH is sort of continuing to evolve and
 

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.460
NIH is sort of continuing to evolve and
maybe maybe that's just an area where

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:43.470
maybe maybe that's just an area where
 

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.960
maybe maybe that's just an area where
you know there used to be my

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:45.970
you know there used to be my
 

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.460
you know there used to be my
understanding correct me if I'm wrong

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:47.470
understanding correct me if I'm wrong
 

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.280
understanding correct me if I'm wrong
Farnham that there used to be almost you

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:50.290
Farnham that there used to be almost you
 

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.020
Farnham that there used to be almost you
know relatively little and now there's a

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:52.030
know relatively little and now there's a
 

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.940
know relatively little and now there's a
lot more collaboration between NSF and

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:53.950
lot more collaboration between NSF and
 

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.750
lot more collaboration between NSF and
NIH and so maybe it's just because again

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760
NIH and so maybe it's just because again
 

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.770
NIH and so maybe it's just because again
computing related activities are

00:37:58.770 --> 00:37:58.780
computing related activities are
 

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.750
computing related activities are
becoming more Howard about that too

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760
becoming more Howard about that too
 

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.720
becoming more Howard about that too
that's just more areas of overlap now

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:05.730
that's just more areas of overlap now
 

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.130
that's just more areas of overlap now
what say anything I shouldn't put

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:08.140
what say anything I shouldn't put
 

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:18.750
what say anything I shouldn't put
anybody on the spot because we use so

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760
anybody on the spot because we use so
 

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:24.690
anybody on the spot because we use so
much force in forest fires and and they

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:24.700
much force in forest fires and and they
 

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.010
much force in forest fires and and they
want to connect this to its building

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.020
want to connect this to its building
 

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.130
want to connect this to its building
industry so that we can use the wood not

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:29.140
industry so that we can use the wood not
 

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.020
industry so that we can use the wood not
to burn it but to use it for

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.030
to burn it but to use it for
 

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.630
to burn it but to use it for
construction okay and that's a very big

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640
construction okay and that's a very big
 

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.670
construction okay and that's a very big
challenge because it doesn't deal with

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680
challenge because it doesn't deal with
 

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.670
challenge because it doesn't deal with
the industry as it exists you know some

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680
the industry as it exists you know some
 

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.620
the industry as it exists you know some
degrees so in a sense could be helpful

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:40.630
degrees so in a sense could be helpful
 

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:45.510
degrees so in a sense could be helpful
in that application you know III think

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520
in that application you know III think
 

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.180
in that application you know III think
there's a very I mean you get to a very

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:48.190
there's a very I mean you get to a very
 

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.830
there's a very I mean you get to a very
important question right so we are

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:49.840
important question right so we are
 

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.230
important question right so we are
funding basic basic science research

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240
funding basic basic science research
 

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.750
funding basic basic science research
right and now the question is how will

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760
right and now the question is how will
 

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.090
right and now the question is how will
those science tools be used to inform

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.100
those science tools be used to inform
 

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.980
those science tools be used to inform
policy right and I think that the the

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:01.990
policy right and I think that the the
 

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.240
policy right and I think that the the
tools that we're building let me give

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:03.250
tools that we're building let me give
 

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.950
tools that we're building let me give
you a great example of this this has to

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960
you a great example of this this has to
 

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.200
you a great example of this this has to
do with deforestation on a global scale

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:07.210
do with deforestation on a global scale
 

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.820
do with deforestation on a global scale
right there's an amazing project going

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:08.830
right there's an amazing project going
 

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.740
right there's an amazing project going
on an expeditious project at the

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:10.750
on an expeditious project at the
 

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.590

University of Minnesota using machine
 

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.270
University of Minnesota using machine
learning techniques so that you can then

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280
learning techniques so that you can then
 

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.940
learning techniques so that you can then
now look at aerial imagery and figure

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:17.950
now look at aerial imagery and figure
 

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.620
now look at aerial imagery and figure
out what are burn areas for example

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:19.630
out what are burn areas for example
 

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.210
out what are burn areas for example
around the globe right so that you can

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:21.220
around the globe right so that you can
 

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.280
around the globe right so that you can
actually look at series of satellite

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:23.290
actually look at series of satellite
 

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.350
actually look at series of satellite
photographs and and predict because you

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:25.360
photographs and and predict because you
 

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.540
photographs and and predict because you
can never measure you know boots on the

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:27.550
can never measure you know boots on the
 

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.960
can never measure you know boots on the
ground

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:28.970
ground
 

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.230
ground
measurements that's a case where

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240
measurements that's a case where
 

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.940
measurements that's a case where
computing techniques are incredibly

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:33.950
computing techniques are incredibly
 

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.250
computing techniques are incredibly
important for even getting data in the

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:36.260
important for even getting data in the
 

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.810
important for even getting data in the
first place right that data can then

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:37.820
first place right that data can then
 

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.880
first place right that data can then
inform policy

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:39.890
inform policy
 

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:44.710
inform policy
I guess I'd argue that that's sort of

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720
I guess I'd argue that that's sort of
 

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.560
I guess I'd argue that that's sort of
where that's sort of where our work is

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:47.570
where that's sort of where our work is
 

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:50.680
where that's sort of where our work is
handed off into the public policy sphere

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:50.690
handed off into the public policy sphere
 

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:51.910
handed off into the public policy sphere
I don't know if you're arguing that as

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920
I don't know if you're arguing that as
 

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.859
I don't know if you're arguing that as
computer scientists or as citizens we

00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:53.869
computer scientists or as citizens we
 

00:39:53.869 --> 00:40:00.480
computer scientists or as citizens we
should be involved in that okay you're

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:00.490
should be involved in that okay you're
 

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.690
should be involved in that okay you're
okay so let me just say that I think

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:04.700
okay so let me just say that I think
 

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.380
okay so let me just say that I think
that computing has that important Kate

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:08.390
that computing has that important Kate
 

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:12.040
that computing has that important Kate
actually mandate right to help provide

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:12.050
actually mandate right to help provide
 

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.530
actually mandate right to help provide
the techniques to make us more informed

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:14.540
the techniques to make us more informed
 

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.750
the techniques to make us more informed
in our policy decisions but the policy

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760
in our policy decisions but the policy
 

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.460
in our policy decisions but the policy
decisions are made outside the realm of

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:18.470
decisions are made outside the realm of
 

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.830
decisions are made outside the realm of
our own technical area right I mean it's

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:20.840
our own technical area right I mean it's
 

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.240
our own technical area right I mean it's
sort of a bigger problem that we engage

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:22.250
sort of a bigger problem that we engage
 

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:26.050
sort of a bigger problem that we engage
in as citizens okay last question and

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.060
in as citizens okay last question and
 

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:35.470
in as citizens okay last question and
then I'll move on yeah thank you NSF but

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480
then I'll move on yeah thank you NSF but
 

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.980
then I'll move on yeah thank you NSF but
I want to take your phrase about taking

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:38.990
I want to take your phrase about taking
 

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:42.070
I want to take your phrase about taking
the results in science into policymaking

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:42.080
the results in science into policymaking
 

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.620
the results in science into policymaking
and look at the third bullet under cyber

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:44.630
and look at the third bullet under cyber
 

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.000
and look at the third bullet under cyber
physical systems and take as a cyber

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.010
physical systems and take as a cyber
 

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:51.130
physical systems and take as a cyber
physical system sort of everything

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:51.140
physical system sort of everything
 

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.530
physical system sort of everything
that's going on that involves computers

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:53.540
that's going on that involves computers
 

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.220
that's going on that involves computers
in computing and I spend a reasonable

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:57.230
in computing and I spend a reasonable
 

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.930
in computing and I spend a reasonable
fraction of my time terrified by that

00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:58.940
fraction of my time terrified by that
 

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.290
fraction of my time terrified by that
third bullet right reliability safety

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:02.300
third bullet right reliability safety
 

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.720
third bullet right reliability safety
security usability and privacy and it's

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:04.730
security usability and privacy and it's
 

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:07.480
security usability and privacy and it's
it's trivial to cite from any newspaper

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:07.490
it's trivial to cite from any newspaper
 

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.550
it's trivial to cite from any newspaper

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560
these days violations of all of those
 

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.339
these days violations of all of those
essentially and I don't know whether

00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:12.349
essentially and I don't know whether
 

00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:15.820
essentially and I don't know whether
there's any way to improve from the

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:15.830
there's any way to improve from the
 

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:20.589
there's any way to improve from the
Foundation's perspective somehow

00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599
Foundation's perspective somehow
 

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:23.349

picked up very readily right because you
can make money on them and then these

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:35.990
can make money on them and then these
 

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.870
can make money on them and then these
control things which are very important

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880

disconnect I think maybe if I could

00:41:46.299 --> 00:41:46.309
disconnect I think maybe if I could
 

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:48.440
disconnect I think maybe if I could
possibly mischaracterize what you're

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:48.450
possibly mischaracterize what you're
 

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.359
possibly mischaracterize what you're
saying is that you know we see that

00:41:50.359 --> 00:41:50.369
saying is that you know we see that
 

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:52.069
saying is that you know we see that
there are these that there are these

there are these that there are these
problems we have solutions we throw them

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000
problems we have solutions we throw them
 

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.039
problems we have solutions we throw them
over the fence and then they're just

00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:55.049
over the fence and then they're just
 

00:41:55.049 --> 00:41:58.299
over the fence and then they're just
sort of used and and that we we don't

00:41:58.299 --> 00:41:58.309
sort of used and and that we we don't
 

00:41:58.309 --> 00:42:01.970
sort of used and and that we we don't
infuse the policy discussion right and

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980
infuse the policy discussion right and
 

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.519
infuse the policy discussion right and
and I don't know if Doug is here I mean

00:42:04.519 --> 00:42:04.529
and I don't know if Doug is here I mean

and I don't know if Doug is here I mean
you you have on your your one of your

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:06.990
you you have on your your one of your

person you know - so he's not here - I
 

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:15.319
person you know - so he's not here - I
mean he's addressing exactly those kinds

00:42:15.319 --> 00:42:15.329
mean he's addressing exactly those kinds
 

00:42:15.329 --> 00:42:17.870
mean he's addressing exactly those kinds
of questions right so that when so he

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880
of questions right so that when so he
 

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.380
of questions right so that when so he
was the he was the CTE he was the CTO of

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:21.390
was the he was the CTE he was the CTO of
 

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.450
was the he was the CTE he was the CTO of
the FCC man fact I think it was the

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460
the FCC man fact I think it was the
 

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.819
the FCC man fact I think it was the
first CTO of the FCC one of my former

00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:25.829
first CTO of the FCC one of my former
 

00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:29.299
first CTO of the FCC one of my former
students was also the CTO of the FCC and

00:42:29.299 --> 00:42:29.309
students was also the CTO of the FCC and
 

00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:31.510
students was also the CTO of the FCC and
when we were able to bring those people

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520
when we were able to bring those people
 

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.400
when we were able to bring those people
into the policy discussion the policy

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:34.410
into the policy discussion the policy
 

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.470
into the policy discussion the policy
discussion is much richer and much more

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480
discussion is much richer and much more
 

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.230
discussion is much richer and much more
well-informed but their their job is to

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240
well-informed but their their job is to
 

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.940
well-informed but their their job is to
be engaged in that policy discussion

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:40.950
be engaged in that policy discussion
 

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:42.620
be engaged in that policy discussion
they bring them I think they bring the

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:42.630
they bring them I think they bring the
 

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.000
they bring them I think they bring the
knowledge and the results of what we're

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.010
knowledge and the results of what we're
 

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:47.990
knowledge and the results of what we're
doing so it can inform it so but I guess

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000
doing so it can inform it so but I guess
 

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.269
doing so it can inform it so but I guess
I I sort of think of that as it's the

00:42:50.269 --> 00:42:50.279
I I sort of think of that as it's the
 

00:42:50.279 --> 00:42:52.370
I I sort of think of that as it's the
it's computer scientists involved in the

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380
it's computer scientists involved in the
 

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.240
it's computer scientists involved in the
policy level type discussion okay okay

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.250
policy level type discussion okay okay
 

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.740
policy level type discussion okay okay
actually it's it's great to be

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:57.750
actually it's it's great to be
 

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.480
actually it's it's great to be
discussing this because I know that the

00:42:59.480 --> 00:42:59.490
discussing this because I know that the
 

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.549
discussing this because I know that the
whole purpose of this forum is not for

00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559
whole purpose of this forum is not for
 

00:43:01.559 --> 00:43:03.589
whole purpose of this forum is not for
me to tell you about what's going on and

00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599
me to tell you about what's going on and
 

00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:05.210
me to tell you about what's going on and
then it's f-for what NSF is funny but

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.220
then it's f-for what NSF is funny but
 

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.460
then it's f-for what NSF is funny but
we're really talking about technology

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:07.470
we're really talking about technology
 

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.450
we're really talking about technology
and in science and policy also so I

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460
and in science and policy also so I
 

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:17.779
and in science and policy also so I
appreciate those questions okay okay so

00:43:17.779 --> 00:43:17.789
appreciate those questions okay okay so
 

00:43:17.789 --> 00:43:19.490
appreciate those questions okay okay so
I wanted to say just a little bit about

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.500
I wanted to say just a little bit about
 

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.920
I wanted to say just a little bit about
sort of experimental systems research

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:21.930
sort of experimental systems research
 

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:24.109
sort of experimental systems research
going on here there was a project that

00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119
going on here there was a project that
 

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:26.480

questions and I want to provoke even a
 

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.720
questions and I want to provoke even a
few more so I'm not going to talk I

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:13.730
few more so I'm not going to talk I
 

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:15.910

going on in data science from data to
 

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.900
going on in data science from data to
knowledge to to action I'll simply say

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:22.910
knowledge to to action I'll simply say
 

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.120
knowledge to to action I'll simply say
that this is an activity that's going on

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:25.130
that this is an activity that's going on
 

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.339

across the foundation these are some of

00:49:27.339 --> 00:49:27.349
across the foundation these are some of
 

00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:29.200
across the foundation these are some of
the larger scale projects that have a

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:29.210
the larger scale projects that have a
 

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.599
the larger scale projects that have a
lot to do with data there's at least one

00:49:31.599 --> 00:49:31.609
lot to do with data there's at least one
 

00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:33.460
lot to do with data there's at least one
from every Directorate yeah

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:33.470
from every Directorate yeah
 

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:36.040
from every Directorate yeah
across the foundation so it's it's very

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:36.050
across the foundation so it's it's very
 

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.589
across the foundation so it's it's very
very important and I was going to talk a

00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599
very important and I was going to talk a
 

00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:40.540
very important and I was going to talk a
little bit hour about our size specific

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:40.550
little bit hour about our size specific
 

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:41.920
little bit hour about our size specific
programs but I think I'll skip through

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:41.930
programs but I think I'll skip through
 

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:47.440
programs but I think I'll skip through
that and I'm gonna also skip quickly

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:47.450
that and I'm gonna also skip quickly
 

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:50.170
that and I'm gonna also skip quickly
just to say again because I know how

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:50.180
just to say again because I know how
 

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.210
just to say again because I know how
important this is here and I made the

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:52.220
important this is here and I made the
 

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.800
important this is here and I made the
pitch that this is sort of the area

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:53.810
pitch that this is sort of the area
 

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:55.960
pitch that this is sort of the area
where we may see the biggest advances

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:55.970
where we may see the biggest advances
 

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.790
where we may see the biggest advances
but certainly augmenting human

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:57.800
but certainly augmenting human
 

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:01.210
but certainly augmenting human
capabilities here and I won't go through

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:01.220
capabilities here and I won't go through
 

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.820
capabilities here and I won't go through
these and I want to sort of finish up

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:03.830
these and I want to sort of finish up
 

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:05.290
these and I want to sort of finish up
with education and then come back to

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:05.300
with education and then come back to
 

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.490
with education and then come back to

I mean many of you may have been through
a program like that the goal here was to

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:50.330
a program like that the goal here was to
 

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:54.130
a program like that the goal here was to
really try and broaden broaden the

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:54.140
really try and broaden broaden the
 

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.440
really try and broaden broaden the
entryways if you will into computer

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:56.450
entryways if you will into computer
 

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.560
entryways if you will into computer
science as a major and and also address

00:50:59.560 --> 00:50:59.570
science as a major and and also address
 

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.330
science as a major and and also address
the pipeline issue right so how do we

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:01.340
the pipeline issue right so how do we
 

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.050
the pipeline issue right so how do we
get kids interested in computer science

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:04.060
get kids interested in computer science
 

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.670

when I was in Massachusetts I was

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.680
when I was in Massachusetts I was
 

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.810
when I was in Massachusetts I was
involved in some of our statewide

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:07.820
involved in some of our statewide
 

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.420

there are a hundred and eighteen

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200
there are a hundred and eighteen
 

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.500
there are a hundred and eighteen
districts in Massachusetts so if you

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:14.510
districts in Massachusetts so if you
 

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.300
districts in Massachusetts so if you
want to change something there's a

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:16.310
want to change something there's a
 

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:17.650
want to change something there's a
hundred and eighteen places you have to

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:17.660
hundred and eighteen places you have to
 

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.350
hundred and eighteen places you have to
go so that's clearly not scalable at a

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:20.360
go so that's clearly not scalable at a
 

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.470
go so that's clearly not scalable at a
national level if you really want to

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480
national level if you really want to
 

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.540
national level if you really want to
create change and so Jan CuNi who's the

going on at a national scale we need to

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680
going on at a national scale we need to
 

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.910
going on at a national scale we need to
embed changes sort of systemically and

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920
embed changes sort of systemically and
 

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.530

sort of sit back and just read on your
 

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:40.630
sort of sit back and just read on your
couch it's not hard to read but it's

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640
couch it's not hard to read but it's
 

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.280
couch it's not hard to read but it's
sobering so you better be in a good mood

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:42.290
sobering so you better be in a good mood
 

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:45.070
sobering so you better be in a good mood
when you started I think because it's

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:45.080
when you started I think because it's
 

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.690
when you started I think because it's
really a call to action it's talking

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:46.700
really a call to action it's talking
 

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.190
really a call to action it's talking
about the level investment that we make

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200
about the level investment that we make
 

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.910

government and companies and you see

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:05.450
government and companies and you see
 

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:08.020
government and companies and you see
that we're sort of flat there at 2.5% we

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:08.030
that we're sort of flat there at 2.5% we
 

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:11.500
that we're sort of flat there at 2.5% we
see other countries Korea one which is

one program here so the goal here is to

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:48.890
one program here so the goal here is to
 

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:53.980
one program here so the goal here is to
rethink what's what can NSF do in terms

can check a box so it's opt in and you
 

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:54.670
can check a box so it's opt in and you
can say I want Intel or it's fine for

we go through the very rigorous and
 

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:08.020
we go through the very rigorous and
you process that I think NSF is known

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:08.030
you process that I think NSF is known
 

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:10.960

really nice idea we're still learning
how well it works and and what some of

00:57:40.809 --> 00:57:40.819
how well it works and and what some of
 

00:57:40.819 --> 00:57:43.299
how well it works and and what some of
the gotchas might be but it sort of

00:57:43.299 --> 00:57:43.309
the gotchas might be but it sort of
 

00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:45.549
the gotchas might be but it sort of
highlights NSF's role as a convener

about education and now not education at
K through 12 but education here at the

00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079
K through 12 but education here at the
 

00:58:18.079 --> 00:58:20.200
K through 12 but education here at the
University so this was a talk that Ed

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:20.210
University so this was a talk that Ed
 

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:25.450
University so this was a talk that Ed
Lisowski and I gave at the last summer

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:25.460
Lisowski and I gave at the last summer
 

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.339
Lisowski and I gave at the last summer
at the Snowbird workshop which is where

00:58:27.339 --> 00:58:27.349
at the Snowbird workshop which is where
 

00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:29.740
at the Snowbird workshop which is where
all the computer science chairs and

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:29.750
all the computer science chairs and
 

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:33.400
all the computer science chairs and
Dean's get together so it was well I'm

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:33.410
Dean's get together so it was well I'm
 

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:35.500
Dean's get together so it was well I'm
sure you're seeing this here right so

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:35.510
sure you're seeing this here right so
 

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:37.690
sure you're seeing this here right so
this is our undergraduate programs and

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:37.700
this is our undergraduate programs and
 

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.640
this is our undergraduate programs and
oh there's this tidal wave of students

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:39.650
oh there's this tidal wave of students
 

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:44.049
oh there's this tidal wave of students
coming towards us right oh here are my

00:58:44.049 --> 00:58:44.059
coming towards us right oh here are my
 

00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:46.539
coming towards us right oh here are my
figures right so I I we just actually

00:58:46.539 --> 00:58:46.549
figures right so I I we just actually
 

00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:48.370
figures right so I I we just actually
became a school of information in

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:48.380
became a school of information in
 

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:52.390
became a school of information in
computer science at UMass right just at

00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400
computer science at UMass right just at
 

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.730
computer science at UMass right just at
the beginning of this academic year and

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:54.740
the beginning of this academic year and
 

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.010
the beginning of this academic year and
when we were trying up sort of push how

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:57.020
when we were trying up sort of push how
 

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.740
when we were trying up sort of push how
important computing was I mean you've

00:58:59.740 --> 00:58:59.750
important computing was I mean you've
 

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:01.240
important computing was I mean you've
already done this right but we were

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:01.250
already done this right but we were
 

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:02.650
already done this right but we were
going through this right trying to

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:02.660
going through this right trying to
 

00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.599
going through this right trying to
convince our provost and Chancellor how

00:59:04.599 --> 00:59:04.609
convince our provost and Chancellor how
 

00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:07.089
convince our provost and Chancellor how
important computing was for the whole

00:59:07.089 --> 00:59:07.099
important computing was for the whole
 

00:59:07.099 --> 00:59:09.880
important computing was for the whole
campus right and and and you know how

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:09.890
campus right and and and you know how
 

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:11.920
campus right and and and you know how
many and the number of students who are

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:11.930
many and the number of students who are
 

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:13.870
many and the number of students who are
wanting to take our courses are taking

00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880
wanting to take our courses are taking
 

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.910
wanting to take our courses are taking
our courses so these are our majors as a

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920
our courses so these are our majors as a
 

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.440
our courses so these are our majors as a
function of time

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:17.450
function of time
 

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.690
function of time
and I was actually pretty good friends

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:19.700
and I was actually pretty good friends
 

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.460
and I was actually pretty good friends
with our Chancellor since I was I wasn't

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:21.470
with our Chancellor since I was I wasn't
 

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:23.770
with our Chancellor since I was I wasn't
in academic academic administration so I

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:23.780
in academic academic administration so I
 

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.359
in academic academic administration so I
wasn't ever asking him for anything

00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:25.369
wasn't ever asking him for anything
 

00:59:25.369 --> 00:59:27.370
wasn't ever asking him for anything
anymore I used to do that

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:27.380
anymore I used to do that
 

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.410
anymore I used to do that
and so we would just go have lunch and

00:59:29.410 --> 00:59:29.420
and so we would just go have lunch and
 

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.180
and so we would just go have lunch and
so I was trying but of course I'm trying

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:31.190
so I was trying but of course I'm trying
 

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:33.190
so I was trying but of course I'm trying
to sell him stuff right and so I'm

00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200
to sell him stuff right and so I'm
 

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.870
to sell him stuff right and so I'm
trying to sell him on this notion of how

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880
trying to sell him on this notion of how
 

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.460
trying to sell him on this notion of how
important computing is and I used this

00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:36.470
important computing is and I used this
 

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:39.819
important computing is and I used this
graph and he said oh you know I know

00:59:39.819 --> 00:59:39.829
graph and he said oh you know I know
 

00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:42.069
graph and he said oh you know I know
I actually didn't show him this graph I

00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079
I actually didn't show him this graph I
 

00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:44.710
I actually didn't show him this graph I
said well you know we used to be 500 now

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720
said well you know we used to be 500 now
 

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.450
said well you know we used to be 500 now
we're almost almost a thousand we've

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:46.460
we're almost almost a thousand we've
 

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.310
we're almost almost a thousand we've
almost doubled so I didn't show him the

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:48.320
almost doubled so I didn't show him the
 

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.130
almost doubled so I didn't show him the
graph because you know it's more

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:51.140
graph because you know it's more
 

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:52.960
graph because you know it's more
complicated than that right he says oh I

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:52.970
complicated than that right he says oh I
 

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:54.970
complicated than that right he says oh I
know the graph you're talking about and

00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:54.980
know the graph you're talking about and
 

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.950
know the graph you're talking about and
I know what the periodicity is and it's

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960
I know what the periodicity is and it's
 

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.200
I know what the periodicity is and it's
about to turn over right and so we went

00:59:59.200 --> 00:59:59.210
about to turn over right and so we went
 

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:01.150
about to turn over right and so we went
through we went through all these

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160
through we went through all these
 

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.650
through we went through all these
arguments about why it's now why all the

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:05.660
arguments about why it's now why all the
 

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.700
arguments about why it's now why all the
things we've been talking about how

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:06.710
things we've been talking about how
 

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:09.069
things we've been talking about how
computing is is important for so many

01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079
computing is is important for so many
 

01:00:09.079 --> 01:00:11.500
computing is is important for so many
different disciplines he got that right

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:11.510
different disciplines he got that right
 

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:14.050
different disciplines he got that right
of course because you know he's created

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:14.060
of course because you know he's created
 

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.089
of course because you know he's created
in college you know at the time he said

01:00:16.089 --> 01:00:16.099
in college you know at the time he said
 

01:00:16.099 --> 01:00:18.220
in college you know at the time he said
so I actually pulled this graph out

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:18.230
so I actually pulled this graph out
 

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:19.990
so I actually pulled this graph out
because I had it right and he said oh

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000
because I had it right and he said oh
 

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.760
because I had it right and he said oh
you know I know you know you want me to

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:21.770
you know I know you know you want me to
 

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.980
you know I know you know you want me to
say you want me to say oh there's a

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:23.990
say you want me to say oh there's a
 

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.809
say you want me to say oh there's a
positive slope there and what I said to

01:00:25.809 --> 01:00:25.819
positive slope there and what I said to
 

01:00:25.819 --> 01:00:27.250
positive slope there and what I said to
him and I said you know actually a

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:27.260
him and I said you know actually a
 

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.500
him and I said you know actually a
quadratic is a way better fit usually

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:29.510
quadratic is a way better fit usually
 

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:33.160
quadratic is a way better fit usually
even more in us but in the end I mean he

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:33.170
even more in us but in the end I mean he
 

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.900
even more in us but in the end I mean he
made of the the university made a very

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:34.910
made of the the university made a very
 

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:37.540
made of the the university made a very
substantial investment and so I think

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:37.550
substantial investment and so I think
 

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.470
substantial investment and so I think
there's a tent

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480
there's a tent
 

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.140
there's a tent
tangible cents on all campuses that what

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:41.150
tangible cents on all campuses that what
 

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:42.700
tangible cents on all campuses that what
we're seeing is student interest is

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:42.710
we're seeing is student interest is
 

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:43.990
we're seeing is student interest is
different this time around

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000
different this time around
 

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.240
different this time around
students have broader interests where

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:46.250
students have broader interests where
 

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.250
students have broader interests where
we're getting people coming in I mean

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:48.260
we're getting people coming in I mean
 

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.809
we're getting people coming in I mean
I'm sure you're seeing this here right

01:00:49.809 --> 01:00:49.819
I'm sure you're seeing this here right
 

01:00:49.819 --> 01:00:50.859
I'm sure you're seeing this here right
we've have people coming in to our

01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:50.869
we've have people coming in to our
 

01:00:50.869 --> 01:00:52.839
we've have people coming in to our
machine learning class from all

01:00:52.839 --> 01:00:52.849
machine learning class from all
 

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.089
machine learning class from all
different disciplines right and you know

01:00:55.089 --> 01:00:55.099
different disciplines right and you know
 

01:00:55.099 --> 01:00:56.890
different disciplines right and you know
graduate students from all across campus

01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:56.900
graduate students from all across campus
 

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.870
graduate students from all across campus
trying to get into these courses and I

01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880
trying to get into these courses and I
 

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.730
trying to get into these courses and I
think it speaks to the the broad impact

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:00.740
think it speaks to the the broad impact
 

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.890
think it speaks to the the broad impact
that we have so let me tell you one

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:02.900
that we have so let me tell you one
 

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.420
that we have so let me tell you one
thing that keeps me up at night

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:04.430
thing that keeps me up at night
 

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:06.280
thing that keeps me up at night
so I've been thinking about this I think

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:06.290
so I've been thinking about this I think
 

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:10.120
so I've been thinking about this I think
I have personally seen because I like to

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:10.130
I have personally seen because I like to
 

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.190
I have personally seen because I like to
travel and talk to people I remember

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200
travel and talk to people I remember
 

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.710
travel and talk to people I remember
three years ago going around and being

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720
three years ago going around and being
 

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.180
three years ago going around and being
on a review committee at three different

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:16.190
on a review committee at three different
 

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:18.220
on a review committee at three different
universities where the Chancellor and

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:18.230
universities where the Chancellor and
 

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:19.569
universities where the Chancellor and
the Provost said exactly what my

01:01:19.569 --> 01:01:19.579
the Provost said exactly what my
 

01:01:19.579 --> 01:01:21.309
the Provost said exactly what my
Chancellor and provost said and I

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319
Chancellor and provost said and I
 

01:01:21.319 --> 01:01:23.470
Chancellor and provost said and I
couldn't convince them right and they

01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480
couldn't convince them right and they
 

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.870
couldn't convince them right and they
would deal with the the problem of or

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:25.880
would deal with the the problem of or
 

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.349
would deal with the the problem of or
the challenge of of over enrollments and

01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359
the challenge of of over enrollments and
 

01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:30.820
the challenge of of over enrollments and
a lot of student

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:30.830
a lot of student
 

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:33.760
a lot of student
demand by allocating lecture positions

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:33.770
demand by allocating lecture positions
 

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:35.350
demand by allocating lecture positions
right because I was gonna turn over

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:35.360
right because I was gonna turn over
 

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.390
right because I was gonna turn over
I think that's changed right and if you

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400
I think that's changed right and if you
 

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.700
I think that's changed right and if you
read around in the newspaper like you

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:39.710
read around in the newspaper like you
 

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:41.710

they can add some dozen faculty members

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:43.790
they can add some dozen faculty members
 

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.130
they can add some dozen faculty members
and there are a number of other schools

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:45.140
and there are a number of other schools
 

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.590
and there are a number of other schools
I won't name them that are all very good

01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:47.600
I won't name them that are all very good
 

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.930
I won't name them that are all very good
schools and are making you know

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:48.940
schools and are making you know
 

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.800

investments in faculty I think we may

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:55.640
investments in faculty I think we may
 

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.080
investments in faculty I think we may
see the number of tenure-track faculty

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:58.090
see the number of tenure-track faculty
 

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.850
see the number of tenure-track faculty
increased very significantly three or

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:00.860
increased very significantly three or
 

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.930
increased very significantly three or
four years from now I wonder what that

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:04.940
four years from now I wonder what that
 

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.290
four years from now I wonder what that
means for us as NSF right that I mean

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:08.300
means for us as NSF right that I mean
 

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.450
means for us as NSF right that I mean
these are really good people right these

01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:10.460
these are really good people right these
 

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.770
these are really good people right these
are gonna be really good people at

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:11.780
are gonna be really good people at
 

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.880
are gonna be really good people at
really good schools we're going to have

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:12.890
really good schools we're going to have
 

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:15.160
really good schools we're going to have
a larger group of P is we're gonna have

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.170
a larger group of P is we're gonna have
 

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.140
a larger group of P is we're gonna have
a larger impact for computer science

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:17.150
a larger impact for computer science

a larger impact for computer science
right if you read if you like to think

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:21.650
right if you read if you like to think
 

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:24.030
right if you read if you like to think
about university administration and

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:24.040
about university administration and
 

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.290

I'd encourage you to read this paper
 

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:31.810
I'd encourage you to read this paper
it's really a picture of it not on a

are leading lights in their fields and

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:41.630
are leading lights in their fields and
 

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.590
are leading lights in their fields and
it talks about the consequences of

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:43.600
it talks about the consequences of
 

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.030
it talks about the consequences of
biomed having grown a lot and then

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:46.040
biomed having grown a lot and then
 

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.190
biomed having grown a lot and then
flattened out in terms of the amount of

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200
flattened out in terms of the amount of
 

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.920
flattened out in terms of the amount of
research and so now for instance your r1

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:50.930
research and so now for instance your r1
 

01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:52.960
research and so now for instance your r1

your first solo grant right now III can
be honest enough with myself to think

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:02.600
be honest enough with myself to think
 

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.480
be honest enough with myself to think
about when I did my best work and when I

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:04.490
about when I did my best work and when I
 

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.520
about when I did my best work and when I
might have been most creative and we

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:06.530
might have been most creative and we
 

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:08.050
might have been most creative and we
might want to all reflect on that so

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:08.060
might want to all reflect on that so
 

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.060
might want to all reflect on that so
some of us are greater than 43 when that

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:10.070
some of us are greater than 43 when that
 

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.340
some of us are greater than 43 when that
happens some of us are less but you know

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:12.350
happens some of us are less but you know
 

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:14.230
happens some of us are less but you know
we've got a lot of fertile minds there

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240
we've got a lot of fertile minds there
 

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.690
we've got a lot of fertile minds there
that aren't engaged in their own

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:16.700
that aren't engaged in their own
 

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.940
that aren't engaged in their own
independent research up to age 41 there

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:18.950
independent research up to age 41 there
 

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:22.000
independent research up to age 41 there
right and so there's a really really I

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:22.010
right and so there's a really really I
 

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:23.590
right and so there's a really really I
mean there's a lot of differences

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:23.600
mean there's a lot of differences
 

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.810
mean there's a lot of differences
between biomed and computer science when

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:25.820
between biomed and computer science when
 

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:27.880
between biomed and computer science when
I first read this I read it and I

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:27.890
I first read this I read it and I
 

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:28.840
I first read this I read it and I
thought it was interesting and then I

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:28.850
thought it was interesting and then I
 

01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:30.250
thought it was interesting and then I
read it again and every time it said

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:30.260
read it again and every time it said
 

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.110
read it again and every time it said
biomed I put computer science and in my

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:32.120
biomed I put computer science and in my
 

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.180
biomed I put computer science and in my
mind and tried to argue why we were

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:34.190
mind and tried to argue why we were
 

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:35.590
mind and tried to argue why we were
different but it's it's really

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:35.600
different but it's it's really
 

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.000
different but it's it's really
interesting I think something we should

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:37.010
interesting I think something we should
 

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:38.660
interesting I think something we should
be thinking about

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:38.670
be thinking about
 

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:42.030
be thinking about
okay the last thing there's one tidal

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:42.040
okay the last thing there's one tidal
 

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.500
okay the last thing there's one tidal

going to hit us I talked about cs10k the
 

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.140
going to hit us I talked about cs10k the
broadening of computer of interest in

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:49.150
broadening of computer of interest in
 

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:53.970
broadening of computer of interest in
computing from from students and so

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:53.980
computing from from students and so
 

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.710
computing from from students and so
here's our regular traditional CS

here's our regular traditional CS
 

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.470
here's our regular traditional CS
programs here's maybe another tidal wave

01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480
programs here's maybe another tidal wave
 

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.910
programs here's maybe another tidal wave
we're going to see where we get students

01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920
we're going to see where we get students
 

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.470
we're going to see where we get students
who are coming in through computer

more in the application of computing and
 

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.930
more in the application of computing and
maybe that's not an issue here but I

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:06.940
maybe that's not an issue here but I
 

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.760
maybe that's not an issue here but I
know at some schools we're still

thank you for enough for the invitation

01:05:34.039 --> 01:05:34.049
 

01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:48.109
one or two quick questions earlier in

01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119
one or two quick questions earlier in
 

01:05:48.119 --> 01:05:50.349
one or two quick questions earlier in
your presentation you showed a very

01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:50.359
your presentation you showed a very
 

01:05:50.359 --> 01:05:52.730
your presentation you showed a very
diagram with where the jobs were with

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:52.740
diagram with where the jobs were with
 

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.339
diagram with where the jobs were with
very crisp lines is there really that

01:05:55.339 --> 01:05:55.349
very crisp lines is there really that
 

01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:57.740
very crisp lines is there really that
crispo of a line between engineering and

01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:57.750
crispo of a line between engineering and
 

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:00.589
crispo of a line between engineering and
computer or it I think there's a greater

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599
computer or it I think there's a greater
 

01:06:00.599 --> 01:06:02.089
computer or it I think there's a greater
and greater blend

01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099
and greater blend
 

01:06:02.099 --> 01:06:05.779
and greater blend
you know blend all the way around right

01:06:05.779 --> 01:06:05.789
you know blend all the way around right
 

01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:08.059
you know blend all the way around right
so so that's a great point the point

01:06:08.059 --> 01:06:08.069
so so that's a great point the point
 

01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:09.769
so so that's a great point the point
well you had a microphone so everybody

01:06:09.769 --> 01:06:09.779
well you had a microphone so everybody
 

01:06:09.779 --> 01:06:11.359
well you had a microphone so everybody
could hear you know the point was was

01:06:11.359 --> 01:06:11.369
could hear you know the point was was
 

01:06:11.369 --> 01:06:13.579
could hear you know the point was was
that in that round circle that there

01:06:13.579 --> 01:06:13.589
that in that round circle that there
 

01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:15.200
that in that round circle that there
were some jobs that was just classified

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:15.210
were some jobs that was just classified
 

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:16.670
were some jobs that was just classified
as life scientists and of course there

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680
as life scientists and of course there
 

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.890
as life scientists and of course there
are biomed people and even in computing

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900
are biomed people and even in computing
 

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.900
are biomed people and even in computing
you may have a biomed background but

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:20.910
you may have a biomed background but
 

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.180
you may have a biomed background but
you're computing so these were simply

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:23.190
you're computing so these were simply
 

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:24.920
you're computing so these were simply
where the Bureau of Labor Statistics

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:24.930

through those lines they're not my lines
but you know somebody has to draw a line

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:29.490
but you know somebody has to draw a line
 

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.490
but you know somebody has to draw a line
somewhere you know so you should

over this slide really really quickly so

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000
over this slide really really quickly so
 

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.529

one of the things I think one of the
 

01:07:12.539 --> 01:07:14.420
one of the things I think one of the
lessons that's been learned over the

think one of the other important lessons
from our history and there have been a

01:07:47.519 --> 01:07:47.529
from our history and there have been a
 

01:07:47.529 --> 01:07:49.049
from our history and there have been a
number of papers written about this

01:07:49.049 --> 01:07:49.059
number of papers written about this
 

01:07:49.059 --> 01:07:50.640

the beginning intercept was sort of one
 

01:08:13.119 --> 01:08:14.729
the beginning intercept was sort of one
of the major players in that but that's

01:08:14.729 --> 01:08:14.739
of the major players in that but that's
 

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:17.069
of the major players in that but that's
really now been embraced by a number of

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:17.079
really now been embraced by a number of
 

01:08:17.079 --> 01:08:18.689
really now been embraced by a number of
the large tech companies and actually

01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:18.699
the large tech companies and actually

NSF funding in that is now a much much
 

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.979
NSF funding in that is now a much much
smaller piece of that because it's been

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:22.989
smaller piece of that because it's been
 

01:08:22.989 --> 01:08:25.019
smaller piece of that because it's been
taken up by others but that network

01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:25.029
taken up by others but that network
 

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:28.319
taken up by others but that network
still exists so we have a network for

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:28.329
still exists so we have a network for
 

01:08:28.329 --> 01:08:30.539
