TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.330
to "The Developer Show."

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.230
This is your TLDR.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.740
We recently
announced the release

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.720
of TensorFlow Serving, which is
a high-performance open source

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.500
serving system for machine
learning models designed

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.710
for production environments
and optimized for tensor flow.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.700
It's ideal for running
multiple models

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.410
at large scale that change over
time based on real-world data.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.650
The post has more details
and the GitHub link.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.460
BabyFirst increased
their installs

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.920
by 50% across their portfolio
of apps with Google Play

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.200
by implementing store
listening experiments

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.380
and localizing the store
listing into 10 languages.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.420
Find out how in the latest
Android Developer Story.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.120
It's time for part 40 of
Laurence Moroney's series

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.300
on Google Sign-In.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.290
In the latest post, learn how
you can have your users sign

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.950
in via your app to authorize
your service for access

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.330
to Google APIs such
as Google Drive.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.320
Autotrack for analytics.js
attempts to leverage

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.150
as many Google
Analytics features

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.180
as possible while requiring
minimal manual implementation.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.690
To start using more of
Google Analytics today,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.790
check out the post.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.200
The Google Cloud Vision
API is now in beta,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.830
and anyone can
submit their images

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.840
to understand the contents,
from detecting everyday objects

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.520
to reading text within the
image or even identifying

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.160
product logos.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.750
You can now diagnose
your problems

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.980
in your production apps
faster with updates

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.780
to the Google Cloud Debugger.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.090
It lets you inspect the state
of an application at any code

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.010
location without stopping
or slowing it down.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.520
And now it has an enhanced
UI, expanded language support,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.690
and debugging from more places.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.810
Custom Machine Types for
Google Compute Engine

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.770
lets you create virtual
machines with vCPU and memory

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.190
configurations that are
perfect for your workloads.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.800
While in beta,
we've seen customers

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.130
save an average of
19% and as much as 50%

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.720
on top of our already
market-leading prices.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.660
It's now in general
availability, so check it out.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.490
"Firecasts" is a
new hands-on YouTube

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.420
series for Firebase developers.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.090
Tune in each week to
learn how to build

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.669
real-time apps on Android,
iOS, and the web with Firebase.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.200
Actually, I know for
a fact that David East

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.840
is in Studio B warming up for
his next Firebase screencast.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.130
Shall we drop in on him?

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.346
Yeah, I think we should.

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:23.214
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.700
DAVID EAST: --schemaless.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Whatcha doing?

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.324
DAVID EAST: Uh, just your
traditional warm-ups, you know,

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:36.160
before a screencast.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.701
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Will
you show me one?

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:39.270
DAVID EAST: Extraordinary apps.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.320
Extraordinary apps.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.820
The Firebase database
is schemaless.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: 1, 2 3, 4.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.050
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.050
DAVID EAST: The Firebase
database is schemaless.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.841
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:50.980
I stopped by because
we're on "The Dev Show."

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.864
See? "Dev Show."

00:02:51.864 --> 00:02:53.136
Hi, "Dev Show."

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:54.760
And I was hoping that
you could tell us

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.290
a little bit about your
series and a little bit

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.990
about Firebase.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.740
Let's start there.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.360
What is Firebase, for
those few people out there

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.360
that don't already know?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.860
DAVID EAST: Yeah, well,
if you like to build apps,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.276
it's really cool
because you build

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:06.690
all this great client-side
code, but then you like,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.827
oh, I have to build a server to
do anything really interesting.

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:12.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: There's all
that, like, infrastructure--

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.690
DAVID EAST: Exactly.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
--spin-up that you

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.210
have to do before you
actually get to your idea.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.380
DAVID EAST: Right.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.110
Before you actually
get to the fun part.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.050
And so Firebase
completely eliminates

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.120
that because it's pretty
much a back-end as a service.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.240
So you can just plug into
your Firebase servers.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.270
And then in addition to getting
scalable infrastructure,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.870
you also get sweet
real-time data.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.690
So every time you update
one piece of data in an app,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.530
it automatically pushes that
data down to every other app.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.140
So they just
instantly refresh it.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.880
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
totally awesome.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.310
DAVID EAST: Yeah.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And I think
one of the things that I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.595
love about Firebase the most
is it's so easy to get started.

00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:43.330
DAVID EAST: Oh, yeah.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's what you're

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.040
doing with these
screencasts, is you're

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.290
showing, like, here's a few
steps, and you're started.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.539
DAVID EAST: Pretty much, yeah.

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.030
Like, when we were showing it
on each and every platform.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.445
So whether you're an Android,
iOS, or web developer,

00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:56.800
we are going to come out
with screencasts for each

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.770
and every one of those
topics, like how to get

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.460
started, how to
do this and that.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.430
And then showing
everyone, like, kind

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.490
of combining these patterns
together and seeing,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.796
if you have one app that has to
be on several platforms, hey,

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:09.420
it's pretty easy when
you use Firebase.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.440
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you've
got two episodes on Android

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.950
already.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.380
DAVID EAST: Right.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's
coming out in the future?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.360
DAVID EAST: Yeah, I have a third
episode on Android next week.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.329
And then after that,
we're going to be doing

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.579
some stuff in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.260
So if you're an Angular fan,
we have some stuff on that.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.130
And then also we're gonna
cover iOS afterwards.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.640
So.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.005
So fully cross-platform.

00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:27.860
DAVID EAST: Oh, yeah.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.475
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Using the Firebase.

00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:29.540
DAVID EAST: That's what we do.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's very cool.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.667
And it comes out every Tuesday?

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:32.750
DAVID EAST: Every Tuesday.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Every Tuesday.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.540

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.770
DAVID EAST: All
right, thank you.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'll
get out of your hair.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.920
DAVID EAST: You're welcome
to join me anytime.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.086
TIMOTHY JORDAN: The Firebase
database is schemaless.

00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:46.057
That does have a good
ring to it, doesn't it?

00:04:46.057 --> 00:04:48.140
If you'd like to have me
sneak up on somebody else

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.390
as they're preparing for a
"Dev Byte" or a screencast,
