00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.881
Lucky you. You get to do another challenge
problem right now. Here we have two

00:00:03.893 --> 00:00:08.003
polynomials once again. This one has 4
terms and this one has 3 terms and I

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:11.805
would like you to multiply them together,
and of course, simplify as much as

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:15.902
possible. I know that you're probably not
very pleased with me for asking you to do

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:19.891
this, but the reason I am asking you to do
it is because I think that this is a

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:23.555
great way to make sure that you're
actually being very careful with writing

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:27.425
out every step in the process for solving
this problem. So I know it's not going to

00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:31.454
be particularly exciting, but if you're
careful the first time you do it, then you

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:35.243
won't have to do it again. So I'll just
remind you. Write everything out, and

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:39.546
remember you just want to take each term
in the first set of parentheses and

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:44.318
multiply it by every term in the second
set of parentheses. And then, add all

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.836
those many, many terms together and
simplify. Good luck.
