00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.730
Who doesn’t love to unwind with a cocktail
at the end of a long day?

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.730
Babies, that’s who!

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.339
No, I mean that literally.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.090
Infants shouldn’t do that.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.010
Hey everyone!

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.690
Amy talking drinking on DNews today.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.699
Recently it was reported that a mother in
Kenosha, Wisconsin, noticed her baby was acting

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.640
a little funny after dinner one night.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.499
So she went to the hospital and realized she’d
mixed her baby’s formula with two ounces

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.390
of vodka instead of water!

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.859
Local police said the infant’s blood alcohol
concentration was 0.29 percent!

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.160
To put it into perspective, that’s higher
than a 200-pound man’s BAC after 10 drinks!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.891
The good news is that the baby, according
to reports, was expected to survive, though

00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:43.190
any long-term effects were unclear.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.260
But how did the infant survive?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.760
We get intoxicated from alcohol because it’s
metabolized by our bodies.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.080
It’s first absorbed in the stomach as it
passes through, then moves onto the small

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.900
intestine where the bulk of the alcohol we
ingest — about 80 percent — is absorbed

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.500
through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
Because alcohol is a poison, the body needs
to filter that out, and the filtration system

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.860
is the liver; enzymes break down the alcohol
and rid it from the body.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.830
But it’s a slower process than consumption.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.670
On average, the liver can process one ounce
of liquor, which is about one standard drink,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.780
every hour.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.600
If you drink more than this, your system becomes
saturated and you end up drunk with alcohol

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.360
in your blood and body tissues until your
liver can metabolize it.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.030
But no two people are the same, which means
no two livers will process alcohol the same

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.030
way.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.860
And of all the things affecting how individuals
process alcohol, age is one thing that isn’t

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.860
a factor.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.420
Your liver doesn’t develop between infant
hood and your 21st birthday such that you

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.890
can suddenly drink safely.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.340
What really happens in these 21 years is that
you get bigger.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.810
Body weight and type are two things that drastically
affect how your body processes alcohol.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.390
Some people are smaller than others, and smaller
people have less mass through which alcohol

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.450
can diffuse so they end up with more alcohol
in their bloodstreams and become intoxicated

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.750
far more quickly.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.010
Body composition also plays a role.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.320
Individuals with a lower percentage of body
fat will end up with a lower blood alcohol

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.979
level than those with a higher percentage
of body fat.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.400
Gender plays a role, too.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.920
The enzyme dehydrogenase that breaks down
alcohol in the stomach, is less prevalent

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.890
in women than in men, meaning more alcohol
is absorbed through women’s small intestine’s,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.670
contributing to an overall higher blood alcohol
content.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.090
Add to that that women typically have higher
body fat percentage than men, and the ladies

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.080
are getting far drunker than the fellows.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.240
A woman my size can have less than one drink
before reaching the legal limit to drive:

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.500
that’s 0.08 BAC, whereas a man my size could
drink twice as much and be fine.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.670
Of course, there are other factors that affect
how your body handles alcohol including mood,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.580
hormonal levels, medication, illness, and
mentality — if you go out wanting to get

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.239
drunk research shows you could get “drunk”
even off non-alcoholic drinks!

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.330
But ultimately, size plays a huge part in
alcohol consumption.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.050
Your liver can always process alcohol, your
body will just be saturated by it if you’re

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.950
small… especially infant-sized.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.830
So a baby might survive getting drunk, but
there could be devastating long-term effects.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.120
From the moment they start to form, our brains
continue to develop until our early 20s.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.760
And at every stage, alcohol is one of the
worst things to give a developing brain.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.750
The brain is less susceptible to alcohol after
birth, but the circuits are still developing

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.379
meaning alcohol can disrupt that development.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.290
Alcohol in a developing brain can affect problem
solving skills, concentration, mood, and overall

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.290
mental health.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.819
The longer you go without drinking any alcohol
the better is it for your brain, but almost

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.290
no one does this.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.290
Including pregnant women.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.120
A mother who drinks passes the alcohol to
her baby in the womb.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.040
There, the developing brain’s architecture
can be severely stunted for alcohol exposure,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.860
but is there a safe amount to drink?

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.410
Tara has more on that story here.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.459

affects brain development, what do you guys

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.520
think is the right drinking age?
