1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,310
Alright. Alright. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,240
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab podcast. And
before we get rolling on this podcast,

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:13,080
just a two items of business we
want to put in front of you. First,

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,410
we're going to be very, I don't
know when you're listening to this,

5
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,710
but if you're listening
to this before June 19th,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,510
2013 that would be a
Wednesday next Wednesday.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,760
Then you will find us if
you're a reddit person. Uh,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,660
we're doing an ask me anything
for the Reddit folks on that date,

9
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,220
3:00 PM Eastern. So if you
want to join us there. Yeah.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,140
And as a, as the name suggests,

11
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,260
you can ask us whatever you want and
we'll do our best to answer details are on

12
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,060
our website, radiolab.org okay.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,590
Bit of business number two which we're
really excited about is we're very close

14
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:47,550
to announcing our next live tour, which
is going to happen later in the fall.

15
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:48,810
We're going to go to 20 cities.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,890
It's gonna be awesome to check
radiolab.org for that too.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,930
And now to the podcast at hand,

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,700
we are going to be considering two
very different takes on everything.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,270
Yes. Later we'll get to physicist Brian
Green, but we're going to start with a,

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,730
a woman whose name is not Brian.
Ah, hello. Hello. Hello. Hi.

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,840
Hi. Is this Jenny buying a chance? It
sure is. Hey, my name is Jenny Hollowell.

22
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:16,770
She's a writer and author.
And here's the setup. Um,

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,240
so we were really recently asked by
the show selected shorts to curate an

24
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:25,200
evening of stories just to select
a couple for people to read. Well,

25
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,740
that turned out to be really hard
for us. Like we, we could not agree,

26
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:32,890
we argue to get kind of ugly internally.
I'm not going to go there. But, uh,

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,680
the one story that we all agreed on
instantly and we never really looked back

28
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,370
yet was the story, uh, from Jenny
Hollowell called a history of everything,

29
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,204
including you.

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,780
So we called her up and we asked her to
a black kind of gushed a little first.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,713
Oh yeah. Well

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,120
there was defining there was the falling
when I know that people are gonna hear

33
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:55,440
this so they're not going to read it.

34
00:01:55,441 --> 00:02:00,441
So they won't be able to dwell on just
the incredible tensions in these very

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,780
short and specific sentences
that you've written.

36
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,160
But I'm just wondering how long did this,

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,220
it's about a five pages
to hold in your hand.

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,890
How many decades did it take for
you to write this? Well, it's,

39
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,190
it's one of those stories that defies, uh,

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,040
most of my experiences
with writing stories,

41
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:23,080
which is that a kid came up
very quickly. Um, uh, and I,

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I always hate hearing other writers say
how quickly something came about because

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,130
it's a rare occurrence in,
you're always kind of full of,

44
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,280
of envy for those moments.
This is the, you know,

45
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:38,650
one story that I think I've
ever written in a day. Wow.

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,040
But then, you know, just not
definitely take time. Okay.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,220
Would you mind reading it
for us? Uh, and we will,

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,110
we can talk more on the
backend. Okay, sure.

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,550
A history of everything including you.

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,330
Ooh, first

51
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,750
there was God or gods or nothing.

52
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,110
[inaudible]

53
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,790
then synthesis space, the expanse,
explosions, implosions, particles,

54
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,100
objects, combustion and fusion.

55
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,080
[inaudible]

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,670
out of the chaos came order.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,180
Stars were born and shown and died.

58
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,090
Planets rolled across their galaxies
on invisible ellipses and the elements

59
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:30,290
combined and became,

60
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,270
um,

61
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,580
life evolved or was created.

62
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,350
Sales trembled and divided
and gasped and found dry land.

63
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,810
Soon they grew legs and fins and hands
and antenna and mouths and ears and wings

64
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:49,250
and eyes, eyes that opened wide to take
all of it in the creeping, growing,

65
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,550
soaring, swimming, crawling,
stampeding, universe.

66
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,790
Eyes opened and closed and opened
again. We called it blinking

67
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,650
above us, shown a star
that we called the sun.

68
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,663
Oh,

69
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,430
and we call it the ground, the earth.

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,460
So we named everything, including
ourselves. We were man and woman.

71
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,400
And when we got lonely, we figured
out a way to make more of us.

72
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,220
We called it sex and
most people enjoyed it.

73
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,660
We fell in love. We talked about
God and Bang Stones Together,

74
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,950
made sparks and called them fire. We
got warmer and the food got better.

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,890
We got married, we had some children.
They cried and crawled and grew.

76
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,700
One, dissected flowers,
sometimes eating the pedals.

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,070
Another like to chase squirrels.

78
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,350
We fought wars over money and honor
and women. We starved ourselves.

79
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,150
We hired prostitutes, we purified
our water, we compromised,

80
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,250
decorated and became esoteric.

81
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,150
One of us stopped
breathing and turned blue

82
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,673
than others.

83
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,150
First we covered them with leaves and
then we buried them in the ground.

84
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,960
We remembered them, we forgot them.

85
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,320
We aged our buildings,
kept getting taller.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,940
We hired lawyers and formed counsels
and left paper trials. We negotiated.

87
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,440
We admitted we got sick
and searched for cures.

88
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,310
We invented lipstick vaccines,
PyLadies solar panels, interventions,

89
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:36,960
table manners, firearms window
treatments, therapy, birth control,

90
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,970
tailgating, status symbols, palimony,
sportsmanship, focus groups,

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,230
Zoloft, sunscreen, landscaping,
Sesnas, fortune, cookies,

92
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,410
chemotherapy, convenience
foods and computers.

93
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,530
We angered militants and our mothers.

94
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,913
You were born,

95
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,120
you learned to walk and went to school
and played sports and lost your virginity

96
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,830
and got into a decent college and majored
in psychology and went to rock shows

97
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,180
and became political and got drunk and
changed your major to marketing and wore

98
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,050
turtleneck sweaters and read novels
and volunteered and went to movies and

99
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,030
developed a taste for
blue cheese dressing.

100
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,510
I met you through friends and didn't like
you. At first the feeling was mutual,

101
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,460
but we got used to each other.

102
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,190
We had sex for the first time behind
an art gallery standing up and slightly

103
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,024
drunk.

104
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,870
You held my face in your hands and said
that I was beautiful and you were too

105
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,310
tall with the streetlight behind you.

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,860
We went back to your place and listen
to the white album we ordered in.

107
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,430
We fought and made up and got good jobs.

108
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:54,930
They got married and bought an apartment
and worked out and ate more and talk

109
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:59,820
less. I got depressed. You ignored me.

110
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,050
I was sick of you. You drank too
much and got careless with money.

111
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,240
I slept with my boss.

112
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,000
We went into counseling and got a dog.

113
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,080
I bought a book of sex positions and
we tried the least degrading one.

114
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,700
The wheelbarrow. You took flight
lessons and subscribed to rolling stone.

115
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,980
I learned Spanish and started gardening.

116
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,793
[inaudible]

117
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,650
we had some children who
more or less disappointed us,

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,540
but it might have been our fault. You
were too indulgent and I was too critical.

119
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,310
We loved them. Anyway,

120
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,500
one of them died before we did
stabbed on the subway. We grieved.

121
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,530
We moved. We adopted a cat.

122
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:44,530
[inaudible]

123
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,710
the world seemed uncertain.
We live beyond our means.

124
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,750
I got judgmental and belligerent.
You got confused and easily tired.

125
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,740
You ignored me. I was
sick of you. We forgave.

126
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,100
Mm.

127
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,210
We remembered. We make
cocktails. We got tender.

128
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,170
There was that time on the porch
when you said, can you believe it?

129
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,610
[inaudible]

130
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,190
this was near the end and
your hands were trembling.

131
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,540
I think you were talking
about everything including us.

132
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,760
Did you want me to say it
so it would not be lost?

133
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,830
It was too much for me to think about.
I could not go back to the beginning.

134
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,290
I said, not really, and we
watched the sun go down.

135
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,100
A dog kept barking in the
distance and you were tired,

136
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:41,450
but you smiled and you said
here that it's rough, rough,

137
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,030
and we laughed. You were like that.

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Now your question is my project
and our house is full of clues.

139
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,220
I'm reading old letters
and turning over rocks.

140
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,560
I bury my face in your sweaters, I
study a photograph taken at the beach,

141
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,560
the sun in our eyes and
the water behind us.

142
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,420
[inaudible]

143
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,740
it's a victory to remember the forgotten
picnic basket and your striped beach

144
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:12,574
blanket.

145
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,660
It's a victory to remember how the
jellyfish stung you and you ran screaming

146
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:20,920
from the water. It's a victory to
remember dressing the wound with meat.

147
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:23,830
Tenderizer in you
saying, I made it better.

148
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,640
I will tell you this.

149
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,380
Standing on our hill this morning, I
looked at the land we chose for ourselves.

150
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,250
I saw a few green patches
and our sweet little shed.

151
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,830
That same dog was barking.
A storm was moving in.

152
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,230
I did not think of heaven,

153
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,060
but I saw that the clouds were beautiful
and I watched them cover the sun.

154
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,380
[inaudible]

155
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,370
a history of everything,
including you or Jenny. Hello?

156
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,270
No,

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,590
Jenny, can you talk a
little bit about like where,

158
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,990
what you were thinking when you're writing
this? Like where did this come from?

159
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,010
Oh, well, I, the story
kind of came from that,

160
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,130
that impulse to kind of trace trace back.

161
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:18,820
I think maybe I was in therapy
at the time. And you know,

162
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,440
they always ask you about your
parents or their parents and,

163
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,690
and I found myself a little
frustrated by the idea that it's,

164
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,650
it's traceable, like whatever sort of
position you find yourself in life,

165
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:37,240
that, that you can trace
back to the origin. You know,
if you follow that logic,

166
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:40,300
then you're eventually
gonna end up in a, you know,

167
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,970
a protoplasm sort of situation.

168
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,050
And I think that's why the guys who
had, so tell me about your parents.

169
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:49,420
Tell me about their parents.
Tell me about their parents.

170
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,280
Tell you about their parents. Just
one of those kinds of things. I know,

171
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,490
I mean, I wait, where does it end? At
some point you're talking about, uh,

172
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,260
some caveman's emotionally
unavailable parents,

173
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,370
and to imagine one of the conversations
you might've had with your therapist,

174
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:10,930
I know you were once very religious and
then you've kind of lost your faith.

175
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,220
I mean, was that part of this,

176
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,910
does that happen near or in the
neighborhood of writing the story?

177
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,840
It was probably about two years
before the writing of the story,

178
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,960
but it was very, it was
still very fresh experience.

179
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,420
I was sort of in the
thick of it at the time.

180
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,310
And was there something of that struggle
or fall from faith that kind of got

181
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:33,310
infused into the, to the
storytelling? I think so too. I mean,

182
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:36,220
I think that definitely
is a part of, you know,

183
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:39,040
the searching that I was
going through at the time.

184
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:44,041
Just that desire to grasp
what might be the grand,

185
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,330
you know, a heart of it all.

186
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,140
So the story was a little about
that wrestling experience,

187
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:53,890
trying to explain how I'm
here, how we got here,

188
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,920
how we ended up in this moment.

189
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,220
And the logic of that is having lost a
narrative and a given to you narrative of

190
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:05,380
how things began, you were thinking, okay,

191
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:08,470
so let me see if I can work my
own narrative from the ground up.

192
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,310
That's, that's definitely, uh,

193
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,350
where I was just sort of maybe mourning
the loss of that narrative a little bit

194
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,980
and, and making one of
my own too, to just, uh,

195
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,330
give me something to,
to think about. Um, I,

196
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:27,730
I definitely don't feel like I
stumbled across any solutions,

197
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,510
but I felt like the,

198
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,820
the comfort of narrative is definitely
something I believe in. And,

199
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,020
and the story sort of is a extension of,

200
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,990
of my process about thinking
about the beginning of everything.

201
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,200
Well, that's creation stories go. It's
really, really nice. I have to say,

202
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,540
you were gonna, you know,

203
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,060
you're going to be hearing from Tom
Mutek rabbis and Quranic scholars,

204
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
Christian saints.

205
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,090
Have you ever thought about getting
a church church start winning your,

206
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,870
oh wow. That's a, it feels
like a, a can of worms babysit.

207
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,613
But thank you.

208
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,550

209
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,980

[inaudible] [inaudible]

230
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,600
we're back. Uh, we just heard a
story by Jenny Hollowell called a,

231
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:40,670
a brief history of everything,
including you. Five pages,

232
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,270
kind of encompassing the
entire universe, everything.

233
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:49,130
Can we do this in a completely
different way? Yeah, part two. Okay,

234
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,860
so this is about what do for a living.

235
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,370
You know that I have this neighbor
and friend, Brian Greene, Brian Green,

236
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:59,470
professor of physics and mathematics.
Columbia University. Yes, I do know that.

237
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,780
And the thing about Brian is he
is a theoretical physicist. Now,

238
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,850
theoretical physicists say that it's
theoretically possible to know everything

239
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,190
there is to know in the universe.

240
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:13,400
So one day they'll be able to explain
not only how you could send a rocket to

241
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:13,940
the moon,

242
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,940
but the laws that govern space
and energy and time and gravity,

243
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,020
every thing,

244
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,100
the whole universe one day they think
might be totally understandable using

245
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:29,550
logic and mathematical equations.
Now you can't take that too far.

246
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,690
And none of us really imagined
that if you asked the equations,

247
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,390
what are we going to have
for dinner tomorrow night,

248
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,750
the equations will spit out
fried Tofu and you know,

249
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,010
spring rolls or something like that.

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,520
But at the level of the
fundamental ingredients,

251
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,120
the particles that make up the
universe, their properties,

252
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,180
the hope and the goal is that the
theories that we work out will apply

253
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:58,340
everywhere and tell us about everything
you just said. Everything yes.

254
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,530
As in everything. Yes.
That's the big, big goal.

255
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,710
This is like playing
poker. You're helping me.

256
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,620
I don't know what you're gonna do. All
right. We'll take it to the next step.

257
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,440
Okay. Wait, so what do you, what
are you up to here? Krulwich

258
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,800
well, we, you know, we argue, oh,
that's the fun thing we do, but sure.

259
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,140
But unlike him,

260
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:26,170
my position has always been that it's
going to be very hard to answer all the

261
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,450
puzzles in the universe. And frankly,

262
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:34,070
it's not a bad thing if some mysteries
remain mysterious. Yeah, that's my view.

263
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,900
But because is so smart when I tell
them, how do you know whenever he,

264
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,330
he always wins the arguments,
but a few months ago, this is,

265
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,130
this is the thing that got
this whole thing started.

266
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,000
I was reading Harper's magazine and
I found an article written by another

267
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:50,450
physicist and a novelist, Alan
Lightman. I thought, oh boy,

268
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,340
this is going to drive Brian Bats because
everyone says theirs is a group of

269
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:59,120
physicists and Brian happens to be one
of them who've embraced a very exciting

270
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:03,110
idea with an unfortunate effect. If
this idea, it turns out to be true,

271
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,460
Allen writes, it will then be impossible
for physicist to know everything,

272
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,120
which I thought, ah,
excellent. What is the art?

273
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,060
What is the idea it has to do
with with more than one universe,

274
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,600
you know there is a very weak, you
know this, we talked about it before,

275
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,580
that there is a a a vogue now for
the idea that instead of one universe

276
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:26,210
encompassing everything, there
might be more than one, right?

277
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,210
So there actually are a number of ways
that physics comes upon this idea of

278
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,210
other universes.

279
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:36,470
Maybe the most intuitive is
to think about the big bang,

280
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,820
that sense space rushing outward and
matter could cool on yield to stars and

281
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:41,361
galaxies.

282
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:46,361
That wonderful picture that we've had
with us since the 1920s we have in the

283
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:51,390
interim interim decades come to the
possibility that the big bang may not be a

284
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,230
onetime event. That is there.

285
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,770
It may have been many big bangs and may
continue to be big bang, like events,

286
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,640
each spawning its own universe.
If that were the case,

287
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,850
then our universe would then be viewed
as one of many in this grand collection

288
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,720
emerging from all of these
big bang like events.

289
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,820
Now in this few of things,

290
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,380
there could be not just one universe
or three or 19 there could be 10,000 it

291
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,170
could be, it could be trillions.
That could be an infinite number.

292
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,430
And here's the crucial thing.

293
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,940
Each and every one of these universes
can be different from its neighbor.

294
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,010
Vastly different. That's right.

295
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:34,011
So when we studied the equations for
the production of these universes,

296
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,360
we see in the mathematics that the
other universes could have different

297
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:44,190
features, different particle compositions,
different masses of the particles,

298
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,940
different forces. Some
of them might have Adam,

299
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,890
some of them might not have that up. You
could have universities, lots of stars,

300
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,520
some with no stars, some could be
made of Munster cheese. I don't know.

301
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:57,360
The fundamental properties of each
universe could be very different.

302
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:00,750
That's exactly right. And that's the
key to Ellen Lachman's argument. Well,

303
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:03,360
then going back to the
beginning of our conversation,

304
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,600
if a physicist job is to explore
everything that is the universe now the

305
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,760
universe has just been
demoted to a sub universe.

306
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,170
Then when you get your diploma
from a great university,

307
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,050
the president of the
university is my friends.

308
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,680
We are gathered here to meet the people
who have earned the credentials to

309
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:27,240
describe the sub universe a
little bit of what we could know.

310
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,310
It's like you've been demoted.

311
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,030
You thought that you were going to get
to learn about everything, your word,

312
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,260
and now I didn't have that. Your
everything is very, it's sub. Oh,

313
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,590
I wouldn't describe it like that
at all. As you might imagine,

314
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,650
rather than do you this as an
incredible loss of understanding.

315
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,710
The right way of viewing it,

316
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:54,360
I think is to recognize that certain
questions that we were asking when we

317
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:58,320
thought there was just one
universe where the wrong questions,

318
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,220
meaning meaning what well piece has.
Here's the way to think about it.

319
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,630
This is how it always go. As we've seen
this before in the history of science

320
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,430
[inaudible]

321
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,430
take Kepler Yohanas Kepler
was an astronomer and a
kind of mapper of the solar

322
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:18,611
system.

323
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:21,970
He was trying to figure out where the
planets were and the nature of their

324
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:26,971
orbits and stuff and Kepler spent a long
time trying to find an explanation for

325
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:31,870
why the earth is 93 million
miles away from the sun.

326
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:36,820
93 million kept with of the has
to be a really important number,

327
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,650
a key to a deeper mystery,

328
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:42,310
but we now know that he was
barking up the wrong tree.

329
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,150
Why there isn't just one planet.
There are many planets. In fact,

330
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:53,740
many planets around many stars and the
distances of those planets from their

331
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,850
hosts are varies over a wide range
of possibilities. Mars, for example,

332
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:01,360
is 141 million miles
from the sun, Jupiter,

333
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,720
483 million and when you start comparing
the different distances of planets from

334
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:11,080
the sun, you realize that the fact that
the earth is 93 million miles away,

335
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,810
it doesn't seem like a deep
law of the universe anymore.

336
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,150
It just feels kind of arbitrary.

337
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,720
And then that forces you to change
the question. Not why 93 million. No,

338
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,560
why all these different planets at
different distances from the sun.

339
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,630
And yet they all stick around the sun.

340
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,750
They're all trapped in the neighborhood.

341
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,780
That question puts you on
the road to a deeper thought.

342
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,060
The theory of gravity. The point is says
Brian, if you're focused on one thing,

343
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,550
you're going to think that one
thing is the key to everything.

344
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,250
When you're one turns to
many, then you think, ah,

345
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,030
well the one thing that really wasn't
so special buck, the way Brian sees it,

346
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,490
that is progress. That is understanding.

347
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:56,410
And then it frees you up to ask other
kinds of questions such as what's the law

348
00:21:56,411 --> 00:22:00,100
of gravity? What is the equation that
allows us to understand how the sun form.

349
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,150
So those are real questions and when
you can toss out the ones that are red

350
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,650
herrings that you thought were deep,

351
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:08,020
but they're actually just
asking the wrong question,

352
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,940
that frees you up to make progress.

353
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,560
And Brian says you can make the exact
same kind of progress if you compare

354
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,640
universes.

355
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,020
So instead of asking why is our one
universe the way it is now you can ask,

356
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:22,541
well,

357
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,740
what do all of these universes so
different one from the other still have in

358
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:27,250
common.

359
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,300
That would be pretty heavy and exciting
to describe the underlying laws that

360
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:36,301
govern all universes regardless of their
detailed features and what it would be

361
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:40,150
like in that universe or that universe
or that universe. Way over there.

362
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,090
There are infinite number of them.

363
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,540
So if I told you that you could write
anything down and it might be a universe,

364
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:52,270
black universe is white, universe is
green, universe is soft university,

365
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,630
Harvard University, muscular
universities, teenie universities,

366
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,930
urged universities, then the only one
you know intimately is your own. Um,

367
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,500
it seems to me that, what do you
know about those other units?

368
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,980
Other than that they might be very
different and then we don't know very much

369
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,650
observationally. Sure. We can't see them.

370
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,390
We don't know very much experimentally.

371
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:17,140
So they're definitely on a very
different footing from that perspective.

372
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,160
But Bryan believes that one day we might
be able to experimentally detect these

373
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:25,360
other universes and somehow it'll kind
of pick up their distant vibrations.

374
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,280
Kind of like the way you
hear your neighbors music,

375
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,180
it's just emanating through the
walls. We might be able to listen in,

376
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:34,540
he says and take a couple of measurements,
which would be quite wonderful.

377
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,750
And in that case at least there's a chance
that we can observational evidence of

378
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:44,440
the existence of these other realms.
And at that point I would begin to say,

379
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,490
hmm, maybe there's something

380
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,500
really to this. So the physics

381
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,260
doing says I can't go
there. I can't observe it.

382
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,670
At least for the moment.

383
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,440
All I have is my brain and my
math and I say from my brain,

384
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm going to just assume
certain things are always true.

385
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:06,490
There's always going to be gravity to
say there's always going to be some

386
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:09,100
particle or wave that creates matter.

387
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,420
There's always going to
be a w, W I don't know.

388
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:16,600
What else are there things that
they're always going to be?

389
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,520
What are they that are
always going [inaudible]

390
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,150
the the things that you were describing
need not always really case. Yes.

391
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,020
What would be the cases that the
fundamental governing equations,

392
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:33,021
the mathematical laws would be the
underlying architecture that governs what

393
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:37,650
happens in those places. But
environmental details can change things.

394
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,580
Absolutely. Really
dramatic mental details.

395
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,500
That's actually something you know at
some level right now, right on the moon,

396
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:45,840
you could jump a lot
higher than you can here.

397
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,730
So if you didn't get to two,
bodies do attract each other.

398
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,181
That's right.

399
00:24:51,181 --> 00:24:55,290
So there is a fundamental law of gravity
that manifests itself in different ways

400
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,890
based on the environment. All right, so
let me say that again or ask it again.

401
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,990
Are there fundamental laws yes.
That you think operate in all? Yes.

402
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:04,950
Yes, absolutely.

403
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,120
And why do you think that that is a
starting point when we come upon this

404
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:12,360
possibility of other universes?

405
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,460
It's not a crazy idea that we dream up
late at night when there's nothing else

406
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:18,294
to think about.

407
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,920
These are ideas that emerge from the
fundamental equations that we use to

408
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,400
describe the things that we
do see in the world around us,

409
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,350
and we follow the equations
and the equations suggest
to us there might be these

410
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:31,740
other universes, so we have equations,

411
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,550
we analyze them and we interpret what
they're telling us about reality,

412
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,180
but those are the very equations that
come to this possibility of other

413
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:42,690
universes. Then those are the equations
that govern those other universes.

414
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,830
The starting point is let's assume
that these are the fundamental awful,

415
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,470
why is God three in one or why did,

416
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,400
why does the, was the
world made in seven days?

417
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:57,690
I T it aren't we getting
close to some sort of a,

418
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,900
you're believing in certain things to
be always true the way religious people

419
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:03,430
believe. Certain things are always true,

420
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,510
not because you've seen it
or it just because you can't.

421
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,700
You have a faith in it.

422
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,030
I couldn't disagree with
you more. I thought, Nah,

423
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,060
it has absolutely
nothing to do with faith.

424
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,180
The reason why we trust the equations
is because we've got century's worth of

425
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:25,720
observational and experimental evidence
that the equations take us in the right

426
00:26:25,721 --> 00:26:27,460
direction here, here,

427
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,850
and it's those very same equations that
work here that we are following to their

428
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:37,120
logical conclusion to see where
the mathematics takes us. Right?

429
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:40,450
So if you remember the the train of
reasoning, he may have just projected

430
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,730
here into there. That's faith talking. No,

431
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,100
you can't go there. All
you can do is say, well,

432
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:52,101
what works with my deep understanding
of here has to be there.

433
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,720
I don't know why it has to be,
but that's what you just said.

434
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,660
No, it's actually the reasoning goes
to somewhat reverse order. From that,

435
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:03,070
we build mathematical
equations to describe here.

436
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,610
We then follow those equations
and say, Oh my goodness.

437
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,080
Those equations that we developed to
describe here are telling us that there is

438
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:14,890
something over there.
And then we're like, wow,

439
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,330
the equation to a great job of describing
things here and the equations have

440
00:27:19,331 --> 00:27:22,870
this feature that they tell us.
There's another place over there.

441
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,220
Maybe that's possible.
The key thing on logic

442
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,240
in your mind. Oh, this is,
this is not belief [inaudible].

443
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,820
This is just logic.

444
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,660
Aren't you worried though that there's
another Brian Green in university number

445
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:38,500
three thousand seven hundred and ninety
million two hundred and eight 600 and

446
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:42,380
thousand 40 and five who is sitting here
talking to another radio reporter in

447
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:44,900
another university? Anything? Well,

448
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:49,901
we know all about the other universities
because we're assuming that the math

449
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:54,200
here is the same as the math
there in that other place,

450
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,930
but as it turns out, they're
math and aren't the same,

451
00:27:56,931 --> 00:28:01,190
so they will not they that is
that. You may just be wrong. Oh,

452
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,670
that's always the possible. In fact,
it's likely the possibility. In fact,

453
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:08,270
99.99% of everything we do is wrong.

454
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,100
Not from the point of
view we make a mistake,

455
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:14,570
but is Reuters is a deep wrong is that
you somehow are or somehow feeling that

456
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:18,980
the math is a clue that
everything follows your math.

457
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,700
If at some point the maths collide
and then the universe is collide,

458
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,430
then that would be very
unsettling to both of you.

459
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:29,400
I would assume in terms of whether
the math is him, I'll contradictory

460
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,580
[inaudible] your tools of
learning are not working.

461
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,920
That would suggest that we were both wrong
and that there's a deeper overarching

462
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:43,100
framework. I mean, I, I
hate to use the word faith,

463
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,350
but the one point where
I'll give you faith is this.

464
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,510
I do have a deep faith that the universe
is coherent and by universe call it

465
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,180
multiverse, whatever word you
want to use, the whole thing.

466
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,300
I do believe that it's coherent. Now,

467
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,420
whether that means it follows
mathematical laws. I don't know.

468
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,580
It could be the case that, you know,

469
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,720
when we talked to those aliens that we
encounter one day and they say, okay,

470
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:06,560
show us what you got.

471
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:09,080
We bring out our equations and they
kind of laugh at us and say, Oh,

472
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:13,430
you guys are still stuck on math, you
know? And they said, yeah, you know,

473
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,890
1,010 thousand years ago
we were doing math too.

474
00:29:15,891 --> 00:29:19,250
But here's the real way of describing
it. Now what they be showing us,

475
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,260
what the real way of
describing it. I have no idea.

476
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:25,190
I can't even imagine what it would
be that would be non mathematical.

477
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,980
So I do have a deep
faith that it's coherent.

478
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,160
And the only tool that I
know how to encapsulate that
coherence are mathematical

479
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:36,500
equations. So if Zan tar,

480
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:41,501
Brian and Brian here come
up with equations that Cole
allied with another and

481
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:42,190
don't

482
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,000
work,

483
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,900
to me it just means that both were wrong
and there's some bigger overarching

484
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:51,070
coherence that we've
yet to find. That's it.

485
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,870
[inaudible]

486
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,440
I don't even, I can't even begin
to figure out if you did you just,

487
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,690
when did you lose? I
can't tell what, wait.

488
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:05,360
So this whole came from Alan
lightens article. Right?

489
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,080
So do you think he beat the objections
in the article? Did he beat the article?

490
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:13,050
Well, I thought it would be fair to
ask the author of the article. So I,

491
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,870
I called Allen. Yup. What happened is it
turns out to be in non Penn, Cambodia.

492
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,800
I, I make all my international calls on

493
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,280
and I, I sent him the interview
with Brian. He listened

494
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,670
good. I listened to,

495
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,410
and I asked, well, what do you
think about Brian's uh, argument?

496
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,770
Well, I, I don't think that he's wrong,

497
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,250
but I think that the problem
is philosophically more
disturbing than what he is

498
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,284
confessing.

499
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,801
He said, well,

500
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:45,570
I think it's going to be much harder
than Brian things to actually sense or

501
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:49,800
encounter or measure these other
universe if they exist at all.

502
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,980
We don't even know whether the outer
universe is exist in the same space and

503
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:55,120
time that we do.

504
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,330
And there are other physicists who
feel that the universes are even in

505
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:05,950
principle, never, never observable by us,

506
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,980
that we will never be able to have any
physical evidence of their existence.

507
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,600
And that possibility is
what I find disturbing.

508
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,250
[inaudible]

509
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,770
it may be that this is the way nature is.

510
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,940
What does that mean?

511
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,860
Well, I mean it may be that,

512
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,450
that we've done as much
explaining as as possible

513
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,020
[inaudible]

514
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,500
and that we will never ever
really understand everything.

515
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,580
Yes. And others we may be,

516
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:43,610
we may have pushed the human mind
if as far as it can possibly go.

517
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,430
[inaudible] [inaudible]

518
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,870
so, uh, is that everything I
think we can say about everything.

519
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,920
I think that's everything. All
right. Okay. Oh, we should go over.

520
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,670
Thank Brian Green professor of physics
and math at Columbia University.

521
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,810
Alan Lightman up at MIT who's essay, uh,

522
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,840
the accidental universe will appear in
a book of the same name coming out this

523
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,000
fall. So if you want to read the essay,
either you buy it in book form soon.

524
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,130
Thanks also to Jenny
Hollowell of course. Uh,

525
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,790
will link you to her short story from
our website, radiolab.org and meantime,

526
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,590
we'll just say goodbye. Bye Bye.
