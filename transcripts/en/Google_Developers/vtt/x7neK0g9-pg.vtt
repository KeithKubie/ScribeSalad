Ralf Knoesel: At VectorUnit,
we make video games.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.667
So, our background is
in console games,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.667
so that the last game we made
was a game for Xbox Live Arcade.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.333
And now, earlier this year,
we basically figured out,

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.625
"OK. Where's the console
space headed?"

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:18.333
And we're seeing tablets and phones.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.167
It's kind of moving into that space.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.167
And so, we, we thought this was a pretty
good time for us to make the mobile game.

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:26.250
And the Android platform seemed like
a really good opportunity for that.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.917
So basically, what we're able
to do this year

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:30.083
that would've been impossible
about a year ago,

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.792
is we're taking our engine,
which is a console engine,

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:35.417
which runs on C, C++, 

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:38.708
and we're able to pretty much port it
straight over to the Android platform,

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:40.250
using the native STK.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.708
And so the game we're showing
today is called Riptide GP.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:46.083
It's basically what we consider
sort of a console-quality game

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.625
running on a mobile device.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:48.125
And so, yeah.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.042
We're able to get all these effects
and great-looking art assets,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.708
onto the platform using the Google Tools.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:57.583
A lot of people, I think, shy away
from the mobile platforms

00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:00.625
because the assumption is
there's so little power there

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:02.917
and it's also really hard to do TOCOAN on it.

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:04.208
But from our perspective, 

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:07.667
it only took us about two to three weeks
to take our console-quality engine

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.958
and get it up and running on,

00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.208
on the Android platform.

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:15.583
And so, right now we're placing a foundation
and we definitely see it in the next year or two.

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:16.625
It's not gonna slow down.

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:19.542
We think it's gonna accelerate,
the number of devices out there.

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:21.458
So, we think with the Android platform

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:24.583
we'll definitely be able to reach
the most number of consumers.
