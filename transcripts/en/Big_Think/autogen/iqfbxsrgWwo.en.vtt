but even adults don't have a tolerance

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
but even adults don't have a tolerance
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.049
but even adults don't have a tolerance
for boredom at all you know there's some

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059
for boredom at all you know there's some
 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.390
for boredom at all you know there's some
research looking at how how our

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
research looking at how how our
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.279
research looking at how how our
attention spans have changed across time

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
attention spans have changed across time
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.720
attention spans have changed across time
there's some evidence that they've

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
there's some evidence that they've
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.170
there's some evidence that they've
shrunk by about 33 percent since the you

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180
shrunk by about 33 percent since the you
 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.580
shrunk by about 33 percent since the you
2001 reason for that is because we

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
2001 reason for that is because we
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.380
2001 reason for that is because we
interact with devices so much of the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
interact with devices so much of the
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750
interact with devices so much of the
time and they don't demand anything of

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
time and they don't demand anything of
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.080
time and they don't demand anything of
you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
you

they are deliverers they bring things to
you you don't need an attention span if

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
you you don't need an attention span if
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.560
you you don't need an attention span if
you're reading a book if you have a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
you're reading a book if you have a
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.389
you're reading a book if you have a
lapse in attention for even a couple of

lapse in attention for even a couple of

really been paying attention for the

really been paying attention for the
last half a page that's a problem and

last half a page that's a problem and
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.160
last half a page that's a problem and
you have to return back to where you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
you have to return back to where you
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.580
you have to return back to where you
were

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860
phones they are constantly competing for
our attention every app every social

you encounter on a smartphone is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
you encounter on a smartphone is
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.709
you encounter on a smartphone is
designed to give you what you need they

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
designed to give you what you need they
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360
designed to give you what you need they
are competing for you instead of you're

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
are competing for you instead of you're
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.099
are competing for you instead of you're
competing for whatever else is going on

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
competing for whatever else is going on
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.900
competing for whatever else is going on
in the world and what that means is you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
in the world and what that means is you
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.219
in the world and what that means is you
don't need to have much of an attention

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
don't need to have much of an attention
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.910
don't need to have much of an attention
span and we've seen this in a lot of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
span and we've seen this in a lot of
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890
span and we've seen this in a lot of
different respect even beyond smart

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
different respect even beyond smart
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.359
different respect even beyond smart
phones of themselves the way we interact

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
phones of themselves the way we interact
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.170
phones of themselves the way we interact
with email for example that when we get

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
with email for example that when we get
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.999
with email for example that when we get
an email it in the office place in the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
an email it in the office place in the
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700
an email it in the office place in the
workplace it takes us on average about

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
workplace it takes us on average about
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620
workplace it takes us on average about
six seconds to check that email and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
six seconds to check that email and
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.260
six seconds to check that email and
every time you check an email you spend

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
every time you check an email you spend
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300
every time you check an email you spend
25 minutes getting back to the zone of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
25 minutes getting back to the zone of
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010
25 minutes getting back to the zone of
engagement you were in before you check

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
engagement you were in before you check
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230
engagement you were in before you check
the email and so what's happening here

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
the email and so what's happening here
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149
the email and so what's happening here
is we just don't have much attention for

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
is we just don't have much attention for
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.230
is we just don't have much attention for
the things that we're doing because

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
the things that we're doing because
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.460
the things that we're doing because
they're constantly distracted we're

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
they're constantly distracted we're
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560
they're constantly distracted we're
pulled away to do things like check

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
pulled away to do things like check
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780
pulled away to do things like check
emails quickly refresh a Twitter feed

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
emails quickly refresh a Twitter feed
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.990
emails quickly refresh a Twitter feed
and Instagram feed and so on and as a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
and Instagram feed and so on and as a
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149
and Instagram feed and so on and as a
result we we really don't need an

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
result we we really don't need an
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.499
result we we really don't need an
attention span we don't need to be as

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
attention span we don't need to be as
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.910
attention span we don't need to be as
engaged as we used to and we can still

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
engaged as we used to and we can still
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.630
engaged as we used to and we can still
get through get by in the world I think

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
get through get by in the world I think
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520
get through get by in the world I think
we have a lot to be worried about with

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
we have a lot to be worried about with
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800
we have a lot to be worried about with
respect to the evolution of tech and the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
respect to the evolution of tech and the
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690
respect to the evolution of tech and the
way it engages us we are far more

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
way it engages us we are far more
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.670
way it engages us we are far more
engaged with tech today than we were 10

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
engaged with tech today than we were 10
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.440
engaged with tech today than we were 10
years ago and when we look back 10 years

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
years ago and when we look back 10 years
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.120
years ago and when we look back 10 years
from now I think we're going to look at

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
from now I think we're going to look at
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490
from now I think we're going to look at
Facebook Instagram Twitter as relics and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
Facebook Instagram Twitter as relics and
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770
Facebook Instagram Twitter as relics and
as primitive relics to be totally honest

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
as primitive relics to be totally honest
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540
as primitive relics to be totally honest
I think the degree of engagement will

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
I think the degree of engagement will
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.710
I think the degree of engagement will
have with things like virtual reality

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
have with things like virtual reality
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.380
have with things like virtual reality
tech and virtual reality platforms will

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
tech and virtual reality platforms will
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.520
tech and virtual reality platforms will
far exceed anything

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
far exceed anything
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.410
far exceed anything
you see now you know if I'm sitting with

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
you see now you know if I'm sitting with
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.610
you see now you know if I'm sitting with
you at a table and we're having a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
you at a table and we're having a
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.710
you at a table and we're having a
conversation and there's a phone upside

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720
conversation and there's a phone upside
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.410
conversation and there's a phone upside
down on the table next to us just for

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
down on the table next to us just for
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.670
down on the table next to us just for
the presence of that phone the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
the presence of that phone the
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.260
the presence of that phone the
connection we form between us will be

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
connection we form between us will be
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.199
connection we form between us will be
diminished and if the phone can do that

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
diminished and if the phone can do that
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.940
diminished and if the phone can do that
turned upside down because of all the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
turned upside down because of all the
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.229
turned upside down because of all the
things that it implies that there's a

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239
things that it implies that there's a
 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.130
things that it implies that there's a
whole world out there

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
whole world out there
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.500
whole world out there
imagine when at any moment in time you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
imagine when at any moment in time you
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.880
imagine when at any moment in time you
have to choose between the real world

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
have to choose between the real world
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.340
have to choose between the real world
with all its messiness with all its

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350
with all its messiness with all its
 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.050
with all its messiness with all its
complexity with all its imperfections

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
complexity with all its imperfections
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.690
complexity with all its imperfections
and this perfect virtual world when

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
and this perfect virtual world when
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.120
and this perfect virtual world when
virtual reality tech is is really

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
virtual reality tech is is really
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.530
virtual reality tech is is really
advanced and you can basically go

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
advanced and you can basically go
 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.180
advanced and you can basically go
anywhere at any time to speak to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
anywhere at any time to speak to
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.890
anywhere at any time to speak to
whomever you like it's going to be

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900
whomever you like it's going to be
 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.570
whomever you like it's going to be
really hard to resist the desire to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580
really hard to resist the desire to
 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.979
really hard to resist the desire to
leave the real world the here and now

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989
leave the real world the here and now
 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.670
leave the real world the here and now
the world that's social and and stop

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
the world that's social and and stop
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.259
the world that's social and and stop
yourself from always retreating to that

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
yourself from always retreating to that
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.970
yourself from always retreating to that
virtual world so I do think there's a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
virtual world so I do think there's a
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.130
virtual world so I do think there's a
big concern I also think it's a concern

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
big concern I also think it's a concern
 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.720

the way we communicate as a species will
 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.590
the way we communicate as a species will
change and I'm especially concerned

about that for kids so there are certain

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810
about that for kids so there are certain
 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.260
about that for kids so there are certain
critical periods in child development

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270
critical periods in child development
 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.930
critical periods in child development
where where kids basically acquire the

their lives and what they need to do is
 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.779
their lives and what they need to do is
they need a lot of feedback pretty rapid

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789
they need a lot of feedback pretty rapid
 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.270
they need a lot of feedback pretty rapid
high fidelity feedback if I'm a child

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280
high fidelity feedback if I'm a child
 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.159
high fidelity feedback if I'm a child
and I take a toy from another child I

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169
and I take a toy from another child I
 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.140
and I take a toy from another child I
need to see what that does to that other

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150
need to see what that does to that other
 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.940

so I learned that's not the right way to

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889
so I learned that's not the right way to
 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.139
so I learned that's not the right way to
do things but if I'm interacting mainly

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:47.149
do things but if I'm interacting mainly
 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:48.700

through screens I don't get that rapid

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710
through screens I don't get that rapid
 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.409
through screens I don't get that rapid
feedback and so I never really honed the

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419
feedback and so I never really honed the
 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:51.639
feedback and so I never really honed the
skills that I'm going to need when I

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:51.649
skills that I'm going to need when I
 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:53.230
skills that I'm going to need when I
deal with people face to face in the

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240
deal with people face to face in the
 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.029
deal with people face to face in the
real world and I think that's a big

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039
real world and I think that's a big
 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.439
real world and I think that's a big
concern because if you take the whole

screen generation on mass the kids who
 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.570
screen generation on mass the kids who
are born today I think a lot of them
