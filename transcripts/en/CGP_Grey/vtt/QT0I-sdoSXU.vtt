00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.560
Queen Lion of the animal kingdom is looking
to improve her democracy. She recently allowed

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.930
citizens to elect representatives to the Jungle
Council which governs the kingdom.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.960
However, she recognizes that her citizens
are not happy with the voting system. Let’s

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.720
watch an election on one of the small islands
of her Kingdom to see why:

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.410
On this island there are three political parties:
the two big ones: Kea and Tuatara, and a small

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.419
third party, Kakapo.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.400
On election day, the citizens each cast one
vote for a local candidate they want to represent

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.019
the range they live in. The results are as
follows:

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.650
With the average across the island that Tuatara
gets 49%, Kea gets 48% and Kakapo gets 3%.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.460
The election is run using First Past the Post,
meaning that candidate with the most votes

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.820
wins. Because Tuatara got the most votes in
each range, they get to control 100% of the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.820
seats on the council.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.660
And this is why so many citizens are unhappy.
The majority of them, the 51% who voted for

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.450
other parties, get no representation on the
council at all.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.810
This seems unfair to Queen Lion but she’s
not sure how to fix it. The citizens like

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.750
having local representatives and don’t want
to change the range boundaries.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.640
But luckily Kiwi, one of the citizens of this
island, has a suggestion for Queen Lion on

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.650
how she can make the system better while keeping
local representation and leaving the ranges

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.650
as they are.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.100
The idea is called Mixed Member Proportional
or MMP and it makes two changes: the number

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.560
of seats on the council is doubled and each
citizen gets two votes, not one.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.409
Here’s how it works:

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.299
At first, election day for Kiwi is just the
same as before.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.619
He gets a list of candidates running to represent
his local range on the council. Kiwi picks

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249
one and the winner will be the candidate with
the most votes.

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:39.150
So far the system is no better – Tuatara
again wins all the local elections and still

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.069
more than half of the citizens don’t have
any representation. But here’s how Kiwi’s

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.100
second vote – and those extra seats on the
council – fix this.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.689
Kiwi uses his second vote to pick his favorite
political party.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.109
These second votes are tallied up and show
the percentage of support that each of the

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.341
political parties has among the citizens as
a whole and reveals how imbalanced the council

00:01:57.341 --> 00:01:58.341
is so far.

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.869
To fix this imbalance, members of the political
parties are added, one at a time, to make

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.079
the council more proportional.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.880
Tuatara is the most over-represented and Kea
the most underrepresented, so Kea gets the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.619
first empty seat.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.319
This continues, adding one Kea at a time until
both Turatara and Kea are over-represented

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.819
and Kakapo is under-represented, so they get
the final seat.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.620
Now, the jungle council represents, as close
as possible, the actual preferences of the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.519
citizens – which is a huge improvement over
the old, first past the post method.

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.170
There is, however, one interesting question
that should arise at this point:

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.400
Exactly who decides which members of the parties
get those extra seats?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.709
The way it works is that, before the election,
the political parties make a list of their

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.970
favorite candidates in the order that they
want them to get on the council.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.120
So, if there is only get one extra seat, the
name at the top of their list is chosen. If

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840
they get two seats, the first two are chosen,
and so on.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.220
This makes MMP a bit different from other
voting methods in that it makes political

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.390
parties an official part of the way the election
works.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.810
This may give the party leaders greater control
over their members because they can reward

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.700
or punish their actions by changing their
placement on the party list.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.459
While this may be a disadvantage of MMP there
are a number of other benefits that Queen

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.840
Lion, in particular, likes.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.500
Because fewer votes are wasted, it mostly
Eliminates Gerrymandering and prevents minority

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
rule.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.250
It also gives more choice to the citizens
by encouraging political diversity.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.200
This point is worth expanding on.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.150
Notice how, with MMP, the percentage of votes
for the local representatives isn’t the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.409
same as for the parties. This is because in
the local elections, citizens have to vote

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.709
strategically.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.159
For example, Kakapo voters don’t like Tuatara
at all, but they can tolerate Kea. Since there

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.930
are so few Kakapo voters they know that their
candidate doesn’t have a chance of winning

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.670
the local election, so it’s really a race
between the two big parties. Thus many of

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.359
the Kakapo will vote Kea in the hope that
he might win and be their representative.

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.569
However, when it comes to voting for their
favorite political party, this strategy doesn’t

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.930
matter. The more votes a party gets the more
representatives it has on the council.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.810
So citizens are free to vote for smaller parties
they like like knowing that every vote counts.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.340
Queen Lion reviews her options and decides
to switch her Kingdom to MMP. Now, for the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:28.939
first time, the Jungle Council is a true reflection
of what her citizens want.
