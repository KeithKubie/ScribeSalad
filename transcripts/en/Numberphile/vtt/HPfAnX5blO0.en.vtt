SIMON PAMPENA: This is really exciting,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.460
I posted something on Twitter a while ago

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.800
about a really crazy number

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.440
with a lot of digits that are all the same

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.220
and it got a really huge response.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.580
I just want to share with you,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.300
my experience with this number.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.640
Let me draw the number for you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.540
Here we go

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.660
Here we go

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.680
Here we go

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.660
And in the words of Andrew Wiles

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.080
"I think I'll stop there"

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.320
This number here

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.300
All nines. You can see it. In actual fact,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.160
the way that you'd describe this is as a repdigit.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.140
So, in the maths canon you'd say repdigit, meaning "repeated digit".

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.060
But what's special about this

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.360
There's two things really special about this number

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.720
is that here

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.280
down here, there's one digit that's changed

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.580
BRADY HARAN: So, it's not a repdigit?

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.420
SIMON: It's called a near repdigit

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.200
So, it's just really close

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320
But you know what I like to call it, Brady?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.240
I like to call it a glitch.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.720
I feel like it's a glitch,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.820
because it's not only a glitch number.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.120
Believe it or not, this is a prime number.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.440
This here, I posted this on Twitter

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.080
It really got people going

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.160
You know what I thought, Brady?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.020
I thought

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.940
Am I sure I haven't made a mistake?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.300
I'd really like to check this number,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.180
you know?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.860
As a mathematician, that's what you wanna do, you want to check it.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.200
The only problem is: how do you check a number like this?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.020
I- I really don't suggest you stick this into the Google entry line.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.380
To actually work out if it was a prime or not,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.640
I actually needed to "compactify" it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.640
I mean, I needed to actually go

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.940
I needed to actually transform it into something that I could carry around

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.360
So, this number has 506 digits

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.160
The 8 here, if you count from the bottom

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.980
From the ones column, and the tens column, and the hundreds column

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.320
If you get up, you actually get to the 254th column

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.220
So, it's actually 254 along

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.240
So, it's just over halfway

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.900
How can we actually transport this in a way that doesn't involve me writing out all these nines?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.940
Any ideas?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.360
What's really cool about it is the fact that they are nines.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.840
So, if you add 1 to 9,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.440
you get a ten.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.800
And, if you add 1 to 99,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.760
you get a hundred.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.160
And, if you add 1 to 999, you get a thousand.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.620
So, we can actually use that fact,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.180
because, if we can actually get this as

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.020
something to the power of 10,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.180
well, that can really make things a lot easier for us to handle.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.100
So, if we think about it, right

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.940
this has 506 nines.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.660
So, if we say 10

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.440
take 1 is 9,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.660
10 squared take 1 -- which is 100

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.120
take 1 -- is 99.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.040
And, 10 cubed which is,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.980
three zeros there, take 1, is 999.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.440
Then, if we go, dot, dot, dot...

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.820
-- You gotta love the dot-dot-dots, because you can put anything in dot-dot-dots --

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.960
we can then say

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:32.360
10 to the 506 take 1

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.220
is equal to... -let's just jump to the chase, hey, Brady?-

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.440
... is equal to nine-nine-nine, dot-dot-dot,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.940
nine-nine-nine, where this

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.120
happens to be

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.720
506 digits.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.880
So, that's kind of that, except for that

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.600
BRADY: I know that's a small change, but that actually changes the value of the number quite a lot, doesn't it?

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.520
SIMON: What do you mean, "changes the value"?

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.460
BRADY: The quantity, like, if you were going to buy that many eggs...

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.560
SIMON: [laughs] You wanna put this into eggs?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.960
BRADY: ...changing that from an 8 --

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.120
Changing that from a 9 to an 8 will dramatically change the number of eggs you just bought.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.120
SIMON: Well, you know what? You're exactly right,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.220
and to actually work out by how much,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.700
you're actually solving the problem.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.740
9 take 8... is 1.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.280
90 take 80, that's 10.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.100
900 take 800 is 100.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.100
Can you see the pattern going on here?

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.840
So, if we actually think there's a 9 right there,

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.800
in the 254th position...

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.300
So what would that mean? That means that we're actually taking away 1,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.960
with this many zeros.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.900
So, we gotta imagine there's a 1 here,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.560
for every 9 there's basically a 0, because that's continuing what's going on here.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.560
So now what we're doing is we go 10

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.420
to the 506 take one

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.300
gives us this sea of 9s, then we just want to take 1

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.760
with a bunch of zeroes so we get it up to that point there. So we're basically taking away

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.040
10 to the 253.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760
So that's what that's equal to.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.620
So it's that take 1 to give us the 9s take that

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.000
To take one away from that spot.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.260
So yeah, I found a way to actually carry it around and talk to it. This is the way you talk about big numbers, big prime numbers to your friends.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.900
You don't go 99999999

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.060
Some sort of Ali G reference

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.840
99999999999

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.440
which is interesting. In actually fact, Ali G does this thing where he goes

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:48.180
"What's 9999999 take 9999989999" and he actually does this and I actually counted the number times he said 9s and 8s

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.280
8999999

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.780
and it's unbelievable, he's like 1 off

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.560
1 place off from actually having one of these glitch primes.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.520
That would have really made the nerds excited.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.320
So now we have a way to actually understand this number. Now we have

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.400
10 to the 506

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.920
take, and I'm just going to order it in terms of magnitude here, take that,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.600
Basically what you need to notice here, what's going on,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.500
is the fact that if you double 253 guess what you get?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.080
Two threes are six, two twenty-fives are - it's actually that number

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:40.640
So now we can actually find a structure. I'm going to put in a couple letters here to denote other things. I can make it even smaller if you check this out.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.820
Maybe not, because in actual fact for m

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820
don't you love mathematicians

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.940
This just makes it more complicated.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.880
So in  actual fact, it actually has this shape. So what happened next?

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.340
I started doing this at 9PM, I was still doing this at 6AM.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.360
I mean this is the hole I want to take you down.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:12.600
So now, what's really interesting is that if you learn about how to factorize polynomials or even factorize things because this is actually 10 m squared.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.600
take 10 m take 1

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.900
so you kind of get this taught at school. It actually has the shape of x squared take x take 1.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:28.840
So you actually think maybe I'm going to be able to work out a way to see when this is a prime or not

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.960
See this is what's amazing about these primes.Primes don't act that way.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.440
In actual fact, I needed to put this number into a database that would crunch it for me

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.440
and you wouldn't believe

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.600
there's only a small number of m's.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.980
which will actually give you this particularly shaped glitch prime.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.400
And they happen to be, for values of m

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.480
where m is equal to 1

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.480
6

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.640
9

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.100
154

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.140
253 hello

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.740
1114

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.860
and 1390

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.040
and that's as far as the database went. And I think that's probably as far as we know at this point

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:28.280
for this particular-.
So look at that! Think about how big this number is, how many values of m you can have and it's only for these numbers

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.920
that this will be prime, and that happens to be prime

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.780
What's cooler than just a glitch?
No glitch!
Well

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.880
Maybe

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.360
But maybe what happens if the glitch was right in the middle of the number?

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.100
So I actully looked into that as well. That's a different formula.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.560
So that formula then is, we're saying is 10 to the 2m

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.460
plus 1 take 10 m

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.560
take 1. It basically has to be an odd number of digits.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.960
Not an odd number, but in terms of the number of digits it has to be an odd number because it has to have a middle.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.280
So there are lots of different values for that but there's a really nice value. The first one that we can find is actually

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.680
m equals nine

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:18.380
so what it looks like is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.660
and nine

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.940
eight

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.220
and then

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:33.560
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.380
So it's nine 9s, 8, nine 9s.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.380
Come on. Swish!

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.060
See, I looked at this and I thought, "Glitch"

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.960
What are glitches, when we think glitches we think computers, we think binary.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.760
So really, where this took me to, is like I'm looking at glitch primes the wrong way, I should be looking at binary glitch primes.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:02.300
So I want to look at binary numbers. So in that fact, in that case, in looking at instead of 9s, I'm looking at one one one one... glitch... one one one one

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.500
and also let's just think about the coolest thing: a palindrome.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.480
And they've actually got a special name. They're called Cyclops numbers.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.240
So for example: 5 is 101.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.140
Cyclops because it's got a hole in the middle.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.880
But you've got lots of other Cyclops numbers. I mean I don't even have to work it out you can have like

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.180
two 1s and a 0 and two 1s.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.180
Whatever that is.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.360
Or you could have three 1s and a 0, three 1s.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.840
Or you could have like 4, and a 0 and 4.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.820
I mean this is getting-, I mean this is the sort of stuff you communicate with aliens about, you know what I mean?

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.560
5 is a prime. Are those other ones prime?

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.560
Well that was my question.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.940
I wanted to know if other ones could be prime.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.860
And this is really where my mind was blown.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:56.680
Because I then had to change the structure of this thing here, this 10

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.520
because it was base 10, but if we actually do it like this

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.800
Because then if it's 2m, because we're basically doing it in binary so it means we need to do it in power 2.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.980
Right. What that means is, this is unbelievable, I'm able to actually factorize this

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.060
into 2 m plus 1

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.040
plus 1

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.280
to 2

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.100
m take 1

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:33.640
So you're always able to do that because it's two. You can't do that with any other number higher than two.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.540
And this is a problem because, guess what?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.920
Primes, by definition,

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.180
don't have any factors.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.760
They don't have any factors. They'll only divisible by themselves and one.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.860
So if you actually turn this always into this

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:54.360
the only time this is not going to be a prime is when one of these things is equal to one.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.320
So this is getting added, it has to be 2m take 1 equals 1.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.520
So, that means it's 2m equals 2, oh come on, it's m equals 1.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.460
So that means it's uh, that means the only prime we have is

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.120
2 to the power 2 plus 1 -- 5.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:26.100
So, where this took me. Unbelievable. Morning. The sun's rising. And I realized, maybe I'm the first person to realize (not really but that's how I feel about maths)

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.580
that the only glitch prime you can have in binary is 101.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.360
We'd like thank Audible.com for their support of this Numberphile episode.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.000
If you know or enjoy a book or spoken material, Audible has everything you could wish for

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.460
They've got over 180,000 titles to choose from

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.360
and they're offering a 30 day free trial

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.360
when you sign up for the service

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:58.820
Now if you're in the mood for some more mathematics I can high recommend these books on the screen, including Alice's adventures in Numberland and the Mathematics of Love

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.060
both by people who appear in Numberphile videos.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:09.180
Or if all this talk of Cyclops has you excited why not go old school and listen to none other than the Odyssey by Homer

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.180
Not that homer.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.000
And if you do check out Audible, and I highly recommend I use Audible myself.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.240
Then use the URL audible.com/numberphile

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.780
That means if you do take them up on that free trile, the good people there will know you came from here.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:31.280
That's audible.com/numberphile and our sincere thanks to them for helping us make more numberphile videos.
