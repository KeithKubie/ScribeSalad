[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:07.430
AJ JACOBS: It's
great to be here.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.410
I'm delighted.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.310
And I'm going to talk
today about three

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.260
of my books-- so a
three for one deal.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.880
And as David mentioned, they
all have this common theme

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.170
of self-experimentation,
trying to improve by testing.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.990
And right before the
talk-- this is probably

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.440
not the way to start the talk.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.270
But I was in the bathroom,
and the sign over the urinal

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.920
had a little slogan,
testing rocks--

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.560
so all about testing your code.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.890
So I was like, I'm
in the right place.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.210
The first book I
thought I'd discuss

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.980
was "The Year of
Living Biblically,"

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.320
and this came about
because I grew up

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.180
with no religion at all.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.040
As I say in the
book, I'm Jewish,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.190
but I'm Jewish in the same way
the Olive Garden is Italian

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.140
so not very.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.610
But religion is such a
powerful force in society,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.080
and I wanted to
know more about it.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.540
Why are people attracted to it?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.740
And I also had a son.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.330
I wanted to know
what to teach him,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.102
so I decided I'm going
to learn about religion.

00:01:13.102 --> 00:01:14.560
I'm going to learn
about the Bible,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.350
and I'm going to try to learn
about it from the inside

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.800
out by living it, by
following in the footsteps

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.500
of our ancestors, and actually
follow as literally as possible

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.585
every single rule in the Bible.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:30.460
So that's what I did.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.060
I got a board of
spiritual advisors,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.600
so I got rabbis, and ministers,
and atheists, and scholars.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.840
And I bought a stack of
Bibles, and I read through.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.040
And I wrote down every
piece of advice, every rule

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.300
that I could find in the Bible.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.060
That turned out to
be quite a long list,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.510
over 700 rules and
pieces of advice.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.300
And I wanted to follow them
without picking and choosing.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.640
I said, I'm going to
go for it completely.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.950
So I wanted to follow the famous
ones like the 10 commandments.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.650
Love your neighbor,
that's a solid one.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.440
But I also wanted to follow
the less famous rules,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.410
the obscure ones, that
don't get a lot of press.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.340
The Bible says in Leviticus
that you should not

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.250
shave the corners of
your beard, and I didn't

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.960
know where the corners were.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.670
So I thought I would just
grow the whole thing,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.400
and that's what I
looked like at the end.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.830
As you can see, some
serious topiary hanging

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.210
from my chin and sort
of a Kaczynski vibe.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.990
And I did actually spend
quite a bit of time

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.000
at airport security.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.530
That is true.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.900
The Bible says that
you should not wear

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.060
clothes made of mixed fibers.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.650
That's in Leviticus too.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.840
And I thought it
seemed a little odd.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.060
It seemed a little like God
was micromanaging there,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.920
but I thought, I'm
going to follow it

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.150
because that's what it says.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.710
The Bible says in the Hebrew
scriptures-- many times,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.500
it says that you should stone
adulterers, and I thought, OK.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.360
I should at least try.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.580
And I was able to stone one.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.630
I'll just give you an example.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.416
It was in the
middle of the year,

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:18.790
and I was really
getting into it.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.940
So I had--

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.950
I was wearing the robe and
the sandals as you can see.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.620
The sheep, that I didn't have.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.440
That was a rental sheep
just for the photo--

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.760
but everything else.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.340
And I was in the park
here in New York,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.299
and this man came up to me.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.090
And he said, why are
you dressed like that?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.190
And I explained, I'm trying to
follow every rule in the Bible

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.890
from the 10 commandments
to stoning adulterers.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.050
And he said, well,
I'm an adulterer.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.400
Are you going to stone me?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.525
And I said, well, that
would be fantastic.

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:53.080
I said, thank you
for this offer.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.930
And I took out a
handful of stones

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.020
that I had been carrying
around in my pocket for just

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.090
this opportunity,
and they were small.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.960
They were pebbles.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.980
So I showed it to him, and I
said, you know, it's not big.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.440
He was very aggressive.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.920
He grabbed the stones out of my
hand and threw them at my face,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.320
so I thought an eye for an
eye is also in the Bible.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.470
And I threw one back at him.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.600
So that's how I
checked it off list.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.720
Now at the end of the
year, I put down my stones.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.180
I shaved my beard.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.790
But I will say that there were
some life-changing insights I

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.600
got from this and
some takeaways,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.080
and there are dozens of them.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.150
But I'll just give you a couple.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.400
One is the idea of gratitude,
because the Bible says

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.080
that you should be thankful.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.040
So I took this literally,
and I was like,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.140
I'm going to be
thankful for everything.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.960
So I would press
the elevator button.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.760
I'd be thankful
the elevator came.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.840
I'd get in the elevator.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.210
I'd be thankful it didn't
plummet to the basement

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.440
and break my collarbone.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.250
So this is hundreds of times
a day I was being thankful,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.900
and it was a
strange way to live.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.930
But it was also wonderful,
because it really emphasized

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.150
the fact that hundreds of
things go right every day

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.240
that we take for granted, and
we focus on the three or four

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.250
that go wrong, or
at least I did.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.600
So it's a radical
shift in perspective,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.550
and actually it
inspired my next book

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.400
which I just finished
writing yesterday,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.900
only eight months late.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.020
So I'm proud of myself for that.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.690
And that book, the
premise is I take

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.930
one of my great joys, my
morning cup of coffee,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.070
and I try to thank every single
person who made it possible--

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.420
so the barista of course.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.300
But I flew to South
America, and I thanked

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.800
the people who grew the beans--

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.205
you know, the people who--

00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:46.830
the truck driver, the people who
made the truck, the people who

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.663
made the steel for the
truck, the people who

00:05:48.663 --> 00:05:50.150
got the iron to make the steel.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.270
And as David and I were talking
about, it's exponential.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.830
So the idea is
there are thousands

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.180
of people that contribute
to every little thing we do,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.820
and we take it for granted.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.950
So it's, again,
about connection.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.640
The second lesson
from this Bible book

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.920
was the power of action,
the power of behavior

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.900
to shape your thoughts.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.610
There's a great quote
from the founder

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.820
of Habitat for Humanity.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.900
He says, "it's easier
to act your way

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.450
into a new way of thinking
than to think your way

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.760
into a new way of acting."

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.835
It's sort of basic cognitive
behavioral psychology.

00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:31.910
You act as if you're happy
or act as if you're kind,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.270
and eventually your
mind will catch up.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.490
For instance, compassion,
it's not an emotion

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.510
that comes naturally to me.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.920
I have some but not
very strong, so I

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.390
had to build it up for this.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.960
So I would-- my friend
was in the hospital.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.970
I hate hospitals.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.530
I didn't want to
go, but I was like,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.730
what would a good person do?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.377
What would a good friend do?

00:06:56.377 --> 00:06:56.960
They would go.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.400
So I forced myself to
visit the hospital,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.520
and it tricked my mind.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.880
I was like, oh, I'm in
the hospital visiting

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.900
a sick friend.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.540
I must be quite compassionate.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.610
And my mind-- you
do that enough,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.900
and your mind catches up.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.500
It's sort of the fake it
till you become it idea.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.310
And then the final
takeaway I'll mention today

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:26.690
is the absurdity and delusion
of fundamentalist thinking,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.300
because part of the
motivation for this book

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.230
was to expose the
absurdity of fundamentalism

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.050
by becoming the
ultimate fundamentalist

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.900
and taking the
Bible at its word.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.800
Because I do find it disturbing
that, by some measure,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.760
40% of America, millions
and millions of people,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.590
say they take the
Bible literally,

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.740
and that's why they believe
homosexuality is a sin.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.920
That's why they believe the
Earth is 5,000 years old.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.560
I mean, this is a tremendous
number of Americans.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.710
And it seemed to me they were
taking parts of the Bible

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.130
literally, but they
were very selective.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.170
They were cherry picking,
and they were not

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.400
taking the bible literally.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.370
They were not wearing--

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.070
avoiding clothes
made of mixed fibers.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.840
So I wanted to show that if you
do take the Bible completely

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.550
literally, then you're going
to act like a crazy person,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.980
and it is not a good idea.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.490
And that we all have to
acknowledge that when

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.440
we engage in ancient
texts like this

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.950
that we are picking
and choosing,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.710
and we are doing
cafeteria style religion.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.350
We are cherry picking,
and that, listen--

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.150
that's fine if you pick
the right cherries.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.580
If you pick the cherries
of compassion and loving

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.130
your neighbor, great,
but you can also

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.910
pick the rotten
cherries of hating

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.320
those who are not like you.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.900
The second book I'll talk
about today was about--

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.180
was called "Drop Dead Healthy."

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.560
And so, this was not my spirit.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.180
This was about the body.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.540
And this came about
because for most of my life

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.770
I've been in terrible shape.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.480
So I was what you call--

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.400
I wasn't traditionally fat.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.247
I was sort of skinny fat,
so I looked like a snake

00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:17.330
that had swallowed a goat.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.580
And I got sick all the time
like, literally, every week.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.190
And my wife said,
you know, I don't

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.900
want to be a widow in my 40s.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.220
You've got to get in shape.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.550
So I decided to do what
I did for the Bible book,

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.630
and I was going to test
out every single piece

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.550
of medical advice I could find.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.580
I got a board of
medical advisors--

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.520
doctors, nutritionist,
trainers, geneticists.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.190
And I wrote down every piece
of advice I could find--

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.010
again, even longer than
the Bible-- hundreds

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.560
of pieces of advice.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.010
And from the next--

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.980
it was supposed to be a year,
but I was such a fixer upper,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.150
it took at least two years.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.090
So for the next two
years, I tried everything,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.470
and it consumed my life.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.200
Because if you're trying to
follow every piece of advice,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.370
like there's no time.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.410
You can't have a job.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.940
You guys have to quit
Google, because there's

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.670
aerobic exercise,
anaerobic exercise,

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.060
you've got to
meditate every day.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.070
There's huge evidence on
the benefits of meditation.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.770
You should probably pet dogs.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.160
There are some solid studies
that that reduces hypertension.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.170
I didn't have a dog
at the time, so I

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.310
would go to the local dog park
and pet strangers' dogs which

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.030
was received with
mixed reactions

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.300
both from the owners and dogs.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.730
You have to put on sunscreen.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.820
If you follow the American
Dermatologist Association

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.350
recommendations, you should be
putting on sunscreen every two

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.580
hours, and you should
be putting on a shot

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.770
glass full of sunscreen.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.270
That's like, my entire
salary would go to sunscreen.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.440
You've got to prepare food.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.140
We all know processed
food is terrible for you.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.870
You've got to eat
food, and if you

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.240
follow some
recommendations, you should

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.820
take a long time
eating food, because we

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.620
are a nation of under chewers--

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.210
that we just wolf down our
food, and the danger of that

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.150
is that we'll over--

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.370
it's a sort of an
excuse to overeat.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.990
Because as you
might have heard, it

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.220
takes 20 minutes for our stomach
to tell the brain that we're

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.950
full, so if you are
scarfing food down,

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.590
it doesn't have time
to send the message.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.750
And you guys need to
redesign the human body.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:40.040
That is-- it's got
some real problems.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.550
So anyway, you should chew.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.940
And I actually-- I found this
group, they are like hard core.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.912
They call their
movement, Chewdaism.

00:11:48.912 --> 00:11:50.620
I didn't make that
up, so don't blame me,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.580
but they say you should
chew 100 times per mouthful.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.900
So I tried this.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.400
I mean, it's insane.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.070
It's like it takes a day and
a half to eat a sandwich,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.050
and I don't recommend it.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.630
But I do think there is
some wisdom to chewing

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.540
more and slowing down our food.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.080
Since I was a human guinea
pig, I tried everything.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.100
I tested everything.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.840
I tested-- I took a
sleep test, of course--

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.390
didn't get a great night's
sleep that night shockingly.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.740
I tried every workout I
could find, including the--

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.300
this is the cave man workout.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.150
The whole paleo thing
was just taking off,

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.090
so we went to Central
Park and threw boulders

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.210
and climbed trees.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.530
And oh, I wrote the book
of course on a treadmill,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.594
so it took me about--

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:41.260
I think it was--

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.640
I think it was about 2,500
miles about to, like, Arizona

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.070
or somewhere around there.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.770
In the end, again, I did
not adopt everything.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.210
I don't crawl around naked
in the woods anymore.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.080
But again, as always
with my experiments,

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.980
I hope there is some takeaway,
some life-changing takeaway.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:09.130
And for this one, to me,
the best health advice

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.410
is almost the simplest
health advice.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.050
I mean, it is so
basic that it can

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.460
be summed up in a paragraph.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.250
Like, most health books
should just be a paragraph.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.810
And it's stuff you all know.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.570
It's like, move more, eat less--

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:28.060
eat good food, real
food, not processed food.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.386
Do the, you know--

00:13:32.386 --> 00:13:34.240
don't smoke.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.480
Don't hit yourself in
the head with an ax.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.700
Like, it's very basic stuff.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.790
There is some evidence for high
intensity interval training,

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.110
so if you're into that, do that.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.380
But it's really quite
basic, and we all know it.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.810
And the mystery to me is
why we don't act healthily

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.750
when we all know what
acting healthily is,

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.480
and that, to me, is
where you can find

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.750
some interesting insights in
how to motivate yourself--

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.860
how to sort of engineer
yourself to be more healthy.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.610
And there were several
interesting strategies.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.370
I'll just give you
one that works for me,

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.740
and that is it's this
idea of egonomics.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.110
That's a term coined by
a Yale professor, who

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.950
talks about how we all
have two selves at least.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.800
We have our present self who
wants to just hang out and eat

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.930
Cheetos on the couch,
and then you've

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.980
got your future self who
wants that present self

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.390
to get on a treadmill
or eat some salad.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.500
So we've got these two
selves that are in conflict.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.100
And one of the keys to
making better decisions

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.740
in every part of our life is to
try to remember our older self.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.430
And I think of my older
self as some other person

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.930
that I want to treat well.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.510
I want to treat that person
like I would treat a friend,

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.642
and you can do this visually.

00:15:01.642 --> 00:15:03.100
And actually, you
guys can help me.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.330
Because I did find some
digital aging software,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.640
but it's not great.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.760
So if you guys
have better ones--

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.060
so I printed that out,
and I put it over my desk.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.850
And it does inspire
me sometimes.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.950
I'll look at it, and I'll
be like, you know what?

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.610
I'm going to do this for
the older version of me, who

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.130
I want that guy to be around
to see my kids grow up

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.660
and, you know, get married
or not get married,

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.010
whatever they choose.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.800
So that is just one of the ways.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.310
It's all about how to
motivate yourself, I think,

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.220
as opposed to what is healthy?

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.060
Because people try to make a
lot of money by telling you

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.310
they have the secret bullet--
you know, the blood type

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.570
diet, whatever.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:54.580
Dr. Oz has a new cure every
day, but really science

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.040
moves more slowly than that,
and we know what is healthy.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.390
All right, so the final
book I want to talk about,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.850
before opening it up to any
questions you might have,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.660
is this one was started
about four years ago.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.460
This started because I got a
very strange email from a man,

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.400
and he said, you
who don't know me,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.110
but I am your eighth cousin.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.050
And I thought, as
you might, that he

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.220
was going to ask me to wire
$10,000 to his Nigerian bank.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:26.550
It seemed sketchy, but it
turns out he was legitimate.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.980
And he is this man
who is obsessed

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.939
with helping to build these
family trees that are big.

00:16:34.939 --> 00:16:35.980
They're not really trees.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.120
They're forests.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.680
They are massive interconnected
forests and not just thousands

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.130
of people, millions of people.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.320
So it's a new--

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.450
I always thought genealogy--

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.020
kind of stodgy, sort
of in the needle point.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.402
No offense to needle point.

00:16:54.402 --> 00:16:56.360
Some people-- I once said
that, and people were

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.970
like, needle point's hip now.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:58.720
Sorry.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.240
But anyway, I just thought
it was a little stodgy.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.980
But nowadays, it's
actually not at all,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.740
and it's affecting every
part of our lives-- politics,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.160
race relations, happiness--

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.280
because there are these
amazing revolutions,

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.500
technological revolutions,
going on in the field.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.260
And there are two main ones.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.109
One is these massive
family trees,

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.810
where you have millions
of people connected--

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.609
sort of a Wikipedia model.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:31.240
You put up your tree, and you
can connect it to other trees

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.690
if you share a relative.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.590
And it's almost
become-- it's like

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.300
the ultimate social network.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.950
It's like six degrees
of Kevin Bacon,

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.470
but everyone's Kevin Bacon.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.470
And you can connect to
almost anyone in the world.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.960
Like, I'm on one tree.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.750
It's got about 110
million, and I've

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.330
got my cousin
Barack Obama, who is

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.380
my fifth great aunt's
husband's brother's wife's

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.940
seventh great nephew.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.460
So we're very close.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.840
But the idea is, as again,
we are all connected.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.470
And for the first
time in history,

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.040
we can actually see
how this is happening.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.070
The other revolution,
as you probably know,

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.080
is genetic testing.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.280
You can spit into a
tube, and send it off,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.880
and get your ancestry
percentages allegedly

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.830
and a list of
hundreds of cousins

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.070
you never knew you had
and might not want to have

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.140
but there they are.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.530
Now this, I was
fascinated by this,

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.590
and I thought this has to be
the topic of my next book.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.070
And as I got into it,
what struck me was,

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.700
like all technology
revolutions, this

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.150
has the potential to do
tremendous good for society.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.610
It also has potential to do
tremendous ill to society.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.690
So let me quickly go over how I
think it could be great for us,

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.790
and then how it could
take a left turn

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.670
and take us down
some dark alleyways.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.870
The way it could be good,
I think, is just a very--

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.980
first way is just the very
simple, almost childlike fact

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.060
that we're all one big family,
but now we can actually see it.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.330
You can see it
concretely, and it makes--

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.410
it actually makes a difference.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.670
And the hope is that
when we realize this,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.400
we will treat each other
with a little more kindness

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.070
or at least a little
less horribleness.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.730
And there is some empirical
evidence that this is true.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.920
There was a Harvard
study a year ago,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.730
where they took
Palestinians and Israelis,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.700
and they told one
group that they were--

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.620
they showed them how they
were related, and the other,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.990
they didn't.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.390
And that test
group, that knew how

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.630
they were related to each
other, treated the other group

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.670
with more kindness.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.480
They didn't buzz them as
loudly on a memory test,

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.880
so there is some evidence
that it might work,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.330
this idea of we're
all family, then

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.040
we should be kinder
to each other.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.150
I see it on a personal level.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.650
This is not quite as profound
as Palestinians and Arabs,

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:19.620
but for instance, I always hated
Judge Judy, the personality.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.170
I just thought
she was obnoxious,

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.990
and nasty, and not that smart.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.840
But then I saw that
she's my eighth cousin,

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.510
and it actually had, rationally
or not, it had an effect.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.870
I was like, oh,
she's not so bad.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:33.966
She's just cousin Judy.

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:35.090
She's just doing a schtick.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.920
She's probably a
sweetheart underneath.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.590
And so, my hope is that this
Judge Judy effect will be good.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.050
The second way I
hope it will be good

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:50.330
is that it will expose
this myth of racial purity.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.510
And one of my advisors for
this was Henry Louis Gates,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.410
the Harvard professor, and
that's one of his big themes--

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.050
is there's no such
thing as racial purity.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.040
We are all a mix.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.450
We are all mutts,
and that's good.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.810
And there are some
interesting phenomena

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.370
happening, where white
supremacists take these tests,

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.160
and then they find
out, some of them,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.570
that they have African-American
or Jewish heritage.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.540
And the reactions
are mixed of course.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.350
Some deny it.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.860
They say, oh, 23andMe
is a big conspiracy,

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.230
a multicultural conspiracy.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.110
But some actually have this
change of heart, and like, oh,

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.950
you know what?

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.160
My world view may
not be that accurate.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.800
So the hope is that
this will increase.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.050
And I, myself,
took all the tests.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.760
I took six or seven of them.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.340
They all reveal I
was mostly Jewish,

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.540
but they had different nuances.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.470
One said, which was
interesting, I thought,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:22:00.560
I am 97% Ashkenazi Jew
but 2.5% Egyptian-Arab.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.890
So I liked having the Middle
East conflict in my body.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.350
The final way I think
that it could be good

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.620
is that it could broaden
the idea of family,

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.790
because this idea of
the nuclear family,

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.040
the two parents and the
two kids, is actually not--

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.090
it's a pretty new concept.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.360
When industrialization came
and people moved to the city

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.370
to be away from their
extended family,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.830
that's when that idea that
this is the normal family

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.640
came about.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.070
It's not really
the normal family.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.530
And I like the idea of
broadening the family

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:38.990
to include gay marriage, sperm
donors, open adoption, even

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.680
group families.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.260
And one of my favorite
stories in the book is--

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.400
I've found these twins,
separated at birth twins.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.020
They were born in Korea.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.280
They moved.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.940
They were both adopted by
families in the United States,

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.100
and they didn't know
about each other.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.790
But they had a mutual
acquaintance on Facebook

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.420
who said, you guys
look weirdly similar--

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.460
like, same freckles even.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.230
And they got together,
and they took a DNA test.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.840
It turned out they
were sisters, and it

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.700
blew their minds of course.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.160
They tried to contact
their biological mom.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.320
She didn't want anything
to do with it, which--

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.470
so that's the sad part.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:27.440
The uplifting part,
to me, is that she--

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.460
one of the sisters told me I
feel like I have lots of moms.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.200
I have an abundance of moms.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.310
I've got my adoptive mom,
my twin's adoptive mom--

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.580
she's an actress, and so she
has what she calls a momager.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:48.440
So this idea of reconceiving
family not just as strict DNA.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.630
One writer says--
he calls it there's

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.470
your biological family
and your logical family.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.610
And I think that's a good thing
to expand the idea of family,

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.610
because as my eighth cousin,
Hillary Clinton, said,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.320
it takes a village.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.970
All right, and then
quickly I'll end.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.760
I like to end on a
down note on the ways

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.690
it could be terrible
for society.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.930
So my main hope, of course, is
that it decreases tribalism,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.240
which I think is one of the--

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.370
it's sort of the
problem of all problems,

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.030
because if we cannot
cooperate as a species,

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.390
we cannot solve these worldwide
problems like climate change.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.140
So hopefully, it will
decrease, but there

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.210
is a chance it'll
do just the opposite

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.220
and increase tribalism.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.580
I talked to one
sociologist at Princeton,

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.750
who, that's his greatest
fear-- is that these DNA tests,

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.730
everyone will get
their DNA tests

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.480
and go into their
own little silos,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.370
their little ethnic silos.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:59.180
And his nightmare scenario is
sort of a 23andMe meets Tinder.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:05.460
So you like-- you know,
you're 72% Scandinavian.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.160
You will only date
people who also are

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.950
70% Scandinavian and above--

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:14.130
and that it will
sort of turn the tide

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.940
against the decades long
trend of intermarriage

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.390
between groups.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.930
So that is one
potential downside.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.820
There is also--

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.020
I mean, it's going to be
psychologically traumatic

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:33.190
for some people, because an
estimated 2% of the world,

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.470
and that's a lot of people--

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.320
you guys are better at math,
so you know how much it is,

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.910
but that's a lot of people.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.720
And 2% of those
are what are called

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.560
euphemistically
non-paternal events, which

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.640
means that their father
is someone else that they

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.660
don't know about.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.850
And so, we're going to
see an increasing number.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.350
The world is going
to be like one

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:03.240
big "Maury Povich" show as
people discover, more and more,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.250
that they have a father.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.610
And it all depends on how we
react to that information.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:13.700
I have a chapter in my book
about a guy who, as an adult,

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.090
he has nine siblings.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.450
He lived in the Midwest,
and they took DNA tests.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:23.090
And it turned out every single
one of those nine siblings

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.970
was from a different
father, and the biological,

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.380
the assumed father,
was biologically

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.840
the dad of none of them--

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.600
so again, like "Maury
Povich" times exponentially.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.940
And it was interesting,
the reaction,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.410
because some of the
siblings were understandably

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.090
horrified and upset.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.650
You know, my mother is a
tramp, et cetera, et cetera.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.540
But some-- hey, the one
I interviewed actually

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.480
tried to reframe it and
be like, oh, this is nice.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.960
I have all of these
new half siblings.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.910
So it's a lot about how we
react to this information.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:08.700
Oh, I will end.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.460
Actually, I'm going to end on
a slightly more positive note,

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.240
because the book is partly about
explaining these revolutions.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.670
Partly it's a memoir of my
own delightfully odd family.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.530
I'm very grateful I
have a strange family.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:28.980
And partly it's this adventure,
because this was about two

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.200
years ago, I decided--

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.470
since I have all these
cousins, I will try to put on--

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.390
why not have a party?

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.300
Why not have a family
reunion for all

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.730
of my seven billion cousins?

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.320
So I did invite seven billion.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.120
We didn't get 100%
turnout, but we did get--

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.650
we got several thousand
in New York, about 4,000.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.250
And there were 40
simultaneous reunions.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.620
I called them the global family
reunion around the world.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:01.320
It was the strangest day
of my life, very stressful.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.500
I can never be a
event planner, but it

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.010
was the strangest cocktail
of humans, you know,

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.830
of all races and all countries.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.880
And we had a
minister, and a rabbi,

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.810
and a Buddhist monk
onstage at one point.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:24.480
We had, like,
D-list celebrities.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.180
We actually had Sister Sledge
come and sing, "We are Family."

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.170
So we sang along to that.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.770
And here are some images.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.620
Oh, those are some
of my cousins.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.300
Using these tools,
you can figure out

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.640
how you're related to pretty
much anyone, as I said.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.620
So it's a very good
networking tool.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.270
Like, I remember I called up--

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:52.290
there's Daniel Radcliffe,
and that was George HW Bush.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.280
It is a remarkably useful--

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.520
it's like LinkedIn.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.697
So I called up his press
person, and I said,

00:28:59.697 --> 00:29:01.030
I'm writing a book about family.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.110
I'd love to interview
President Bush since he's

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.707
had an influential family.

00:29:05.707 --> 00:29:07.290
And she's like, well,
we're not really

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.910
doing any interviews anymore.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.160
And I said, that's fine.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:15.120
But just so he knows, and
you know, I'm his cousin.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.320
And we are like fifth cousins.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.970
He's my fifth cousin's aunt's--

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.230
and so, I went on.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:26.820
And she was like, all right,
let me see what I can do.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.760
So it actually
worked, and here is--

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.920
oh, here's some shots
of the reunion itself

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.170
in New York and some--

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:38.680
there's the Sister Sledge and
then some around the world.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.870
So I will end it with that, but
I'm happy to talk about that.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.680
I also have done a ton
of other experiments

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.300
that I'm happy to talk about.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.200
I did one--

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.550
I was here like--

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.380
what is it now, three
or four years ago?

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.680
Because I did an experiment
with Google Glass.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.630
I was one of the
first journalists

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:03.660
to wear Google Glass for,
I guess, a month or so.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.780
And so, happy to
answer questions

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:10.020
about that or anything
else, but that was fun--

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.890
I had a great time.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.086
Thank you for coming.

00:30:12.086 --> 00:30:15.974
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.620
AUDIENCE: So for the
Bible year, how did you

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.660
resolve the contradictions
in the Bible

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.407
like turn the other cheek
versus an eye for an eye

00:30:27.407 --> 00:30:28.240
and stuff like that?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.891
AJ JACOBS: Yeah, that
is a very good question,

00:30:30.891 --> 00:30:32.640
because there are a
lot of contradictions.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.160
Because I believe, and I
said this in the book--

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.130
I didn't get in as much trouble
as I thought, but I said--

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.770
the Bible is very
much like Wikipedia.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.950
It was written by dozens of
people over hundreds of years.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.190
So when you say the
Bible says this.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:51.522
The Bible says that.

00:30:51.522 --> 00:30:53.730
What you really should be
saying is part of the Bible

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.750
says this, part of
the Bible says that.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.420
And to resolve--

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.970
I could never resolve
the contradictions,

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.200
but I tried them both.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.870
So I would try eye
for an eye, then

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.760
I would try turn
the other cheek.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.640
I remember in terms
of parenting--

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.270
because some parts of the
Bible are be loving, and kind,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.540
and compassionate.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.360
But then there are
parts in the Proverbs

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.090
especially that, like,
if you're a parent,

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.710
you have to discipline your
kid physically and not just

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.640
with a hand.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.467
You got to hit
them with a stick.

00:31:31.467 --> 00:31:32.550
Like, that's what it says.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.170
Do not spare the rod.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.090
Hit your kids with a stick.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.180
As you might have guessed,
I'm sort of this liberal Upper

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:39.730
West-sider.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.830
I'm not so into hitting
my kids with a stick.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:49.370
So the loophole I found was
I had this, like, Nerf stick.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:53.400
And I would-- when my kid was
bad, I would, like, tap him.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.430
He thought it was hilarious,
so he would run and get

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.090
a Wiffle bat and just
start wailing on me

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.420
with the Wiffle bat.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.950
And I was like,
this is not working.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.250
And I will say one
other difficult one was

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.140
the rules of purity, because
the Bible, as you might know,

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.740
in Leviticus, it says that you
should not touch a woman when

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.240
she's in her time of month.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.080
And if you take it
really literally,

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.650
Leviticus says that you
should not sit on a seat

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.740
where a menstruating woman
has sat, because the seat has

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.510
become impure.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.630
My wife found that offensive,
so she sat in every seat

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.540
in our apartment.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.280
And I was forced to stand
for the year, which later,

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.320
as you saw, I did
this book on health.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.350
And, you know, if you
believe some experts,

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.790
sitting is going to kill you.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.680
Like, you'll all be
dead by the end of this,

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.060
because here we're sitting.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:49.470
So it's actually a good thing
she made me stand for the year,

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.250
so I thank her.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:50.820
Yes, sir?

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.320
AUDIENCE: It is
mentioned, your wife

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.640
and your child--
obviously, your family

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.260
had to go through this with you.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.080
Is there anything that
they just absolutely

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.872
hated about the whole
process, and is there

00:32:59.872 --> 00:33:02.330
anything on the flip side, that
they really liked about it?

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.030
AJ JACOBS: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.730
Well, it depends
on the experiment.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.960
And I do get a lot of emails
saying that your wife is

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.180
a saint, and I
forward them to her,

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.330
so she knows that sometimes
the pain-- actually, you know,

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.650
it will pay off maybe.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.090
But yeah, she hated
the menstruation law.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.770
She hated the beard
for the Bible.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.540
She wouldn't kiss me.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.320
I did get-- this was
about five years ago.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.680
I kept getting emails saying
you're putting your wife

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.640
through all this stuff.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.300
You should do an
experiment where

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.870
you try to be the
greatest husband ever.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.310
And I thought,
OK, I'll try that.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:43.890
And it was kind of hellish.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.870
I will say that.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.880
And part of it was
what you would expect.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.360
Part of it was like,
you know, the foot rubs,

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.130
all the cliches--

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:57.540
the Kate Hudson
movies, we saw those.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.420
But part of it was
quite enlightening.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.940
I'm trying to decide
which part to mention.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.450
I mean, one thing that
I found enlightening

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:09.510
was it relates to what I was
mentioning earlier about how

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.340
behavior affects your thought.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.670
So as part of my goal
to be the best husband,

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.820
every day I would buy her a
little gift, a little trinket,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.420
just like $2 or $3--

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.179
like, you know, a
little soap that

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.580
smells like guava or whatever.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:28.290
And I would present it to
her, and buying and presenting

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.110
a gift to her, it
sort of convinced me.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.889
I'm like, wow, I must
really love this woman

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.929
that I am giving her
a gift every day.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:41.670
And it made me love her more.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.810
So that was--

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.320
I think that was-- and
I still try to do that.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.280
I fail miserably, but I try.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.969
And I will say just when
we're on the topic of my wife,

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:55.770
I did an article for "Esquire,"
it's about 10 years ago now,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.660
where it was called, "Do I
Love my Wife, A Scientific

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.430
Investigation."

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.920
And the idea was
because there are

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.170
these scientists,
these neuroscientists

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.390
and anthropologists--

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.270
Helen Fisher is perhaps
the most famous--

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.100
who investigate the
science of love,

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.300
and what parts of
the brain light up.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.550
So I thought it would be
interesting to see, you know,

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.830
do I love my wife?

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.860
And so, they put me
in an fMRI machine

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.520
and filmed my brain as
I thought about my wife,

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.280
and as I thought
about neutral people,

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.890
as I thought about Angelina
Jolie, and it was, you know,

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.070
terrifying.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.330
It turns out I do love
my wife but only in two

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.130
of three ways, which, like,
after 10 years of marriage,

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:49.280
like 67%, I thought
was pretty good.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.430
So I felt I felt OK with that.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.380
Yeah?

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.180
I've read much a
bunch of your books.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.430
So it's really nice
to see you in person.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:57.170
AJ JACOBS: Oh, thank you.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.920
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if there's

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.630
anything from any
of the experience

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.170
you've done that you continue
doing that you never thought

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.960
that you would do, or that
you've adopted it in your life,

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.720
or maybe you've had other
people around you adopt.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.180
So just curious like what's
become part of your actual--

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.890
AJ JACOBS: Sure, sure, sure--

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:13.670
well, I will say.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.120
I mean, every-- ideally,
every one of these,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.960
there's something I take away.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.060
Otherwise, it would
be a waste of time.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.010
So just to give you a
couple of random examples,

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:27.860
I mean, I still write
on the treadmill.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.030
I still do like--

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:32.060
I go pretty slowly,
but I do do that.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.020
From the religion, I
mentioned the gratitude.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.850
I still try to practice that.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:47.330
And I did join a synagogue, and
I do think there are benefits.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:53.930
The way I-- just briefly
about religion, one scholar

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.770
breaks it up into the
three B's of religion.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:01.250
There's belief, belonging, and
behavior-- so belief in God,

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:05.480
belonging to a community, and
behaving ethically or doing

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.840
these rituals.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.820
So I actually think
that the second two B's

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.040
have helped my life.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.320
Like, it's nice to
have a community.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.600
There's lots of research
that a close knit friend

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.570
group is healthy.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.880
The ethics, if they're
the right kind of ethics,

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.210
I think it's good to
reinforce them with a group.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:30.830
I just never got into
the belief, the first B,

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.020
and I have become
increasingly worried

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:38.360
that to believe in
a supernatural being

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.840
can be used for evil.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.920
So I've become increasingly
skeptical of the first B.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.120
But I like the second two B's,
so those two B's are still

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.980
with me.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.850
Yes, sir?

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:53.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much as you are

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.980
sharing your stories with us.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.220
Oh,

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.410
AJ JACOBS: My pleasure.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.140
AUDIENCE: So you
made big changes

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.880
to your life-- big, big changes.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.670
Do you think everyday
people understand

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.680
how much power
they have to change

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.270
the way they live their lives?

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.520
AJ JACOBS: Oh, that's
a lovely question.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.300
Yeah, I do, you know-- if I do
preach the gospel that everyone

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.320
should experiment on
themselves, and it's right there

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.540
on the urinal in Google.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.030
And I hope for gender equity.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.484
It's on the back of the
stalls in the women's room.

00:38:23.484 --> 00:38:24.330
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.420
AJ JACOBS: Oh, good.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.100
I'm not going to check it out.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.950
But I do think that
you don't have to--

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.300
I'm get to do this as
a job, so I'm lucky.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.600
So I can do it as
radically as-- you know,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.470
I can wear the crazy outfit,
but not everyone can.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.000
But you can make
smaller experiments,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.150
and I got a lot of feedback.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.760
People say, you know, I tried
not to gossip for a week,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.390
and that really changed my life.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.350
Or I try not to lie--

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:56.840
or even changing
your toothpaste.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.590
I did one experiment all
about cognitive biases

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:04.520
and trying to eliminate
all my cognitive biases,

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.920
which of course is
impossible, but you can try.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.370
And one of the cognitive
biases was just

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.480
the routine of brushing
my teeth with Crest,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.780
because I had always bought
it since I could remember.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.630
But there is no rational
reason why I chose Crest.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:24.290
So the experiment could be just
trying different toothpaste

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.020
until you find the one you
like best, and I used--

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:32.090
you know, Tom's has a delicious
apricot-flavored toothpaste,

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.020
which I much prefer.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.810
It's made my life better,
just that little change.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:41.720
So yes, I do preach the gospel
of self-experimentation.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.680
Thank you.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hello.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:43.945
Thank you for coming.

00:39:43.945 --> 00:39:45.320
AJ JACOBS: Oh, my pleasure.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.130
AUDIENCE: I started reading your
book about becoming healthier,

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.540
and it was really interesting.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.270
And it kind of made
me think that, you

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.020
know, there's a lot
of-- as you mentioned,

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.640
there's a lot of
different people

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.030
who go around saying that we
should do one thing or another,

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.730
and all these things are
sort of-- it does not work,

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.130
because as you point out, you
can't do everything, right?

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.838
AJ JACOBS: Right.

00:40:04.838 --> 00:40:07.430
AUDIENCE: Is there any
effort to put together, like,

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.980
a sane set of
advice, like this is

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:15.410
what a normal person can do with
a set amount of time per day?

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.340
You know, like, trying to have
a really coherent set of health

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:19.935
advice?

00:40:19.935 --> 00:40:20.810
AJ JACOBS: I like it.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.330
I think you should write it.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:27.020
I mean, I think that
the challenge with that

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.990
would be if you say you
have a magic bullet,

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.530
then that is exciting
and people buy it.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.620
Like, they asked me to write
a health column for "Esquire,"

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.140
and I said, all
right, but it's not

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.400
going to be that interesting.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.010
Because I'm going to write
the same paragraph every week,

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.510
which is, you
know, get exercise,

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:51.050
eat non-processed foods,
get a lot of sleep.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.210
And then the second
month would be like,

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.550
OK, let me repeat this.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.789
And then I could get even,
like, angrier and angrier.

00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:00.080
It's like, how many times do
I have to tell you people?

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.470
Here is what you should do.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.680
So I would say--

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:06.980
there are some good books.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.550
Marion Nestle-- Marion
Nestle is a nutritionist

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.100
who has a good book
called "What to Eat."

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:20.330
I think you don't even need a
book on exercise, because aside

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:24.110
from the idea of--

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.810
I do think there is some
evidence that high intensity

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:30.560
interval training like going
really hard for two minutes

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.840
has some benefits,
but mostly it's

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.870
just do exercise--
you know, just

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.490
whatever you find pleasurable,
because you're never

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.490
going to do it if you
don't find it pleasurable.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.990
So it could be gardening, it
could be building a stone wall,

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.750
or whatever.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.410
So anyway, those
are my thoughts.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.370
I mean, I think one of the
big problems with health right

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.920
now is the health media,
because of the biases built

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.390
into journalism, you want
the man bites dog story.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.390
You want the-- if you
find one study that

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:09.140
says bacon is great for
you, that's the headline.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.880
That's the article
you're going to write,

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:17.360
not the 980 studies that said
bacon is not good for you.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:25.420
So it's this sort of unusual
study syndrome and flaw

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.520
that I think is super
dangerous, and that we

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.560
need more perspective.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.330
There needs to be context.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.720
I think of it as the Rotten
Tomatoes of health advice.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.970
You know, you're
always going to find

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:44.250
a critic who loves "Battlestar
Earth," but 99% of them

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:44.750
are not.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.780
So you're always going to
find a scientist who says--

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.570
with good credentials--
who says, you know,

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:55.160
that you should only eat
broccoli if you have blood

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.120
type, C. Is there a blood
type, C I don't think there--

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.830
blood type, B. But that is--

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.000
that is an outlier,
so you got to look

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.260
at what the mass of the
scientific community says

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.482
and go with that.

00:43:10.482 --> 00:43:11.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.460
AJ JACOBS: So there you go.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.150
Anyone else?

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:15.350
Is there anyone else?

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:15.950
Yes, sir?

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:18.440
AUDIENCE: So do you have any
other experiments in mind.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.980
"The Year of Living
Biblically," one of the points

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.637
of it you said
was to demonstrate

00:43:23.637 --> 00:43:25.220
some of the dangers
of fundamentalism.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.790
There's a lot of
other dangers that

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.410
have sort of taken root in
the last 10 to 15 years.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:34.080
Any ideas for the year of
living without x or anything

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.580
like that?

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.320
AJ JACOBS: Well,
that's a good question.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.920
I actually-- well,
I've got the--

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.920
I just finished the
one about gratitude,

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.540
which hopefully has this
message of connectivity that

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.179
might resonate.

00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:51.470
And this one, I haven't even
written the book proposal,

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:55.880
so hopefully no one will watch
this and decide to scoop me.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:03.090
But I am fascinated by how
do we know what's true,

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.400
and this whole fake
news phenomenon.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.650
And basically, it would be a
book about epistemology, which

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.780
is a very sexy word, I know--

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.745
that's going to be--

00:44:13.745 --> 00:44:16.760
it'll say a book about
epistemology, that's my title--

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.520
but it's sort of, you know,
how do we know what's true,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:25.280
and how can we fight these
crazy biases and this sort

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.840
of this destruction of the
idea of an objective truth?

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.760
Because I believe it's
complicated, you know.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.080
I don't believe in
black and white.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.540
I think you always--

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.510
there's always-- it's
all about probabilities,

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:42.890
so it's hard to say, you know,
there is an objective truth.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.830
But there is.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.740
We just can't ever get to
it, but we have to try.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.150
We have to try.

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.080
And that's, I think we're
losing that in today

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.727
in our crazy political world.

00:44:54.727 --> 00:44:55.810
AUDIENCE: So I'm confused.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.230
Isn't just I Googled it?

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.816
AJ JACOBS: That is
a good point, yeah.

00:45:01.816 --> 00:45:03.190
I actually-- I'm
trying to think.

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:06.610
I did have a couple of
Google-related experiment

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:10.800
ideas, and I can't
remember what they are.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.970
I mean, I did do the
one with the Google

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:16.390
Glass, which was fun.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:17.500
Yes?

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.690
AUDIENCE: How do you
find like the willpower

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:22.204
and the discipline to
stick to your plans?

00:45:22.204 --> 00:45:23.620
AJ JACOBS: That's
a good question.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:30.370
I mean, partly, it's the
idea of faking it till you

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.840
make it and just like--

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.650
and partly it is--

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.570
I would say it's
delusional optimism.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:41.050
It is a very useful
tool that I use.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:44.870
So for instance like
with the health book,

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.340
I would wake up every morning,
you know, filled with despair

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.170
that this is such a huge topic.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.630
How can I write
one book about it?

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:57.430
But then I would
pretend to be confident,

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.260
and I would act as
if I was confident.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.910
So I would call my publisher,
and I'd be like, oh, this book,

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.390
I think it's going to be big.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.100
Let's have a party
when it comes out,

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.330
where we serve kale martinis--
like the healthiest drinks

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.140
ever.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.600
And then I would call
and set up a bunch

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.370
of interviews with doctors.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.220
And by acting as if
I were confident,

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.340
after like three
or four hours, I

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.090
started to become a
little more confident.

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:24.910
And that helped
me from giving up.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.860
It helped me prevent
me from giving up.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.240
So there it is, a little
delusional optimism,

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.110
not too much.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:36.010
Because as we know, delusional
optimism has a huge downside.

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.710
Like, if you think, I've
never been in politics,

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:40.540
but I can be president.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:46.990
That, shockingly enough, does
not work out, so there you go.

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:49.480
Yes, anyone else?

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.510
All right, well,
thank you very much.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:53.230
I loved it.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.220
Thank you again.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.060
Have a good day.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.610
