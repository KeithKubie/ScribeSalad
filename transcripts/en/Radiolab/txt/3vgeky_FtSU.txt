Speaker 1:          00:00          Kaye I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab our topic today is mathematics mathematics and mathematics. This post is our topic but actually we do have a gripping story for you coming up now from our producer Shawn Wheeler. Hey sorry. Hey. And this is about math right. Yeah. Well math and friendship really. And I heard it from Steve Strogatz. He's a mathematician at Cornell University and he's been on the show once or twice. OK. And we sat down in the studio and he told me about you back up and tell me a little bit about high school and about his high school math teacher Don Jaffrey.

Speaker 2:          00:36          Well there were several striking and peculiar things about him. I mean probably the first thing is that he was physically incredibly impressive. You hold the chalk between his enormous fingers and right on the board the chalk would pulverize with each stroke so that there would be this cloud of chalk dust all over him and his big sweater and another thing that was very unusual about him. He'd be in the middle of the calculation standing at the board chalk dust all over him as usual.

Speaker 3:          01:05          Then he would space out and he'd get a look in his eye a kind of faraway look and then he'd say Oh this reminds me with the hushed tone This reminds me of the time Jamie Williams calculated the formula for the end of term and the Fibonacci sequence. Who's Jamie with Jamie Williams was a student at.

Speaker 4:          01:27          He was just a couple of years ahead of Stephen and Mr. Jeffries Clark. And that was part of the mystique. You know that now he was graduated and it was as if the secret was.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Was lost to the ages. But the point was that he would talk about a student with reverence with reverence. Yeah. What was very thrilling about that is that there was this kind of chain that we were now becoming part of.

Speaker 5:          01:53          Yeah. So then I'm off to college.

Speaker 4:          01:55          And it was it started very early I started to write to him. It was sort of like an annual tidbit. Dear Mr. Joffrey here's the gem that I learned this year in. So Steve would write to him Mr. Joffrey would write back add something ask him a new question and then went on like that for a while with Steve kind of still being like a student and Mr. Joffrey still like a teacher. There was one moment though where. Something new happened where he wrote to me.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Asking for help. He said a question came up in his class about an elliptical swimming pool. So you know picture a swimming pool. Often there's a little border on the edge of the swimming pool like a piece of concrete that lines the pool you stand on that part before jumping in. And so the question was if you had an elliptical swimming pool with a one foot boarder around it is the outer edge of the border. Also on the lips. Something about that really appealed to me it was a very nice math problem. Probably there was a little bit of a show off in me like I thought if I could do this he's going to say something nice. You'll become part of the panel. Maybe he'll enter the pantheon they'll start talking about me like they used to talk about Jamie Williams. So I stopped whatever I was doing and I worked hard on that ellipse problem and I figured out two or three different ways too. Turns out it's never an ellipse.

Speaker 1:          03:20          If it cannot be an ellipse so sat down and wrote back to Mr Joffrey about this puzzle.

Speaker 6:          03:26          But I didn't just show him the answer. I wrote the answer in a very loving and gentle way that was meant to be empathetic. That is I know where you're coming from and I'm going to just start from scratch to lead you from where you are to where you need to be to solve this problem.

Speaker 7:          03:44          In other words Steve acted like he was the teacher and Mr. Joffrey played along and this was such a generous thing in retrospect.

Speaker 2:          03:51          The humility the modesty the kindness in playing the role of a student. It's like he knew that that's what I needed and man I loved it. I would. I couldn't wait for the next question.

Speaker 7:          04:02          And as Steve went off to graduate school to become a math professor himself he and Mr. Joffrey kept writing to each other. In fact they were writing to each other quite a lot.

Speaker 2:          04:11          There was one sequence in March of 1989 where we wrote to each other almost every day.

Speaker 3:          04:19          He sent me a puzzle. I worked on it. I showed him a really beautiful answer.

Speaker 8:          04:24          He expressed kind of ecstasy and seeing this answer it was kind of a mathematicians dream correspondence of puzzles and equations.

Speaker 9:          04:36          And Steve loved it. But every so often. Mr. Joffrey would.

Speaker 2:          04:43          Break the routine a little bit. He would say things about that he was doing some jazz piano gig. He would sometimes write about he had three sons. He would talk about them a little bit and you know I feel embarrassed. It feels mean but I remember not liking those parts of the letters and I didn't write about that. I mean I would say maybe I was playing some tennis or but I have lines in some of my letters that say after a few of those sentences. Okay enough stalling. Here's the math problem. But then in later years he would almost pointedly ask me things like there was a time when he said that rumor has it that you're engaged. We wish you the best. If this is true. And guess what I got my letter back to him.

Speaker 6:          05:28          I didn't say anything. You remembered like thinking not to respond or just. Well I I I can tell you what was going on which is that I was already in couple therapy with my fiance say you know like in that time the letters were a kind of refuge from all that. That is we could go into this pristine world of math where things are simple and logical and.

Speaker 10:         05:55          Well-ordered.

Speaker 11:         05:57          There may have been part of me that felt like I'll come on it. This is the one place where it's all.

Speaker 12:         06:02          Perfect but over the years that perfect world got a little less perfect because his older son died Marshall died Marshall died when he was only 27 and uh I didn't ask about it.

Speaker 6:          06:21          Can you believe this. I feel so sick about this when I think about it now. So you were just right back. Oh I've got another poll. Got another math problem for you.

Speaker 13:         06:29          Look at this.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Yeah and then more than 20 years into this relationship.

Speaker 2:          06:38          Letter writing Mr. Joffrey retired and now that he couldn't teach anymore he'd write to me he'd show me these beautiful math problems that he would make up for himself usually about hawks flying over the earth and you know how much spherical area can the hawks see if it's at such and such altitude.

Speaker 6:          06:56          And what is happening at this time is that now I have just gotten married and we've started having kids and I'm not answering his letters anymore. They're sitting in their envelopes stacking up. He's writing them faster than I can answer him a lot faster. And then at one point I got one more letter from Mr. Joffrey except as soon as I looked at the envelope I could see that something was really very wrong. His handwriting didn't look normal. That my address my name was written in a craggy like shaky shaky and I knew what that looked like because my dad wrote like that when he had Parkinson's. So I thought what what is this. And I opened the letter and the first sentences eek. I just had a mild stroke.

Speaker 7:          07:42          I didn't write back to him right away.

Speaker 14:         07:44          I didn't call him and then just a couple months later my brother died very suddenly. And.

Speaker 15:         07:54          He heard about it from someone else and immediately wrote to me how you know that he was very he and his wife had heard and they were very sorry to hear that my brother had died. That to me was you know I still had never said I'm sorry about Marshall all those years ago and it kept nagging at me. Why won't you talk to him beckoning and you obviously care about him.

Speaker 16:         08:19          It's sort of like an in math. There's this concept of bifurcation which really means a fork in the road a splitting when the forces on a system get too large. There can be a moment when the dynamics of that system change.

Speaker 17:         08:32          Abruptly. This was a moment of bifurcation. I should have just said how sorry I was to hear about about Marshall.

Speaker 2:          08:48          So I I thought I gotta go talk to him and ask him Can I come to your house. You know he seemed a little reluctant about it but you know. Okay fine. So I bought a little pocket tape recorder just a cheap thing drove up Route 95 to his house in Connecticut on the shore knock on the door here the piano that was playing inside Stop. He comes and rushes to see me and we give each other hugs take out a big plate of cold cuts and say let's sit out on the porch.

Speaker 18:         09:18          Does that work well. So we're we're eating and be recording and then he takes out his journal. I decided that I would keep a journal since I was retired where he's drawn pictures of all kinds of birds and here's a picture of me doing an eagle watch out in the Connecticut River. And there's a lot of stuff back in his typical way. I don't know.

Speaker 19:         09:37          This is a bird it's moved up from the south too. You never saw these. Well what some people call buzzards. Yeah they've they've moved up here and. This is one of my favorite birds. It's a Marsh Hawk and it flies low over the meadows. More about that. Hank says I'm going to take you over to see a rough legged Hawk. Now. He didn't say we're going to see if we can see a rough legged hawk.

Speaker 20:         10:05          He produced.

Speaker 2:          10:08          And I'm thinking to myself I don't not really interested in this. I want to talk about him about all these things that are that we never talked about that are emotional hard things like what happened. How did your son die.

Speaker 21:         10:20          Have a lot of work. They're just trying to make eyes for it in extra hours to pay guys extra. There was a fidgeting feeling inside me and benefits and right other stuff. And there was a pause. My heart was beating fast.

Speaker 22:         10:42          Then I thought I'm gonna ask him. So I don't think we ever talked about Marshall but I want it I I did. I asked what.

Speaker 23:         10:49          I didn't really know him either but I know that he died very young and I know what what happened.

Speaker 22:         10:55          You know what happened to Marshall. Well. You know.

Speaker 21:         11:01          That's not what I want to talk about. And I think he's gonna say that's something we don't talk about. Well it was he he had ever as a star.

Speaker 24:         11:14          Energy.

Speaker 21:         11:17          He did. He had a wonderful 27 years.

Speaker 24:         11:22          Music was gone. It was so beautiful.

Speaker 21:         11:25          And so and so we went to mass so uplifting and sweet. He'd be at home and we'd sit around the piano and I'll get out there. Cole Porter songbook I just turned to a page something that he'd never seen. He could sight read it play it and sing it all in one time. Well that's an I thought. This guy's got a multi-channel line that I wish I had. You know he talked about what a great what a great life he had.

Speaker 25:         11:49          In his 27 years in the waning moments. He'd stay up all night long playing the piano just the house which is filled with beautiful music and he had made plans to get a job at the New England Conservatory and things like that. But. The fates were wrong.

Speaker 26:         12:22          Oh yeah. We miss.

Speaker 13:         12:28          Was was that I mean in that moment did it change the way you see him. Well

Speaker 6:          12:36          change I have to tell you how that day ended.

Speaker 27:         12:39          So we talked more record and I asked him at one point do you think Marshall had a religious feeling and he said oh yeah he does think he felt close to having to come to terms with somebody out there. Yeah that was a good thing that that I think he went peacefully. Then and actually conversation drifted to easier things like calculus problems.

Speaker 18:         13:01          And we talked to more about math and then he said How about a swim or let's go to gym I should go out to the beach and I'd like to do something where I get outdoors a. So we did go to the beach and it was a beautiful evening and there were waves.

Speaker 28:         13:16          Coming in from Long Island Sound.

Speaker 29:         13:18          In fact we were talking about a math problem about waves about 40 analysis which is really about well infinity and the fact that if you take an infinite number of simple waves you can create any shape of wave you want as long as it's a wave that repeats. But then Mr. Jaffrey asked But how do you create waves that don't repeat waves that change sometimes waves don't exactly repeat. They can grow or die out. And Steve told them that to deal with those kinds of waves. You need a different kind of infinity. Not the kind where you just keep adding and adding and adding numbers but the kind that sits in the space between two numbers this higher kind of infinity then than Don had thought about before.

Speaker 30:         14:25          Thanks to Susan Miller because you interviewed Steven produced that story.

Speaker 1:          14:30          Thanks to Steve Strogatz who has a book out now which tells this very story called the calculus of friendship.

Speaker 29:         14:36          I'm Jad Abumrad. Three seconds to do you are Robert.
