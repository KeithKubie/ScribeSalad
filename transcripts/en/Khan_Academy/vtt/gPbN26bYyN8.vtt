00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.710
James and Karlee caught a
lizard in their backyard.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.920
Its body is 17/8 inches
long, and its tail

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.930
is 10/8 inches long.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.230
What is the length of the
lizard's body and tail

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.740
together?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.880
So good thing we have
the lizard obediently

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.400
standing next to our
measuring stick or our ruler

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.250
or whatever this happens to be.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.014
And we have it
marked off in inches.

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:24.680
And not only that,
we have it marked off

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.620
in eighths of inches.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.850
Notice-- this is an inch, and
we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.220
8 sections of that actual inch.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.290
So, let's see, 17/8 inches long.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.013
This is going to be 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:49.710
14, 15, 16, 17.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.820
This right over
here is 17/8, which

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.440
you might notice is
also equal to 2 and 1/8.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.040
8 goes into 17 two times
with a remainder of 1.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.900
But we won't talk
about that just yet.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.110
But we see that's the length
of the lizard's body-- 17/8.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.960
I just counted off 17 of these
8's right over here-- 17/8.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.130
And then they say that the
tail is 10/8 inches long.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:28.970
So it's another 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.040
So this distance right over
here, I just counted off 10/8.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.840
So that's another
10/8 inches long,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.540
and it gets us all the way to
the end of the lizard's tail.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.100
And they say what is the length
of the lizard's body and tail

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.460
together?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.470
Well, that's going to be
the length of the body

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.370
plus the length of the tail.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.560
So you have 17/8 plus 10/8.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.010
Well, that's going to
get you to 17 plus 10/8,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.870
which is equal to 27-- 27/8.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.100
And so this mark right
over here is 27/8.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.289
And if you wanted to write
this as a mixed number,

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.330
you could just say, well,
8 goes into 27 three times,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.140
and you have a remainder of 3.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.974
So this is equal to 3 and 3/8.

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:19.890
And you see that on the
ruler right over here.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.210
It's equal to 1, 2, 3.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.140
And then we have
another 1, 2, 3/8.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.650
These two things are equivalent.
