00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.700
Recently, I had a surprise
while returning home

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.760
from a trip changing planes.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.780
I was squeezing out of
an economy class seat,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.790
grabbing my bag, and running
through a crowded quarter.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.230
Wasn't a lot of fun.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.134
But then I get to the gate
of my final flight home,

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:18.800
and I was greeted
with a notice that I'd

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.760
been upgraded to business class
because of my frequent flyer

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.810
status in the airline.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.230
I felt like I'd won the lottery.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320
These kind of upgrades
are all around us.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.950
Hotels reward loyal customers
for an extra night's stay.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.180
Coffee shops can give
you 10th drink free

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.310
or maybe give you a
discount if you come back

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.890
later that afternoon.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.600
And big game
companies are already

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.880
starting to follow suit
and apply that to games.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.100
Now, providing that kind
of personalized touch

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.090
is within easy reach
of all game developers.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.860
Hi.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.540
I'm Noah Falstein, a
developer advocate for games,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.990
and I'm here to tell you
about the new Player Stats

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.010
API that's now part of
Google Play Games Services.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.240
Making successful
games can be tough,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.180
but knowing a few key statistics
about each of your players

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.700
makes it easier for you to
identify individual gamer

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.610
styles, patterns,
preferences, and then

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.610
you can customize your
responses to match

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.560
each of those individuals.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.610
For free-to-play games,
it's really helpful

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.240
to identify your big
spenders and encourage them

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.180
with some special game
power-ups or maybe a bonus match

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.100
to their spending habits.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.580
When you spot a player who's
been gone for a long time

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.950
and is coming back
after a long absence,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.440
you can make their reentry a
little bit easier by dropping

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.580
difficulty a notch, or maybe
you can turn tutorial options

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.020
back on.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.910
Finding your most
loyal veteran players

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.330
lets you offer them easy
options to tell their friends

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.420
about your game without spamming
the new players who may still

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.370
be on a learning curve.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.610
And what's more,
the Player Stats API

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.190
is free and easy to incorporate.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.690
Making a quality
statistical package

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.970
can really be time
consuming, and frankly,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.480
a pain to create
it, to maintain it.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.270
So why not use ours instead?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.640
Now, big companies who
are managing many games

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.030
will have different needs than
individuals or small startups,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.590
and the API takes
that into account.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.640
A large company with
their own infrastructure

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.060
can call the stats
server to server,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.120
handling communications with
the game clients on their own.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.030
A smaller company, though,
can call the API directly

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.160
from their game
client, and then later,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.940
if their needs
grow to justify it,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.050
they can switch over to
a server-to-server model.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.460
So how do you incorporate
the Player Stats API

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.470
into your game?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.830
Well, first, you create
a GoogleApiClient client

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.080
object and configure it to
use the Games API and SCOPE.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.360
Then you use code like
this to retrieve statistics

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.280
on a player.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940
You can pick and choose which
stats are relevant to you,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.050
and then you can make a
tailored response using those.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.110
So you can add your
own code to customize

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.570
a gamer's experience
for your specific needs

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.250
and make them feel valued.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.780
So, for example, you
might give a novice player

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.635
some extra help,
or a veteran player

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:55.430
a power up as an incentive
to come back and use it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.910
in their next session.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.820
It may not be as satisfying as
a business class flight upgrade,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.820
but even free tokens
at the right time

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.900
can make someone's day.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.980
Here's a link to some
additional documentation

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.380
if you want more
detail or suggestions

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.350
on how to use the API.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.780
Those steps will get you started
on using the Player Stats

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.330
API so you can refine your
game and target those responses

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.320
to players individually,
make them happier,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.490
and make your games
more profitable.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.040
So have fun, and let
us know in comments

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.540
if you have any new
ways that you've

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.450
thought of using the stats
to make your games better.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.050
Thanks.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.000
