00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.700
You and I have explored the rules that govern
lots of different moving objects so far.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.400
But physics isn’t just about dragging blocks
up inclines, or astronauts floating in Vomit Comets.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.470
There are also ... collisions!

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.770
And physics has a lot to say about collisions
-- whether it’s two billiard balls knocking

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
against each other, or what happens when you
fail at a Super Mario level for the 47th time

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.180
and throw your controller at the floor.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.280
Stupid lava sticks!

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.739
To figure out what’s happening when objects
collide, we’ll have to take into account

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.540
two main qualities: momentum and impulse.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.540
We’ll also discuss what physicists mean
when they talk about center of mass, and why that’s important.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.560
And we’ll have our old friend Isaac Newton
to help us out along the way.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:52.140
[Theme Music]

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.960
Remember Newton’s second law?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.300
That’s the one that says the net force on
an object is equal to its mass, times its acceleration.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.069
Except, that’s not actually what Newton
said.

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:06.349
He really said that an object’s so-called “quantity of motion” was equal to its mass, times its velocity.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:10.309
And the net force is equal to the change in
that mass-times-velocity over time.

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:14.591
In other words, it’s the derivative of mass-times-velocity
with respect to time.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.200
And if you were to calculate that derivative, you’d find that the net force is just equal to mass times acceleration.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.979
But putting Newton’s second law in terms
of mass and velocity introduces an aspect

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.320
of motion that we haven’t talked about yet.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.899
Newton didn’t really give this aspect a
name, but we will: it’s called momentum,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.260
and it’s one of those things that’s easier
to see in real life than to describe.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.280
Momentum is often described as an object’s
tendency to remain in motion, but technically,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.549
it’s an object’s mass times its velocity.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.009
So, a big bag full of leaves rolling down
a hill? It might be going fast, but it doesn’t

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.629
have much mass, so it doesn’t have a lot
of momentum, and it wouldn’t be too hard to stop.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.700
But the boulder chasing Indiana Jones? That
had a lot of mass -- and therefore lots of momentum.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.179
So it would have been much harder
to stop.

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.929
And momentum is one factor that affects collisions
between objects.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.890
After all, if a huge boulder crashes into
another huge boulder, that’s going to be

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.990
a very different sort of crash than if a bag
of leaves crashes into a boulder.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.900
But the other quality of a collision that
we often consider is known as impulse, which

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.760
-- at least in the context of physics -- doesn’t
actually have anything to do with willpower,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.050
or why you throw your game controller when
you get stuck on a level.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.380
Instead, impulse -- usually represented by
a J -- is the integral of the net force on

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.990
an object over time -- in other words, its
change in momentum.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.690
Impulse turns out to be a particularly useful
way to describe a crash --

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.140
because generally, in collisions,
forces change very quickly.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.970
So, if a ball smacks into a wall, and over
the course of half a second, its force on

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.270
the wall in Newtons is equal to the time, multiplied by 25, we’d say that its impulse was 3.1 Newton-seconds.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.910
Now, let’s consider the different kinds
of collisions that we can study.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.620
Generally, collisions can be described
as either elastic or inelastic.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.160
And it’s going to be important to figure out which kind you’re dealing with, because the math works in very different ways.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.150
If elastic collisions sound bouncy, that’s
because they are.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.290
Like the conservative systems we talked about last time, in elastic collisions, kinetic energy is neither created nor destroyed.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.230
For example: let’s say you knock a white
billiard ball into a second, red one that’s

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.530
sitting on the table, and they hit each other
in just the right way.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.180
For this to be a true elastic collision, all
of the kinetic energy from the white ball

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.150
would be transferred to the red ball.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.740
Meaning, after they hit each other, the white
ball would stay put, and the red one would

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.960
zoom away with all of the kinetic energy -- so, the same speed, basically -- that the white ball used to have.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.500
But you won’t come across elastic collisions
in real life.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.030
Because: There’s always going to be some
energy that’s lost somewhere in a collision,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.550
generally as heat or sound.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.510
And when kinetic energy isn’t conserved,
that’s an inelastic collision.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.520
There’s one thing that’s going to be true about every collision, though, whether or not it’s elastic:

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.460
The momentum of the system
will always be conserved.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.760
It might be transferred to another object --
it might even be transferred to more than one object --

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.400
but the momentum is always
going to go somewhere,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.940
And we’ll be able to use math to figure out where it went.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.500
And we can use what we know about impulse
-- and Newton’s third law -- to prove it.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.780
The third law, of course, is the one that
says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.380
And that applies to collisions in the sense that,
if a ball hits a wall, it’ll exert a force

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.380
on the wall, and the wall will exert an equally
strong force on the ball.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.540
We can describe each of these forces as impulses,
since we know that an impulse is just

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.540
a change in an object’s momentum.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.280
So, the ball’s momentum will be decreasing
when it hits the wall. But because of Newton’s

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.319
third law, we know that the wall’s momentum
is going to increase by an equal amount.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.030
The change in the wall’s momentum might
be impossible for us to see, because the wall

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.370
is connected to the ground, and Earth has
lots of mass. But it’s there.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.210
And that fact -- that momentum is always conserved -- turns out to be super helpful for describing collisions using math.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.039
Like in the case where you knocked the white
billiard ball into the red one.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.000
Since momentum is conserved, and momentum
is mass times velocity, the white ball’s

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.440
mass-times-velocity before the collision has
to be equal to its mass-times-velocity, plus

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.020
the red ball’s mass-times-velocity, after
the collision.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.819
Which is why -- assuming the balls have the
same mass -- if the white ball stops moving

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.439
after the collision, then the red ball must
move with the same velocity that the white ball had.

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.490
So, now we know about both elastic and inelastic
collisions.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.080
But there’s also such a thing as a perfectly
inelastic collision, because... of course there is.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.780
And it’s easier for me to tell you, first,
what it isn’t.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.360
So, it is not a collision where the objects
lose all of their kinetic energy.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.240
Instead, a perfectly inelastic collision is
what happens when objects stick together.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.719
These collisions lose as much kinetic energy
as possible to other forms of energy, like

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.590
heat, sound, or even potential energy ... but
still, their momentum is conserved.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.749
An example would be if you pushed one magnet
toward another -- at just the right angle

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:48.009
for them to stick together on contact -- and
then they both started sliding together at

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.039
half the speed of the magnet you pushed.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.419
Before the collision, the momentum of one
magnet was zero, and the momentum of the one

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.840
you pushed was its mass times its velocity.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.949
Once the magnets collide, the mass is doubled,
and the velocity is cut in half.

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.940
So the total momentum stays the same, but you lose some kinetic energy because there’s less speed involved.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.500
So that’s the basics of how collisions work, and how they relate to the momentum of motion in a straight line.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.960
But there’s one more detail we have to explore in order to really understand how objects move,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.900
whether they’re going to collide or
not.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.620
And that is: center of mass.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.740
Until now, we’ve been talking about objects
as though they were little point-particles.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.960
And that’s worked fine -- for the most part, the objects we’ve been talking about would act much like a small dot would.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.439
But of course, not all objects work that way.

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.840
If you’ve ever tried to fling a hammer,
for example -- which I do not recommend doing!

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.039
-- it wouldn’t fly through the air the same way a softball would, because the hammer’s mass isn’t distributed evenly.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.880
Likewise, a pendulum with a big ball on the end of a very light string -- called simple pendulum --

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.080
would behave very differently from a pendulum that uses a heavier stick -- what’s known as a physical pendulum.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.370
In these situations, it’s more useful to
describe what the center of mass is doing.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.849
When you throw the hammer, for example, it’ll
rotate around its center of mass.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.710
So, what is the center of mass?

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.029
It’s basically the average position of all
the mass in the system.

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:08.479
Say you have a 3 meter long stick -- which we’ll pretend is massless -- with a 2-kilogram ball stuck on either end.

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.800
It’s easy to see where the center of mass
should be -- the mass is distributed symmetrically,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.449
so its center is going to be right in the
middle of the stick.

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.759
Now, let’s say you have another 3 meter
stick, and on the left side there’s a 2

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.379
kilogram ball, but on the right side, there’s
a 4 kilogram ball.

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:25.029
This time, there’s twice the mass on the
right side of the stick.

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:29.180
So when you’re trying to calculate the average
position of all the mass attached to the stick,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.409
you’re going to be counting the right-hand
side twice as much.

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:35.949
That means the center of mass will be two
thirds of the way along the stick,

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.720
closer to the 4 kilogram ball.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.220
It’s like each piece of mass pulls on the
center of mass a little bit, so parts with

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:45.490
more mass end up pulling harder and moving
it closer.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.629
But if you don’t want to calculate this
in your head -- and if there are like seven

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.999
different particles to deal with, you probably
won’t -- but there’s an equation for it!

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.059
First, pick a starting point to measure from,
where x = 0.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.040
That can be the end of the stick,
the middle of the stick, whatever’s easiest.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.480
As long as you’re consistent.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.900
Then, the center of mass will be equal to
the sum of each individual mass, times its

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:09.050
distance from the starting point, all divided
by the total mass in the system.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.300
Let’s try it for our stick with the differently-weighted
balls.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.340
We’ll choose the left side of the stick,
where the 2 kilogram ball is, as our starting point.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.700
The 2 kilogram ball’s mass times its
position is zero.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.260
The 4 kilogram ball’s mass times its position
-- 3 meters -- is 12 kilogram-meters.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.920
And the total mass of the system is 6 kilograms.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.219
So, divide 12 kilogram-meters by 6 kilograms,
and you get 2 meters.

00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:32.890
That’s the position of the center of mass,
which is two thirds of the way along the stick,

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.669
toward the 4 kilogram ball’s side.
Exactly what we figured out earlier.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:40.840
I’m telling you all of this now, because
from here, we’re heading off in a totally new direction.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.080
Literally!

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.980
But for now, you learned about collisions, and how momentum and impulse can be used to describe them.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.900
We also talked about the differences
between elastic and inelastic collisions,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.550
and how to calculate the center of mass of
a system.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.860
