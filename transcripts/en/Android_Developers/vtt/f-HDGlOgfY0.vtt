00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.480
 I moved home to Singapore about 2 years ago from the US. 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.920
 One of the biggest reasons why I decided 
 to move home was to spend more time with my mom. 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.440
 That was about the same time that I met my co-founder Lily as well.  

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.200
 Both of us were at the stage of our lives 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.640
 where we were spending more time with 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.160
 our aged parents and in-laws. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.680
 We want to build a solution that provides quality home care 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.480
 to enable independent living at home. 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.600
 We felt that we could combine Lily’s background in health care 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.640
 and my background in business and technology 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600
 and create this improved experience within the home care space. 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 When our seniors are not well 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.800
 they would not want to check themselves into the hospital 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.680
 and lose the control of their lives. 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.760
 All of them want to be cared for at home. 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 Homage app creates the accessibility 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.120
 to people who needs care for themselves and for their loved ones. 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.600
 My work start at 9 o’clock and end at 6.30 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.080
 so my mom will be alone during my office hours. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.440
 She told me that she cannot take care of herself 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.360
 like bathing, clothing and simple cooking. 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.520
 Calie was selected from Homage to be a care pro for my mom. 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.120
 She’s very friendly and she told me 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.640
 ‘No worry, you can just go to work and I will take care of her’. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.520
 Calie also took some pictures 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.880
 so I know what she has done for my mom 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.400
 It’s very convenient. 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.920
 At anytime, anywhere - I can know what’s going on. 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.040
 So the Start on Android program really made 
 a huge difference in our mobile app development. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.160
 They were invested in our growth, in the experience we were providing our users. 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.560
 Every single discussion was anchored around 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160
 how can we improve this experience 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.320
 Whether it’s in material design, in UI/UX. 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.880
 They have been helping us look at it from a user’s perspective. 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.840
 One of the key outcomes of being part of the Start On Android program 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.760
 is that we got featured on the Play Store recently. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.680
 It’s been so great to have this support of not just having a great team but also 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.160
 members within the tech community like Google Play. 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 I would absolutely recommend the Start on Android program to other startups. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.920
 A lot of the value is in just getting external feedback. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.040
 Often times you can develop in a vacuum 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.880
 and just having skilled experts tell you
 “these are the areas that you need to improve on” 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.200
 you can really fast track the way you deliver these improvements to your users. 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.040
 Our aspiration is to build a huge community of caregivers 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.400
 who are trained and happy to help anyone. 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.400
 With our Homage app, help will just be a click away. 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.440
 All these seniors can age in confidence knowing that 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.280
 there’s always help around for them.
