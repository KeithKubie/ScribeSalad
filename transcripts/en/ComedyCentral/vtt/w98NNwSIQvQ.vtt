00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:02.936
Oh, no, it's an honor.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.138
I can't believe
I'm someone's Make-A-Wish.

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.340
His name's Jason.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.109
He's nine, he's gonna die,
like, yesterday.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.310
Oh, my God.

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:11.545
You'll be fine.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.117
( monitor beeping )

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.519
Hi, hi!
Hi, hi.
Hello.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:19.753
Welcome.

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.189
He's, uh,
right over there.
Okay.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.024
Hey, Jason, I'm Amy.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.727
Um, I brought
this for you.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.630
Oh...

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.731
Your headshot.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.832
Okay.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:37.171
Uh... I just want you
to know that you're--

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.438
you're really special

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.607
and, um...

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.209
and everything's
gonna be fine.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.545
( monitor beeping )

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.346
Well, I'm realizing
that I bit off

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.814
a little bit more
than I could chew.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.583
It was an honor
meeting you.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:51.785
Oh, whoa, where-- where
do you think you're going?

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.053
I was gonna go
get my car.

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.521
Don't you know
why you're here?

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.522
I thought I was
just supposed

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.257
to come
and meet-- meet Jason.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.258
Did I do something
wrong?

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.394
Roast me.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.695
Roast you?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.065
It was our son's
last wish

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.702
to be roasted by
a professional comedian.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.370
Okay.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.839
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.540
making fun of your son.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.276
You think I give
a bitch queef

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.179
what you are
comfortable with?!

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.180
Okay.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.515
Okay, okay.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.383
Okay.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.518
Um...

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.520
Nice bed--

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.323
Why don't you get some more
tubes in your nose, weirdo?

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.091
( nervously chuckling )
Is that even a joke?

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:33.927
Okay, uh...

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.829
Where's the rest
of your hair?

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.798
Is it, uh,
at the hair parade...
Oh, God.

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:38.866
.. where there's
no hair?

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.101
Enough with
the softballs, please.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.135
Okay.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:43.403
This is really hard.

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:46.373
Hey-hey, hey,
little man.
Hi.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.374
How ya feelin'?

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.475
Terrible.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.811
Well, at least you feel
the way you look.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.346
( laughing )

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.914
Am I right,
am I right?

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:55.015
Nah, I'm just jokin',
I'm just jokin'.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.383
You're dark and handsome.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.118
If it's dark...
you're handsome.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.853
( laughing )

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.788
Okay, I gotta go,
I gotta go.
( whispering )
That's good.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:02.789
( laughing )

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.057
LOL.

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.626
( man )
Oh, he's good.
Amy, take notes.

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:07.594
Those-- those were
hack one-liners

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.062
from the Internet.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.631
What?
The Internet.

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.933
You know, the thing you
won't be on in three weeks.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.268
Wow, Amy.
Hey.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:15.269
That's not the direction
we're going in?

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.270
No.
Listen...

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.604
He's ready for a laugh

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.106
but, y'know, could you
please make sure it's funny?

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.242
Yeah, put some kind of
twist on it.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.744
Has he been there
the whole time?

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:24.878
( woman )
Knock, knock.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.381
( Jason )
Lisa Lampanelli!

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.415
My first choice.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.784
It would either be me
or the Grim Reaper.

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:31.885
( laughing )

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.921
That's good.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.522
We heard that you booked
a Toyota commercial.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.291
You weren't
available, I...

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.960
Well, that explains
why Amy Schumer's here.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.296
The girl's a miracle worker
with her comedy.

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:44.765
If she's funny,
it's a miracle.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.767
( all laughing )

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.768
( man )
That's terrific.

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:48.802
Beat it!

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:49.903
( man )
Yeah, beat it.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:50.904
Hey, wait a minute.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.139
Who's dying here
first?

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.008
This guy...
or this guy?

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.644
( all laughing )

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.112
( woman )
Excuse me.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.747
Are you Amy Schumer?

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.282
Yeah.
You have HPV.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.251
We've been trying to
reach you for seven years.
