00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:02.936
- [Voiceover] So I have
the graph of y is equal to

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:06.381
f of t here, our horizontal
axis is in terms of time,

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.115
in terms of seconds.

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.183
And this type of function
is often described as

00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:14.294
a square wave, and we see that
it is a periodic function,

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:18.101
that it completes one
cycle every two pi seconds.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:22.552
And so we could say its
period is equal to two pi,

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.160
if we wanna put the units
we could say two pi,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.327
two pi seconds per cycle,
we could write it like that.

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:32.657
We could also just write s for seconds.

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.849
And its frequency is
gonna be one over that.

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:39.004
So we could write its
frequency is equal to one over

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:42.671
two pi cycles per second,
cycles per second,

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:48.011
it could also be described as hertz.

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:50.029
And what we're gonna
explore in this video,

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:53.059
is can we take a periodic
function like this and

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.599
represent it as an infinite
sum of sines and cosines

00:00:56.599 --> 00:01:00.294
of different periods or
different frequencies?

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.175
So to write that out a
little bit more clearly,

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:05.755
can we take our f of t,
so can we take our f of t,

00:01:05.755 --> 00:01:10.297
and write it as the sum
of sines and cosines?

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:13.248
So can we write it, so
it's going to be sum,

00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:16.643
let's say baseline constant,
that'll shift it up or down,

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.989
and as we'll see, that's
going to be based on the

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:23.024
average value of the
function over one period.

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:26.650
So a sub zero, and
then, let's start adding

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.783
some periodic functions here.

00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:32.616
And so let's take a sub
one times cosine of t.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.606
Now, why am I starting with cosine of t?

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:40.095
And I could also add a sine of t,

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:42.762
so plus b sub one, of sine of t.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.750
Why am I starting with
cosine of t and sine of t?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.862
Well, if our original function
has a period of two pi,

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.903
and I just set up this one so it does have

00:01:55.903 --> 00:01:58.251
a period of two pi, well
it would make sense that it

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.271
would involve some functions
that have periods of two pi.

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.935
And these weights will tell
us how much they involve it.

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:07.307
If a one is much larger
than b one, well it says,

00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:09.557
okay, this has a lot more
of cosine of t in it,

00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:12.628
than it has of sine of t in it.

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:14.973
And that by itself isn't going
to describe this function,

00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:16.362
because we know what this would look like.

00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:18.895
This would look like
a very clean sinusoid,

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.472
not like a square wave.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:23.812
And so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna add sinusoids

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:26.788
of frequencies that are
multiples of these frequencies.

00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:30.955
So let's add a sub two, so
another waiting coefficient,

00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:36.541
times cosine of two t.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.159
This has a frequency of one over two pi,

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.954
this has twice the frequency,

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:44.133
this has a frequency of one over pi.

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:47.883
And then a sub three
times cosine of three t.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:52.349
And I'm gonna keep going
on and on and on forever.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.211
And I'm gonna do the same
thing with the sines.

00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:58.378
So plus b two sine of two t
plus b three sine of three t.

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:07.396
And you might be saying,
well, okay, this seems like

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:09.978
a fun little mathematical exercise,

00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:12.092
but why do folks even do this?

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:16.064
Well this was first
explored, and they're named,

00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:18.440
series like this, infinite
series where you represent

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.187
something by essentially
weighted sines and cosines,

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:23.951
this was explored originally by Fourier,

00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:25.562
and they're called Fourier Series.

00:03:25.562 --> 00:03:28.549
And they were interesting
to him in the study of

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.646
differential equations,
because a lot of differential

00:03:30.646 --> 00:03:34.813
equations are easy to solve
when you involve sines

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:40.212
and cosines, but not as
obvious to solve when you have

00:03:40.212 --> 00:03:43.952
more general functions, like
maybe a square wave here.

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:45.423
But if you could
represent that square wave

00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:47.551
as sums of sines and cosines,

00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.485
then all of a sudden you
might be able to find

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:53.708
more general solutions to
your differential equations.

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:56.006
Another really interesting
thing about this,

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.975
and this is really the
foundation of signal processing,

00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:02.692
it's very used, it's heavily
used in electrical engineering,

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:06.109
is you can view these
coefficients as they are,

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.494
they're weights on
these cosines and sines,

00:04:08.494 --> 00:04:10.384
but another way to think about it is,

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.504
they tell you how much
of different frequencies

00:04:12.504 --> 00:04:14.769
that this function contains.

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.710
So, for example, if a one
is much bigger than a two,

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.922
then that tells you that
that function contains

00:04:21.922 --> 00:04:25.331
a lot more of the one over
two pi hertz frequency

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.098
than the one over pi frequency.

00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:32.015
Or maybe a three is bigger
than a one or a two.

00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:36.156
And so you can start to
say, hey, this helps us

00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:38.781
start to think of a function
not just in terms of the time

00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:42.213
domain which f of t does,
but it can start bringing us

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:44.354
to saying well, how much do
we have of each frequency?

00:04:44.354 --> 00:04:47.266
And as we'll see with Fourier
Series and eventually,

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:49.248
Fourier Transforms, that's
going to get us into

00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:52.219
the frequency domain,
where we can start doing

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.272
some signal processing.

00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:56.615
So we're going to explore
all of that in future videos.

00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:58.077
In order to understand how we can actually

00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:02.358
find these coefficients, we're
gonna review a little bit

00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:04.807
of our trigonometry, especially
integrating trig functions,

00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:06.500
and then we're gonna solve for these,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.545
and we're gonna see how
good we can approximate

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:09.795
our function f.
