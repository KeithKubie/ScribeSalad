00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.250
In the last video, we saw that
if Ben's Shoe Company's stock

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.440
prices are trading
at $21.50 per share,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.620
and if Ben's Shoe Company
has 10,000 shares--

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.550
and we saw that over here on the
left, if it had 10,000 shares.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.160
Actually both of the shoe
companies have 10,000 shares.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.360
Then the market is
essentially valuing the equity

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.310
of Ben's Shoe
Company at $215,000,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.280
even though the book value
of the equity was $135,000.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.240
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.520
think about what does
that mean, or how

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.350
should we perceive
the market's value

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.070
of the assets of
Ben's Shoe Company.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.060
Then we can also think
about Jason's Shoe Company.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.700
So remember, assets are
equal to liabilities

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.390
plus the shareholders' equity.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.490
So if all of a sudden the market
value of the equity, the market

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.570
capitalization for
Ben's Shoe Company

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.220
is $215,000, that's the
equity part right over here,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.150
this is the equity.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.910
And the only liability
that Ben's Shoe Company had

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.220
was this $5,000 in
accounts payable.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.900
So let me show you
that right over here,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.640
he had this $5,000
in accounts payable,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.570
also depicted over there.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.410
So the only liability
is this $5,000.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.370
So the liabilities
plus the equity,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.430
in the case of Ben's company,
is $215,000 plus $5,000.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.710
So this piece right
over here is $220,000.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.780
Now, you might remember
from previous videos

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.020
that the book value of the
assets in Ben's company

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.915
are only $140,000.

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:42.710
$20,000 of cash, $100,000
of inventory, $20,000-- this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.580
isn't equity, this
is equipment, I

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.670
should call it--
$20,000 of equipment.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.170
So

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.640
The question is,
what makes up the gap

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.250
here, when we think about the
market value of the equity?

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.480
Because remember, this piece
right here only adds up

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.350
to $140,000.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.890
But our total assets-- or
the market's perception

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.940
of the total assets
of the company--

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.690
are essentially what
it's willing to pay

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.889
for the equity
plus the liability.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.160
So the market is saying that
Ben's assets, the assets

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.090
in that company,
are worth $220,000.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.090
So what makes the difference?

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.380
And even better, let's
assume that Ben has actually

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.990
done a good job of
saying the market

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.487
value of his inventory, the
market value of his equipment.

00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:28.570
Well, what the market's
saying in this situation--

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.770
and this is actually what
tends to happen in general,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.640
the market value of
a company's equity

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.050
tends to be higher than
the book value-- is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.290
that this company has
some type of intangibles.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.570
Things that you really can't put
a finger on, or touch, or feel,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.680
or hold.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.430
But it makes this company's
assets-- or this company

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.620
has more than just
the sum of its parts.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.950
There's more to this company
than just the equipment,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.350
the inventory, and the cash.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.950
It might be Ben's
management expertise.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.932
It might be a certain way
they have of doing business.

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:03.640
It might be a certain
location they have.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.052
It might be their assortment.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.010
Who knows what it has,
but the market is saying

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.180
that the combination of this
plus all of the expertise

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.190
and how the business
is organized

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.970
means that it actually has more
assets than are on the books.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.650
And the same thing is true
of Jason's company, when

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.680
they assign a $120,000
market cap there.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.300
This is the $120,000 in
equity-- market value of equity.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.530
He has another $105,000
in liabilities.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.440
So the market's valuing
their equity plus liabilities

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.247
at $225,000.

00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:37.830
Is that right?

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.240
120 plus 100 plus 5.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.030
So 225,000.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.700
So once again, they're valuing
all of the assets at $225,000,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.520
because assets are
equal to liabilities--

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.291
these are the liabilities
right here-- plus equity.

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:53.790
So once again,
you're saying there's

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.640
something above and
beyond the $140,000 that

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.312
makes this company special.

00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:01.020
And an interesting
thing to think about--

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.686
and we'll address it
in the next video--

00:04:02.686 --> 00:04:05.970
is which one is a
better deal, considering

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.250
that these companies
are pretty similar?
