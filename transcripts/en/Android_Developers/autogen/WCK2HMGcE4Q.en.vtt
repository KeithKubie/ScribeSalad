00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:11.509
 It is home to wait for the Yes Hello google 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.200
 8 Today is google play charge api tribal beginning with android 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.009
 not to mention 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:21.680
 This is a sequel to the overview of that book api that was broadcasted on August 28 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.140
 I would like to deliver 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 google 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 My name is Ryosuke Matsuto and I am examining developers in android. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.020
 Thank you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.090
 My name is Yoshitsune, who is in charge of content development today. 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 Nice to meet you 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.970
 By the way, I would like you to go around in today and do something like this 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:52.430
 Well, I think there were various sources but especially now 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.430
 While you are providing content in 8 google play 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:04.170
 That's right, the situation is that there is a lot of content on the main up Billing Mu 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.210
 Among them, I bought items for mania items that I often used in knee-up billings, but 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 Comfort woman billing in 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.060
 Say that it will not come to the content purchaser of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.479
 I will win the award 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:23.090
 But why is there a part of it and why is it solved? 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:29.689
 Today there are a lot of things there and that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:36.500
 I think it would be like if it could be, but what about it? 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:40.250
 Billing is an area where we have a lot of inquiries, so it is August 28th 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.110
 It is a little part that was not able to talk in detail 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.350
 I'm going to use that wide board or something this time 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.920
 I would like to explain while please thank you 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.120
 There are quite a lot of quick questions in up-billing and why are you coming all the way 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.420
 High that 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.780
 Well in the background as a very powerful means to monetize with Google Play 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.330
 Attention 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:12.700
 Is that why there is a background that feels like the expectations of the reblopa 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:17.260
 It seems that the company is actually doing great achievements, but even the best Google Play 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:21.770
 But I do not come out I'm getting a cup of Google Play 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 I'm very happy to hear that kind of story but it ends in such a story 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:31.790
 After all, I sometimes use that in up-billing 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:37.319
 Umpa's reflection is slow, so 8 user reviews are bad and the view is skipped 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.769
 I can not handle that great claim 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:45.760
 We had to expand such a user support team 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.790
 You will be asked to respond to google play 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.470
 How can I solve it? 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.550
 Well, the first thing I want to mention is that the number of inquiries for that child is actually in Japan 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.160
 Not limited situation 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.150
 That's what we do 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:08.000
 That's right, even when I came for sightseeing, I have a lot of inquiries 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:11.580
 Oh, it's great, but I'm also a huge cancellation 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.850
 There is a delay and you talk about what to do 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:20.319
 You've seen it for two hours and three hours 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:24.579
 Even people meeting people meeting people in Japan Korea and a situation that is heard 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:30.790
 We have received a lot of similar inquiries to google now in America Europe. 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.079
 It seems that I would like to talk about that a little more today, so I will 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.260
 Assorted 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.260
 That's right, could you please enter the slide for a moment 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:57.410
 That's right from now on the fact that it will be broadcast on August 28 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:02.800
 Well it was a rough explanation of the story why the notification can be sent, but this is this today 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:07.810
 It is a crossdresser who needs to talk completely 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.550
 It's just that I can not send it to me, but how can I solve it? 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.430
 that 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:17.609
 You can tell me the details, so it's true that other than that 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.909
 This August 28 and this today 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.849
 google developer and not the live page, so many questions 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:31.259
 Because we receive each one, 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:35.099
 I bought the question of yes for the question on August 28 after the question of 5 minutes and the truth after a while. 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:37.600
 I would like to receive Mr. Rosa after the day 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:41.780
 Well then, it will be convex in the same state. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.760
 5Because it is the one who reported it 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.910
 Just explain 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.249
 Then let's move a little 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.169
 Actually I do not replace a lot of fun cameras in the same room 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.560
 Yes 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.560
 net 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.280
 Yes yes maybe 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.590
 Awesome Sanko's 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.460
 I wonder if it's okay 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.780
 Hmmm-really 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.370
 Today is this 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.180
 Something causes something to be treated as a pride and Africa is used by 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.060
 While 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.440
 I would like to explain briefly 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.780
 Purification 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.710
 Well first of all, the app calls request purchase first of all. 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.040
 request 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.440
 Start with sending to Google Play 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.020
 so 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:46.470
 The problem is that what happens after that moment 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:50.720
 So how are we making recommendations for our sample programs? 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.720
 I would like to briefly explain the existence of 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.470
 Well that generally 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:01.270
 Please change the 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:05.969
 Let's write and see 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.119
 And 8-7 numbers 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.119
 Ah 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.520
 48 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.020
 There are some 50 routes in some of the things that go out of the app and the moving fortune tellers 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.530
 go in 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.530
 activity 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.740
 In the sample program of that rice field ring 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.740
 in addition to tbt 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.479
 In addition to that with the broadcast receiver 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.889
 There is a module called 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.889
 Oh dear 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:01.030
 Generally in general 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.030
 Because it is included, from Google Play 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.960
 It's cool, it's in 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.790
 It is from google play 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.960
 First blue for cast receiver 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.960
 Tifa position in up 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:33.720
 A certain broadcast receiver 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.760
 The app receives notification from the example of the sample program of that sample program example 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.520
 Then 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.150
 After receiving that once in service 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:46.730
 For 6 pm 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:49.720
 get Target Panfes also asserts that the tool that sent the request 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.720
 Play from site 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.430
 For cast receiver 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.430
 artis state change way 

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:13.960
 I am sorry for the small size 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:20.380
 Receive these notifications on the broadcast receiver Yes 

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:24.420
 In this Peenap beam sample code in general these are forwarded to service 

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:28.830
 In the service that is 4 to the service and doing rice Shogi in the service 

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:32.690
 When the result is reflected in the activity 

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.769
 It has become a flow of love 

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.680
 so 

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:37.500
 If this 

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:41.659
 Wait 

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.659
 Where can I make a mistake? 

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.840
 As a possibility 

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.330
 It is now said that the role played by Woo 

00:08:52.240 --> 00:09:01.940
 From the broadcast receiver to the service or its Tocky's version service from 

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.600
 It's right when you pass it out to the activity 

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.070
 so 

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.410
 Sound is good by having a lot well 

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:12.209
 I wonder if this is me 

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:16.200
 This is great too 

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:19.370
 Or it does not move if it arrives in the first place 

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.370
 It is said that I can not hear 

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:28.399
 It seems that the trouble is happening or it is a group day 

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:31.820
 In fact 8 because there are so many inquiries of that child google but 

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:33.270
 I am doing a lot of analysis and analysis work 

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:38.760
 that 

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:41.939
 Probably he seems to be 5 times in comparison with the food of the inquiry 

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:47.059
 It is late or not reached 

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:51.679
 According to the analysis of the google side if the delivery date is not good 

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:56.599
 I would like to do almost without the result 

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:59.869
 I'm sending it almost haste, but there's still a record that I'm sending almost as fast 

00:09:56.599 --> 00:10:01.280
 Huh-it was just 

00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:05.330
 that 

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:08.170
 What are we thinking of being the most angry? 

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:11.870
 Hunt delivery 

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:16.910
 Something is weird after sending a book at 

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:20.110
 What is wrong with something? What is wrong? 

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:23.139
 After this arrival 

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:27.220
 When hunting for my brother and I 

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:33.480
 If there is not enough memory, Google Play is first and foremost 

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:35.410
 When it comes out to the front of the failure It is the terminal that the memory is not enough 

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:40.240
 At that time 

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:44.139
 Well, for example, the broadcast router has arrived but before it reaches service 

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:48.579
 The app has been terminated due to lack of memory 

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:52.390
 Or I received the service but before I reflected it on the screen or saved the database 

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:55.730
 The app was closed when there was not enough memory 

00:10:52.390 --> 00:11:01.519
 If it happens even once 

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:03.640
 This is the next delivery of this Inap's auxiliaries are now fan's subtlety 

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:09.690
 From the app 

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:12.830
 Until it is given, it has become a tumor of redelivery. 

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:16.110
 If you move even once, this damage is large 

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:22.050
 If you miss even once, for example the next delivery 

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:26.579
 If you're lucky few seconds school If you're unlucky you'll be in a few minutes if you're lucky 

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.240
 The user seems to be late as they have to wait forever 

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:29.810
 so 

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:35.610
 If it is the best 

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:41.100
 If you fail to be the first goddess first, then it will be 3 seconds 5 

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:47.250
 Or after 30 seconds it is spreading like Japanese 

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:51.059
 That this is not necessarily a sense of trying 

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:53.510
 Anyway, let's not miss the city bar first delivery 

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:54.790
 It is important importantly 

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.940
 Yes 

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:02.430
 The first delivery 

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:05.280
 What does a large thread to make it go a long way? 

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:10.140
 If you take it straight as the code 

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.699
 There is a possibility that it may fall out of place, so this is included in the sample code 

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.089
 It is not 

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:14.410
 that 

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:19.830
 Oh dear 

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:24.570
 Specializing in the moment received by the muddy speaker and receiver 

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:29.540
 Recently google said that please write to a file or database 

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.540
 We strongly recommend the rice 

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:37.899
 When I write in, I'm going to go see a little if it's a little useless 

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:43.030
 I went in black and I should go 

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:46.390
 When you receive 200 power with a broadcast receiver 

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:49.950
 Dokhan point with blog cast receiver 

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:54.170
 Well this is ok Well by this company 

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:57.690
 I use different storage methods each 

00:12:54.170 --> 00:13:02.930
 In a certain s-class light database 

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:07.870
 In another company, you can use text file 

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.870
 And another business person's life preference 

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:22.139
 For the time being, as soon as something is received by the blog cast receiver 

00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:23.080
 Yes, if you leave data in the app 

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:27.810
 so 

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:29.329
 Even if you write from this service on 8 sites 

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:34.110
 It's ok 

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:35.370
 Because I do not know that this service is also always terminated or forced 

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.640
 that 

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:43.170
 Well this is also a bit still a bit of our evaluation formula 

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:45.400
 You should write from within the broadcast receiver 

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:48.140
 I should write here from service 

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.850
 This is still from us 

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.660
 Clear guidance y 

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:57.160
 It is important not to treat 

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:59.180
 Take one second, for example 

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.790
 that 

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:08.900
 If it takes processing 

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:10.089
 It is said that there is a good chance that the app will end up in the meantime 

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:16.230
 To 

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:20.430
 20 I hope you know this is the google play ui still this time 

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:23.730
 It is said that it appears on the screen as android os 

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:27.350
 If this idol does not have enough memory 

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:30.860
 Because shut down is the specification of android 

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:36.170
 That is not wrong even if this 5 ends 

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:38.380
 I have to write to the place where it will not disappear immediately from receipt 

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:41.350
 Say it will mark 

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:44.730
 I guess things are happening 

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:50.279
 Well, that's the current understanding from google 

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:53.390
 At this moment in the moment you actually received it on the broadcast receiver 

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:58.640
 For example, I wrote bread in shared preferences 

00:14:53.390 --> 00:15:01.930
 Or at the moment of receiving it from the brand cast receiver at the service 

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:04.950
 It is consumption of how many milliseconds already 

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:08.290
 Only 10ms or 20mm 

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:10.110
 I already have a car in between 

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.529
 Because there is a millisecond 

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:17.520
 Between 

00:15:12.529 --> 00:15:20.550
 It's like writing to the database in a quick attack 

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.910
 I'd like to request processing from google 

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:25.939
 By 

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:31.250
 In fact this is some business operators 

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:34.410
 I think that I was stable as a result of doing this 

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.769
 The story that says 

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:41.050
 some 

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:43.059
 As we heard that it was a change plan stay, so that customers can also purchase fairly smoothly 

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.000
 The story that it became 

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:47.720
 U 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.650
 After we give this advice from us 

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:56.690
 I heard that it is right here once 

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:58.690
 Oh, it's a baby, it's a text file, it's a preference, it's a preference and you write 

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:02.670
 Whats received 

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:07.580
 When the app is launched next time 

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:13.840
 Well, if there is data left here, continue the process and steal it 

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:16.060
 After you write, for example, continue the process with the service etc, and of course until the end 

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.370
 If you can go 

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:22.620
 As it is 

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:26.580
 Let's enter it, but I can't cut it on the spot as it is, and the end 

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:32.209
 You will delete the data here 

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:35.499
 Of course we recommend that you have that kind of mechanism 

00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:35.499
 What's important is that 

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:42.490
 I received it here and write it in a fast attack, so it's Kapiko so I have a quick attack now 

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.480
 The love of notification 

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.480
 Not once in a group 

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:58.990
 That of the two 

00:16:53.670 --> 00:17:00.240
 Please return it there and by doing so 

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.970
 that 

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.680
 I agree 

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.860
 Well for network saving 

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.140
 There is neither a loss nor a waste of one 

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:11.449
 It can be saved 

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:18.439
 I think there is no known data 

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:20.380
 Save in haste and return there and then 5 os shuts down the app 

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:24.270
 Also okay 

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.270
 Make this process a guardianship function 

00:17:24.659 --> 00:17:32.559
 This is very effective 

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:38.530
 It is a story. This is very important and very 

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:40.480
 Well, that common mistake is that 

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:45.460
 In the other round 

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:49.750
 No matter what you save it in memory after receiving 

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:54.669
 If I try my best to handle my brother and I without saving in the database 

00:17:49.750 --> 00:18:00.470
 It is a pity because I was only in memory when I was shut down on the way 

00:17:54.669 --> 00:18:02.500
 I will not be open until I come back again until twice the good guy fly from the end 

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.870
 It will be said that it will not come out without it 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:09.940
 In fact this is 

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:10.610
 It is the time until the second half marketing of various apps comes back by us 

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.600
 Of 

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:17.880
 Measure 

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:23.430
 If there is no problem with the app, change this in a moment for collaboration 

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:26.150
 After coming out of Anouchi cup to the rush and coming back soon with some app of the body it comes back 

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.740
 It takes a long time until 1 minute 

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.430
 I think 

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.230
 Like that 

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.210
 That things are frequent 

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:38.740
 Hijon Well 

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:41.440
 Possibility of failure in the part of this or the reception or this part 

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.600
 I do not know 

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.480
 Because 

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.900
 This is very 

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.900
 Precious 

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:57.040
 I'm told that this was really quite effective, so the scale 

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:58.590
 The border that gave me this explanation 

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:04.350
 In part 

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:07.740
 If you actually review the implementation and implement it, it will improve significantly 

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:10.370
 Yes, I would like to mention one more thing 

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.470
 What is saying? 

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.820
 There is no state 

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.080
 From service 

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:19.830
 I ran for a while, but I was able to finish it 

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:24.539
 Of course there can also be a state of 

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:27.750
 In such a state, Inaf notify purchase state change 

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:31.670
 You can fly and have a professional speaker and receiver. 

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:34.530
 Is it okay to try something? 

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:39.420
 Unfortunately in the world 

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:44.650
 Unfortunately there is something even if you receive something here when activities or favors are not running 

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:47.640
 I'll come in after I can do nothing 

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.360
 It is good to have failed to receive 

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.590
 One big factor 

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.370
 Become a heart 

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.370
 Yes 

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.690
 Yup 

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:04.390
 Well this is already 

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:07.020
 This is only the furious tiger description This very important or not super important 

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:10.440
 I think that this time around 

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:14.020
 Yes it's a topic but the remaining time is 

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.059
 Damage to the question and answer sidewalk 

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.100
 Shall we 

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:19.640
 High in time 

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.640
 I agree 

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:26.620
 It will not return if it is possible to correspond 

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.620
 I will not return to that chair Yes 

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:38.510
 Yes that's a little 

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.510
 Here 

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.910
 For 28 days 

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.910
 Delicious 

00:20:50.580 --> 00:21:01.500
 Is displayed and registered 

00:20:53.049 --> 00:21:08.370
 Question that we were not able to introduce head buff this broadcast and this August 28 broadcast enough 

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:11.660
 If you let me follow you as much as I can today 

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:16.000
 Measure First of all 

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.000
 I hope the culture of August 28 can be 

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:21.000
 Let's go 

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.000
 Would be nice 

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.170
 Service service 

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:39.870
 Hmmm 

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.870
 The question is whether there are a lot of stories 

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:53.360
 After that I asked about it from before, but about Google Play Card again 

00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:59.740
 It's a card gift that I can not say yet. 

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:59.740
 Now we only service in the United States Thank you 

00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:10.419
 I am in love with a list of questions 

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:27.059
 It looks like a day 

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:32.630
 Let's go to Hydere 

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:36.110
 Well first August 28 yes my 

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:40.700
 How is the noise lake west last? 

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:44.000
 Let's read a little Jaguar taste Get after purchase item with subscription 

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:47.510
 I received a visit by sending purchase pin formation 

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.950
 The action of order lead restoration which is included in the data of up 3rd place without turn 

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:52.650
 I sent and visited 

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:53.760
 in up 3 India data meat rounds with orders do not match what kind of thing 

00:22:52.650 --> 00:23:00.240
 Is it 

00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:04.080
 Oh, this is the case of Ams subscription and the case of usual inapubilingu 

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:10.419
 If the value you should have in your key is totally different 

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:13.499
 In that case, please use purchase token as key 

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:13.499
 is called rid 

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:24.870
 This will of course occur from the order with another order id etc if it is the next month if time passes 

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.650
 First and foremost 

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.980
 Also in the order 

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:34.720
 Order Eddy is said to be on the way 

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:36.410
 It's a phenomenon or this is a specification, but if there is a time that has happened 

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:41.810
 In that case too 

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:44.390
 A party called Sudo-kun, which is distributed from Google Play together with the wooden case in the up 

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:48.980
 Yes based on value 

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:49.230
 Well there is no problem if you can identify the order 

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.830
 of 

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:57.680
 By all means this is not a regular subscription 

00:23:52.830 --> 00:24:02.390
 In the case of purchase, I think it is better to use the order id 

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:04.340
 One of the subscriptions identified a good deal with a purchase token 

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.610
 It is 

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.549
 Yes 

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:11.799
 User minutes 

00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:11.799
 Is the question of b good on the next page? 

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.250
 Yup 

00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:24.909
 Hmm 

00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:28.749
 It is not 

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:40.240
 The best I can't work looks good is buying an item with a subscription 

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:42.340
 When I made a refund, I do not know the expiration date and it remains one month later, but how to shorten the expiration date 

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.450
 Do you have 

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:48.010
 9 questions 

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:50.050
 Arai Musei = Tell me why you can not expire even though you have not received a fee 

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:52.620
 Ted 

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.620
 Oh yeah 

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:58.610
 It is a question of this subscription 

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:02.320
 this is 

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:06.960
 That's why I'm part-time 

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.960
 That's what I did from the checkout unsol 

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:19.050
 This is a very interesting question 

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.050
 a building 

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:31.640
 First of all if you give a refund in the middle of that second month 

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.640
 That's all about that refund 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.600
 Oh that here 

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:51.110
 google play api spec as the city sells and expires 

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:55.760
 There is no basic cancellation until the curve comes 

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:58.279
 In the case of a refund because it is postal service 

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.840
 Stop providing content 

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:05.860
 If you need it, that control 

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.340
 App this side as you may need to make this 

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:13.720
 so 

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:16.539
 If you want to make a refund the soil has arrived to the app or this server 

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:20.080
 Refund with Murai pi or not 

00:26:16.539 --> 00:26:20.480
 If you find that you can not cancel 

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.049
 so 

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.049
 In this case 

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:31.500
 Well create explicit logic to stop and not provide more content 

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.480
 Need to 

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:37.380
 In this 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:40.450
 Anyway, the Google Play subscription api itself is 

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:45.610
 User as much as possible 

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:47.240
 Give priority to providing content to users who are used by 

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:51.800
 Of summer 

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:55.600
 It was something I didn't burn and cut along the way. With Iran 

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.760
 Cosdeco that has become a specification that has not been so far 

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:04.330
 It was shared very much 

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:09.250
 However, not only people who asked a question of that child a little here but also stores that asked various other questions 

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:12.130
 We have received similar requests, so google play continues 

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:16.210
 I would like to consider it, but maybe it might be 

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:17.750
 b As there were not many such times in the business of Chapo 

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:23.590
 As an ellipse 

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:27.880
 That's why I asked this question because I drank on my new return 

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:30.630
 OK I got a bit of a question from Tokyo 

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:36.980
 Yes let's go 

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:42.169
 The top is scary For users who have been paying for a long time 

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:43.360
 I'm thinking about discounts and discounts, but I would like to know how to do it and discounts on 1 year subscriptions 

00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:46.530
 Etc 

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.530
 o 5th floor 

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:55.470
 goo 

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:59.789
 It is unfortunately not possible to change the price of the subscription if it says it as of now 

00:27:55.470 --> 00:28:00.669
 Change of is the preparation that can change the price for one item 

00:27:59.789 --> 00:28:06.879
 so 

00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:09.830
 That's just getting ready, now you're ready to start offering subscription items 

00:28:06.879 --> 00:28:13.130
 Change the price of &amp; 

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:15.049
 It is clear that yesterday is the last in preparation 

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.290
 Date and time 

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:19.080
 If I can not say that Izuke's in the middle of it 

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:25.820
 It is a situation 

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:25.820
 If the feature can be launched this issue is quite 

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.050
 It must have been changed for each user 

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:35.030
 I agree 

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:35.980
 Well what a meeting may be, but in the middle of the user again j or the next 

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:43.150
 a 

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:49.710
 At the time of renewal military or one year of a large family or the like, new child item discount price to its user 

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:49.710
 It is the best impression he can do most now 

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:58.040
 At this point in time 

00:28:53.950 --> 00:29:03.170
 Beautiful solution with black api play standard api 

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:05.779
 So if you have it now, you need to make it agri- culturally after the app 

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:08.169
 I think so 

00:29:05.779 --> 00:29:11.980
 Yes let's ask the next question 

00:29:08.169 --> 00:29:16.239
 Providing content in a one-time subscription model 

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:20.889
 If you start studying, can you stop it? 

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:26.830
 Is there any penalty if you are forced to quit due to circumstances? 

00:29:20.889 --> 00:29:28.160
 ntt is 8 or nr til from google is group 

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:31.870
 Penalty on a 

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:35.100
 I think that I mean that it refers to D NA 

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:39.470
 I wonder if high school will be especially important 

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.470
 I think, from the perspective of the user 

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:48.250
 8 That's right 

00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:54.490
 There is no such thing that a penalty is defined by the rules. 

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:56.580
 In light of general common sense, the provision of services has stopped and money 

00:29:54.490 --> 00:30:01.590
 It is said that 

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:02.600
 There is a lot of people who have happened This will lead to user complaints Yes 

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:06.390
 is not it 

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.840
 In that case 

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:13.070
 Right now 

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.610
 Even with google play server girl api to cancel 

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:19.049
 I can do it 

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:19.950
 How can this user at the river as possible not to happen between the user 6 tatami 

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:21.970
 Do you want to cancel 

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:24.780
 Mouth of procedure is reference 

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:29.789
 From the developer 

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:34.230
 It is necessary to do it, and the procedure is google like google. 

00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:37.520
 I'm going to lose the case separately on that day 

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:42.390
 Well pc or even google bolette's 

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:43.500
 High pay subscription school that was on the web page 

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.230
 Will be written 

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.070
 Procedure 

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:49.070
 In the morning 

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:53.630
 I understand that I was talking 

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:55.009
 Firmly support that after-sales follow user or 

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:58.530
 There is a place to get 

00:30:55.009 --> 00:31:01.130
 That's right where it's important 

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.130
 Yes 

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:05.230
 Feeling ale 

00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:08.289
 It is a thing 

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.140
 Kaname 

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:29.210
 6 hours for initial settlement of subscription expiration date 

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:34.280
 The next high was about 2 hours for a grace period, but the actual voice is 

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:39.030
 The first purchase is at 12 o'clock on September 5 because it became as follows. 

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:39.730
 The expiration date is 18 o'clock on October 5 

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:48.910
 yeah 

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:54.700
 The deadline for 12 people automatic renewal of 5th on October 5th at 7 o'clock on November 5th 

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:59.720
 The next grace period is not 12 hours for purchase + grace period 

00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:08.470
 It will be added at 18:00 + grace period of actual use deadline 

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:17.090
 In the question of whether this is the first time you purchased a subscription when purchasing it 

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:19.740
 Deviation occurs. Deviation of progress and view has been shifted to the next tack and at the time of the next update 

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:24.679
 Enforcement based on which one 

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:27.429
 I wonder if that grace period is a plus 

00:32:24.679 --> 00:32:27.429
 this is 

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:36.630
 This is my own 

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:37.900
 It is a little different from the movement you are looking at, so this was what it was with the introduction purchase at logo 12 o'clock 

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.870
 Tara 

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.070
 Well May 

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:43.360
 2 months this 

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:46.690
 November 5th 

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.690
 Around 14 o'clock in the case I saw 

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:51.940
 That says 

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:56.440
 Most of the term was the expiration date 

00:32:51.940 --> 00:33:00.360
 It's never been a long time 

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.360
 As a subscription 

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:10.240
 The term is always calculated based on the first purchase date The first purchase date 

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:15.850
 It is two months issue class postponement in light of light 

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:19.960
 I'm worried that you are doing calculations like +4 months + 

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:24.710
 It seems like this is growing steadily 

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:30.399
 And just why I'm getting this 19 o'clock is not enough to investigate this a little 

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:30.399
 From the person who was there and compare it with a little 

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:37.430
 peach 

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:41.520
 I'm applying here for a while or for a while 

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:44.580
 Oh, let's go beyond the end 

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:48.990
 Yes it's not charge at all 

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:56.669
 So I'm asking questions about the earnings story, but Bhub police are on other platforms 

00:33:48.990 --> 00:34:00.450
 Profitability in autumn tends to be lower than app market There is labor to cooperate mainly 

00:33:56.669 --> 00:34:05.489
 Get a free app with ads and have a paid version without ads 

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:07.750
 Please let me know if there is a standard edition with a limited edition of the limited edition free version and extensions with a plentiful paid version 

00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:10.990
 Please give me 

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:13.590
 I have a question but 

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:13.590
 this is 

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:22.669
 What do you mean 

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.310
 There is a place that seems to be the point where it depends on the point but recently 

00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:31.480
 It is said that after all it is called a freemium model 

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:31.480
 Download for free and be an item or virtual public 

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:42.550
 Is it most likely to sell in the form of individual and individual charges? 

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:44.929
 At the same time, it is quite important to collect the same users for the app 

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:47.649
 In the way 

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:47.649
 I do 

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:55.790
 Profitability of that charge 

00:34:51.570 --> 00:35:00.210
 Some of the stories I am listening to 

00:34:55.790 --> 00:35:02.690
 The fact is that it is almost the same as it is good per user 

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:07.600
 If you put in sales per person 

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:10.180
 Business person who does not change so much with other platforms 

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.560
 It appears quite recently emerging 

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:17.510
 On the other hand 

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:19.610
 If the sales per person are small for the android, the business operator is still 

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.240
 I'm not here yet 

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:23.800
 I wonder if this is about to break 

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.020
 It depends on the content 

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.280
 Or 

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.430
 quality 

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.350
 I think there are some hypotheses 

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.610
 Talking about the quality of the app 

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.540
 The post is that 

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:39.000
 Compared to other platforms 

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:41.119
 android user base 

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.509
 After the difference 

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:47.650
 In that content as explained today 

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:49.250
 Because adjustment does not go well 

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:53.349
 Charge is good 

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:55.739
 I think that there is a possibility that it will not be lifted by hand. 

00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:55.739
 Something 

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.640
 this is 

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:05.109
 that 

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:11.220
 In general, in-app purchases will last longer 

00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:14.920
 Well paid app and put in the app or entertainment over a longer period 

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:17.950
 The profit is easy to go up, so one by 9 

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:22.540
 Especially the Japanese market 

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:29.619
 In the case of the market in Bangkok, carrier charge accounts for a very large percentage 

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:32.950
 It is the first time to pay with carrier's payment mobile phone charge for the first time 

00:36:29.619 --> 00:36:34.910
 In the exam that the option is for the user 

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:40.099
 Google Play as a Doo 

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:43.579
 For example, Aval's Joy makes it easy for hawks to pay 

00:36:40.099 --> 00:36:46.209
 It seems to be good. 

00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:46.209
 I agree 

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.780
 A paid app is 

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:56.710
 Of course someday from now on 

00:36:53.170 --> 00:37:02.380
 It is continued as method of offer of offer, but 

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:05.160
 Now that's tremendous growth is in-app billing, so some of the official version is in-app 

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:10.829
 It is said that we buy by charge 

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:11.460
 It seems that it will fit well if it is good to do the laundry 

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:12.020
 That 

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:17.630
 Hmm 

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:19.630
 One good point is that you don't have to put pressure on the terminal's memory. 

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.260
 How far that user's 

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:24.950
 The terminal you have 

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:28.570
 There is also one place where that old can go 

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:30.640
 I think it will be the point in making a business 

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:35.859
 I can say 

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:39.910
 Well what's the difference in the audience, for example, android google 

00:37:35.859 --> 00:37:44.980
 I do not ask all users to play credit cards 

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:47.770
 I'm not writing for not asking I think that the difference due to that may come out the war 

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.930
 Of course it will come out 

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.579
 Toto users are 

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:54.700
 Spend money 

00:37:51.579 --> 00:37:57.670
 The charge will already come true 

00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:01.500
 It may be easy 

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:03.559
 The difference seems to come out a little bit 

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.470
 Oh yes 

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:12.080
 And the part here is still that 

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:18.890
 I think that there are various parts to consider in various ways, so it is the same at the tasting party again 

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:26.009
 Well, since time has already come to an end today, it's up to here today that charge 

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:30.749
 App business firmly on Google Play including meetings 

00:38:26.009 --> 00:38:36.329
 By the way, I hope that you will make it up 

00:38:30.749 --> 00:38:38.299
 Although there is no charge until now, there is still a lot of inquiries.
