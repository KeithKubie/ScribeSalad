00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.859
Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, this is Crash Course
Study Skills, and with this video in particular,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.080
I want you to promise me you’re not going
to click over to another tab to look at cats.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.840
In exchange I’ll pretend that’s not exactly
what you did during the last four videos.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.500
In all seriousness though, I do want you to ask yourself: when’s the last time you were able to sit down and intensely pay attention to one task for a long time?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.220
If you’re anything like me, this has become
harder and harder to do as we’ve added more
distractions to our lives –

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.180
tweets, snaps, messages, browser tabs, cookies
that must be clicked – they’re in endless supply,
while your brain’s ability to resist them is, sadly, not.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.360
So that’s why today we’re turning our
attention to attention itself.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.480
Cue the intro.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.240
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.460
Before we get into any specific tips, let’s first
answer the question of what attention really is.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.180
Put simply, attention is the process of focusing your cognitive resources on one particular stimulus or source of information while ignoring all others in the environment.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.040
Understanding this definition is important
because there are two main forms of attention.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.500
The first is top-down, or voluntary attention, which
is based on “task demands” like needing to read a
page in a textbook or solve a math problem.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.540
On the other side of the coin you’ve got
bottom-up, or stimulus-driven, attention.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.360
Just like it sounds, this is automatically
focused attention due to stimuli in the environment
– SQUIRREL.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.540
When you use your top-down attention to focus
on something, your brain activates inhibitory
mechanisms to block out competing stimuli.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.000
It can’t do this forever, though; these mechanisms
eventually tire just like the muscles in our body, and this
leads to something called Directed Attention Fatigue.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.260
This is part of what causes you to become
more and more distracted and less able to
focus on your work as time goes by.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.280
Now, the strength of your inhibitory
mechanisms, and hence your ability to focus
on one task intensely, is variable.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.040
It depends on lots of different factors, including:
- Your environment

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.840
- Your personal tendency to seek novelty when
faced with a boring or difficult task

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.600
- Your interest in the task itself

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.080
- Your brain’s current state, which is dependent
on the amount of fuel or food you’ve got, rest,
exercise, anxiety, and a lot of different factors.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.160
- How long you’ve already been focusing your
attention

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.780
With that in mind, let’s look at several different things that you can do to strengthen your attention muscle and also give it as much ammunition as it can get to focus well on whatever task you need to finish.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.800
The first thing you need to do is stop multi-tasking.

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.060
Many people try to deny it, but your brain
can’t actually do two things at once.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.180
Think of your brain like a single-core processor
in a computer.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.280
These types of processors don’t truly do
multiple things at once –

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.160
they just create the illusion of multi-tasking
by rapidly switching from one task to another.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.180
So while you may think you’re simultaneously
watching this video and looking at pictures of cats

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.740
– which I did ask you very nicely
not to do –

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.800
your computer is actually just jumping
back and forth between each.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.340
But your brain is not good at doing this, which is
why when you switch your attention from one task
to another, you incur a cognitive switching penalty.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.080
Not only do you lose the raw amount of time
it takes to switch from one task to another,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.840
but you also lose the amount of time it takes
for your brain to properly refocus its attention
and get back into the flow of things.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.160
And this can take quite a while, both
because our brains simply take time to
truly focus on a task in the first place,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.560
but also because switching from one task
to another creates attention residue.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.880
As the author Cal Newport explains in his
book Deep Work:

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.400
“...when you switch from some Task A to another
Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.060
a residue of your attention remains
stuck thinking about the original task.”

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.280
This also happens when you switch from the task you’re supposed to be focusing on over to a distraction, and then go back to the task after a few minutes.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.220
As you try to get back into the flow of your work,
you’ll be contending with the attention residue from
that mashup of the Space Jam and Cowboy Bebop
theme songs you just listened to on YouTube.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.700
So, when you sit down and decide to work,
choose one task and make it your only focus.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.540
You don’t have to sit there and work on
it until people mistake you for a hat rack,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.900
but do spend at least 20 or 30 minutes on
it before switching to something else.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.500
Secondly, tailor your environment for better
focus.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.819
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.040
Start by finding a spot, either in your room
or somewhere else, that you use ONLY for studying.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.780
By doing this, you’re establishing a
spot for yourself that has just one context,
and context is powerful.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.580
When your location, the people you’re around, and
all the other pieces of your environment point to a
single activity, you’ll be much more likely to do it.

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.900
When you’re in the gym, your brain knows
you’re there to work out.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.900
And even if you don’t do it, it won’t be because
you’re sitting there trying to decide between doing
a set of pull-ups anddoing your laundry.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.060
A lot of great artists understand this, and
they deliberately find or create spaces that
are only for work.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.220
Some choose to work in cafes, like
Nicholson’s Cafe in Edinburgh, where J.K. Rowling
wrote much of her first book,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.560
and some create isolated work spaces in their
own homes, like the author Steven Pressfield.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.700
Those examples highlight another
important point, actually – there is no formula
for a perfect study spot.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.160
It would seem like a silent, totally isolated desk
in the basement of a library would put the least
amount of strain on those inhibitory mechanisms,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.980
but as J.K. Rowling can attest, some people
actually work better in a noisy coffee shop.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.720
So you might need to experiment a bit before
you find the context that works best for you.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.020
In general, though, the fewer things that
are competing for your attention, the better.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.180
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.700
Once you’ve chosen your spot, prepare
it for your current task by putting away
anything non-essential.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.660
This includes removing books and supplies
that are unrelated, closing any tabs or programs
you don’t need, and putting away your phone.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.160
When you’re doing this, it can also be helpful to
break your current task down into smaller chunks
in order to decide what’s essential to have out.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.380
The act of writing a research paper is a
good example here;

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.640
if you just think, “I have to write a paper,”

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.470
and then prep your study space for that
task, then you’ll have the internet open the
whole time so you can do research.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.140
But in reality, you can break that task
down into several phases – brainstorming,
researching, drafting, and editing.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.080
And once you do that, you’ll realize you
only need the internet for that research phase.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.680
During all the other ones, you can close it
and cut its potential for being a distraction.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.180
All those cats are still gonna be there later,
I promise.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.280
Also, anticipate potential distractions that
might come up and try to get ahead of them.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.960
Maybe put your phone on do not disturb so no one
can text you, or tell your friends you’re studying and
ask them not to bother you for a while.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.060
Anything you can do to mitigate future distractions
will help you to stay focused and finish your work faster.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.300
Once your study environment is established,
the next area you should look to improve is
your actual ability to focus.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.220
As we talked about before, your attention
is like a muscle; it’s something you can train
over time to get stronger.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.490
One of the best ways to do this is by learning
to resist cravings for novelty.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.530
These are the sudden urges you get to check
Snapchat or watch video of a corgi jumping into a
lake while you’re working on your English homework.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.360
You get these cravings because, by default,
your brain doesn’t like boredom or hard work.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.220
But the strength of these cravings is set
by how often you give into them.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.920
Our actions create habits and expectations
in our brains, and these become hard-wired
patterns of behavior.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.340
And this means that every time you give into
that craving for a distraction, you’re ingraining
that decision as a habit.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.700
Luckily, you can also train the opposite behavior.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.160
By acknowledging a craving for novelty, and then
deliberately ignoring it and getting back to work,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.480
you start to build a tolerance for boredom and wean
yourself off of that need for constant stimulation.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.240
As you do this, your ability to focus on your
work strengthens.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.020
You’re building that attention muscle.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.060
Now, doing this is easier said than done – especially
at first.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.860
However, there are tools you can use to give your
brain some extra firepower in the early stages.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:55.200
Apps like Cold Turkey and StayFocusd can block
distracting websites entirely, while a tool like Forest
encourages you to ignore your phone by letting you
grow virtual trees.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.640
And when you don’t need a tool like the
internet for your work, disconnecting it eliminates
its potential for distraction entirely.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.889
Of course, even with training, your brain’s
ability to focus still diminishes over time.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:11.640
Unlike computers, which are built to run all the time
as long as they’ve got a steady supply of resources,
our brains operate on a cycle of work and rest.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.840
Your circadian rhythm, which governs your
sleep and wake cycle, is the best example – but
it also applies on the smaller scale as well.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.320
After a certain amount of work, you need to
take a break.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.700
Now the amount of time will vary from person to
person, but a good guideline to use is 25-30 minutes.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.060
Once you’ve spent that long on a task, if
you feel your attention waning, take a break
for a few minutes.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.520
Stand up, stretch, walk around a bit – maybe
get some water.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.980
During these short breaks, it’s important
not to switch to another task or get involved
in something distracting,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.900
as you don’t want to create that attention residue
that makes it harder to get back into your work.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.320
After a few work sessions with these short
breaks in between, you can then take a longer
break to recharge.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.200
And during these longer breaks, it’s fine
to switch to something easier or do something
fun for a little while –

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.420
as long as you’re planning in advance when
these breaks will happen.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:59.500
That way, you’re deliberately choosing when to
work and when to indulge in distractions, rather than
letting your mind be ruled by cravings for novelty.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.120
Now, as time goes on, you’ll probably find
that you can go longer and longer before
needing a break.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.340
This is a good sign that you’re building
those attention muscles.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.680
But realize that you’ll always have a limited
amount of focused energy you can expend in a day.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.260
Eventually, you’ve got to call it quits
and go relax for a bit.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.159
And relaxation isn’t the only thing your
brain needs.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.020
To keep being able to focus and improve
long-term, you need to take care of your
brain’s biological needs as well.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.860
We often think of the brain as this non
physical, ethereal realm that isn’t bound by the
same limitations of our bodies.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.800
You know, “mind over matter” and all that stuff.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.960
But your brain is still part of your body,
which means that it needs plenty of sleep, nutrients,
and exercise to work at peak efficiency.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.120
So if you’re still struggling to focus,
look at your health habits.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.020
Make sure you’re getting at least 7 hours of
sleep per night, eat healthy, and try to exercise
once a day, even if it’s just a short walk.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:51.580
These things all take time, but – to quote
Deep Work once again: High Quality Work =
(Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.980
Taking care of your brain will allow you to
focus more intensely when you do decide to work.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.860
Of course, making that decision to start
working isn’t always easy,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.460
which is why next week we’ll be tackling what is
probably the biggest problem students struggle
with, which is procrastination.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.440
I’ll see you then.

00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:08.860
