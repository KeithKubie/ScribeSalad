00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:11.939
How many times does the chorus repeat
in your favorite song?

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.572
And, take a moment to think,
how many times have you listened to it?

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:21.519
Chances are you've heard that chorus
repeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.239
and it's not just popular songs in the West
that repeat a lot.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.792
Repetition is a feature that music from
cultures around the world tends to share.

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:34.455
So, why does music rely
so heavily on repetition?

00:00:34.455 --> 00:00:39.937
One part of the answer come from what
psychologists call the mere-exposure effect.

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:44.084
In short, people tend to prefer things
they've been exposed to before.

00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:48.135
For example, a song comes on the radio
that we don't particularly like,

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:51.421
but then we hear the song at
the grocery store, at the movie theater

00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:53.606
and again on the street corner.

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:56.311
Soon, we are tapping to the beat,
singing the words,

00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.555
even downloading the track.

00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:02.135
This mere-exposure effect doesn't
just work for songs.

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:06.164
It also works for everything 
from shapes to Super Bowl ads.

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:10.016
So, what makes repetition so
uniquely prevalent in music?

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:14.505
To investigate, psychologists asked
people to listen to musical compositions

00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:16.960
that avoided exact repetition.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.281
They heard excerpts from these pieces
in either their original form,

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:24.623
or in a version that had been digitally
altered to include repetition.

00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:26.675
Although the original versions
had been composed by

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.726
some of the most respected 
20th century composers,

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:33.984
and the repetitive versions had been
assembled by brute force audio editing,

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:38.647
people rated the repetitive versions
as more enjoyable, more interesting

00:01:38.647 --> 00:01:43.250
and more likely to have been
composed by a human artist.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.718
Musical repetition is deeply compelling.

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:48.894
Think about the Muppets classic,
"Mahna Mahna."

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:49.979
If you've heard it before,

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.181
it's almost impossible after I sing,
"Mahna mahna,"

00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:56.547
not to respond, "Do doo do do do."

00:01:56.547 --> 00:01:58.451
Repetition connects each bit of music

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.092
irresistibly to the next bit 
of music that follows it.

00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:06.122
So when you hear a few notes,
you're already imagining what's coming next.

00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:08.366
Your mind is unconsciously singing along,

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.609
and without noticing,
you might start humming out loud.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.383
Recent studies have shown that when
people hear a segment of music repeated,

00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:18.287
they are more likely to move
or tap along to it.

00:02:18.287 --> 00:02:22.630
Repetition invites us into music
as imagined participants,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.081
rather than as passive listeners.

00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:26.622
Research has also shown

00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:30.410
that listeners shift their attention
across musical repetitions,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.136
focusing on different aspects of
the sound on each new listen.

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:36.970
You might notice the melody
of a phrase the first time,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.971
but when it's repeated, your attention
shifts to how the guitarist bends a pitch.

00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:46.183
This also occurs in language,
with something called semantic satiation.

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:48.984
Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:52.002
can make you stop thinking about 
what the word means,

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:57.073
and instead focus on the sounds:
the odd way the "L" follows the "T."

00:02:57.073 --> 00:03:00.086
In this way, repetition can 
open up new worlds of sound

00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:02.853
not accessible on first hearing.

00:03:02.853 --> 00:03:07.203
The "L" following the "T" might not be
aesthetically relevant to "atlas,"

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:11.492
but the guitarist pitch bending
might be of critical expressive importance.

00:03:11.492 --> 00:03:13.960
The speech to song illusion
captures how simply

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.639
repeating a sentence a number of times
shifts listeners attention

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.690
to the pitch and temporal
aspects of the sound,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.371
so that the repeated spoken language

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:26.144
actually begins to sound
like it is being sung.

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:29.185
A similar effect happens with 
random sequences of sound.

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:33.430
People will rate random sequences
they've heard on repeated loop

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.624
as more musical than a random
sequence they've only heard once.

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:41.181
Repetition gives rise to a kind of
orientation to sound

00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:46.063
that we think of as distinctively musical,
where we're listening along with the sound,

00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:49.632
engaging imaginatively with the note
about to happen.

00:03:49.632 --> 00:03:54.150
This mode of listening ties in with our
susceptibility to musical ear worms,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.660
where segments of music
burrow into our head,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.089
and play again and again,
as if stuck on repeat.

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:03.109
Critics are often embarrassed
by music's repetitiveness,

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.382
finding it childish or regressive,

00:04:05.382 --> 00:04:09.752
but repetition, far from an embarrassment,
is actually a key feature

00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:14.109
that gives rise to the kind of experience
we think about as musical.
