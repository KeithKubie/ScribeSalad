Speaker 1:          00:01          Before launching into a pension today. I thought I would just take a few moments to look back over the books that we've read and talk about the visions of language that they have offered us and also just to reflect for a moment on the relationship. Imagine between those visions of language and what is happening outside of fiction in in what we might call the real world. We started this course talking about black boy and the way that a whole world of pressure, political pressure, racial tension pushed on the borders of that work and actually changed it's very material form. After that I began a series of readings of novels that emphasized more what you might call the history of literature, the history of literature, forms and ambitions and so beginning that series we had O'Connor embodying a new critical craft of fiction that comes out of modernism imagining nevertheless that that craft is reflective of a transcendental order in the world or religious order.

Speaker 2:          01:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:33          When we moved on to Nebach off, we had an author trying to imagine a work of art, so autonomous from the world that it could be something like an autonomous form of life. That of course I argued in those lectures, opened it up for the threat of mortality. If you imagine your artwork is living at can also die. It's a kind of haunted Agnus that surrounds Nepal, coughs, vision of aesthetic bliss. Um, as one's response to that autonomous artwork, Kira whack represents a whole group of writers. The beats who reject the formalism embodied by both O'Connor and Novaka off.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:27          They reject that formalism as an impediment to languages access to the real and to our access to the real through language. They dream of an unmediated relationship between experience and the word. They don't think so much of language as a mediating force, as an expressive force.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:57          I argued in my lecture second lecture on, on the road that in the end that dream looks quite deflated when Dean can't even speak in a coherent sentence and he has to be rejected by sal. As Sal drives off to the jazz concert. At Carnegie Hall. Nevertheless, that dream is spiritualized. It's a way of becoming, not just, uh, close to the real, but also part of some mystical unity. That thread of the mystical quality of language at its extreme of literary power is what I drew out of Franny and Zooey. So Salinger two has the dream that the artifice of literature of Literary language, the performance of language and the style of his novels can somehow be the essence of the human soul. That it can somehow, uh, communicate the truth of the universe just through its form, its human distinctive form. It's a way of thinking about form that has more to do with, uh, individuality than it does with convention. Remember that way that Franny can identify the Tambour of her brother's voice, very specifically, it's like no other.

Speaker 2:          04:38          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:39          so sound, you're imagines that the literary art imitates that kind of voice and in that way it is a sacred practice, a sacred art.

Speaker 2:          04:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Barth rejects the idea that language is an unmediated form of access to the real, absolutely impossible for Barth to countenance that idea. He sees life as continually, always already mediated by language. Now I should say as as, um, someone from the class who came up to me after lecture asked me about this, that Barthes understanding of language as preceding human understanding proceeding any sense of ourselves in a sense always slipping out of our control is very much in concert with what was going on at very high level language theory at that time. So the work of Jacques Lacan in France in the 1950s and sixties, and of Jacques Derrida who brought deconstruction to the United States actually to Johns Hopkins, first of all in the 1960s where Barth was teaching, he presented that work in a famous lecture, um, in the late sixties. This is all part of a way of thinking about language that became very powerful through the next decade and a half.

Speaker 1:          06:11          And we're going to see it some too next week. Uh, when we read Morrison and Maxine Hong Kingston. So this is part of a larger intellectual trajectory. Barth is not alone in thinking these things about language. I argued that Barth tried to counter that sense of helplessness at the hands of language by imagining that the human effort at connecting with another person through the mechanisms of love and desire always renewed the possibility for language to do new kinds of work in the world. So if language seems exhausted because it's always preceding you, everything has always already been said, there's no new plot to be had. The world is full of stock phrases. How do you use them to embody and experience that seems fresh to you. How do those stock phrases alienate you from the very experience you hope that they can describe? He thinks that following out desire can renew language and mentally ad I think is his attempt at doing that.

Speaker 1:          07:27          So now we arrive at pension and I want to suggest that Barth was still dreaming of a pretty autonomous version of the literary art, even though in his 1987 preface to loft lost in the fun house. I don't know if any of you read it. Um, he, he says about these stories which were published throughout the 60s. The high sixties, like the roaring twenties was a time of more than unusual, more than usual ferment in American social, political and artistic life are unpopular. War in Vietnam, political assassinations, race riots, the hippy, counterculture, pop art, mass poetry, reading street theater, vigorous avant garde ism in all the arts together with dire predictions not only of the depth of, of the novel, but of the more abundant t of the print medium in the electronic global village. Those flavored the air we breathe. Then along with occasional tear gas and other contaminants, one may sniff traces of that air in the funhouse. I myself found it more invigorating than disturbing me. The reader find these stories. Likewise, it's a very interesting little comparison he makes at the end. He takes that whole foment of 1960s politics and counterculture. And essentially he says, I found that invigorating as I hope you will find these stories invigorating as if the stories in this very almost seemingly hermetically sealed literary world that he offers us are somehow meant to have the effects of a whole decade of foment social foment.

Speaker 2:          09:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:16          If Barth only gestures towards that world, the politics of that decade pension actually lets us, uh, see it. And if you look on page 83, uh, this is just one of many, many examples, but I choose this one just because it's so obvious.

Speaker 2:          09:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:44          Add a pie is going to Berkeley looking for Emery boards and she comes a on a summer, weekday in the midafternoon.

Speaker 1:          09:56          No time for any campus at a new have to be jumping yet. This one was, she came down slope from Wheeler Hall through Sather Gate into the plaza, teaming with Corduroy Denim, bare legs, blonde hair, horn rims, bicycle spokes in the sun, bookbags swing card tables, long paper petitions dangling to earth posters for undecipherable, f. F. S. Ms y a. N. S. Y v. D sees suds in the fountain, students nose to nose and dialogue. She moved through it, carrying her fat book attracted, unsure, a stranger wanting to feel relevant, but knowing how much of a search among alternative universes it would take. Four, she had undergone her own educating at a time of nerves, blandness and retreat not only among her fellow students, but also most of the visible structure around and ahead of them. That whole world of government and, and social life at a Pi is an a different generation of a different generation, but we can see the social foment just in that little snapshot of the Berkeley campus. Those, I don't know all of the acronyms. I don't know what the fsms are, but the why ETFs are the young Americans for freedom. The vcs are the Vietnam Day committees. Um, the Vietnam Day Committee organized a 24 hour teach in, in 1965 against the Vietnam war.

Speaker 2:          11:26          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          11:26          There's a little anecdote from that teach him that I want to share with you that I think embodies some of the tensions in this knob.

Speaker 2:          11:34          Cool.

Speaker 1:          11:37          They invited Ken Keasy to come and speak at the convention at the teaching. Now, Ken Keasy, uh, some of you probably know was a sort of performer, writer, not really an activist. Um, he was a purveyor of street theater and most famously the advocate of LSD and he and his merry pranksters would a ride around the country doing street theater advert advocating the use of LSD and marijuana. Um, who in 1964 do you think drove their bus, which was called further. Who Do you think drove their boss? Neal Cassady. Neal Cassady drove their bus when they came to the Vietnam Day at the Berkeley campus. Keasy addressed the assembled people saying, turn your back on the war. Look at the war. Turn your back on the war and say, fuck it.

Speaker 2:          12:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:40          This is a group of people he was addressing who were intent on doing something to stop the war. And this was keasy his response. That moment for me embodies these, this tension right at the senator of the 1960s, attention between countercultural self development and an ethos of play drop out, uh, tune in. I can't remember. Keys, these little hole, a little motto. Um, essentially leave the institutional life of America. That means schools, government, politics, all those traditional sources of water and create disorder. And do that as a way of finding what's true about yourself. Do it in the company of others. It had this communal aspect for sure. On the other side, you have a growing political movement among young people. And of course it's legendary. By 1964, the civil rights movement had accomplished amazing things. So as a result of the freedom rides, they had integrated interstate transportation at great cost to the volunteers who wrote those buses.

Speaker 1:          14:05          They were beaten. Uh, some were killed, civil rights workers were murdered in various states. Um, it had come to a kind of crescendo with voter registration drives and the voting right act rights act of 1964. At the same time, uh, Lyndon B Johnson was ratcheting up of the Vietnam War. So the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was passed in 1964 which authorized bombing raids on Cambodia. This was a new turn in the war and it promised to escalate it. And this really galvanized, especially student resistance. So this was a time of major political stakes and young people at universities, primarily at universities, but also people out doing the march on Washington, uh, in the south, in small towns, we're really changing the face of America and its role in the world. So can keasy on the one hand is looking for that internally directed playful response to the oppressive order of the world. And then there's this very political response pension let's us see both and he's parodying both kinds of response in this novel. So in that sense, the novel is very much of its time. Now I want to, uh, pause for a moment there and asks you a question. I want you to think about what kind of protagonist pension sends out into this world. What do you think of [inaudible]? How does she strike you as a character? How would you describe her?

Speaker 2:          16:04          Yeah, that's true.

Speaker 1:          16:05          Desperate. Okay. How else? Yeah, powerless. Powerless. [inaudible]. Confused. Confused.

Speaker 2:          16:16          What else?

Speaker 1:          16:18          Those are all pretty, um, pretty negative adjectives. Does she bring any resources? Yes. She's attractive. Yes, she is. What else? What other resources does she bring? Yeah, she's curious. She's curious. Yeah. What else? Anything else determined [inaudible] when this book first came out, critics called her a lightweight. Was that a word that ever occurred to you? Did anyone think this is just a fluff character?

Speaker 2:          17:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:03          I would suggest to you that the difference in your response and the critics is a difference. The difference that feminism in the 70s made, um, in the 1960s to have a protagonist go into the world and discover this incredibly complex set of patterns. Uh, and to have that protagonists to be a housewife was very much playing against type. So pinch and took a certain kind of risk by choosing to make his protagonist to housewife. So the question is why did he do that? I want to suggest to you that he did that because a woman is to occupy certain conventional roles at this moment and we see her in one at the very beginning of the novel. She is, has just come back from a Tupperware party where the waitress or the hostess put too much cure in the punch. So she's a little drunk. So you get this image of her as this stereotypical 50s housewife going to Tupperware parties and then she makes salad. She does the shopping, she picks her herbs from the garden, she makes Lasagna, she mixes drinks so that they'll be ready when mucho comes home, when her husband comes home. Very typical. So this is the moment in which she discovers that she's been chosen or named as the executor tricks of Pierce's will.

Speaker 2:          18:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:39          It's that conventionality that then allows her to occupy multiple roles. And let me just, um, detail some of those. You see it almost in language of a side. Um, this is when she first meets Gangas Cohen. Yes. Now the names in here, we have to think about them at some point. Um, one thing you can say about them is that they are funny. A second thing you can say about them is that they seem redolent of meaning. I can't tell you how many scholars have come up with different readings of what Ed oppose name means. That's just ed a. And then there were so many hundreds of others. Um, they are redolent of meaning. What are we to do with that fact? That's a question for you. Three, they declare that language is always mediated, always mediating that your experience of people is never clear of some set of meanings that someone else has assigned to it. Your encounter with the world is always mediated. So these names drag associations with them and one question you want to ask is what to do with those, but I'm going to set that question aside for a moment and note that at at meeting Gangas at a puff felt at once motherly.

Speaker 2:          20:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:11          Now this may seem like a small aside, but if we look also on 73 when she meets Mr Thought, she says on the, on the very top topic he's telling at OPA her dream, his dream, and she sees in it clues to the third and taxes mystery, Oedipus sensitized, thinking of the bronze marker smiled at him as granddaughter Lee as she knew how and asked did he ever have to fight off desperadoes. And then of course, she gets a major clue for figuring out what the whole story is behind the truth stereo and the post torn granddaughter Lee. It's a role she can occupy, uh, with great ease. A last example on one 22

Speaker 1:          21:13          this is when she's going to meet, uh, Emery boards at upper showered, put on a sweater skirt and sneakers, wrapped her hair in a student like twist, went easy on the makeup. These are her resources, makeup, clothes, hair with them. She can occupy all these different roles. And in doing so, she has access to certain kinds of knowledge. Her roles are s fluid in some ways, as Pierce's were. Remember that when Pierce calls her, he's always impersonating someone. So he was speaking with his Lamant Cranston voice the last time that she spoke to him. The difference between the way at Hipaa occupies these various roles and pierce did it, is that adipose roles have a kind of traction in the world with other people that, that pierces voices or even Dr Hilarious. His voices simply don't have these male versions of it are all. So apparently performances that they can't, uh, they can't get much out of them except to a noise at a pub.

Speaker 1:          22:40          But at OPA jumps right into these conventional roles. And in that act comes to know more about the world in a way that these men cannot add a Pi is even from, from the time she was a child, a reader. And we find that out on page 14 when she has her religious instant. And I hope you remembered that scene of um, sal looking down on Salt Lake City, the birthplace of, of Dean from on the road. Very similar structure. He looks down and he sees the little city laid out, uh, below him. So this is at OPA. In one of the first instances of her becoming a reader,

Speaker 1:          23:35          she looked down a slope needing to squint for the sunlight. This is when she first sees San Nurses sent, I'm sorry, San Narcisso onto a vast sprawl of houses which had grown up together like a well tended crop from the dull brown earth. And she thought of the time she'd opened a transistor radio to replace a battery and seeing her first printed circuit. The ordered swirl of houses and streets from this high angle sprang at her. Now with the same unexpected astonishing clarity as the circuit card had, though she knew even less about radios than about southern Californians. There were two both outward patterns, a hieroglyphic sense of concealed meaning of an intent to communicate. There'd seemed no limit to what the printed circuit could have told her if she had tried to find out. So in her first minute of San Narcisso, a revelation also trembled, just passed the threshold of her understanding.

Speaker 1:          24:31          Smog hung all round the horizon. The Sun on the bright beige countryside was painful. She and the Chevy seemed park at the center of an odd religious instant, as if on some other frequency or out of the, I have some world wind rotating too slow for her heated skin, even to feel the centrifical coolness of words were being spoken. She suspected that much. She thought of Mucho her husband trying to believe in his job. Was it something like this? He felt looking through the soundproof glass at one of his colleagues with a headset clamped on and queuing the next record with movements stylized as the handling of Chrism Sensor Chalice might be for a holy man, yet really tuned in to the voice voices, the music. It's messaged surrounded by digging it as were all the faithful at went out to, did Mucho stand outside studio a looking in, knowing that even if he could hear it, he couldn't believe in it.

Speaker 1:          25:28          She gave up presently as if a cloud had approached the son or the smog thickened and so broken the religious instant, whatever it might have been. Yeah. Here the cloud becomes the obscuring of this sense of intent to communicate or a sense of meanings pattern, but it still retains as it did in Flannery O'Connor. That spiritual sense that the divine is always shrouded round. Bye. Some cloud of unknowing here. We see her with the desire to know and the difference between her as a child and her in this moment is that she had not bothered to find out if she had tried to find out about the radio circuit, she would've learned something. She did not try this time she will try. So she's a reader who notices patterns even from a young age and at this moment she has called upon and she rises to the occasion to figure out what the pattern will mean. And of course she progresses through a kind of education as a reader. She goes from being a reader who can listen. For example, to the ambiguity's in the war finger play. She can hear when the ambiguity creeps in between the words and that tells her that she needs to find something out. That's what causes her to have the curiosity to go backstage.

Speaker 1:          27:08          She becomes a critic. She moves from interpretation to actually finding the history and the intertextuality and the variations of these additions of the play. She learns history of the u s and of Europe about the mail systems. She learns the history of [inaudible] enterprises. So she becomes a scholar in a certain way in amateur scholar. She's not just a reader. She is someone who actually performs research. Where does all this get her? Well, I think, uh, what we're led to believe is precisely nowhere in terms of revelation. Does a revelation ever happen? Of course, the book ends with her waiting for the anonymous bitter to reveal himself. Whether that would ever happen if pension had decided to let us in on the secret, I don't know. Pension instead chooses to end the novel before that moment.

Speaker 2:          28:21          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:21          and so we're left with a kind of emptiness. We're left with the multiple options

Speaker 2:          28:27          that

Speaker 1:          28:30          she laments. If you look on one 46 one 47, she rehearses all the possibilities

Speaker 2:          28:41          of meaning

Speaker 1:          28:48          and her conclusion. Finally.

Speaker 2:          28:50          Okay,

Speaker 1:          28:54          is this San Narcisso, was the name an incident among our climatic records of dreams and what dreams became among our accumulated daylight, a moment's squall line or tornadoes touchdown among the higher, more continental solemnities storm systems of group suffering and need prevailing winds of affluence. There was the true continuity. San Narcisso had no boundaries, no one knew yet how to draw them. She had dedicated herself weeks ago to making sense of what in virality had left behind. Never suspecting that the legacy was America and then I'm going to skip down a little bit so she could never again call back any image of the dead man to dress up, pose, talk to and make answer. Neither would she lose a new compassion for the CULDESAC. He tried to find a way out of for the enigma has efforts had created. What we don't get here is a sense of whether there really is an alternate secret postal system that serves a sort of underground of private networks. We don't ever get a sense of whether these stamps and the signs that she sees everywhere in San Francisco when she travels through the city in the night, whether these things are a coherent meaning

Speaker 2:          30:24          or

Speaker 1:          30:27          whether they are her fabrication, we don't really know and she never really can say all she has is the sense that there is this pattern. Now there are two things that she's left with in the passage. I just read that sense of sooner so being all of America and moreover of it being constituted of storm systems of group suffering and need to remember all the little sub communities that she interacts with have some sort of pain or a loss associated with them. The inner Morati anonymous for example, people who don't want to love, it's all comedy, but then there is a heart, a colonel, and if we look on page one oh one one oh two we can begin to see what that heart or kernel is that recuperates what I would call the sentimental. So this is when she's in San Francisco looking around the city. She's come, they're hoping to escape the network of symbols that she has seen all those post warrens and instead she's immersed with a new network of them.

Speaker 2:          32:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:02          We're told just before the morning rush hour, she got out of a Jitney who's ancient driver ended the day in the red ended each day in the red downtown on Howard Street, began to walk toward the Embarcadero. She knew. She looked terrible knuckles black with eyeliner and Mascara from where she'd rubbed mouth tasting of old booze and coffee through an open doorway on the steer leading up into the disinfectant smelling twilight of a rooming house. She saw an old man huddled, shaking with grief. She couldn't hear both hands smoke white covered his face on the back of the left hand. She made out the post torn, tattooed and old ink. Now beginning to blur and spread fascinated. She came into the shadows and ascended creaking steps hesitating on each one. When she was three steps from him, the hands flew apart in his wrecked face and the terror of eyes gloried in burst.

Speaker 1:          32:52          Veins stopped her. Can I help? She was shaking tired. My wife's in Fresno. He said he wore an old double breasted suit. Fred Gray shirt wide tie. No hat. I left her so long ago. I don't remember. This is for her. He gave out a letter that looked like she had been carrying around for years and he tells her to drop it in the, in the w a s t e lady. Um, can waste. We're not allowed to see waste. Remember? Uh, and then she is gripped with, as she says, uh, overcome all at once by a need to touch him as if she could not believe in him or would not remember him. And she reflects just above that on the mattress that he must sleep in. And this is one of those great pension, uh, sentences. This is a question, but it comes in the declarative form to what voices over heard Flinders of luminescent God's glimpse to among the wallpapers.

Speaker 1:          33:57          Stained foliage, candle stubs lit to rotate in the air over him. Prefiguring the cigarette he or a friend must fall asleep someday. Smoking. Thus to end among the flaming secrets salts held all those years by the insatiable stuffing of a mattress that could keep vestiges of every nightmare. Sweat, helpless over flowing bladder viciously. Tearfully Kunz consummated wet dream like the memory bank to a computer of the lost. It's assertive. Um, Aria of description and pension can string those clauses together like no one else. Uh, there are even longer examples in the book and I'm sure you notice them at our pod needs to actually touch the man. And when she finally sort of takes him in her arms, the position she assumes looks like that of a mother with her broken sun and the image is much more specifically of Michelangelo's Pieta. And remember the Lago DPA tough figures prominently in the novel both as the site of the, um, the route of Gis in Italy and the lake, uh, from which their bones are taken to make charcoal filters for cigarettes.

Speaker 1:          35:18          So the PA ta the image of Mary with Jesus' body broken from the cross on her lap is repeated and here at a puck comes to inhabit that position. It's not a social role in the that she could be granddaughter, Lee or motherly. On those other occasions, it's a religious image. It's also a, a gendered religious image. It's also an aesthetic image. But here it's infused with her compassionate approach to this man. And remember in the passage that I read about in varieties, estate, what she sort of left with as her final understanding. She has a kind of compassion for peers and the way that he had surrounded himself with this network of holdings that he had tried to escape from in some way. So if you cannot finally have a pattern resolve into a clarity of truth or meaning, what you can do instead is in habit a role where you will be in contact with the very material of social life. And that's what that mattress is totally imbued with the bodily detritus of a human life actually have many human lives. She reflects later on the set of all men who had slept on that mattress.

Speaker 2:          37:03          Okay?

Speaker 1:          37:03          Pension wants to imagine a very physical repository for the social and especially for the human aspect of dimensions of the social. That's why Adam [inaudible] has all these men stripped away from her. Remember she says it as she's growing more and more desperate at the end that her men were being stripped away from her one by one. And so when she comes to be isolated in this way, she can finally see and meditate upon in a new way. All those systems of communication. And she has that vision of the telephone wires and she looks up at them as she's just doubted all the possibilities for making sense of the post torn in the true Stero. She looks up at the telephone wires and she thinks about all the messages unintelligible full of human longing going back and forth across those wires. So if pension gives us, uh, the pattern of meaning rather than meaning itself in this novel, he also gives us a vision of what it means to embody that pattern. This is very different from Nabar coughs, idea of embodiment as a kind of alternate or rival creativity. Remember, I argued that Lolita has a dead child and she dies in childbirth in a way because it's a kind of creativity that novakof wants to cancel or that Humbert wants to cancel.

Speaker 2:          38:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:45          In this novel, it's not arrival. Creativity, it's what creativity has to be in the literary sense. Now pension was a student of Nobach offs for a couple of years at Cornell university in the early sixties so he took, he took courses with Nabokov. I don't know how close they were. Um, but he certainly learned a few things from to back off. This is something he revises from that old teacher. He is imagining a literary form that is soaked in the stuff of social life. So if you only get a sniff of the tear gas in Barth here, you get a whole draft full of it. And what I think he is rejecting, if you look on page 95 oops, that's not the one I want.

Speaker 2:          39:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:50          Yes, it is 95 if you look on page 95 here's a different vision of what the artwork could look like that I think we're meant to put next to that vision of at a Po with the suffering sailor.

Speaker 2:          40:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:06          This is when it first occurs to her that the whole world is being organized around her. Nothing of the nights could touch her. Nothing did. The repetition of symbols was to be enough without trauma as well, perhaps to attenuate it or even jar it altogether loose from her memory. She was meant to remember. She faced that possibility as she might the toy street from a high balcony roller coaster ride feeding time among the beasts at the zoo in a zoo. Any death wish that can be consummated by some minimum gesture. She touched the edge of its voluptuous field knowing it would be lovely beyond dreams simply to submit to it that not gravity's pull laws of ballistics feral ravening promised more delight. She tested it. Shivering. I meant to remember each clue that comes is supposed to have its own clarity. It's fine chances for permanence, but then she wondered if the gem like clues were only some kind of compensation to make up for her. Having lost the direct epileptic word, the cry that might abolish the night.

Speaker 2:          41:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:23          This is a meditation on both the joy and the loss of literary substitution for the real or for the truth, the substitution of abstract pattern for something like comprehensible meaning. So here she's kind of enthralled with the idea that these gem like clues, that's a very new Nabokovian moment. The gem like clues that are gathering around her would be a compensation for the loss of that real access to revelation. And this has this religious sense to it. It's not just the religious instant of looking down at San Narcisso, it's the religious sense of the capitalized word that comes back a couple of times towards the end of the novel, the epileptic word, the word capitalized always refers back to the beginning of the gospel of John, where John Describes Christ as the word made flesh. The word was with God and the word was God. And the word was made flesh and came to dwell among us.

Speaker 1:          42:34          So pension is using that religious vocabulary, not just the religious imagery of the PA ta, but the religious vocabulary of the capitalized word. So you can have a kind of system of symbols that's gem like and pleasurable and that calls you to submit to it as it does here for at OPA. But in the end there is something more that her search will produce. And that is the moment of compassion. And I would submit to you that, um, tears are just all over this novel. I don't know if you noticed it, but, um, there are many, many examples. I'll just give you a few. Um, first of all, there the tears that accumulate in her bubble shades when she's in Mexico looking at the Remedios Varo painting of the women in the tower embroidering the long tapestries that become the world. So that sense of isolation in the tower makes her weep on one 17. Can see another example.

Speaker 2:          43:44          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          43:45          Um, this is, uh, mucho talking about the Muzak, um, at up of the human voice. You know, it's a flipping miracle. His eyes brimming reflecting the color of beer. One 13.

Speaker 2:          44:00          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          44:02          this is doctor hilarious crying. Tears Sprang to hilarious. His eyes, you aren't going to shoot. He says, um, one 46 in her moment of desperation when she loses her connection to the MRI motto and anonymous, um, or when she's about to talk to him, she waited in explicable, tears beginning to build up pressure around her eyes. Um, back on one. Oh, this is the nurse, uh, who has just escaped from doctor. Hilarious. He thinks someone's after him. Tear streaks had meandered down over the nurses cheekbones. It's not just that we could explain any of these moments of tears. It's that pension describes them, all notes them all. So this is a novel that's full of people crying, which is an odd thing to think about when you think back to pensions reputation as a metaphor actional novelist, as someone preeminently preoccupied with the formal aspects of fiction, what you find when you actually open up pensions novels is an incredibly rich world of human detritus of history in gravity's rainbow.

Speaker 1:          45:31          He did enormous amounts of research in newspapers, um, from the Second World War in London where some of this is some of the novel is set so that you can go to newspapers and find the ads that he talks about in the novels. So he combines this very attentive set of details, which are not always and often are not at all the aesthetic details with which Novaka filled Lolita. I remember when I asked you about the specificity of America and on the road and asked you to think about whether there was anything there at all in on the road. There isn't anything in the back off there is, but it's usually aesthetic how things look. The look of a hotel, the look of a field, the look of a child, the look of a woman in pension. Often these are somehow social details about people talking to other people, political things, um, places and how houses are arranged.

Speaker 1:          46:45          But there is a sense that these are social worlds, not just patterns, even though at the beginning that's how adipose sees them as she goes further and further into her search for knowledge. And finally her abandonment of that search of knowledge. Um, she sees more and more that this is not just pattern, that it's these storm systems of suffering and need. So I think this is what pension brings to the string of meditations on what language can do and what the novel is for that. I began my lecture today with just recapping for you. He's trying to imagine a novel that meditates both on these structures of meaning that imbue the real world, such that there's no name that isn't already saturated with associations and that within such a world, if you enter into it, you can come to encounter the real and the real is that sense of suffering and that the novel can make you feel things, both the pleasure of humor or the pleasure of beauty, but also that sense of compassion.

Speaker 1:          48:12          And I don't know about you, but I feel compassion for at OPA. I feel like she's a real character. I think she is a character that you can if not identify with at least you can understand and be interested in. So pension offers us that and in our next reading when we start with Toni Morrison and also in Maxine Hong Kingston, what you're going to see is a kind of shift. So all these meditations on language, these different ways of thinking about how language interacts with the real and what you can do by messing with language are almost, I would say, taken as read, taken as the starting point from which a writer like Morrison or Kingston will begin to rethink how those things can be used in relation to the real world. So that's where we'll start when we think about Morrison next week. Um, let me just also say there are a thousand things to talk about in this novel. So I hope you'll get to some of them in section. And if you want to write about this, it's a very rich novel for writing your papers.
