00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.785
MALE SPEAKER: Almost there.

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:03.715
One hour until social time.

00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:06.200
But before that,
it's social time.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.504
I'm very pleased to announce
Ade Oshineye to the stage.

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:10.420
I've worked with him for
the last three years,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.740
and he's given me a lot
of insights into developer

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.590
experience, crafting
good software.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.360
Today, he's going to talk to
you about growing with Google.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:17.860
Ade.

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:23.510
ADE OSHINEYE: Sorry about this.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.860
Turns out I'm a bit lost.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.430
While we're waiting
for the slides

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.634
to catch up, while
I fiddle with this,

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:31.800
I'm going to talk to you
about Grow with Google (+).

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.550
The parentheses are deliberate.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.550
So I'm a developer
advocate at Google.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.980
I've actually been here longer
than everybody in the room.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.304
I've been at Google forever.

00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:44.762
But I thought I
would take a moment

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:47.130
to find out a little
bit about you.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.270
Because part of
the job of advocate

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.180
is about listening to
what you guys want.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.010
I thought we'd try a
little interaction.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.680
Can you stand up, please?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.480
OK.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.780
So if you've never played
Flappy Bird, sit down.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.350
Stay standing.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.000
Anybody who's got a high
score that's higher than five,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.700
stay standing.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.290
Anybody whose high score
is less than five, sit.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.230
Less than 15?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.580
Less than 25?

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.570
Less than 40?

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.325
Less than 60?

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.702
Just take a moment.

00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:33.710
This is the hard core.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.900
OK, less than 100.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.690
Wait, wait, wait, less than 200.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.620
Ah, it gets interesting.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.740
OK, we're down to the final two.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.710
OK, less than 300.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.970
Less than 350.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.420
OK, less than 400?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.660
Now he has to go.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.570
So I believe he's the king.

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:07.530
So if you follow him on
Google+ and play Flappy Bird,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.639
you'll see his
high score is 358.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.570
356, sorry.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.070
There's actually
somebody I know who

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.434
has a better score than him.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:17.730
AUDIENCE: What device was it?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.050
ADE OSHINEYE: Rich, what
device were you playing on?

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.870
AUDIENCE: Nexus 5.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.040
ADE OSHINEYE: Nexus 5.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.480
AUDIENCE: You have to
find the cheat code.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.510
ADE OSHINEYE:
There's a cheat code?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.415
AUDIENCE: Must have
to get that score.

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:30.070
ADE OSHINEYE: No, it's
called not having a life.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.010
It's a very popular cheat code.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.470
My score is 64.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.650
I did that this morning.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.670
So we've now learned a
little bit about you.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.410
Let's talk a little
bit about Google.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.290
OK, so I'm here to talk to you
about the Google+ platform.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.340
So up until the end of March,
I am a developer advocate

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.991
on Google+.

00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:55.260
From April, we're changing
things a little bit.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.640
We're moving away from this
focus on specific platforms,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.740
specific products, and trying
to think about the world the way

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.050
you see it.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.590
And the way you tend to
see it is you see Google

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.000
as one company, one service.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.550
You don't really care
about our org chart.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.190
You want to think about,
I want to use some service

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.700
from Google, and just
be able to just use it.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.580
You don't want to get
told, oh, I'm sorry,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.422
that's not my department.

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:23.130
You don't want to be
told, oh, I'm sorry,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.720
that's not managed over here.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.305
Please talk to the person in the
right department in New York.

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:28.430
Oh, you're not in New York?

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.540
That's unfortunate.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.530
You'd like a more
holistic organization,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.130
and one of the things we're
trying to do is to get there.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.390
One of the first things we did
as part of that is we set up

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.890
Google+.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.470
Part of this was to
have a unified account

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.600
system for all Google users.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.610
For example, I'll give
you something interesting

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.600
you may not know.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.099
On the third floor
of this building,

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.642
we have a YouTube studio
and a lot of YouTube people.

00:03:53.642 --> 00:03:54.350
And it was great.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.160
We'd bring in
YouTube celebrities,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.270
and every now and again,
somebody would say, hey,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.740
do you know Google is
in the same building?

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.540
And the YouTube guys
would go, well, yeah.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.150
They own us.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.875
And then YouTube celebrities
would say, no way.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:09.750
We'd say, no, really.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.360
It happened several years ago.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.935
And it turns out
people didn't know.

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:17.470
One of the things we've been
doing with Google+ is trying

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.339
to say, can we unify the
experience of Google so that

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.020
if you use any of our services,
you have access to all of them

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.660
as an end user?

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.510
Also, how do we make
sure that if you

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.220
want to use one of our
services or APIs or libraries,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.860
you should be able to use
that in any language--

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.590
except Perl, because we
can't get volunteers.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.340
The idea is that you
should be able to use

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.550
it web, iOS, Android,
it shouldn't matter.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.060
You should have access to it.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.930
So we're thinking about taking
the different platforms we've

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.410
got and making
them work together

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.482
so that we don't have
a Play console which

00:04:50.482 --> 00:04:52.440
is different from the
Google API console, which

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.330
is different to how
YouTube does things.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.610
We want to fix that.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.620
We want to simplify this.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.150
Part of this is also
thinking about metrics,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.630
trying to change what we do so
it makes more sense for you.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.580
So let's try a little survey.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.600
When you guys are choosing
which games to build,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.532
working your games, putting
your games into production,

00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:14.740
what are the metrics you use?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.310
So shout out-- what
kind of metrics

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.169
do you guys use to
measure the success

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.210
or failure of your games?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.470
Retention, anything else?

00:05:26.624 --> 00:05:29.130
Up down?

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.960
Virality.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.540
Anything else?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.040
Installs.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.570
Active users.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.150
Cold hard cash.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.880
That's a good metric.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.542
It's hard to game that metric.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.750
The point is, there's lots
and lots of these metrics,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.590
and as a platform, we need
to be asking ourselves,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.932
how do we help you
optimize these metrics?

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:52.890
How do we help you make
sure that these numbers

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.120
go up and to the right?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.390
Especially that cold
hard cash number.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.620
So what I'm going to do is talk
about the four sets of metrics

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.120
that we're currently
particularly focused on.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.970
Reach, user acquisition and
conversion, user engagement

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.889
retention, and re-engagement.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.680
I'm just going to skim
this because we only

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.504
have about 25 minutes left.

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:15.670
But I just want to give you
a brief overview of some

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.340
of the tools that are available
in Google+ and the way it hooks

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.145
into the rest of Google
that you can take advantage

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:25.170
of to optimize these metrics
or these sets of metrics.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.070
Let's start with reach.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.180
So you build something,
and we'd like

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.600
you to reach as many
people as possible with it.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.110
Well, for reach,
you've got to go

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.950
for the biggest hammer we have.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.280
It's a little site
called google.com.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.460
You may have heard of it.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.740
The first and
fundamental problem

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.900
you're going to have as a
game developer is nobody's

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.491
heard of you.

00:06:50.491 --> 00:06:52.240
Or they've heard of
you, but they have not

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.070
heard of your new game.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.790
So for example, who
here can tell me

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.815
all the Angry Birds games and
the difference between them

00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:00.030
all?

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.530
Can you?

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.235
AUDIENCE: I can.

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:02.110
ADE OSHINEYE: Really?

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.520
OK, what's Angry Birds Stars?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.408
AUDIENCE: There is no
such thing as Stars.

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:06.830
Star Wars, maybe?

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.269
ADE OSHINEYE: See, I'm confused.

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:09.810
My point is, when
I go to google.com,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.340
I'm going to type Angry Birds
Stars, and it's going to say,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.590
you didn't mean that.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.400
You meant Angry Birds Star Wars.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.410
But my friend told
me Angry Birds Stars,

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.660
and who am I going to believe?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.190
You or the guy in the pub?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.310
So if you're going
to be in search,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.820
you've got to be
thinking, how do I

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.950
make sure I rank for my name?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.000
How do I rank for common
misspellings of my name?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.230
Because again,
your users probably

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.560
don't spend their time obsessing
about the latest releases

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.224
you've done, even if you are as
famous as the Angry Birds guys.

00:07:41.224 --> 00:07:42.515
They even have branded hoodies.

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:46.330
First thing you've
got to be thinking

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.666
is, are you doing a
good job with SEO?

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:50.340
Do you have a
website for your game

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.190
where people can actually
discover you through search?

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.230
One of the best ones in the
world, the Play Store search

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.880
is not as good as
google.com's search.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.470
It's getting better, but this
is still one of the best places

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.959
to get discovered.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:06.250
So obviously you can do things
like have a Google+ page

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.730
to make it easier for them
to discover your brand

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.590
or your game.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.440
But again, it means that when
they type your name in or they

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.680
type a horrible misspelling
of your name-- for example,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.940
Ruzzle is how many z's?

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.260
Again, as a user, I don't care.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.660
I just type some
approximation to search,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.030
and search points me
in the right direction.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.289
The point is, search-- and
of course, advertising--

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.530
are great ways to let
people get maximum reach.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.929
They are ways where
people can discover you.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.720
So they've discovered you.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.320
Now this could mean they've
discovered you through the Play

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.840
Store, or it could mean
they've discovered you

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.341
because they went
to your website.

00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:51.340
And of course, you have
a link to the Play Store

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.589
so they can install your game.

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:54.322
OK Yes?

00:08:54.322 --> 00:08:56.030
You guys aren't one
of those people who's

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.490
got a website that doesn't
actually tell people

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.280
how to get a hold of your game?

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.710
Because that's embarrassing.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.630
All right, so the
user's found you.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.052
You need to convert them.

00:09:06.052 --> 00:09:08.510
So conversion could be as simple
as they click on the link,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.990
they get taken to
the Play Store.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.780
Great.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.550
If you've got a game that spans
multiple platforms or spans

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.150
the web, and Android
and iOS, as well,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.990
one of things we have with
Google+ sign in is a feature

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.320
where they can
sign in on the web,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.030
and then we can push
the app, the game,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.850
to their devices over the air
so that you can convert them

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:34.040
on the web, and they've got the
game installed on their device.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.930
The point is, if the user signs
in on the web or on Android,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.610
they should be
signed in everywhere.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.535
That means when
I pick up-- let's

00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:46.690
say I buy a new tablet
like the new HTC One,

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.575
or a really ridiculously big
phone like the new HTC One--

00:09:49.575 --> 00:09:50.950
it's so big, it's
easy to confuse

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.107
with a tablet-- I buy that.

00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:53.940
I install your game.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.950
I sign in.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.860
I should resume from
where I started,

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.230
from where I was last
time on my other devices.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.610
So I shouldn't have to worry
about every time starting again

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.560
from scratch.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.360
So when we think
about conversion,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.620
conversion could be as
simple as getting the user

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.100
to create a stronger
bond with your game

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.960
because they've signed in,
they have a high score table,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.620
things like that.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.250
For traditional apps,
it tends to be all about

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.050
can they get installed
from the web.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.860
So this is Deezer.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.170
They're a French company.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.820
This is what the install
process looks like.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.190
As you can see, it's just a
standard Google Play widget,

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.240
but they get to pick devices.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.060
Again, obviously, you'd prefer
people to just discover you

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.680
through the Play Store,
but there's this web thing.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.190
I hear it's going to be big.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.920
So it's a good place
to get discovered,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.750
and it's a good place
to drive installs.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.170
Again, it's a fairly easy
thing to do, especially

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.970
if you're a big enough
company or you are trying

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.821
to build a community
on your own site,

00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:52.820
or you're trying to build
an engaging experience

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.820
on your own site.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.650
Somehow, people have found you.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.360
They've installed your game.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.990
They've signed in.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.550
How do you keep them?

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.670
Ideas?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.430
How do you keep people coming
back to play your game?

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.440
AUDIENCE: Pay them.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.520
ADE OSHINEYE: Pay them, OK.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.020
What else?

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.430
New content?

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.428
What else?

00:11:20.428 --> 00:11:22.720
AUDIENCE: Something
attractive to draw them back.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.050
ADE OSHINEYE: OK, something
attractive to draw them back.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:26.850
Rewards.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.710
There's a lot of
things you can do.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.760
But one of the
things we've added

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.980
is a little feature
called Incremental Auth.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.520
And the reason we've added
this is because it turns out

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.740
lots of people use YouTube and
a lot of other Google services,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.140
and sometimes you can use the
data in those other services

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.100
to make your experience
better, more enriching.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.690
So for example, you can
ask them after they've

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.660
signed in-- so it's a separate
process-- you can say,

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.410
can we have access to
your YouTube account

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.560
because perhaps we'd like to
write YouTube videos to it?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.560
So that when you have that
great, wonderful, perfect round

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.877
of Flappy Bird
when you get to 64,

00:12:04.877 --> 00:12:06.460
you can actually
capture the recording

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.702
and share it on YouTube
so people can see

00:12:08.702 --> 00:12:11.010
you didn't cheat.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.260
If Rich had captured his
356 score with a video,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.290
he could send that around
now to prove he didn't cheat.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.580
But he didn't, so we have
to believe he's cheating.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.680
Point being, this is a
separate section from sign in.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.610
And you could pull in
any Google APIs this way.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.520
So that means you could
do things like-- can we

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.070
capture screenshots and maybe
share them to Drive, or are

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.180
there things you
have in other Google

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.070
properties that we can
use to augment this game?

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.260
Typically, if it's a
music-related game,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.650
one thing you can do is
with the user's permission,

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.680
go through their YouTube history
and use their musical tastes

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.660
to influence the
nature of the game.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.590
The point is, from
the sign in flow,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.877
you could either ask for a
wide range of Google APIs,

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.460
or you can ask for
them incrementally,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.057
and use those to enrich
the experience of the game.

00:13:02.057 --> 00:13:03.890
The point being, it
gives you an opportunity

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.310
to personalize the game so
that you can see your face,

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.870
your friends' faces, the
things that matter to you.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.200
You've got a game.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.110
You've got people,
they've signed in.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.930
They've brought their
social graph across.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.189
You've somehow made the
game engaging, enticing,

00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:28.855
interesting, because
you've personalized

00:13:28.855 --> 00:13:32.410
it using data you
have that's available

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.220
about them from the full
range of Google services.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.060
How do I keep them engaged?

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.560
How do I retain them?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.000
Well, if you've used any of the
Google Play games in the past,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.290
you know that we have high
scores, we have leader boards.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.430
One of the really
nice things you can do

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.390
that actually starts
to get very interesting

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.882
is when I share that high
score, what do I share?

00:13:53.882 --> 00:13:55.340
Now, the typical
thing people do is

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.300
they share just a
little blob of text.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.960
As you can see, I
scored zero points.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.610
That's actually
unlocked an achievement.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.360
But nothing stops them
from editing there,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.320
cheating and saying yeah,
I scored 1,000 points,

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.070
except for the screen shot,
which keeps me honest.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.780
The point being,
you can start to do

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.620
these kinds of
interesting things

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.320
to actually make the sharing
experience more compelling.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320
Because Flappy Bird is
actually a pretty OK game,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.342
but what makes it great is
when you get a new high score

00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:26.800
and you take that
screenshot, which

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.810
you have to do manually
in Flappy Bird,

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.240
and then you share it to
the stream to tell people,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.287
look what I did.

00:14:32.287 --> 00:14:34.870
And somebody else sends you back
a message a few minutes later

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.960
saying, look, I just
beat your score.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.010
And that gets you to come back.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.000
There's an authenticity that
comes from having the screen

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.720
shot, rather than me
claiming I got 1,000 points.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.650
So that's a much
more powerful system.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.470
So you have achievements,
but ultimately, the thing

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.400
that gets you to come back
is, I had a great experience.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.790
Here's the proof of it, here's
the social proof of this.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.380
And I share that with people I
know, and then they come back.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.220
Because a lot of people will
try your game-- it's OK,

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.150
it's great-- and then they
get bored or life intervenes,

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.340
and then somebody
they know plays it,

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.680
and then they come back.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.630
So Rich, for example,
has tried to quit

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.150
Flappy Bird on
multiple occasions.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.230
And every time he does,
somebody beats his high score,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.320
and he has to come back.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.820
It's like in-- what's that
mafia film? "The Godfather"?

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.190
Just when you think you're
out, they pull you back in.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.122
Speaking of which,
re-engagement.

00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:40.430
Who here actually sends
re-engagement emails

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.450
in their games?

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.110
Hands up.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.200
Nobody?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.820
Come on, I play your games.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.910
Who here sends re-engagement
notifications telling people,

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.580
you haven't played
our game for a week?

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.220
Please come back.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.940
This is a picture my kids.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.440
They need the money.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.720
So everybody does this, or
if they're not doing this,

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.730
they're thinking
about doing this.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.680
And the reason they do this
is because a person plays

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.480
the game, they get a certain
way in, they get bored

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.680
or they get stuck,
and they stop playing.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.040
How do we re-engage them?

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.590
Well, you nag them.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.400
You spam them.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.520
And you hope they come back.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.910
Does it work on you guys?

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.940
Who here actually gets
a re-engagement email,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.610
they get a re-engagement
notification,

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.776
and then they say, oh well,
I'll play that game now.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:32.860
That guy.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.850
So spam him.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.760
Because everybody
else finds it annoying

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.530
because you get an
email once a day.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.900
So I have a service
called 750 Words,

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.420
and it emails me
each day to tell me

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.480
I should write 750 words.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.820
I've learned to ignore it.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.540
I have a Duolingo subscription.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.120
It emails me every day to tell
me I should practice my French.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.610
I've learned to ignore it.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.000
That's because I'm a bad person.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.902
However, I am not alone.

00:17:00.902 --> 00:17:02.610
There are many bad
people on this planet.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.390
There's about 7 billion of us.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.854
And we've learned that
these emails telling

00:17:06.854 --> 00:17:08.729
you to come back, these
notifications telling

00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:11.429
us to come back, it's a machine
somewhere telling you you

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:12.970
should probably play
this game again.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.595
It doesn't have any
meaning, it doesn't

00:17:14.595 --> 00:17:16.180
have any emotional weight.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.400
What does have emotional
weight is getting

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.250
a message from somebody you
know telling you something

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.710
has happened, something
worthwhile is going on.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.000
So for example, here's a recipe
I shared on Google+ for honey

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.270
soy chicken.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.000
Of course, I can't
cook because I

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.790
worked at Google for
nearly seven years.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.350
So I make a post saying,
if only I could cook.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.440
And hopefully, somebody I
know will click on that,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.040
learn the recipe, and
then invite me around

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.400
because they made
this-- it could happen.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.880
Here's a song.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.640
By the way, who here has
heard the acoustic version

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.220
of Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend"?

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.554
It's actually pretty good.

00:17:55.554 --> 00:17:57.470
I can say that because
this is all on the NDA.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.450
But hey, I can share that song
and people can click on it

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.130
and they can listen to the song.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.040
But the point is, I share this,
and people say, what the hell?

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.670
And they click on it,
because why would I say this?

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.571
And then they say, actually,
it's not that horrible.

00:18:16.571 --> 00:18:18.570
And then they show it to
a few of their friends.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.280
It's not that horrible,
the acoustic version.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.910
And it spreads it that way.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.250
This is how things like
Flappy Bird spreads.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.500
And it's that
message that spreads.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.260
It's the idea of somebody
actually saying this.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.390
By the way, in this version,
this app, Soundwave, actually

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.900
created that message for me.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.940
I had the option of whether I
wanted to edit or delete this.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.830
I would never say,
"check out" this song.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.710
I would say, "hey, give
this song a listen."

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.840
Point is, when you share what
we call an interactive post,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.690
you get the call to
action button, which

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.700
says Listen here, Learn here.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.955
You get a pre-field of text.

00:18:54.955 --> 00:18:58.020
You can +Mention up to
10 of the user's friends.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.300
So that's a notification the
user will see across any Google

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.610
product across all
of their devices.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.600
But because it's a
human-mediated message,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.410
they know it came from a person
and that person was involved.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.840
For example, this is
an app called Fancy,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.050
and they have a really
nice affiliate scheme

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.370
where you buy stuff from them.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.880
It's a business model
where you give them money

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.700
and they give you stuff.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.620
It's a Web 3.0 business model.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:35.690
In this case, I'm sharing a
vintage Rolex Submariner watch.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.400
It's ridiculously expensive.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.110
As you can see, I've
hidden the amount of zeroes

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.760
because it goes off the edge.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.780
It's like $30,000 for a watch.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.870
But it's a really nice
watch, apparently.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.740
So I share this to my stream.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.767
And say Larry or Sergey was
following me and they saw this,

00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:53.600
and they go, oh, that's
nice, and they click

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:01.430
Buy-- they would be
taken into the Fancy app.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.930
If they didn't
have the Fancy app,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.710
they would be taken
to the Play Store

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.269
on Android, the App Store
on iOS, to install the app.

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:11.310
So if you think about this
as if you were sharing

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.122
an interactive post for
a high score on a game,

00:20:14.122 --> 00:20:16.330
the people who didn't have
the game when they clicked

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.570
on that button would be
taken through a process

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.740
to install the game
because somebody

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.320
they know has recommended this.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.630
So in this case, let's say
Larry and Sergey get that watch

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.710
recommendation from
me because look,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.620
I wear two Smartband things.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.660
I must know about watches.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.320
Fancy actually has
an affiliate model,

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.720
so if Larry and Sergey
bought 10 of these watches,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.280
I get a small percentage.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.830
It's unlikely to happen
because they'd probably

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.850
just buy the watch company.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.670
I don't get a
percentage on that.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.590
But the point
about this is, what

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.990
you have is a human who has
reached a particular place

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.590
within an app or a game,
has found some content

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.770
that they think will
resonate with their friends,

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.240
and you've been able to
nudge them to share that,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.650
and then when those
friends see that message,

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.180
they click on the button.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.520
They become an app
install for you.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.393
So it's not just hey,
here's a cool thing.

00:21:10.393 --> 00:21:11.976
It's here's a cool
thing and an action

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:14.030
you can perform
that will cause you

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.970
to install on iOS or Android.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:23.520
Point being, people don't really
respond very well to messages

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.690
from machines, but they
respond very well to messages

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.380
from actual people.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.760
My parents have nagged me
for 30-something years.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.740
It still works.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.380
Whereas in a few months,
I get trained very quickly

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.520
to ignore notifications from
certain games, certain apps.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.070
The point being,
human communication--

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.350
having people be the one
to drive the sharing,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.960
whether it's of a high
score of a particular level,

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.230
or if it's a screen shot or
a video of a particular piece

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.350
of a game, is very,
very powerful.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.950
Because there's a unified
Google experience,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.540
this spreads to wherever there
are people are using Google.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.540
And the final piece
is that little site

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.540
called google.com
we talked about.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.992
Now, when I share a message
or a screen shot or a video

00:22:10.992 --> 00:22:16.210
or whatever through Google+ from
YouTube or within your game,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.310
I've shared to specific circles.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.740
When those people are doing
searches later on, if things

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.660
they search for match
the post I made,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.420
even if it's a private post,
the Think or Search+ your world,

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.970
as you can see there, that
personalized search feature we

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.090
now have for users who are
signed in means that they will

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.010
see that private
post right here.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:42.750
Remember earlier when I shared
that post about the Submariner

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.690
Rolex watch, and
it had the phrase,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.650
if only I had a submarine?

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.520
Here it is in web search.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.230
So the point driving the ad
is that users can discover you

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.340
through the Play Store.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.670
They can also discover
you through web search.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.970
The content you and
your users share out

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.630
from within your game, often the
YouTube videos of your games,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.520
can be discovered again
by those same users

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.000
through general web search.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.020
And they click on that,
they end up in that post,

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.670
there's that Call
to Action button.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.490
They click on that, they've
now installed your game.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.570
So you don't have
this trap where

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.380
you have to get
all the conversions

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.060
in the first few weeks.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.360
You have content that lives
out for-- well, in this case,

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.030
37 minutes after
I made the post--

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:34.030
but theoretically, your content
can live for months and months,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.650
and those people can still
be coming back into your game

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.150
months after the initial
flurry of traffic.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.820
So there's a much
bigger opportunity here

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:48.320
to use all of Google's services
to drive growth for your games

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.610
and to think about reach
and conversion and all

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:56.860
of those things-- and of
course, cold hard cash.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.700
Thank you very much.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.130
Does anybody have any questions?

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.990
Or would you like to
throw cold hard cash?

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.820
That's also good.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.808
OK, thank you very much.
