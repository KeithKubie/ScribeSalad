It's that you have a car. They have a drive through and you have singles in your wallet. Where are you going to spend it? Drive your fat ass down to the supermarket. Just like my doughy midsection. I'm bringing it down there looking like the fucking freckled. Imagine the Pillsbury Pillsbury dough boy with like freckles. That's what I'm looking right now by my fucking shirt on. Put on a good 12 pounds, a writers' room weight. You know, you know what I like to go for? I like the Hershey's many inches, right? Get that fucking sugar rush. Then I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Then I eat a handful of fucking pretzels. Bring me back down with the salt and then where am I? Oh, late night. Oh, we're working late again. Did I all, let's get a fucking pizza. I'm just going to have one slice, four slices hot right down the fucking pie hall. And who am I blaming? Huh? My blaming those whores on Instagram. I'm not, not me.

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       I am a fucking ONA. I'm not a mess. I'm turning around.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       Old Daddy, white legs here. Get up to almost a buck 86 you know, now I'm back down to a buck 82 my goal is just to be in the one seventies but I'm in the fucking one seventies by the time we're done with the next two episodes. Right? A couple, two or three pounds of the next two weeks. Right. I can do that shit even though the of July is coming up. Right. And that's the big day we celebrate Independence Day. You know, wasn't that the day we had the fight with the British and we said a one if by land two of spicy and get those native Americans off my property. Isn't that, isn't that what happened on that day? Um, we declared independence from England on July 4th, 1776. We were like, we're sick of you oppressing us. We would like to be the oppresses and it's took us almost 300 years to get there and God dammit, what dealt with doing it as good as England ever did it. Take that Fuckos

Speaker 3:          00:03:41       um,

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       anyways, got to drink the throat coat tea. I don't know why I never drank this before. I can tell you, you know something that's fucking delicious as a God damn grapefruit, not a regular grapefruit. A goddamn grapefruit. They're right next to the Sunkist. You go in there, you, hey, you got a goddamn grapefruit. I'm sorry. We only have Sunkist and then you say, well fuck you buddy. Fuck you. When you create a salary. That's what I'm back to salary at night. My little scoop of fucking peanut, right. I'm six months into this year. My drinking's back under control, not that will bring your drinking back under control like eight fucking corona lights that somebody left at my fucking fridge, Jesus Christ. But slowly knocking those things back one a day and it's just such a horrible experience. By the end of it, it's like I did, not only do I not want another, I don't think I ever want to drink again, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       Oh, so whatever. So I'm only had one cigar this month, so I've had nine for the year, so that's good. Right? It's going to go off the rail soon, right. We've got 4th of July and then I got fucking the European brand coming up, you know, and uh, I was on a flight and I somehow discovered this part of Ciga affection that Oh, um, it's places to smoke. Few like cigars, people go on cigar affection out or.com and you click on search cigar aficionado oneF who know? Um, I thought it was spelled like after with two F's. Right? I'm kidding. I just love all the people when I play up, how stupid I am. They just love, you know, you guys dominant. You're right next to me at the Applebee's, right? Just order your fried fucking pickles. You can't,

Speaker 3:          00:05:25       um, [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       scarf. Actually not a oneF as in fuck and a Google places to smoke. I mean, it's just, it's fucking, it's incredible. So I've, um, I've done that all across Europe, but I just did it like every, like fifth city or something. So I don't go off the rails when I'm over there. So I've got a couple of days in London, I'm going to smoke there, and then I think I'm just gonna fucking haul ass for the rest of the trip and maybe take a few days off, a little vacation, little holiday, you know, somewhere down the Mediterranean, right. Look at all fancy freckles. You like this? What a fucking life. Flunked everything in high school. Huh? You need two years of a language. No, you don't. You just need to be a silly comment and have enough people get into you and all of a sudden you too. You too can not add up how much your vacation costs and then get a credit card bill.

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       It'd be like, Ooh, what the fuck? That's one of my favorite things. I might sound a little more jovial than usual. There's a reason for that. There is a fod as a fucking reason is the great Sam Kinison would say. I um, I uh, I finally bought a car. Daddy bought a whip. Oh look who's here. The Levenia just in time for me to talk about my new fucking car. Let's turn up the Mike Nini. I gotta tell you I bought, you know when I bought yes, I bought the BMW bitch magnet. That's what it's called. No, I didn't buy a BMW. I bought a Jaguar. Um, and I ordered it. I bought a Jag and I, and I ordered the color cause I didn't want to be another douche driving a black, white or fucking red car as they make calls me driving a, what does that British racing green.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       Yeah, like every was supposed to be, oh, you're hating. You hate on me right now. It's fucking beautiful. Cold freezing in here. You notice that I'm wearing like, oh you're, you're fucking Apollo 13 jacket. Yeah, go turn off the AC bombers. Well, cause it was, it was hot as hell on you. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'm a white. The cold doesn't affect me. You know how I get on the beach and look like I'm having heat stroke. You're sitting there frolicking around. Why isn't this great? I'm under that giant fucking umbrella looking like it was my final wish to go to the beach for the first time ever in my life, it of my life. Remember that guy? Do you know what somebody told me to buy on the, uh, on the old inner web there? Is Richard Wrong? He says, yeah, downstairs saying in her webs.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       I love when he says that. Why I love that guy. Get Yourself. Because I look at him going, he flunked everything in high school too, and he still made it. They put so much emphasis on being smart in school. You don't have to be everything in school. What was, when I say I flunked everything up the ceiling, the glass ceiling I couldn't push through was cs. And then there was a bunch of ds and then just the, uh, the math was just the old right there, Fred. Ugh. What about, I've never shown you my fucking, I think I still, I have this desk, my parents don't throw anything out. It's still in there. And every once in a while there's this little thing and I open it up to, oh my God. Really? Oh, I was showing you all my, my achievements certificates. Yeah. Oh, opposites attract Neil.

Speaker 2:          00:08:52       But it's like a, it's a bunch of C's and easiest. It's like English and stuff like that. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I stopped going. I stopped getting A's and B's. Right. I did well until through junior high. And then when it counted when the fucking colleges were gonna have to do more than share, the greatest thing, the greatest thing I ever did was completely fuck up in high school because why? Because of I did well, if I did well and I lived the dream like, and I w I got accepted into a big time college that had a great fucking football program and I joined a Frat and I had penny loafers with no socks on and all that. Just live in the white guy dream. We definitely wouldn't be right if I did that. Like I, I just think I would have been doing so well in life that getting into this business never would have dawned on me.

Speaker 2:          00:09:56       I would've been like, well, I can't leave. Right. I'm driving a convertible Audi. I got a, I got the extra special cubicle and I don't think I would've done it, but the fact that I fucked up so bad that my options were only going part time, two low level schools and unloading trucks that then going and doing an open mic that wasn't as scary. Like what was I walking away from? That's true. Lower back pain. I mean, look at me now. I Erica, I think it's curious. Um, penny loafers with no socks. I feel like that's a big red flag to me. Like there's just something about it that I just, yeah, it's like when black people weren't loafers with no socks. That's like on w certain white people see black guys in hoodies.

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       It's the same thing. Yeah, it is. I said, well, no, it isn't because of the power structure, but it's the same thing. You're totally looking at him. You look at those penny loafers with no socks and you're like, frat boy, date rapists. Yeah, it's true. We agreed to have aggressive sex and you end up face down dead in a park. Yeah, exactly. Yes. You're allowed to say that, right? Yeah. Okay. I'm not allowed to say that. I'm not allowed to see a black guy with a Hoodie at 12 midnight. It's we'll be like, oh, he's working on an app and he just came outside to stretch his legs. Then I ended up in a trunk of a car. Ah. But I do. I do feel that way and I know that that's a stereotype and I know that that's wrong. Why do you have yes. Yeah. Well, you know, it's, if I think about like, why do you have like Kennedy's and you have like, you have this Trump white eyeliner on here.

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       Oh No. I think that's my eye cream that I didn't fully blended my skin. Oh God. You're spoiled. I'm not spoiled. I think that's my ice cream. I put it on at night. I have a promoter that's a bad stereotype. What is preppy guys? Preppy white guys or serial killers are date rapists. But I feel like if they were to be, they would get away with it. Good. I just feel like it's a safe thought is money. It's a safe thought. The think is a woman [inaudible] just go with the bad. So you get home in one piece? Yeah. If you think somebody is going to eat you, you, you got to go with that thought. Yeah. And just just avoid regardless of how many people's feelings you hurt. Right. But like I get just people wearing like, so how do you think white people should handle pants? How do you think white people should handle the other situation? And like boat shoes and like blazers or like shorts with whales on them.

Speaker 2:          00:12:37       Then you got you gotta you fucking got this person down or like their hair is so perfect and they've got their like color pop, just so on. They're like Ralph Lauren, like yellow, buttoned down. You've got issues with salmon shorts and like a white belt with a blue stripe down the middle of it. So what if a guy like that came walking up to you and started talking to you in the club? I would feel very only, what is your name? Is it something ethnic? My name is Scott [inaudible]. Scott. Uh, no, I'm being very stereotypical right now. There are plenty of those guys that are a part of the yacht club and the golf and glove and, um, are they're lovely people. Where did you meet those people? I've never been, I'm really white. I've never met those people. I've just, yeah, I'm, I'm being, I'm being stereotypical and it's wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       Do you know one time I met he wasn't, he wasn't like a waspy guy. He was a Jewish guy. Right. And I was at this wedding for buddy of mine who was Jewish. Right? So I was like one of the only gentiles there, and eight I had just moved to fucking Manhattan and this guy fucking big lead to me big time. Right? I was living on this out walkthrough bedroom on 97 east, 97th street. Right. And, uh, you know, crack heads smoking underneath the thing, the total New York experience. Like the first night I'm laying in my single bed, you know, just just like a little kid bed and a like a roach walked across my chest that night and I just thought that was part of, I didn't even kill it. I just thought it was part of the New York experience. I was like, all right man, I need to get tough. So I was like, fuck it. Alright, bugs are gonna crawl on me. I can take this shit. Right. So I go to the uh, but I was still excited. Oh, it's such a German, Irish toughy. Fucking dope. You guys will put up with any yup. And that's why we die young. That's all we die young. One day I'll let it all out and I'll do that epic cry. Like that black dude on the intervention. Cause I still do and I'll be like

Speaker 4:          00:14:45       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       when you watched that yesterday, the cry of man who hasn't cried and like ever who was a baby, we watched that yesterday in the writer's room and then we watch one of the worst ones ever because I love the Guy Mike Schmidt retiring from baseball. We watched that one and it's such a shame the amount of shit that that guy gets. Cause he could literally at this still at this age, he could literally pick me up and throw me out of the major league in field. I would land shallow left, but he just goes like, you know, whatever. Like I forget how it whip. It was like 20 years ago a boy left, blah, blah, blah, Wisconsin. Where did the hell he was with the dream to play originally. He went all the way. I was like, oh no. So somebody had that video, major league and then they immediately cut to the black.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       I got, ah dude, we fucking died. We fucking died. And I was actually sitting there when I was [inaudible] watching that. How hard we were all laughing. I was wishing I could reach out to the person that made that cause I would be psyched, you know, if I wasn't in this business and a bunch of people in a writer's room right now on a fucking show, like we don't laugh at Shit, dude, we will fucking dying. So I mean, I wish my standup got that kind of fucking left in my writer's room. That's all right. What's the setup as a tracking and all of that shit. So, um, anyways. Um, all right. So where are we now? Where are we talking about? We were talking about your car. Oh yeah. Your Jaguar. Jaguar. So like about the Jaguar, the Jaguar. DXF Are you excited for, I'm so fucking excited.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       I'm not excited that it doesn't come for, it's 100 days away. That's what happens when you order a custom color countdown every single day. Yeah. If you don't mind, can I be excited about this? I drove a fucking Prius for nine years. You're right. Yeah. I've been gay bashed for the better part of a decade. Driving that car. Yes. Long overdue. I can tell you that's a hot fucking car though. The Prius. I've had two people already offered to buy it. Can I buy it? Can I buy it off here? I know that car is done right by us. Yes it is. Although it smells, you got a detailed that one time and then we came home and it was a hot day and the windows were up in whatever that chemical was. Did they put in the seat if fucking baked in there and like, yeah, know how to get it out?

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       Yeah. It's like somebody died in there that cleans houses. No, it doesn't smell like somebody died in there. It's this, this got, you know a certain, yeah, you have to eat something and you kind of think you like it and then there's yet weird after taste and you're like, Whoa, we can't sell it until we figure out how to get rid of that. You need to learn to talk into the mic. There you go. Not to. Okay. You know what they're not. They'll just pick a height. Can hear me. All right, I'm going to turn you up a mile away. I'm sorry. It's because of you. Hey, I don't like that or that Remy Ma just cause she shot somebody that's fucking great. So many people in that genre act like they would do shit like that. But at the end of the day, like what am I a fucking, I got a Bentley.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       I don't need to be shooting people. Yeah. She actually shot somebody and she went to jail for it. I don't think she's like proud of it by any means, but, well no. You know what? I know I had to see her out and do it. I'm not advocating shooting people. What I'm saying, what's cool is that if she talks about shit like that, you know that she's not pretending. Oh, I certainly wouldn't fuck with her. Yeah. Like I'm still waiting for Robert Blake to put out an album. You know he fucking flake. Yeah, he plays guitar. Wait, he's not dead. No, he's out. I went into a guitar shop one time and he was in there. No. Yeah, I would run the other way. He's so scary.

Speaker 2:          00:18:29       Don't go to bed with the price on your head. No. So you enjoy, you enjoyed watching the bet awards with me. I did the whole prince tribute and all that. It was fucking tremendous. Fucking tremendous. I don't know why you guys were upset about the Oscars. You guys have a better award show. Just do one yourself and show us how to do a good one. I don't know why the fuck you're trying to get there. Yeah. Our shows generally seem to be more fun, but oh Jesus. Where the hell is on you? No, no. It's not more or less fun. It's just you're going to be able to be yourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       I don't know who that is. I Dunno what the fuck happened. All of a sudden I got on this list like congratulations your businesses one and just hang up. What kills me is they keep calling, which means somebody out. It's enough people at works on. There's enough people that sit there. Congratulations. Like holy Shit Allen. Get it here. Eight, four, four number. Cause I have some weird eight, four, four number that keeps calling me and it's business, but you know they have those machines that like this. Try every single combination of phone numbers and whatever one hits and someone picks up, they're like, hello, I have some exciting news for you.

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       Yeah, it's not exciting. It's fucking annoying. You know what the worst is when I'm out walking Cleo and I'm listening to some song, right? I'm listening to some songs, so of course, any song that I listened to, I am on stage with the band playing drums and I'm killing it and they're all turning around and looking at me like, wow, this guy has more skills than we thought. That's what I do with the entire time I'm out there fantasize and then all of a sudden the phone comes on and I'm old. Whenever it's a random number, I just think at some radio station that I used to do, and that's always good for business. I pick up the phone, I make people laugh, drive time, you know, whatever. I'm not even in the city and they're hearing me make them laugh. Maybe they'll come out to a show.

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       So I always pick up and I'll be like in the middle of a, what was, I was listening to Queens of the stone age today. I'll listen to them. And, uh, ozone gay man ain't gay, Gay, Gay, da Da da and nicotine and get up like a day or extra speed. Whoa, whoa. Okay. Okay. But it, yeah, I'm just fucking listening to it. Of course I'm on the drums going gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay kid, right. Fucking kill it, Josh. Turnaround Code. Wow. Right. Totally impressed. Which will never happen. Right? So I can dream. And then the fucking photo rank. He's impressed with you, but not for your musical skills. I know he's not impressed with me. Why would you say that and ruin this great story. He fucking, uh, so I'm walking down the street and the fucking phone rings and then I stopped listening to that and I fucking, uh, I pick up, it was like, congratulations.

Speaker 2:          00:21:20       Your fantasy as over a year, your best, this letter won a free trip to a room. Wait a minute, wait a minute. So even if you know you don't have a radio station, you'll just still pick up random numbers. Yeah. You have to stop doing that also. Why wouldn't you? Hey, do you a thank you. Do you ever think he ever like dialed somebody? Dial the number incorrectly? Well, I guess you don't do it that much anymore, but every once in a while you just fucking dial a number. You'd dial it wrong. You ever think he actually like called somebody famous? Like they have phones, they got to get wrong numbers. They don't pick up numbers that they don't recognize. Yeah, they do. You don't think Jay Lo picks up. It's like, oh, whatever. She sounds like what?

Speaker 2:          00:22:00       She goes, I'm just, I'm just chatting on the Bronx. I don't know what the fuck she said. You wouldn't pick up like Bill Clinton. I don't understand. I Bet Bill Clinton picks up random numbers. Oh, of course. Yeah. You know, he does. He's like, hmm. Oh, could this be, I dunno what now he's looking like very frail. Uh, yeah, he's old and Vegan now, so I feel like that is that why he looks like a scarecrow that came to life. If a scare crow fucked a snowman for scarecrow, fuck the snow man. That's what he looks like cause he's keeps his pasty as a snowman and his skinny.

Speaker 2:          00:22:37       I've never felt more alive. He comes at you with that fucking chicken neck. Um, can we talk about how you kind of like to like in the same vein as you picking up numbers and being like, yeah, sure. How you just don't pay attention. What stuff? Like what happened when I asked you to get minute rice and grapefruit. What did you bring home? A cantaloupe and a regular rice that took 20 minutes. I thought Uncle Ben's was always minute rice. He thought he had shit the dope. I was wrong. Ben Can hang around. Hmm. Came on with the cantaloupe. What do you want from me? It was delicious though, wasn't it? It was, but I just feel like you've just get a vague idea of like what's supposed to happen and just kind of run with it. Like you're like, oh, that's around melon fruit or something.

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       Not even a melon. You weren't even supposed to get a Mellon. Just you just knew it was round and it was probably next to the grapefruit and you just grabbed it not thinking, yeah, you want to do, you know it's sure. Alright, so I bought you a nice fucking car, right? And you park and under a tree. So I got this fucking the top, the tarp that fits your car like a fucking glove and you're not putting it on and the fucking saps coming down on your car. So I sit there and go near. Why don't you put the top on the car and like, is there anyway somebody can turn back the tree? It's like, or you could just put the fucking tarp on the car. I know, but I also feel like that she needs to be cut back in general. Why that tree is right out side can hear you right now.

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       Don't worry buddy, you're not going anywhere because it's just trapping those weird things all over the place. It's called nature called nature. Nia. We live. We shouldn't even be out here. That tree should be out here. Okay. I'm not saying that you should cut it down and like it should be just cut it back. That's all I'm saying is cut it back or maybe like cut it so that it grows. Why don't you just put the fucking tarp on the car? I have a problem putting a tarp, the tarp on the car. Then there you go with salt. Yeah you do have a problem. Cause I went down there, there was shit all over your car and I'm telling you the fucking last night. And what happens is a lot of people don't know this. I learned this the hard way. What happens is, and I'm explaining this and I know you don't like this, but I'm, I explaining when the fucking PSAP gets on your fucking car, you gotta end up not talking to you.

Speaker 2:          00:25:01       You got to get it off. Cause what happens is when your car heats up, the paint expands and then at night when it cools off, it contracts again and it's like a motion, right? The SAP and the paint become one. It's like a tattoo and then it's underneath your fucking paint and you can't get it up. At least that's what the guy at the car wash told me. Cause I was like, Hey, what about these spots here? And he's like, oh my friend, my friend. We're not friends. Tell me what happened. So I like your blue dress. Thank you. I got it yesterday. What'd you get it? Top shop. Top Shop? Yes. Is that expensive? No, I'm actually good. Good Job Nini. Get a red one too. I like topshop. The money morning podcast sponsored by topshop. Topshop. That'd be great. Well Youtube, why? Cause they'd send me some dresses. Yeah, yeah, that fit me. Ideally I'm the host. I get the dresses.

His head ever came out of that hole and an email about a seven night Mediterranean cruise riding from Venice starting at eight 99.

Speaker 2:          00:30:19       But I don't think that's the kind of thing that we underneath the boat or we set the refugee special. I think that's the kind of thing where it's like we have to work on the boat when we go there and like 4,000 other people at the, at the buffet line. Oh yeah. You can't even get a cruise for that. There's no fucking way you're getting on this. What does the boat look like? I don't know. It's a dinghy. Yeah. All right. Well I don't know. I'll have to, I'll have to do something evil to ever be able to afford that, but it's nice to notice. Um, all right. That's it. Ah, that's the a Thursday afternoon podcast for um, wait a minute.

Uh, what did we do that, that $10,000 pyramid, it all came about because we were talking about how you just notoriously, uh, sort of just gets things wrong or it was really more about how your, your movie titles, that's how it started.

Speaker 4:          00:36:01       [inaudible] hey. Oh, okay. [inaudible] oh [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:37:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill births. The Monday morning podcast for what the Hell is today? June 29th June 30th fuck is a date. I don't know. I don't know where it is. The last Monday in June and I can't believe how much the summer is just flying by Jay. When somebody say say that every fucking summer, you know, you know what's going to fly by because the weather is awesome cause it's fun. It's like eating cookies, you know, you open a bag, you think you're just going to have one. Next thing you know the whole bag's gone. You know why? Because they taste delicious too. You really need some douchebag to stand there next to you. The one like couldn't your blue how good those cookies were. I can't believe they're already gone.

Speaker 5:          00:37:50       Um, I wish someone would say that in the winter. Can you believe how fast the winter's going by? What kind of person would say that? Huh? Some sort of mountain man who's into snowboarding. Alright. That was awesome. I don't fucking, alright, it's the Monday morning, but Monday, June 30th. Sorry. I'll, okay. I was riffing and I was looking up with the date was all right. As I've told you guys in past podcasts, I have one of the oldest still functioning laptops out there. I told you mine is actually made out of Birch. I, uh, I got it down at the, uh, pottery barn back when they used to sell laptops. A lot of people don't know that. They think that they were, uh, just into furniture. But there was a moment there where they'd stay, tried to branch out into computers and electronics and needless to say fail.

Speaker 5:          00:38:38       And, uh, actually, you know what I was thinking about getting a new laptop, but, um, good friend of mine told me how to, what? Add more memory to this one. So I'm thinking, why the fuck? Why would I go out and get a new one? I don't understand why people keep going out and buying new laptops. Like they're fucking Steven Spielberg and they're dumping like hours of film footage. You're not doing it. Okay. They cost like two, three fucking grand. What are you doing? You know what I mean? Do you ever just stop and think what the fuck you're doing? Just get off the Goddamn fucking hamster wheel for a second and just realize how ridiculous it is that you spent $2,500 on something and it's acceptable that the thing is going to shit the bed within fucking two years been two years, something's going to happen.

Speaker 5:          00:39:32       You know the battery's gonna mess up and then you're going to go down to the Mac store or the fucking Bill Gates store, whatever the hell they got out there. And they going to be like, yeah, um, it's not under warranty. Uh, can we fix the year? We can fix it. Book. Oh to fix it for some stupid fucking reason is gonna Cause 2100 and a new app up is 25. So, you know, I mean, we'll fix it, but you know, the whole thing is fucking bullshit. There's no reason they should cost that much. You know, you know something, if nerds had any fucking brains, the amount of pussy they would be getting right now just by fixing their friends, laptops and saving everybody 2,500 bucks instead of charging people 1800, why don't you charge charge like 500 bucks? You fucking nerds go out, you know, buy something flashy that always attracts the horse.

Speaker 5:          00:40:27       They like that, you know? No. Just to give yourself a little makeover with the, with the, with your laptop fixing abilities, money, you know, like one of those bad eighties movies, you can turn your life into like a montage, you know, play some songs like the fine young cannibals as some chick takes you to the mall, you know, takes off your glasses. I always hated that in those fucking movies. Like whenever like somebody, you know, whenever they were going to have like, uh, like the nerdy Chicco all of a sudden become gorgeous. Right? Like the way they made her ugly was they put her hair up and they made her wear black frame glasses. You know what I mean? Like you still couldn't see that she was gorgeous, you know? And then they just take her hair down and then she take off her glasses and everybody's like, oh my God, who is that?

Speaker 5:          00:41:15       You know? And then the date rape is football player comes up to her and then she always like a, it's like, no, I don't think so. You know, you didn't like me when I, when I had my hair up and I was wearing these glasses. Okay. But this nerd over here, he always liked me. So now we're going to go to the prom and we're going to dance and that's going to be the end of the fucking movie. Okay. And I always hated that moment in the movie cause it always reminded me that I was watching a movie because in real life, okay, that girl, as much as she liked the nerd, she wouldn't like him in that way. Okay. They can't help it send that fucking DNA. They want to breathe with the strongest cock in the room. And I don't care how much of a Dick, that guy that quarterback was being toward the second she got the attention that that would fill her up because all those years they have in her hair up wearing those fucking Malcolm x glasses gave her low self esteem.

Speaker 5:          00:42:06       And uh, she, she would at least for a four to six year period would have to go out and instill herself up with, please accept me cock. You know, before she kind of was able to regroup and be like, you know what, these guys are assholes. I wonder what that nerds up to. And by then it'll be too late because a nerds generally, you know, they married the first thing that a lot of, let them fuck them, you know, so by the time she, she, you know, she runs through, you know, the time she's down to fucking the place kicker. That nerd is already married with three kids and he invented a, invented the iPhone. Wait a minute. No, he's t's fucking event. These damn laptops, they've got it. That's got to get repaired every couple of years. That's their fucking payback. Wow. I just figured that out. That's why there's no god damn nerds out there being able to fix these fucking laptops for 500 bucks.

Speaker 5:          00:43:06       That's all 1800 bucks. Because in math that when they gave the fucking nerdy chicken make over, she still blew the quarterback. So now, now we gotta pay for it. Ridiculous man. All right. This is the Monday morning podcast and uh, my name is bill burns. I do one of these every fucking Monday. And uh, you know, give you some laugh about and uh, you know, keep you in my thoughts. Actually keep me in your thoughts. That's why I'm doing this. I'm not doing it cause I give a fuck about you people. I'm trying to give you guys a reason to keep coming back to my site and maybe you'll tell other people to come to my sites and the next time we go to Raleigh, North Carolina, I'm not standing in front of 25 people, you know, so then I can make some more money and then I can buy some shiny shit.

Speaker 5:          00:43:48       And then I can make up for the fall, all the fucking pussy. I never gotten high school, see how that works. So anyways, I do one of these every week I talk about stuff that I have coming up in my career. I talk about a comedy date and a, you know, whatever like is a great example for you. I have a, an upcoming CD DVD release. I just like saying that CD, DVD release, um, and a one hour, um, comedy central special and that will be shown, I believe it's August 23rd. Um, it will be shown the first time CD's coming out in August. CV. I don't have an exact date yet. And the DVD is coming out in September. I don't have an exact date for that. I just have a month at this point. Okay. So cool. You fucking jets. All right. We got July 4th coming up.

Speaker 5:          00:44:38       Just relax. There's plenty of holidays between now and the goddamn release. And when I get the information, I'm going to let you know what's up. So that's what I have coming up. Okay. It's gotta be in a container in that. So let me try it. Let me, let me try to say it a little more clearer. In August, I have a CD coming out and a one hour comedy central, uh, special. Um, and in, in, uh, September, the DVD is coming out. So a by October you guys should all be sick of me, but by then, uh, hopefully I'll be filthy, stinking rich. I'll have a brand new, a Ludwig drum kit and a big house and I'll stand up there, you know, naked with the bathrobe that's partially opened looking down on the city, realizing that I'm still empty inside. Okay. But we're going to cross that bridge when we get to it, ma'am.

Speaker 5:          00:45:26       All right. Um, people ask me questions every week on my podcast and I like to try to answer them. People also send me in stories. They give me information. What do you want to start with first? You want to start with the questions? You want to go with the stories? How about a story? Let me scroll down here. Okay. Last week, you know, people were talking about their cars getting fucked up and everything like that. God Damn. And somebody sent me a funny one and I forgot to copy and paste it. I gotta read that one next week, but I told you last week I was going to tell you the second half, basically everyone was telling me these stories about how their car got fucked up and then everybody's story. They would the victim, except for this one dude who talks about how he was hitting on some fucking chick and she doesn't want to hook up with them.

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       So he goes out in the parking lot, hammered and backs his car into another truck. And I was trying to tell him, you know, you're not really the victim there, so it's Kinda hard to feel bad for you. So what the fuck did the girl do that made you do something like that? That we should all feel bad for you? Me and my 14 podcast listeners should feel bad for you. So yeah, he goes this, this is the other half. This is his reason for doing that shit. Uh, okay. Hey Bill, thanks for reading my story. Share my gloom with everyone. Ha Ha. Let me tell you what happened with girl number one. All right? This is why he got, he got pissed in the club, was a little tipsy drunk gun in his car, evidently did not look stomped on the gas and backed into a truck, fucked his car up and didn't do shit to the truck.

Speaker 5:          00:46:55       All right. He said, uh, all right. Me and the girl, we've been working together for about a year now and everyone in this building would like to get with her. We've been on and off talking a lot or not at all. It's a big company. She's kind of a teeth. She's kind of a tease. Okay, well, you know, I'm going to take your word for it, but I mean it kind of sounds like she's a good looking woman. You know, who's got a lot of caulk coming at her and uh, you know, maybe she's a little defensive. Um, anyways, she kind of a tease, but hell, I don't care. She's damn hot and I haven't sealed the deal yet. All right, now I'm rooting for you. That's right. Go in and fucking hit it. All right. I was damn sure that this was the night. Um, I was going to hook up with it cause we were hanging out and talking a lot for the few weeks leading up to this particular night out since it was her birthday.

Speaker 5:          00:47:44       Okay. So here he is, you know, chat her up for two weeks. He's going in the patient room as opposed to those other guys who are walking into the cubicle with their pants already have on zip. You know, I respected, everybody likes a full court press, but uh, that usually doesn't work, especially if you weren't dockers. It's just creepy. So anyway, so this guy, you know, works if the two weeks, now it's your birthday. Okay. And uh, let's see. And apparently most girls like to get down on the day when the clock rolls over. Okay, I'm with you anyway. I completely fumbled the ball by not paying enough attention or not flirting enough that night or some shit. And I got pissed when I knew that this was probably the last chance I had, which then led to the affirmation story. So basically you did two weeks of reconnaissance, you went out there, it was her birthday, and you're trying to hit on her to close the deal.

Speaker 5:          00:48:41       And basically every other hot chick that walks by and you're looking at him, you know what, there's not one person in their early twenties that does not have that fucking story that it's just what it is. It's just pussy as to, it's still too amazing for you with the, you're in your thirties you'll be able to block out the other shit and you'll be able to focus on your target. And uh, of course by then you'll be in your thirties. So you'll be hitting on some, a cougar as they say. I hate that fucking word. And I hate those broads who think they're still fucking hot. Like they're 22. Okay. I'm not saying that hot for a 43 year old, but we estopped wearing shit that 22 year old chicks wear. You know what I mean? I just turned 40. Okay. My days of wearing a hap shirt and fucking socks up to my knees, like I'm in that movie dazed and confused.

Speaker 5:          00:49:32       You know what I mean? You'd look at me like I was a retard. All right, stop it. You're hot fee or age, you look good for your age. Okay. But let's leave it at that. Okay. Let's, uh, you're in your dressing elegant years. You're in your address. Classy. Okay. You know, once you past fucking, you know, I dunno, somewhere in your mid thirties if you're still dressing like a Jello shot girl, I don't know what to tell you. You know what that's like. That's like the fucking, the former muscle head who stopped working out, but he still has the whole cog Hogan Wardrobe, you know, so we still got on the tank tops, but now he's got those flabby grandmother arms and it's just like, dude, you need to get a full shirt or start doing some curls because yeah, it's not working. It was like Billy Crystal's grandmother and a Mr Saturday night number.

Speaker 5:          00:50:24       Then they were making sandwiches out of the arm, the fat on the back of her arm. Um, all right. So anyway, so what did, so you got pissed because you weren't able to close the deals and you backed up and smashed your car. That's actually fucking hilarious. Um, that's a whole different segment because stories I was trying to get people to tell is, you know, you went into go buy some a face moisturizer and you came out and your bumper was gone. You know, the whole, I didn't do shit and uh, somebody raped me stories. Um hmm. I guess you created a new one. People will fuck up their car cause a, they were trying to fuck the hot chicken work on her birthday. Okay. And uh, I don't know. They looked at some of the chicken. I don't know what happened. Anyways, whatever man to man, I feel bad for you.

Speaker 5:          00:51:11       Okay. Is, uh, last story I'm going to read here. Um, all right, bill a, your Ranson. American Airlines ring true as they screwed a marine I met while on vacation. I don't know if you guys listen to this shit every week, but American Airlines fucked me over awhile. Back to the point I did a puff daddy a remix of their song. Um, when little stop like this wave up man, fucking you. What? In the aish ass h so you can still get it on the air. All right, so this is, this is this guy's story. All right. While returning from Mexico, I was in DFW airport. I love when people write their DFW. Like I know what the fuck that means. Is that Detroit fucking where port. Oh, Dallas. Dallas. Dallas. Fort Worth. There we go. The Delaware. All right. I don't know. Um, Detroit fucking, I dunno. I went in with the fucking guy is, he's at DFW airport.

Speaker 5:          00:52:09       Okay. And I know for all you pilots out there, hey, people do flown into lax. Kelly x is actually a great JFK lax. People know that. But stop saying DFW. Like I know where the fuck that is. All right. I was in DFW airport and I left, said no voc. I'm in the OCC. Barely. I don't know what the fuck that is. Orange County, I still don't know what that is. It's south of Los Angeles. Thank you. Thank you. You mean that place that nobody fucking goes to in between Los Angeles and San Diego. All right. I was in DFW airport and met this guy at the tram. Oh, just fucked it up. That word just makes my skin crawl. All the airports I've been, I was at the tram. Uh, I met this guy at the tram who was fuming mad. He told me he was headed to, to Gulfport, Mississippi from California and the plane had engine trouble and had to return.

Speaker 5:          00:53:01       He then caught the next flight and then had to land in Dallas due to bad weather. He was then told that all all flights out were on standby and while talking to the gate agent, the employee got pissy with them. What a fucking surprise. He mentioned that he had orders and needed help getting any flight out and the clerk said, sir, I can't help you. Please enjoy your night in the airport. After the marine calmed down, I asked him what airline he was on. He replied, motherfucking air, American Airlines, they suck. I hope they go under Jesus Christ. They even fuck over a guy. Was He in uniform? Sharing can help you. Please enjoy your night in the airport. Really, please enjoy this fucking Timberland T. I already said the c word enough in this God damn thing. It's ridiculous. Do you know something? You know, just go on their website.

Speaker 5:          00:53:56       Just start complaining. I'm really trying to do that shit. You know what I mean? Somebody's got to do something. You know what I mean? If somebody fucking do something, do they respond when you complain? Somebody sent me a fucking email about a, they returned something at best buy and they charged him a 15% restock fee, which basically they bought something. It sucked. They brought it back. Okay. If it costs a grand, they charge them 150 bucks just to put it back on the shelf. So they still make money. So personally, I'll never shop in a best buy again. That's it. I'm done. That's what I'm saying. That's just like, you know what, I'm not eating fast food ever again, man. So that basically means I'm not fucking with best buy for three months. I don't know. I'm sorry. I said, let's get, let's get on with the questions.

Speaker 5:          00:54:40       Okay, this fucking, this podcast started off really good and now it's just, it's brining to a fucking halt. Let me see if I can up the comedy here. Take it up a notch. Okay. This podcast is like, it's like the Lakers in game six. You know what I mean? I never seen a team with west hard. Jesus Christ. I'll fix her up by 40 points. They're still shooting three pointers. You think he would've put up with that? Kareem, those guys would've been throwing elbows. Larry Burton, all of them would've been holding up the trophy looking like Bobby Clark and the Lakers just stood there and watched it. All right. Questions a number one. By the way, I'm a Celtics fan and yes, I am totally psyched and I'm sick. All you like offense talking to bite me about this, buying them guy like he's the second coming of fucking Bill Russell and Michael Jordan.

Speaker 5:          00:55:28       Okay. You guys need to work on your heart first. Why don't you draft a fucking heart first and then talk to me about, you know, fucking kid a coming off the goddamn bench. Cause I don't give a fuck. Woo. Got a little hostile there. All right, question number one. So when a comedian does the comedy central presents, is there an applause o meter? Because sometimes it seems like an odd place for an applause break. Also. Is there an opening act to warm up the crowd? Uh, let's see, is there a plaza meter? No, they just actually, I think they just edit it in. They'll take applause from a different joke that really killed and uh, I don't know, maybe cause there's a low and for some reason they think the viewer at home isn't gonna notice or like when they cut to somebody who's laughing hysterically at another joke, that was hysterical.

Speaker 5:          00:56:22       That maybe even that didn't even tell. They'll actually, if they get a good laugh or in the crowd, they use that as stock footage. You know, Kinda like, you know, a battle footage. You don't like the, you don't want to show the atom bomb. It's the, they have like two or three views of that stock footage of the fucking Adam Bond. That's the same, it's the same thing in standup comedy. Okay. Some lady lost her shit laughing in 1983. You haven't ever noticed that. Sometimes like they'll cut to somebody. It's really bad. Like on v t they'll cut to somebody with a hairstyle that is just like from fucking 20 years ago. You know what I mean? Like, remember black people used to have the three levels, like high top fade, like three different levels. So it was like a parking garage or like a, some sort of fancy stairs that would lead into like a, a serving room or some shit.

Speaker 5:          00:57:09       I remember the, you know, during the, uh, the Bobby Brown, uh, my prerogative, that's what they'll do. They'll show a guy, black dude or a white dude or whatever on comic view and he'll tell a fucking joke, you know, that dress, you know, they got a Obama and o a t shirt, right? The comedian. And then they'll cut to somebody who looks like one of the guys and fucking boys to men sworn like one of those lime green fucking seven up sports coats. Um, okay. Yeah, I think, I think I overly explained that. Alright. Also, is there an opening act to warm up the crowd? Uh, if you're lucky? Yes, there is. Uh, if there isn't, it sucks because it's like nobody's laughing. They're just sitting there and all of a sudden you come out and you're just like, what's up with lamps? These things crazy and it's really shocking.

Speaker 5:          00:57:57       So hopefully there is a warmup act. All my experiences there has been. Okay. Question number two. The question is why does asparagus make your kiss stick? Um, I just looked at, you said Piss, you know, like they should have been the f word in that sentence. Just, just to prepare me for pis. I should've been. Why does your, why does asparagus make your urine smell for a while? Is fucking asparagus make you pitch stick? You know what I mean? You've got gotta be consistent here. The first half, you're like Dan rather reading off the teleprompter and then you know the second half you go and dice clay on me. All right. Asparagus contains or this is, this is the answer. I actually looked it up. This was the first thing I saw. So I'm going with this like it's the truth. Asparagus contains a sulfur compound called Merck captain.

Speaker 5:          00:58:45       It's also found in rotten eggs, onions, garlic and in this, in the secretion of skunks, when your digestive track breaks down, this substance byproducts are released. That caused the funny sense, the funny scent. I don't think it's funny you guys think it's funny. It's actually kind of disgusting. The process is so quick that your urine can develop the distinctive smell within 15 to 30 minutes of eating asparagus. She sources for more info. I left that last part in there just in case. I actually tried to play that off like I wasn't reading it. Um, so that's why it does it, you know, cause there's some sort of sulfur compound mercaptans that's also fun and rotten eggs, onions, garlic and in the secretion of skunks. You know what I mean? That's just one of those bucket things that the second you hear it, just forget it.

Speaker 5:          00:59:30       Okay. Cause there's no way to say that at a party and it's going to get you any further with the person you're talking to. You know, either talking them into bed or trying to get a promotion that's just like, it just makes you weird. And people just sorta rates raise their eyebrows and nod and fucking walk away. And you're left with a awkward silence. And that's when you take out your cell phone and you pretend you got to call. You don't have a call. All right, question number three. Oh, this is a great question. So who is more Badass? Ty Domi above prober for those of you who don't, uh, watch hockey, these are two of the all time great enforcers in NHL history. Who's more Badass? This is ty Domi or Bob Proberg. It's not even a question. It's fucking Bob Prober. Not In, not even, I'm not even talking about at the height of his career where he beats the shit out of every tough guy and let me beat the shit out of every tough guy in the league.

Speaker 5:          01:00:25       He didn't start losing fights towards the end. Okay, so everybody knows what he did on the ice. This is what he did off the ice. Here's a little blur by finding him on the Internet. Died a former NHL enforcement, Bob pro truck, Bob Probert, so I don't do the news. I can't even read his back in jail. He was arrested Friday night in Delray beach after a scuffle with Florida police that led to pro Bert being shocked with the Taser Gun. This is, this is what he's doing after his career, when he's supposed to be out on the golf course, hanging out with Charles Barkley doing cell phone commercial charged with battery on a law enforcement officer resisting arrest with violence and disorderly conduct. Trovert was held without bail at the Palm Beach County jail while playing for the Detroit Redwings in the eighties and nineties propriate served a prison term when he was caught trying to carry cocaine into the United States from Canada.

Speaker 5:          01:01:14       He also had alcohol problems and was charged with numerous driving expenses. Provo probate was placed on inactive status for the eighties 94 to 95 season after he was involved in a motorcycle accident and test showed alcohol and cocaine in his system. This is what he does off the ice is what he was doing off ice during his career. He probably had three fights that night. Beat the shit out of a whole nother team and that still wasn't enough. He's like, Eh, you know, drink a 12 pack of fucking Schaffer, you know, get an eight ball and jump on a fucking Ninja. They'll rate police officers first spotted program at this. This is a, this is for my July, June 4th, 2004 he's well into his forties at this point. All right. They spotted him on Friday as he was parked in his white BMW sport utility vehicle, the wrong way on a side street and began hanging out his window to yell at several men before 1:00 AM and he was out of his mind fucking pussy.

Speaker 5:          01:02:17       You know [inaudible] you probably still wearing the hockey gloves. I bet they're like, he has to do that. He has, he has to drop gloves before he could fight or it's just like, it's like no mark Nomar Garciaparra before he hits, he's got a fucking, you know, click his feet in his shoes and justice gloves, you know, his batting gloves or Betty. He literally has to walk around in hockey gloves or he won't, he won't get the first couple of shots off. So anyways, for officers intervened when pro Bert, a native of Windsor Ontario, got out of the car and tried to start a fight with one of the men according to the report, he then fought with the officers and refused their orders to drop to the ground. As two of the officers struggled to handcuff Filbert, I'm opposite. Thomas Tolbert shot him with a taser gun and he fell backwards. But probate continued to resist their efforts when they tried to handcuff them. This is after getting tasered. So Tolbert use the Taser gun to stunt probate several more times.

Speaker 4:          01:03:19       Hey

Speaker 5:          01:03:19       is fucking unreal. The gun shoots Bob probes. Yeah, that's that Bob. Why Shit? I don't know if you guys know like it's not like science fiction where they just shoot electricity at you. It shoots out these two medieval fucking uh, inquisition

Speaker 5:          01:03:36       hooks in it hooks under your skin. India chest like fucking eagle talents. Like that's not enough to make you just scream like a bitch and drop to the ground. They then shoot electricity into that. Okay. It's bad enough. The guy's already fighting two cops, you know, cops. Okay. There's little cops like they have like many UFC skills. They all know armbars and choke holds and they have guns and clubs and shit and he's fighting two of them. They still have to take them two or three more times. So I would go with Bob Prober. I would say Bob Roberts a little cuff and the tied to Omi. Okay. Until Domi fights for fucking cops in his mid forties and has to get Tabors tasered numerous fucking times. I'm going to go with Bob Prober and I don't want have any sort of fucking hockey geek. Come on here and talk to me about fucking career stats.

Speaker 5:          01:04:25       Bring out dome use, arrest record. All right. Has he been arrested? I didn't even look it up. That's how fucked up probate's arrest record was. I didn't even have, I didn't have the decency to look up tied only so there you go. All right, I've got to wrap this thing up here. This is getting too long. Um, there's a couple more questions. I'll ask the answer real quick. Have you ever done any work on a cruise ship? Uh, yes I did. And they won't be asking me back. The captain wrote a letter, said I was offensive to all races. Said I made fun of Handicapped People Cause I did a joke about midgets. Um, you know, I don't, I don't know what to tell you. You know, uh, I was told that at the night. You already answered this question. Did I answer this question?

Speaker 5:          01:05:05       They told me he's going to be young people and then I got on the cruise ship and the first person I saw was that old Vietnamese lady lady with no teeth asleep with their mouth open. Wearing that on picking rice hat. Then I tell you, I told you that, right? I don't fucking remember. All right, let's get on with it. Okay. That's the podcast for the week. I'm going to tell you some of my, uh, my fucking, uh, my dates they have coming up here, my slow computer, June, 2008. Um, alright. Oh, big date here. I've got, uh, the Improv in Pittsburgh coming up, uh, July 10th through the 13th. Um, I'm actually coming in town the day before cause I'm going to be going to that pirates game. So, uh, if you go to the pirates game, I'm sure you're going to be able to see me cause it's gonna be me and 18 other fucking people sitting out there at the Goddamn game.

All right, so keep the questions coming. Uh, let me know how you guys think the story is. Sometimes I think the stories are good. Sometimes I think kind of slows me down from a joking around. I don't know if they're boring or if they're interesting, please let me know. Please give me your feedback. I'll probably regret saying that cause now I'm going to get a bunch of yeah and you started too much during them and blah blah blah.

Speaker 5:          01:06:41       So what, why would I open myself up to more criticisms in life? Anyways, thanks everybody. I really appreciate all you guys listening.

Speaker 5:          01:07:26       Taking shit from these corporations. Go to their websites and complain. Use a lot of words like outrageous, ridiculous. Try to go to a privately owned shit. That's what I like doing. I tried to do that. Then you go in there and they shit all over the food, all over the spoon. I mean, this is food all over the spoon. God just fucking, this is why, you know, most people when they read the dyslexic, I like to speak in dyslexia. This is why I became a comedian. If she ever fucking wondered why this is why I did it, because I'm too much of a moron to exist in the real world. And secondly, when I'm in the real world, um, I like, I just keep hearing this voice over and over and just going, this is fucking stupid. This is fucking stupid. Fucking stupid. That's all I would hear.

Speaker 5:          01:08:13       You know, I tried to sit in the meetings as they talked about how to make the product better and to try and increase the revenues. And everyone was sitting there and they had out little little notebooks cause it was the 80s, early nineties and it was fucking writing shit down. And I just got so I couldn't hear what the person was saying cause my brain just kept going. This is fucking stupid. This is fucking stupid. I don't want to do this. I don't wanna fucking do this. All right, I don't fucking do this. Alright, there you go. That's my job history. Before I became a comedian. It was me doing one job after another and hearing a loud voice in my head going, I don't want to fucking do this, so I don't,

Speaker 4:          01:08:51       and now I do this and this is too long. All right, I'll talk to you next week. Have a great week. Bye. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] hey, [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].
