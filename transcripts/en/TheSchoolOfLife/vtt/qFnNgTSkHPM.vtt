00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.680
thank you so much for that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680
that was fantastic

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.140
and this song apart from being one of my favorites

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.940
I sing like this everyday

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.900
I am not joking

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.400
the reason i picked this song is because it's called angels

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.240
the reason i picked this song is because it's called angels

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.740
and yet there is no God at the heart of that song

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.280
and yet there is no God at the heart of that song

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.340
but there is a lot of feelings that was formerly directed at our God's art

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.920
is nowadays our new religion and museums are our cathedrals

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.980
this is not me stating it that's something that Theodore Zeldin a cultural historian said

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.400
art is our new religion and museums are our  cathedrals

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.760
that is a beautiful ideal

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.760
because religion is on the decline

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.080
and culture is something that is eminently suited to filling its shoes

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.860
that is take a look at the historical background to that

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.520
you know up until the middle of the 19th century this was a pious nation

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.900
and then around the middle of the 19th century church attendance fell off a cliff

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.580
and people start to worry

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.080
what were people going to do when there is no longer a god to hold a society together

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.100
where were people going to find consolation  meaing

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.840
a sense of morality a sense of dignity

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.200
and somewhere to go to in moments of distress

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.880
and with fears and tears and terrors of mortality

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.100
and a small but influential group of critics in the UK

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.640
came up with an answer which reverberates and challenges us to this day

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.920
critics like Matthew Arnold and John Ruskin began to argue that there was something

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.600
that could fill the gap created by the decline in orgranized faith

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.780
and that thing was culture with a capital C

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.020
culture could replace scripture

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.960
this was the great promise of the 19th century

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.020
political thought that there could be something that could take up the slack the essays of Plato

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.540
the novels of Jane Austen the paintings of Titian and Botticelli the poetry of Matthew Arnold

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.780
these things could fill the  gaps left by the departure of religion

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.660
It's a beautiful idea one that at the School of Life we take deeply seriously

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.620
and one that myself take deeply seriously

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.580
but i can't help but notice that there are a lot of lip service

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.180
is paid to this idea in the cultural establishment among the cultural elite

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.180
in fact the idea is dead

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.140
and i'll tell you why it's dead and how you can prove it's dead

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.740
if you were to show up at any of Britain's elite institutions

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.060
the University of Oxford the University of Cambridge the National Gallery the taint

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.900
and you said i've come here at the funtain of culture

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.480
and i've come to study because i am lost

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.840
i don't know right from wrong

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.560
i am confused i'm terrified of death

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.280
the people in charge of those elite institutions will be picking up the phone and dialing

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.420
if not the insane asylum the police

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.900
it is simply not acceptable to bring the aches and pains of our souls to the guardlians of culture

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.040
whatever lip service is paid to the importance of culture it cannot be done

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.600
now what should you do with these pains and troubles

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.880
well if you 're a relatively stupid person there is one answer that is customarily given

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.860
and that answer is read a self-help book

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.400
these things are for stupid people

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.120
there are some of those people around and they'll tell you how to live

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.840
but the elite answer says that anyone who's clever doesn't need that sort of stuff

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.480
and the reason is that life is relatively simple

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.380
after all all you need to do in an average life is grow up separate yourself from you parents

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.500
find a job that's moderately satisfying

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.900
creat a relationship where you can relate to someone

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.580
start rasing some children

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.720
watch the oneset of mortality and your parents generation

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.060
and then starting to laugh at the shores of your own

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.620
and then eventually when it gets you lie down in the coffin and shutthe lid politely

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.560
and go off into the next world or no world at all

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.000
and that's simple who's got any problem with that

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.700
well i think it's desperately wrong

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.700
i think we are very vulnerable fragile creatures in desperate need of support

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.100
and we generally don't get it

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.460
this is why the school of life was founded it's the founding idea of the school

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.120
that culture can support us in our life

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.780
and it's constant uphill struggle to get that point across

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.180
what i'm trying to talk to you about today is a new book that i've written with a fellow faculty member John Armstrong

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.180
