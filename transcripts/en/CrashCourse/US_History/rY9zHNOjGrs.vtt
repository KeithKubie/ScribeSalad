00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi I’m John Green this is Crash Course US
History and today we come at last to the Civil

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.530
War, the conflict that in many ways created
a nation. So here’s what you won’t be

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.550
getting today.
We will not be describing battles and tactics.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.529
If that’s your bag, might I suggest Ken
Burns or if you prefer books, like 1000 authors,

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.940
my favorites being James McPherson and Shelby
Foote.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.560
And 2. We won’t be bashing and/or praising
Abraham Lincoln very much, although we do

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.359
have multiple Lincolns here because we’ve
heard that’s good for ratings.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.910
I mean, to watch or read certain accounts,
you would think that the Civil War was a lengthy

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.960
chess game played by Abraham Lincoln against
his cunning opponent Abraham Lincoln, but

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.440
of course there were other people involved.
We are going to quote a fair bit of Lincoln,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.019
though, because, you know, that won Tony Kushner
an Academy Award nomination.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.399
3. We won’t be claiming that the Civil War
was somehow secretly about something other

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.339
than slavery, because that is just so early
20th century.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.339
And 4. There will not be a lot of jokes today
because hahaha 700,000 people died.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.159
Mr. Green, actually only 680,000 people died.
Yeah, it depends on how you count, you snivelling

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:06.170
little ghoul. But recent estimates are between
680,000 and 800,000 total casualties. Deadlier

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.170
for Americans than the American Revolution,
World War I, World War II, and Vietnam combined.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.119
intro
So let’s start with some basic facts about

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.240
the American Civil War. 1861 to 1865, which
corresponded with the presidency of Abraham

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.009
Lincoln. The Union, or more colloquially the
North, fought against the forces of the Confederate

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.460
States of America, or the South.
Sometimes people call the Union ‘the blue”

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.399
and the confederates “the gray,” but in
fact the uniforms weren’t very uniform,

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.109
they were all different kinds of color. And
also, with all that dirt and blood, they were

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.630
all just brown. Alright, let’s go to the
Thought Bubble.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.740
You’ll notice from this map that not all
the states that held slaves were part of the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.270
Confederacy. The border states of Kentucky,
Missouri, Delaware and Maryland allowed slavery

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.420
and never left the United States. All of these
border states were critical to the Union--Maryland

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.939
was north of the nation’s capitol in Washington
D.C.; Kentucky controlled the Ohio River;

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.860
Missouri was the gateway to the West; Delaware
actually wasn’t that important.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.110
So none of that should be particularly controversial,
unless you’re from Delaware, but the causes

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.290
of the war, that’s another story. The Civil
War was about slavery--actual historians will

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.650
back me up on this, like David Goldfield,
who wrote, “Both Northerners and Southerners

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.019
recognized slavery as the immediate cause
of the Civil War.” Also, Lincoln said in

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.599
his second inaugural address, “One eighth
of the whole population were colored slaves,

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.470
not distributed generally over the Union,
but localized in the southern part of it.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.120
These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful
interest. All knew that this interest was,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.269
somehow, the cause of the war.”
That said, in comments lots of people will

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.640
be like, the war was about agriculture versus
industry, or the states’ rights to protect

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.720
themselves from the tyranny of a big federal
government, but if it were REALLY about that,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.390
the Civil War would’ve started during the
Nullification crisis in the 1830s, when--as

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.060
I’m sure you’ll remember--Andrew Jackson
said that South Carolina couldn’t declare

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.329
a federal tariff null in their state. Why
didn’t that cause a Civil War?

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.879
The Confederate government passed the first
conscription act in American history, implemented

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.269
national taxes, created a national currency,
and had a government bureaucracy of about

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.560
70,000 people, more than the federal bureaucracy
in Washington D.C.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.340
Thanks, Thought Bubble. That said, in the
beginning of the war, Lincoln deliberately

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.730
tried to downplay the slavery angle, arguing
that the war was only about preserving “the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.469
Union.”
But the war was also about religion, for both

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:36.180
sides. As David Goldfield put it, “In protecting
the Revolutionary ideals, northerners would

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.439
preserve God’s plan to extend democracy
and Christianity across an unbroken continent

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.969
and around the world. Southerners welcomed
a war to create a nation more perfect in its

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.409
fealty to God than the one they had left.”
But it’s also important to remember that

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.909
regular soldiers often had more prosaic reasons
for going off to fight, as you will eventually

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.480
learn when you are forced to read The Red
Badge of Courage,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.319
Goldfield tells the story of one Alabamian
who enlisted only after his girlfriend mailed

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.620
him a dress and told him he should start wearing
if he wasn’t willing to go fight.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.239
And for Northerners, Union, religion and an
end to slavery mixed together to form a potent

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.439
rationale for war. It’s summed up nicely
by Julia Ward Howe’s words to the song that

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.810
would become famous as the Battle Hymn of
the Republic: “As he died to make men holy,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.620
let us die to make men free.” You thought
I was going to sing, but you were wrong.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.120
So spoiler alert the Union won the war, which
in a sense was unsurprising, because they

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.550
had massive advantages:
For starters, they had many more people, approximately

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.100
22 million as compared to 9 million in the
South, of whom 3.5 million were slaves and

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.980
therefore unlikely to be sympathetic to the
Southern cause.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.520
Also, the north manufactured more than 90%
of all goods in America; its factories turned

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.230
out 17 times more textiles than the South,
30 times more shoes and boots, 13 times more

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.200
iron, and 32 times more firearms.
Plus, at the outbreak of the war the North

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.320
had twenty thousand miles of railroad compared
with the South’s ten thousand.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.410
This made it easier for the Union to move
its army, which over the course of the war

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.790
enlisted more than 2 million men, compared
with 900,000 for the Confederacy.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.420
Even northern agriculture was also more productive,
taking greater advantage of mechanization

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.810
than southern farmers did.
Really the only advantage the south had was

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.310
better leaders, like most of the tactically
famous generals of the Civil War, Robert E.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.770
Lee, Stonewall Jackson, J. E. B. Stewart,
etc., were Southerners. And also, by the way,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.960
they all had great last words.
Lee said “Strike the tent,” Stonewall

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.870
Jackson said “Let us cross over the river
and rest under the shade of those trees,”

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.880
and JEB Stuart after being mortally wounded
in battle said to his close friend and lieutenant,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.760
“Honey-bun, how do I look in the face?”
Famous Union general Ulysses Grant’s last

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.190
word was “Water,” which isn’t near so
good, but he said that last word after having

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.630
survived the war and getting to be, like,
President of the United States and stuff.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.200
Right but anyway, this all raises an interesting
question: Was the result of the war a foregone

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.490
conclusion?
The Confederacy had to create a nation from

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.720
scratch and build national unity among people
who were committed to the autonomy of their

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.050
individual home states. So that’s a problem.
And, then there was the issue of overcoming

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.920
class conflicts, especially when the ruling
class was often exempted from actually fighting

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.410
in the war.
But when you put aside all that nation-building

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.540
stuff and just focus on the actual fighting
of the war, the question of the union’s

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.570
inevitable win becomes much trickier.
Some have argued that all the Confederacy

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.640
really to do was outlast the Northern efforts
to bring them back into the Union, like Washington

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.640
had to do against the British.
And the idea was that the war of attrition

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.680
would eventually wear down northern resolve.
But, there were two problems with this theory.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.870
First, the North had such superiority in its
resources that it would take a long time to

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.480
wear down.
Secondly, fighting a war of attrition would

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.620
be costly to the South, as well and their
resources would be depleted long before the

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.120
North’s.
Oh it’s time for the Mystery Document? The

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.980
rules here are simple. Woah! That was intense.
I try to identify the author of the Mystery

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.860
Document. If I am right, I do not get shocked,
but I’m never right because Stan makes it

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.010
too hard. Alright, let’s see what we’ve
got today.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.570
“I therefore determined, first, to use the
greatest number of troops practicable against

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.650
the armed force of the enemy, preventing him
from using the same force at different seasons

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.650
[and] second, to hammer continuously against
the armed force of the enemy and his resources,

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.820
until by mere attrition … there should be
nothing left to him but submission.” [1]

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.220
Okay so the strategy of attrition was a Confederate
strategy. But, Stan is a jerk.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.610
But it talks about the enemy AND HIS RESOURCES,
which was kind of a Union focus. And more

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.210
importantly, it talks about preventing him
from using the same force at different seasons.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.600
That makes me think it is a Union general.
Final answer Ulysses S. Grant. OH HOW DO YOU

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.050
LIKE THEM APPLES.
Grant was different from previous Union generals

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.530
in that he was willing to sustain enormous
casualties in pursuit of his goal to wear

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.850
down the South.
Because of this, Grant was branded a butcher,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:54.650
like he was willing to weather incredible
losses including the 52,000 men -- 41% of

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.590
his army -- who were injured or killed at
the battles of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.900
But his grim determination not just to defeat
but to destroy his opponent is what made Grant

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.750
one of the first truly modern generals and
also the most successful leader the Union

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.660
found.
So, Grant’s brutal strategy coupled with

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.610
the vast superiority in Northern resources
suggests that the outcome of the Civil war

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.540
really was inevitable, but it also points
to some of the reasons to be cautious about

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.450
that conclusion.
First off, it took three years before the

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.930
Union actually fully adopted Grant’s strategy,
and between 1861 and 1864 it was possible

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.280
that Southern victories would eventually force
the Union to give in.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.120
I mean, the Union lost a lot of battles in
the first two years, largely due to ineffective

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.159
General-ing and nothing saps a nation’s
motivation for war like losing.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.509
Now, some argue that the North had superior
motivation to prosecute the war because they

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:46.810
had God on their side and they were against
slavery, but that’s also pretty problematic.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.120
I mean, for many men who joined the federal
army, a war to end slavery had very little

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.920
appeal, especially poor enlistees who might
be afraid that newly-freed slaves would compete

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.019
with them for jobs.
Also, while we are correct in considering

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:03.959
slavery unjust, southerners who took up arms
for the Confederacy saw themselves as engaged

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:07.579
in a fight for their own freedom, rather than
a fight to protect slavery.

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:11.540
The truth is, when it comes to fighting, motivation
is a very tricky business, and I’m most

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.819
comfortable agreeing with James McPherson
who argued that motivation waxes and wanes

00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:19.920
with victory, and that the outcome of the
war was contingent on a number of turning

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.509
points.
And we’re just gonna discuss two of the

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:28.350
most important: July 1863 and August 1864.
July 1863 saw two of the most important Union

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.930
victories in the whole war. In the western
theater, General Grant laid siege to and captured

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.550
Vicksburg Mississippi, thus giving the federals
control of the lower Mississippi river.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.639
I mean, by then, the North already had New
Orleans, which made it pretty much impossible

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:43.370
for the Confederates to ship cotton or anything
else along the Mississippi River.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.250
After that, Grant was able to turn his attention
to the east with the aforementioned hammering

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.019
of the enemy and their resources.
More famously, especially in the eastern part

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:55.689
of the United States, the first three days
of July 1863 saw the battle of Gettysburg

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:59.110
in Pennsylvania.
This was General Lee’s furthest major offensive

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.420
in the north and had he won the battle it
is likely that panic would have set in in

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.180
places like Philadelphia and maybe even New
York.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.620
Actually panic did overcome New York in draft
riots that killed more than 100 people and

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.529
only ended after troops from Gettysburg were
called in.

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:17.350
I’m not going to go into detail about either
of these battles, but they shifted the tide

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:22.639
of the war in favor of the North, although
not enough to bring the war to a quick end.

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:27.740
Confederate forces would never again threaten
a northern city. August 1864 saw another turning

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.639
point that really spelled the doom of the
Confederacy, and that was when Union general

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:36.639
Sherman took Atlanta. Atlanta was a railroad
hub and manufacturing center but its capture

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:40.839
was more significant politically than militarily
because it happened close to the election

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:44.069
of 1864.
And that American election was really the

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:47.720
last time that the Confederate states of America
could have won the Civil War.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.410
It’s easy to forget this, but Lincoln actually
had to run for reelection during the Civil

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.189
War, and by the summer of 1864 the war was
pretty unpopular and it looked like Lincoln

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.759
might lose.
The capture of Atlanta changed public opinion

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:04.199
about Lincoln and meant it that his Democratic
opponent and former top general George McClellan

00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:08.410
didn’t stand a chance of winning, which
was really significant for the war because

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.110
Lincoln was committed to ending it with a
Union victory and McClellan, meh.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:17.040
I think it says a lot about American history
that in the end the war’s outcome was insured

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.339
not just by military victories but by a political
one.

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:23.610
Next week, we’ll examine the effects of
the Civil War and the enduring questions that

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.870
have arisen out of it, such as who, exactly,
freed the slaves? But, until then, thanks

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.790
for watching.
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.089
Muller. The script supervisor is Meredith
Danko. Our show is written by my high school

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:38.259
history teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself.
Our graphics team is Thought Café. And our

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:42.199
associate producer is Danica Johnson, also
responsible for felt Abraham Lincoln.

00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:45.689
If you want to suggest captions for the libertage,
you can do so in comments where you can also

00:11:45.689 --> 00:11:49.240
ask questions about today’s video that will
be answered by our team of historians.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.800
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.
