00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.199
Every year, hundreds of thousands of students
march across a stage in a gown and a squared

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.009
hat to receive a piece of paper that says
they’ve completed a particular phase in

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.270
their education.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.460
This school graduation will undoubtedly be
marked by cheering, proud adults, and, particularly

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.320
in North America, the playing of the seminal
marching tune “Pomp and Circumstance March

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.450
No. 1.”

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.130
So, why is Pomp and Circumstance played at
seemingly every graduation?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.320
We should probably kick things off by discussing
the name itself- “pomp and circumstance”

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.100
simply is a phrase for a ceremony or display
of splendor or stateliness.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.190
It comes from the Latin “pompa,” meaning
“procession,” and “circumstantia,”

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.830
meaning “standing around.”

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.890
A procession of standing around doesn’t
make much sense until one follows the evolution

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.320
of the meaning “circumstantia.”

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.990
In the 13th century, the word was used in
reference to “a particular detail, matter

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.540
of small consequence.”

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.580
But a century later, in the 1300s, somehow
it literally reversed its meaning to be defined

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.640
as “something of great importance or accomplishment.”

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.040
Like so many other phrases, the credit for
the first to coin this one is generally given

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.610
to William Shakespeare, though in many cases
it is thought he was just using existing phrases

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.840
that we simply don’t have earlier surviving
examples of today.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.710
Whatever the case, in Act 3, Scene 3 of his
1604 play “Othello,” the title character

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.710
notes

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.340
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill
trump,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.549
The spirit-stirring drum, th’ear-piercing
fife,

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.400
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400
war!

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.310
From there, the phrase seemed to take on an
almost sarcastic quality, often used as a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.310
way to make fun or point to the belief that
someone or something thinks of themselves

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.310
as overly important.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.100
Flash forward three centuries later, in 1901,
one Edward Elgar had already made a name for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.340
himself as one of the premier English musical
composers of his day.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.370
Despite this, as so many musicians and artists
before him, Elgar was struggling financially,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.599
unable to translate critically-acclaimed works
into money-making successes.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.490
Knowing that people love a good military march,
he composed two (of what would end up being

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.770
five) marches that he called “Pomp and Circumstance,”
pulling the title from the line in Othello.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.860
As for the most famous of these, March No.
1, legend has it that Elgar told a friend,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.671
Dora Penny, that “I’ve got a tune that
will knock ’em – knock ’em flat! … a

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.890
tune like that comes once in a lifetime.”

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.240
Whether he actually said this or not, “Pomp
and Circumstance” March No. 1 in D was first

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.030
performed on October 19, 1901 by the Liverpool
Orchestral Society.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.770
This debut performance was reportedly met
with a standing ovation, which was nothing

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.099
compared to when it was played three days
later in London.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.690
After the first go-around, the ecstatic audience
would not let the rest of the concert go on

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.459
until the tune was played two more times.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.550
(And, note, this sort of non-passive audience
used to be the norm, even during symphonies,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.640
contrary to what generally happens at such
events today, see: Has There Ever Been an

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:44.810
Actual Case of Someone Being Pelted With Tomatoes
During a Performance?)

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.510
This event was, according to the London performance’s
conductor, Henry J. Wood, the first time in

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.200
that particular theater’s history that a
double encore was ever done.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.379
In November of that year, Elgar was approached
by famed English contralto Clara Butt who

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.440
asked him to compose a finale for her performance
with a full chorus at the crowning of King

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.780
Edward VII later that summer.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.019
Sparing himself extra work, Elgar used the
very same march he’d composed that was such

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.019
a hit.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.130
He did add lyrics to it, thanks to poet Arthur
Christopher Benson.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.460
Called “Land of Hope and Glory,” Benson’s
lyrics extol the virtues of the British crown

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.460
and empire.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.659
The march, coupled with lyrics and Butt singing,
was all set to premiere on June 30th at King

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.380
Edward VII’s coronation, but the king fell
ill and the ceremony was delayed until August

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.380
9th.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.550
In meantime, Elgar put together four more
marches and produced sellable versions of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.550
them.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.349
By August, he was already making good money
off this.

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.880
When it was finally played at the coronation
of the new King and Queen, Elgar was on his

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.509
way to finally making his fortune.

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.629
Thanks to the music’s prominence in the
coronation, Elgar became internationally famous.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.749
Fairly quickly, in part because of its use
at the coronation of the King and Queen, the

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:05.060
march became immensely popular with American
orchestras, particularly played with great

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.169
frequency in Chicago.

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.060
Coming back around to why Pomp and Circumstance
is played during graduation ceremonies, in

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.270
1905, Elgar was invited to the United States
by a friend, Professor of Music Samuel Sanford,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.379
to receive an honorary degree from Yale University.

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:26.259
Hailed as “England’s foremost musician,”
he outshone the 12 others who were also receiving

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.610
honorary degrees from the revered American
university that day.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.469
Upon completion of the ceremony, the entire
group left the stage to the tune of “Pomp

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.819
and Circumstance March No. 1” in honor of
Elgar.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.279
This is the first known time that the tune
was played at a school graduation.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:45.599
The uplifting song was noted by other colleges
and played at graduations, including at Princeton

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.669
in 1907 and University of Chicago in 1908.

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.469
According to the Elgar Research Center, it
was the 1920s when “Pomp and Circumstance”

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.610
became the norm at college graduations across
the United States, though it’s unclear when

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.490
it shifted from being a recessional to a processional
(entering) song.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.599
Today, the lyrical version of the march (Land
of Hope and Glory) is one of England’s most

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.759
famous songs, even considered by some to be
something of a second national anthem.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.649
In the United States, the march – sans lyrics
– is also played thousands of times a year

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:50.970
while students march down the aisles in anticipation
of receiving their diplomas.
