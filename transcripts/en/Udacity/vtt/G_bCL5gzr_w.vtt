00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.981
Most symmetric encryption schemes are
called block ciphers because they take

00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.930
a fixed length plain
text block as input.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.430
We will discuss later how these
schemes can be used to encrypt

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.200
input text arbitrary length.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.350
Here is a very high level
view of block ciphers.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.900
A plain text block of fixed length,
say n, is encrypted using secret key,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.450
k, to produce a cipher attacks
block of same length, n.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.250
The same secret key, k,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.460
is used to decrypt the cipher attack's
block into the plain text block.
