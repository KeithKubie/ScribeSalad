00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:01.196
- [Man] Hello Grammarians.

00:00:01.196 --> 00:00:02.029
Hello Rosie.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.140
- [Rosie] Hi David.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.381
- [David] So you've called me

00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:05.947
into the recording booth today.

00:00:05.947 --> 00:00:06.989
- [Rosie] Yes.

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:10.890
- [David] Because you have
a bone to pick with me.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.456
- [Rosie] Just a little bit, yeah.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.092
- [David] So I have always

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:16.945
in my usage, I've always
drawn a distinction

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.307
between 'less' and 'fewer'.

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:21.336
I wouldn't say I'm one of those sticklers

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:23.514
that goes around correcting signs

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:25.509
at the grocery store checkout.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.441
You know if it says like 15 items or Less.

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:29.839
I'm not gonna take out a black Sharpie

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.172
and say,"No, fewer."

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.570
But I do think that there is

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.869
a distinction in usage between the two.

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:40.379
But you told me that there is not

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.229
as much as I would like to believe.

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:44.517
Look, like I'm the last person

00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:46.437
that wants to needlessly subscribe

00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:48.521
to grammar superstitions, right?

00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:49.496
- [Rosie] Right.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:50.721
- [David] Our job is to go around

00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.780
with our little needle
of truth and pop 'em.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.613
- [Rosie] Yes.

00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:56.134
That's what I'm gonna try to do

00:00:56.134 --> 00:00:57.367
or I'm gonna try to argue this.

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:58.807
- [David] Okay. Dislodge me from my perch.

00:00:58.807 --> 00:00:59.640
- [Rosie] Alright.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.358
I'm gonna make a broad
statement to start with

00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:06.275
and we can kinda dig into
it but my argument is

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:10.865
that you can use 'less'

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:11.698
to mean

00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:17.204
or to refer to both
countable items, count nouns

00:01:17.204 --> 00:01:19.204
and to larger mass nouns

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:23.016
but you can only use 'fewer'

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:26.494
to refer to count nouns

00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:29.577
like, 'five items or fewer'

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.851
but you couldn't say 'fewer water'.

00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:34.684
- [David] So you are acknowledging

00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:36.181
that there is a difference.

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:37.529
- [Rosie] Oh definitely!

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:38.454
- [David] So okay, so Rosie

00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:41.261
what are count nouns and mass nouns?

00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:42.269
- [Rosie] Good question.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.831
So, count nouns are essentially nouns

00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:47.134
that you can count individually

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:47.967
as in individual entity.

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:51.383
So an example between these two

00:01:51.383 --> 00:01:53.892
count noun would be 'grains of sand'

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:54.850
- [David] Okay.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.876
So I can count, not that I'd want to

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:59.027
grains of sand individually

00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:01.785
but I guess what you're
saying is I couldn't count

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:02.897
- [Rosie] Sand.

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:03.780
- [David] Sand.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.744
Like, let's say for some reason

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:09.924
you and I were having a
sand counting contest.

00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:12.470
Plucking individual grains of sand

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.565
from the beach with tweezers
putting them in a bucket.

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:19.416
I could say, "I have fewer
grains of sand than you do."

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:20.249
- [Rosie] Right.

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.738
- But I couldn't say, "I have fewer sand."

00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:23.571
Is that what you're saying?

00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:24.797
- [Rosie] That is what I'm saying.

00:02:24.797 --> 00:02:28.229
Fewer just, it just
doesn't in Standard English

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.224
it just doesn't go with these mass nouns.

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:33.565
You know, fewer sand.

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.896
I'm getting fewer sun than I used to.

00:02:36.896 --> 00:02:38.883
You would say, "I'm getting
less sun than I used to"

00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:40.984
for example if you're talking
about being out in the sun.

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:43.822
- [David] Sure. Versus
hours of sun exposure.

00:02:43.822 --> 00:02:47.161
- [Rosie] Right. You could get
fewer hours of sun exposure

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.994
but my argument

00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:50.050
and this is where I think you and I differ

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.529
is that I believe you could also say

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.334
"I'm getting less hours of sun exposure."

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:56.453
- [David] Hmm!

00:02:56.453 --> 00:02:57.644
- [Rosie] And the reason
that I feel this way

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:58.964
- [David] Okay

00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:01.697
- [Rosie] Is that this trend

00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:02.697
or this idea

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.699
that fewer always has to
go with the count noun

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.866
is really just

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.892
as far as I can figure

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:16.475
just a thing that some guy

00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.453
named Robert Baker

00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:21.826
wrote in this book.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:22.945
- [David] What do you mean "some guy"?

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:23.800
- [Rosie] He was, well okay

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.891
- [David] Just like some dude invented it?

00:03:24.891 --> 00:03:27.038
- [Rosie] He wasn't
some guy, I guess he was

00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:31.067
at the time he was sort of a front-runner

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:32.258
in terms of talking about language

00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:33.803
and he wrote this book

00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:35.806
that was called "Reflections
on the English Language"

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:37.302
in 1770.

00:03:37.302 --> 00:03:41.119
And what Robert Baker said in the book

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.474
and this is, I mean,
people have looked at this

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:47.641
and tried to trace the origins
of this 'fewer/less' issue

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.327
with count nouns

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:52.044
and Robert Baker said

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:56.211
"This word is most commonly
used in speaking of a Number

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.159
"where I should think
'fewer' would do better.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.234
"No fewer than a hundred appears
to me not only more elegant

00:04:05.234 --> 00:04:09.338
"than no less than a hundred,
but strictly proper."

00:04:09.338 --> 00:04:12.817
- [David] He did just kind
of decide arbitrarily.

00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:13.650
- [Rosie] He did.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.775
I mean he's really
stating his opinion here.

00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:20.433
He says, "Appears to me
not only more elegant

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.248
"than less than a hundred
but strictly proper."

00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:24.809
Okay so maybe this strictly proper

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.135
sounds a little intimidating

00:04:27.135 --> 00:04:28.586
but he's stating an opinion here.

00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:30.951
- [David] So he's talking
about the word 'less'.

00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:32.128
- [Rosie] He's talking
about the word 'less'.

00:04:32.128 --> 00:04:33.556
- [David] The word 'less'
is most commonly used

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:35.431
in speaking of a number.

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:37.813
And he just thinks, "Ah, I feel
like fewer would do better"

00:04:37.813 --> 00:04:40.450
so he's going on this gut impulse.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.851
Which is for the record, fine.

00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:43.684
- [Rosie] It is fine.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.172
- [David] Right? Like there's nothing

00:04:45.172 --> 00:04:47.702
would you think there's
anything ungrammatical

00:04:47.702 --> 00:04:51.702
about saying, "There is
fewer, I get fewer sun."

00:04:53.173 --> 00:04:54.113
- [Rosie] I guess not.

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:57.780
It's just not the way that
we speak in Standard English.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.073
- [David] It's just
style and culture right?

00:05:00.073 --> 00:05:01.089
- [Rosie] Right.

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.393
- [David] That dictates the
way that we feel about words.

00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:03.334
- [Rosie] Right.

00:05:03.334 --> 00:05:05.299
And so I guess that's what I'm getting at

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:08.049
is in Standard English these days

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:10.899
we see 'less' being used

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.627
when referring to both
count nouns and mass nouns

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:19.627
and I think that's fine.

00:05:20.993 --> 00:05:22.176
- [David] Alright.

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:23.250
- [Rosie] Yeah. I don't
see any problem with that

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.667
especially since the only real reasoning

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.237
that anybody can find to go on

00:05:30.237 --> 00:05:33.404
is this one persons opinion from 1770.

00:05:34.297 --> 00:05:36.047
So I think we can say

00:05:37.177 --> 00:05:40.010
'less' to refer to countable items

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:44.900
- [David] And lest you
think that we're replacing

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.920
one dudes opinion from 1770

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.869
with two peoples opinion from the present

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:51.610
like I get that that's
a legitimate criticism

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.443
that you can make

00:05:52.443 --> 00:05:53.992
but what we're trying to say

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:55.644
is that this reflects
the way that language

00:05:55.644 --> 00:05:58.130
is commonly used and understood now.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.963
- [Rosie] Right.

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:00.879
- [David] This isn't just the two of us

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.591
making an arbitrary rule.

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:06.284
Which, by the way Rosie
I'm now on your side.

00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:07.525
I buy into this.

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:10.138
You can use 'less' to refer
to count nouns and mass nouns

00:06:10.138 --> 00:06:12.497
but 'fewer' only in refer to count nouns.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.497
I get that.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.815
Because this actually reflects the way

00:06:16.815 --> 00:06:19.253
that these words are used

00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:21.186
in what is called 'The corpus of English'

00:06:21.186 --> 00:06:23.584
like the body of language

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:26.033
that bounces around everyday.

00:06:26.033 --> 00:06:27.566
- [Rosie] Exactly.

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:29.916
And the one exception that I would say

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:32.536
comes back to this question
of context and style

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:34.714
that David and I have been talking about.

00:06:34.714 --> 00:06:36.650
If you're writing a formal paper

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.139
you probably wanna use 'fewer'
to refer to count nouns

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:41.885
because in that context

00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:43.685
I mean that's still
kinda what's on the books

00:06:43.685 --> 00:06:45.268
as the "right way".

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:50.800
- [David] Okay, so this
is the more formal option.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.017
They're both correct
but this is more formal?

00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:54.338
- [Rosie] Right. I would say so.

00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:57.220
- [David] Okay. Well
cool. Thank you Rosie.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.333
- [Rosie] Oh, you're welcome.

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.997
- [David] I feel like I
learned something today.

00:07:00.997 --> 00:07:04.652
Thank you for disabusing
me of this superstition.

00:07:04.652 --> 00:07:05.986
- [Rosie] Of course.

00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:09.082
- [David] And thank you
Grammarians, you can learn anything.

00:07:09.082 --> 00:07:09.915
David out.

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:10.915
- [Rosie] Rosie out.
