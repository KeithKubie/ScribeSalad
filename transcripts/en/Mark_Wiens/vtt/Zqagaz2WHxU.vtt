00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.669
- All right, hey
everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.432
I am in Saigon, Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam,

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:07.495
and I'm sitting down for what is one of,

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.829
I guess you could call it a pastime

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.829
or a highly enjoyed meal in Vietnam,

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.321
uh, eating snails.

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:20.277
(chillout beats)

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:26.281
So first, you choose your
type of shellfish or snail.

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.850
And then once you know
which snail you want,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.731
then you tell them how you want it cooked.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.827
So, they have like five
different ways to cook it,

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:37.744
I think one is stir-fried, sauteed,

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:42.404
steamed, a bunch of different ways.

00:00:42.404 --> 00:00:45.272
But this is like a Vietnamese pastime,

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:47.125
it's extremely popular,

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:50.897
and whenever you eat shellfish and snails

00:00:50.897 --> 00:00:53.003
you have to be drinking beer as well.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.586
At least, almost everyone does.

00:00:58.474 --> 00:01:01.298
So I am sitting right along the street,

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:04.747
actually just a couple blocks
from where I'm staying,

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:07.635
and I have ordered a
couple of different dishes

00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:09.786
of which a few I know what they are,

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:11.379
and a few I have no idea what they are.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:13.331
Oh, and one that just came.

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:14.164
Ohh-kay.

00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:17.850
Oh, these are the crazy ones.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.703
I'm not sure what kind of snail this is

00:01:19.703 --> 00:01:21.412
but it was recommended by our waiter.

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:22.857
This is a huge--

00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:24.589
that's huge.

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:27.423
Comparison of this one and this one.

00:01:27.423 --> 00:01:28.706
Oh, that's hot.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:29.815
Oh that's hot.

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:33.898
Okay, I'm gonna grab these
little two-prong fork.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.140
I think I'm gonna start with--

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.277
I think these are the Babylon snails,

00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:42.636
or Babylon snai--
yeah, I think so.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:46.299
Anyways, and this is
stir-fried in chili and garlic.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.216
Okay, let me poke it and then pull.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.212
Oh yeah, okay that came out nicely.

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:58.917
Okay so the problem is
that all the seasoning

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:01.210
is on the shell, but
then when I pulled it out

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.620
it's like a naked, a little naked snail.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.348
So, I don't know if I
should dip in a sauce?

00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:10.598
Okay I'll dip a little bit,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.157
and then I'm gonna eat it, okay.

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:18.567
Mmmm.

00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:21.724
Oh wow.

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:22.557
That is--

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.491
it's a little bit on the chewy side,

00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:30.423
but I do like that seasoning.

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:32.983
The seasoning is like garlic salt--

00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:35.233
garlic salt and chili, mmm.

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:39.590
Oh that's chewy, but in a very good way.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.507
Almost like squid, mmm.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.162
Okay, this one is another
snail and I can see--

00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:50.427
and this one I think is
stewed in coconut milk,

00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:55.132
and then it is topped with a
handful of Vietnamese mint,

00:02:55.132 --> 00:02:57.492
or Vietnamese coriander.

00:02:57.492 --> 00:02:58.981
Let me try to find a big one.

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:00.398
Okay, here we go.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:02.914
Wow.

00:03:06.174 --> 00:03:07.683
I didn't even know how to eat this,

00:03:07.683 --> 00:03:09.778
but the kind waiters here have told me

00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:11.433
that I gotta suck this one,

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.120
'cause I was trying to poke down here,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.620
but there was nothing to poke.

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:19.781
Mmmm, okay.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.733
I sucked down a bunch of sauce first.

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:29.338
And then the little snail came
like, sliming out at the end.

00:03:29.338 --> 00:03:31.644
That almost has the texture of an oyster.

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.401
It's slimy, and then that's like

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:37.484
a kind of a sweet coconut milk curry.

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:42.781
I think I should chase it
with some Vietnamese mint.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.670
Mmm, once you're finished
eating these snails,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.587
you just toss the shell
into the garbage below.

00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.929
Okay, these are scallops, and
they're just little scallops,

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.547
but I think they're grilled
face down, or shell down,

00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:08.789
and then they are topped with
green onions and peanuts.

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.411
So I don't think I've
ever had the combination

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:12.639
of scallops and peanuts,

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.264
so I am looking forward to this one.

00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:18.676
I'm not sure if you should
just go in with your face,

00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:20.387
or eat--
but anyways,

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:23.970
I guess I'll go with
the fork method first,

00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:27.777
try to scoop on all those peanuts.

00:04:27.777 --> 00:04:28.610
Okay.

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:34.335
Mmmmm.

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:37.801
Oh yeah.

00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:43.131
Oh that really works,

00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:44.521
oh that really works well.

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:45.591
And then you're supposed to chase it

00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:48.758
with the Vietnamese coriander as well.

00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:51.668
And I'm just gonna--

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:53.693
I think I'm just gonna bite
straight into this shell

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.526
to get everything out.

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:03.548
Mmmmm.

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:09.412
Oh, I think there must
be some butter on that

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:11.594
because it tastes so good.

00:05:11.594 --> 00:05:12.427
Oh, wow.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.034
That is a combination,

00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:20.060
scallops and peanuts, that I
never would have thought of.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.273
And it doesn't--

00:05:21.273 --> 00:05:23.247
to me it doesn't even sound that good.

00:05:23.247 --> 00:05:25.111
But it's actually amazing.

00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:28.420
It has that beautiful
sweetness from the scallop,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.232
and then that peanutty nutty flavor,

00:05:31.232 --> 00:05:34.762
and then also the
crunchiness from the peanuts.

00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:36.471
That is awesome.

00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:38.821
That's like a scallop with peanut butter.

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:39.654
Amazing.

00:05:39.654 --> 00:05:42.783
I also got some beef
stir-fried with noodles.

00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:46.700
Gotta get a bit of a more
filling dish as well,

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:50.072
and so let me taste that.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.152
Mmmmm.

00:05:57.221 --> 00:05:58.054
Oh yeah.

00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:03.905
Again, the beef in Vietnam is so good,

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:07.537
and that's stir-fried on top of noodles,

00:06:07.537 --> 00:06:12.023
with some Gai-Lan Chinese
broccoli on there.

00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:14.273
That's marvelous, the beef.

00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:19.281
And also I got some morning glory,

00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.281
stir-fried I think with just garlic.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.573
Mmmm.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.715
Stir-fried to perfection.

00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:34.689
It's crispy and fresh,

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.522
and nice and garlic-y.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.074
The time has come to sample the beasts,

00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:49.574
these giant, scary looking snail-mollusks,

00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.467
and they almost look like
they've been diced up,

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:58.592
and then some chili sauce
has been thrown in there.

00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:00.644
I don't even know how
to go about eating this,

00:07:00.644 --> 00:07:03.394
but potentially scoop it all out.

00:07:04.294 --> 00:07:05.127
Or maybe it's--

00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:07.949
oh, they sort of cut it into
bite-size pieces, maybe.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:09.229
Perhaps.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.312
Anyway, okay.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.986
I don't know if I should
do some prying action,

00:07:14.986 --> 00:07:17.556
some leverage, get a little
leverage up in there.

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:18.889
Oh, there we go.

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:22.474
Oh yeah, look at that.

00:07:23.413 --> 00:07:26.163
Okay, I'm gonna try what this is.

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:36.492
It has the same texture as squid,

00:07:36.492 --> 00:07:37.575
it's chewy...

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:40.106
Oh, man.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:41.812
That's wonderful.

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:43.190
It has like a sweet--

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.857
kind of a sweet and
salty chili sauce on it.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.713
I like that.

00:07:49.713 --> 00:07:51.380
And that's so meaty.

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:54.079
Oh yeah, one more.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.579
One more big bite.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.643
Mmmmm...

00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:02.929
That might be the best one.

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:04.714
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:08.960
Literally I've seen people with
these shells like in their--

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.845
like as a decoration in their house.

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:15.103
But I think I'll throw this guy out.

00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:16.669
That was amazing.

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:19.173
I think I'm going straight back to those--

00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:20.817
Where did my little fork go?
Oh.

00:08:20.817 --> 00:08:22.900
I'm going in for another.

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:26.390
I'm gonna squeeze on some lime,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.453
and then I'm gonna try to add a few more--

00:08:28.453 --> 00:08:31.810
a few of these chilies to top it off.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.727
I think that might make it perfect.

00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:42.457
This might be the best
thing I've ever tried.

00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:46.624
All right, I'm gonna just
slurp this bad boy down.

00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:51.354
Mmmmm.

00:08:55.847 --> 00:08:57.225
Oh that's so good.

00:08:57.225 --> 00:09:00.236
Now if your hands get too juicy or dirty,

00:09:00.236 --> 00:09:02.469
they always have these wet-wipes

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:05.764
readily available on your table,

00:09:05.764 --> 00:09:09.847
and you can always wipe
your mouth and your face.

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:17.584
You definitely have to wipe your face

00:09:17.584 --> 00:09:19.360
after a meal like that.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.656
There were definitely some snail splatters

00:09:21.656 --> 00:09:22.922
all around my mouth.

00:09:22.922 --> 00:09:24.114
That was delicious.

00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:26.008
You gotta make sure to
clean out your teeth,

00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:29.117
I'm sure I have lots of bits of snail

00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:30.463
all up in my teeth,

00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:34.158
but that was a truly marvelous meal.

00:09:34.158 --> 00:09:37.103
I especially loved those
scallops with the peanuts,

00:09:37.103 --> 00:09:38.570
a combination that I never
would have thought of,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.731
but it was amazing.

00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:43.301
And then also those giant...

00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:44.218
The giant--

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:49.039
the giant shells were also
very good, nice and chewy,

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:49.877
but I loved the flavor,

00:09:49.877 --> 00:09:52.525
and I also loved that
chewy texture of them.

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:55.138
But really, everything was very good,

00:09:55.138 --> 00:09:58.471
and this style of dining and socializing

00:09:59.413 --> 00:10:01.913
and relaxing and slowly eating

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:07.547
is definitely a style
of Vietnamese cuisine

00:10:07.547 --> 00:10:10.117
that I love and enjoy.

00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:12.000
Thank you so much for watching this video,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.898
hope you enjoyed it,

00:10:12.898 --> 00:10:14.453
please remember to give it a thumbs up,

00:10:14.453 --> 00:10:15.721
leave a comment below,

00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:19.888
and I'll see you on the
next food/dining adventure.

00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:24.724
