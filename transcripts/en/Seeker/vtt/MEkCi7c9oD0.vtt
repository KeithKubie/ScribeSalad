00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.449
If you’ve ever woken up from a night out
with mystery

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:16.680
We’re all pretty familiar with bruising.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.440
A bruise is what happens when you break the
capillaries just under the skin through some

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.080
trauma, like smashing your leg into a coffee
table.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.160
It’s a small amount of non-lethal internal
bleeding.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.680
And like a cut, platelets rush to the site
of the bruise and stem the flow.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.400
The blood clots, keeping the bruise localized.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.989
Once there’s a pool of blood, immune cells
called macrophages digest the blood to clear

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.319
up the bruise.

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:41.059
Their byproducts are responsible for a bruise’s
characteristic colour change from the initial

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.089
dark purple to that gross yellow-brown before
it totally fades.

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.570
But why do some people bruise more frequently
and more easily than others?

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.380
Aside from being clumsy, of course.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.530
Well, there are some pretty common reasons
for increased bruising.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.969
Both age and sun exposure can make the skin
thinner and weaken capillaries making trauma-based

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.629
bruising more likely.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.579
People with higher body fat can be more prone
to bruising, but so are in-shape athletes,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.140
but not just because they hit themselves with
barbells.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.920
Which is a random example, totally never happened
to me.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.990
Okay, I hit myself in the face with a barbell
once.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
Maybe twice.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.990
Don’t judge.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.670
Anyway, exercise breaks apart muscle fibers
under the skin, and these ruptures are tiny

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.000
traumas that can lead to a bruise.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.560
And if your black and blue mark is lasting
longer than normal, it might be because you’re

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560
taking certain drugs or supplements.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.950
Blood thinners like aspirin, anticoagulant
medication, and antiplatelet agents will make

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.909
you more likely to bruise from trauma.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.329
These medications don’t break capillaries,
but they do limit your blood’s ability to

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.340
clot so any internal bleeding can spread further
and take longer to heal.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.869
It doesn’t necessarily increase the chances
you’re get a bruise, it just means that

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.009
bruise will last a little longer.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.310
But all of these causes of bruising demand
trauma, like smashing your shin on a coffee

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.900
table, basically something that breaks capillaries.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.369
If you’re bruising without making contact
with a table, you might have a pretty serious

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.439
underlying condition, like a bleeding disorder.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.729
Bleeding disorders are a type of disease wherein
the body doesn’t produce enough of the blood

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.069
proteins or platelets that are needed for
blood to clot, or those that are present don’t

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.229
function properly.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.330
Haemophilia and von Willebrand disease are
two familiar inherited ones.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.920
These disorders can make a bruise last longer;
blood can’t clot so bleeding persists.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.570
They can also lead to spontaneous bruises
without trauma on a part of the body that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.070
doesn’t normally bruise.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.160
A sudden black and blue mark on your abdomen,
for example, can be a sign of something far

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.520
more serious.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.050
These kinds of non-trauma induced bruising
could mean you may have an acute or chronic

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.870
infection like sepsis or a chronic disease
like lupus or cirrhosis that affects clotting,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.920
something you could have been born with or
developed later in life.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.330
You might also be malnourished.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.710
Vitamin B12, C, or potassium deficiencies
can lead to increased sporadic bruising.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.660
So at the end of the day, bruising is pretty
normal, especially if you’re a klutzy gym

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
rat.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.030
But frequent bruising or ones that last a
long time, can come down to a lot of different

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.030
things.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.500
The moral is: listen to your body!

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.480
If a part of it changes colour, maybe find
out why.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.970
Minor bruises are known to clear up quickly,
but it never hurts to visit your GP if you’re

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.970
concerned.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.970
