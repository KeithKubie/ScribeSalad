00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.170
On January 13, 1842 1842, Dr. William Brydon,
who had part of his skull sheared off at the

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.200
time, rode an exhausted horse into the British
garrison at Jalalabad, Afghanistan.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.750
When asked where the rest of the army was,
he replied “I am the army”.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.170
In fact, he wasn’t actually the sole survivor,
as he thought, but was pretty close to it.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.210
The few other survivors tended to be certain
high ranking officers and some of their wives

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.530
who were captured and held prisoner.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.050
The 4,500 troops (700 British and 3,800 Indian)
were commanded by Major-General William George

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.650
Keith Elphinstone.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.550
They were accompanied by about 12,000 camp
followers, made up of various craftsmen; servants;

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.971
barbers; blacksmiths; etc., along with many
wives and children of soldiers and the other

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.299
camp followers.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.689
Along with leading this small army, Elphinstone
was also noted for being one of the commanders

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:01.120
at the Battle of Waterloo.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.120
This is where his positive accolades end though
as General Elphinstone was generally considered

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.860
a poor commander and was even called “the
most incompetent soldier who ever became general”

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.760
by one of his fellow Generals (William Nott).

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.830
Initially, things went very well for Elphinstone
and his troops stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.220
At first, they numbered 20,000 with another
38,000 in a civilian camp.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.140
The lifestyle in Kabul for them was very luxurious
and peaceful after they initially took over,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.360
despite the justified unrest among the Afghan
people towards their relatively recent British

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360
conquerors.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.380
This peaceful lifestyle was purchased at a
high price by the British government in India,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.120
who paid subsidies to surrounding tribes to
keep them placated.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.360
The lifestyle was so peaceful that most of
the troops were ordered back to India, leaving

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.210
just 4,500 in Kabul with about 12,000 civilians
in tow.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.960
Unfortunately for the soldiers, though, it
was eventually decided that the cost of the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.630
subsidies and maintaining the small garrison
in Kabul was too great, so the subsidies stopped.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.850
Shortly thereafter, a group of Afghans murdered
one of the chief British political officers

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.530
in Kabul, Alexander Burnes.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.780
Rather than take any action to prevent further
uprising, General Elphinstone didn’t respond

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.950
at all to the murder.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.190
Soon, a series of small skirmishes took place,
at which point Elphinstone realized their

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.640
peril and called for reinforcements from Kandahar.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.740
Unfortunately, no reinforcements were able
to reach him because of heavy snow in the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.969
passes.

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.040
To get around the issue, another high ranking
British official decided to try to negotiate

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.720
safe passage to the garrison at Jalalabad
for the soldiers and 12,000 camp followers.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.689
The Afghan rebels, led by Akbar Khan, initially
seemed open to such a treaty and invited the

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.310
British to a meeting… where they subsequently
slaughtered the British delegation directly

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.599
after the British dismounted their horses.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.370
Once again, rather than respond in any way
to this event, General Elphinstone chose to

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.260
do more or less nothing initially.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.639
He followed this move by the genius stroke
of making an agreement with the rebels which

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.959
included stipulations that the British soldiers
would hand over much of their gunpowder, muskets,

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.639
and heavy artillery before leaving.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.700
In return for giving up much of their ability
to defend themselves to the rebel troops who

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.529
would then subsequently be well armed, they
were to be granted safe passage to the garrison

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.529
at Jalalabad some 90 miles away.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:21.129
Naturally, the second the main portion of
Elphinstone’s army and camp followers left

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.569
Kabul, they were fired on from the ramparts
of the city, with their rear flank taking

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.569
heavy casualties.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.069
Further, those sick and wounded who were left
to follow along as soon as they could were

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.129
slaughtered by the Afghans and the former
army encampment was set on fire.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.809
Despite being attacked the second the troops
were out of the city, rather than quicken

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:44.409
the march to the critical pass 10 miles away,
to make sure Afghans didn’t get there first

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.299
and setup fortifications, Elphinstone, rather,
ordered a halt after just 6 miles.

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.599
The next day, they made it the remaining way
to the pass, but the Afghans had already secured

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.590
it, armed of course with the British gunpowder
and weaponry General Elphinstone had given

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.299
them a few days before.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.109
By that night, around 2/3 of Elphinstone’s
army lay dead, unable to penetrate the pass.

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.469
Finally, Elphinstone and his second in command
voluntarily left their troops and surrendered

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.419
themselves (the General later died in captivity
a few months later), though the surviving

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.670
troops and followers that weren’t yet captured,
continued on.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.850
Most of the others who chose to surrender,
including women and children, were killed.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.569
The few who might fetch a ransom were simply
taken back to Kabul and held captive.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.039
One group led by Thomas John Anguetil did
manage to soldier on and made it as far as

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.770
the small village of Gandamack, less than
a day’s ride from the garrison at Jalalabad.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.340
During their journey from the pass to that
village, the group took heavy casualties as

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.080
they went and only about 20 officers and 45
other soldiers made it to Gandamack.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.860
As you might expect from them having made
it this far without breaking, these soldiers

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.930
weren’t quite so willing to surrender, even
after they were surrounded and were given

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.509
the chance; so the fight continued.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:03.310
Of those remaining 65 of the once 16,500 strong
group, all but seven were killed at Gandamack.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.539
Six mounted troops manage to flee the scene
after nightfall, with five of them killed

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.449
before they reached Jalalabad.

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.759
In the end, Dr. William Drydon manage to make
it, being the first and one of the only ones

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.460
who managed to do so (a few others managed
to make it back, such as a Greek merchant

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.770
and also a “Mr. Baness”, though Baness
died the next day).

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.460
By Drydon’s account, he and a Lieutenant
were abandoned by the other officers, the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.520
officers having horses in better condition.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.810
The two then continued on alone before finally
the Lieutenant chose to stop and hide until

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.620
nightfall, even though they were just three
miles from the garrison.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.790
Dr. Drydon thought it was better to keep moving,
which he did and arrived at the garrison at

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.250
around 1 P.M. on January the 13th.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.740
The Lieutenant never made it.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.520
Interestingly, Brydon’s life was actually
saved by a paper magazine which he had stuffed

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.039
in his hat to try to keep his head warm (it
was extremely cold at the time, with heavy

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.039
snowfall on the ground).

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.169
At a certain point in his trek, an Afghan
soldier swung a sword at him and it struck

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.139
the magazine and rather than cleaving his
whole head, the sword simply deflected and

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.340
sheared part of Dr. Brydon’s skull.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.500
Still a none -to-pleasant injury, but not
nearly as bad as it could have been.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.599
Obviously the British didn’t take kindly
to this massacre and the rebels in Kabul soon

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.600
were the victims of a massacre of their own
when a British army lead by a competent General

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.629
this time, William Nott, marched into Kabul
shortly thereafter.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.219
All total around 50 hostages were rescued
after the British army re-took Kabul, nearly

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:52.369
all that was left of the 16,500 people that
had attempted to flee that city.
