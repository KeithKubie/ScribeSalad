so here's a question how much of your

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949
so here's a question how much of your
 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.769
so here's a question how much of your
brain do you actually use now CERN

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779
brain do you actually use now CERN
 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.330

Hollywood movies might try and have you

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340
Hollywood movies might try and have you
 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.610
Hollywood movies might try and have you
believe that we only use 10% of our

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
believe that we only use 10% of our
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.330
believe that we only use 10% of our
brains doesn't look like much does it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
brains doesn't look like much does it
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340
brains doesn't look like much does it
and what does that mean the other 90% is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
and what does that mean the other 90% is
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710
and what does that mean the other 90% is
for just pointless pink mush

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
for just pointless pink mush

we human beings actually use a hundred
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.389
we human beings actually use a hundred
percent of our brains obviously so

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399
percent of our brains obviously so

this one okay so you see me which is
 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.930
this one okay so you see me which is
obviously terrifying and that makes you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
obviously terrifying and that makes you
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.420
obviously terrifying and that makes you

can I have a go okay so I see Charlie

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850
can I have a go okay so I see Charlie
 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.020
can I have a go okay so I see Charlie
I'm registered him as a clear threat and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
I'm registered him as a clear threat and
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.699
I'm registered him as a clear threat and
so my brain sends messages to my stomach

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709
so my brain sends messages to my stomach
 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.920
so my brain sends messages to my stomach
and hearts telling them to tense up and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930
and hearts telling them to tense up and
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.570
and hearts telling them to tense up and
be faster respectively

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580
be faster respectively
 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.100
be faster respectively
I then notice these changes in my body

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110
I then notice these changes in my body
 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.540
I then notice these changes in my body
and take them as a sign that I should be

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550
and take them as a sign that I should be
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.940
and take them as a sign that I should be
afraid of him which I still AM by the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
afraid of him which I still AM by the
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.710
afraid of him which I still AM by the
way exactly

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720
way exactly
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.940
way exactly
nice one can I interest you in a copy of

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
nice one can I interest you in a copy of
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.920
nice one can I interest you in a copy of
this book it's the perfect gift for

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930
this book it's the perfect gift for
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.350
this book it's the perfect gift for
Christmas so although it might sound

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360
Christmas so although it might sound
 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.240
Christmas so although it might sound
counterintuitive when it comes to your

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250
counterintuitive when it comes to your
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.460
counterintuitive when it comes to your
emotions your brain knows how you should

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470
emotions your brain knows how you should
 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.949
emotions your brain knows how you should
feel before you do and actually tells

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959
feel before you do and actually tells
 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.810
feel before you do and actually tells
you how to feel by changing your body

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820
you how to feel by changing your body
 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.220
you how to feel by changing your body
how weird is that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230
how weird is that
 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.960
how weird is that
however this idea of your brain

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
however this idea of your brain
 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.640
however this idea of your brain
controlling you doesn't just apply to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
controlling you doesn't just apply to
 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.319
controlling you doesn't just apply to
your emotions in fact it might even

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329
your emotions in fact it might even
 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.319
your emotions in fact it might even
apply to something as simple as the

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329
apply to something as simple as the
 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.910
apply to something as simple as the
wiggle of a finger in an experiment

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920
wiggle of a finger in an experiment
 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.039
wiggle of a finger in an experiment
which was first done in the 40s people's

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049
which was first done in the 40s people's
 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.080
which was first done in the 40s people's
brainwaves were measured and they were

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090
brainwaves were measured and they were
 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.240
brainwaves were measured and they were
told to simply wiggle their finger

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
told to simply wiggle their finger
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.670
told to simply wiggle their finger
whenever they felt like it now instinct

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
whenever they felt like it now instinct
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.259
whenever they felt like it now instinct
says that you should see something like

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269
says that you should see something like
 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.930
says that you should see something like
this basically because I decided to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940
this basically because I decided to
 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.729
this basically because I decided to
wiggle my finger just a fraction of a

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739
wiggle my finger just a fraction of a
 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.530
wiggle my finger just a fraction of a
second before I actually wiggled it the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540
second before I actually wiggled it the
 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.150
second before I actually wiggled it the
point at which I made that decision is

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160
point at which I made that decision is
 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.890
point at which I made that decision is
where you'd expect to see brain activity

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900
where you'd expect to see brain activity
 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.259
