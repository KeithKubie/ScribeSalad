00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:17.031
Imagine yourself standing on a beach,

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.215
looking out over the ocean,

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.229
waves crashing against the shore,

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:24.427
blue as far as your eyes can see.

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.190
Let it really sink in,

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:28.886
the sheer scope and size of it all.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.703
Now, ask yourself,

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.677
"How big is it?

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.660
How big is the ocean?"

00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:37.373
First thing, we need to understand

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:39.331
that there really is only one ocean,

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:42.126
consisting of five component
basins that we call

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.210
the Pacific,

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:43.794
the Atlantic,

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:44.461
the Indian,

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:45.048
the Arctic,

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:46.630
and the Southern.

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:47.672
Each of these five,

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:49.467
while generally referred to as oceans

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:50.927
in and of themselves,

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.512
are really and truly a part of

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:54.645
a single, massive body of water,

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:55.707
one ocean,

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.518
which defines the very
face of planet Earth.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:02.202
The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface,

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:05.373
some 360 million square kilometers,

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:09.524
an area in excess
of the size of 36 U.S.A.'s.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:10.617
It's such a vast spread,

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:11.994
when viewed from space,

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:16.621
the ocean is, by far, the dominant
feature of our planet.

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:17.872
Speaking of space,

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:22.010
the ocean currently
holds over 1.3 billion,

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:23.712
that's billion with a "b",

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:25.627
cubic kilometers of water.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.673
Put another way,

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:28.247
that's enough water to immerse

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.207
the entire United States

00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:31.642
under a body of salt water

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.506
over 132 kilometers tall,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.477
a height well beyond the reach
of the highest clouds

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:40.985
and extending deep
into the upper atmosphere.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.195
With all that volume,

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.954
the ocean represents 97%

00:01:44.978 --> 00:01:47.689
of Earth's total water content.

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:49.285
On top of all that,

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.342
the ocean contains upwards of 99%

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.206
of the world's biosphere,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.756
that is, the spaces
and places where life exists.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.879
Now let that sink in for a second.

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:02.173
The immediate world as we know it,

00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:05.167
indeed the totality
of all the living space

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.303
encompassed by the continents themselves,

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:11.767
all of that represents
only 1% of the biosphere.

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:13.542
1%!

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.687
The ocean is everything else.

00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:20.400
So, the ocean is physically massive.

00:02:20.424 --> 00:02:24.001
It's importance to life
is practically unparalleled.

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:25.957
It also happens to hold

00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.295
the greatest geological
features of our planet.

00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:35.650
Quickly, here are four
of the most notable.

00:02:35.674 --> 00:02:38.457
The ocean contains
the world's largest mountain range,

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:40.086
the mid-ocean ridge.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.997
At roughly 65,000 kilometers long,

00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:45.990
this underwater range is some 10 times

00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:47.980
longer than the longest mountain chain

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:50.486
found purely on dry land, the Andes.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.393
Beneath the Denmark Strait exists

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:55.056
the world's largest waterfall.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.438
This massive cataract
carries roughly 116 times

00:03:03.462 --> 00:03:06.344
more water per second over its edge

00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:08.316
than the Congo River's Inga Falls,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.736
the largest waterfall by volume on land.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.618
The world's tallest mountain
is actually found in the ocean,

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:16.241
hiding in plain sight.

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:18.660
While 4200 meters of Hawaii's Mauna Kea

00:03:18.684 --> 00:03:20.619
sit above sea level,

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:22.689
its sides plummet beneath the waves

00:03:22.713 --> 00:03:25.041
for another 5800 meters.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:26.459
From its snow-covered top

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:28.630
to it's silt-covered bottom, then,

00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:31.805
this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height,

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.098
dwarfing tiny Everest's paltry peak

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:35.926
by well over a kilometer.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.081
Then, since we're picking on poor Everest,

00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:40.807
let's consider the world's deepest canyon,

00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.419
the Challenger Deep,

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:45.354
existing 11 kilometers
below the ocean's surface,

00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:47.805
some six times deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.446
That's deep enough to sink
Mount Everest into

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.615
and still have over 2.1
kilometers of water

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.022
sitting atop its newly submerged peak.

00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:58.560
Put another way, the depth
of the Challenger Deep

00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:00.145
is roughly the same height

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.231
that commercial airliners travel.

00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:04.877
So, pretty much however you
choose to slice it,

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.918
the ocean is capital B

00:04:06.942 --> 00:04:07.737
capital I,

00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:08.868
capital G,

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:10.025
BIG!

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.966
It defines our planet,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.452
home to the greatest geological features,

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:16.871
comprises the largest living space,

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:19.498
and accordingly, is home
to the greatest numbers

00:04:19.522 --> 00:04:21.882
and forms of life on Earth.

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:25.709
It is practically
incomprehensible in scope.

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.628
But it is not so big,

00:04:28.652 --> 00:04:29.857
so vast,

00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:31.218
so extraordinary

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:33.304
as to be untouchable.

00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:37.049
In fact, with roughly 50%
of the world's population

00:04:37.073 --> 00:04:39.698
living within 100
kilometers of the coastline

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:41.696
and with most of the remainder

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.482
living close enough to lakes,
rivers, or swamps,

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:46.963
all of which ultimately lead to the ocean,

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.548
virtually every single
person on the planet

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:52.970
has the opportunity
to influence the general health

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:55.520
and nature of the world ocean.

00:04:55.544 --> 00:04:57.211
Evidence of human influence is seen

00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:59.193
in every part of the ocean,

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:00.456
no matter how deep,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.356
no matter how distant.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.249
The ocean defines our planet,

00:05:05.273 --> 00:05:07.391
but, in a very real sense,

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:09.621
we define the ocean.
