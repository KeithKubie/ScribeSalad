00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.856
- [Voiceover] Things are
starting to get interesting.

00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:04.404
In the first video, we set
up a space-time diagram

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:07.173
from my frame of reference
and started to plot things

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.609
past in that space-time diagram.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.612
And then we thought about
our friend, Sally, who

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.615
right at time equals
zero is at x equals zero,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.618
but she's passing me up
at a relative velocity

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:21.321
of half the speed of light
in the positive x direction.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.791
So after one second, she
has gone 1 1/2 times 10

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.060
to the 8th meters in the
positive x direction.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.596
After two seconds, she's gone
three times 10 to the 8th.

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.032
And then we assume that
she was part of a train

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:31.994
of spaceships.

00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:34.240
So three times 10 to the
8th meters in front of her

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.402
was another spaceship and
it's moving with the same

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.160
relative velocity relative
to me, or in my frame

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.084
of reference.

00:00:40.084 --> 00:00:42.844
So at time equals zero is three
times 10 to the 8th meters

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:43.924
in front of me.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:46.398
But then at time equals
one, if we take this point

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:50.268
in space-time, in my frame of reference,

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:52.908
that ship is now, it now has,

00:00:52.908 --> 00:00:54.760
so t, let me write this.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.175
If we look at my space-time coordinates,

00:00:57.175 --> 00:00:59.555
t is equal to one second

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:03.797
and x is equal to 4.5

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.399
times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.035
That's if you look at my
space-time coordinates.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.805
But what about Sally's
space-time coordinates?

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.807
Well, to figure out Sally's
space-time coordinates,

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.643
we go parallel to the x
prime axis and see where we

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.446
intersect the t prime
axis, but that's still t

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.081
is equal to one second, this
is t is equal to two seconds,

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.317
this is t is equal to three seconds.

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:27.220
So t, or I should say t
prime is equal to one second,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.089
t prime is two seconds,
t prime is three seconds.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:33.560
So t prime is equal to one second still.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.162
And so in general, we can say that t prime

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:40.433
is going to be equal to
t, but what is x prime

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.335
going to be equal to?

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.771
So x prime, well, to figure out x prime,

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.773
you go horizontal to the t prime axis

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.008
and see where you
intersect the x prime axis,

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.778
and you see that it's three times 10

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.855
to the 8th meters.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:57.675
And hopefully, this makes intuitive sense.

00:01:57.675 --> 00:01:59.985
If it doesn't, pause the video
and really think about it

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:03.482
because in her frame of
reference, that spaceship

00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:06.247
looks stationary because it's
moving with the exact same

00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:08.627
relative velocity to me.

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:10.964
It's going to continue
to stay three times 10

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.959
to the 8th meters in front
of her, which is exactly

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.800
what we see.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.102
So that's why its x prime coordinates stay

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:18.104
three times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.106
From my point of view, it's
getting further and further

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.976
away from me at the relative velocity,

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.845
at 1.5 times 10 to the
8th meters per second.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:29.381
So how do we translate between our,

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.152
between our x coordinates?

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:35.592
Let me do this in a different color.

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:40.432
Between our x coordinates
and our x prime coordinates?

00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:42.795
Well, you see for these examples,

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:46.932
we see x prime is going to be less than x,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.403
and that should also make sense because

00:02:51.063 --> 00:02:53.373
especially for this case, it's stationary

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.075
from the s prime point of view,

00:02:56.075 --> 00:03:00.046
but its x is continuously
increasing as time passes on

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:03.259
from my frame of reference,
from Sally's frame of reference,

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.084
from the S frame of reference.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:08.054
So if we start with x, we
should subtract something,

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.525
and the difference between the two,

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:12.058
the discrepancy between
the two is going to be

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:14.903
the relative velocity times time.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.397
And so for this particular example,

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.999
we saw that three times
10 to the 8th meters

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:26.639
was equal to 4.5 times 10 to the 8th,

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.109
minus the relative velocity, 1.5 times 10

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.479
to the 8th meters per second times time,

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.714
which was one second.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.077
And I didn't write the units
but if you write the units,

00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:39.087
it all works out and you get exactly this.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.621
So hopefully that's starting
to get you comfortable

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.724
with having these two coordinate planes

00:03:46.144 --> 00:03:49.729
or two space-time diagrams
over on top of each other.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.065
And the reason why the
blue one is distorted

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.434
is because it's on top,
they're moving with a relative

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.070
velocity relative to what I'm considering

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.074
to be a stationary frame of
reference, which is mine.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.109
Obviously, there's no
such thing as an absolute

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.111
stationary frame of
reference, and we'll talk more

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.112
about that in the future.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.315
But what I now want to
focus on is that photon

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.485
that I emitted at time equal zero.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.754
Because we saw it moves
with the speed of light

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.221
in my frame of reference.

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:18.458
After one second, it has moved,

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.427
its x coordinate is three
times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:25.794
After two seconds, after two seconds,

00:04:25.794 --> 00:04:29.068
the photon is at six times
10 to the 8th meters.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.170
But let's see what that photon looks like

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.940
from the s prime frame of
reference, from Sally's

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.441
frame of reference.

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.610
Well, from Sally's frame of reference,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.413
let's think about that
photon after two seconds.

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.415
So the photon is right over there.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:46.786
So t prime is equal to
two seconds, two seconds,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.354
but what is x prime?

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.356
What is x prime going to be equal to?

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.693
Well, x prime, we go
parallel to the t prime axis,

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.129
is three times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.398
Three times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:02.869
So in her frame of reference,
it took that photon of light

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.938
two seconds to go three
times 10 to the 8th meters,

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:09.175
or it looks like the
velocity of that photon

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:13.146
is one and a half times 10
to the 8th meters per second

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.214
in the positive x direction.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.950
And this should hopefully
makes sense from a Newtonian

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.854
point of view, or a
Galilean point of view.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:24.824
These are called Galilean transformations

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.760
because if I'm in a car

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.830
and there's another car and
you see this on the highway

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.999
all the time, if I'm in a
car going 60 miles per hour,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.401
there's another car
going 65 miles per hour,

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.040
from my point of view,
it looks like it's only

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.405
moving forward at five miles per hour.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.841
So that photon will look slower to Sally.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.845
Similarly, if we assume this
Newtonian, this Galilean world,

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:49.691
if she had a flashlight,

00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:51.756
if she had a flashlight right over here

00:05:51.756 --> 00:05:53.786
and right at time equals
zero she turned it on,

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:57.127
and that first photon we
were to plot it on her

00:05:57.127 --> 00:06:01.168
frame of reference, well, it
should go the speed of light

00:06:01.168 --> 00:06:04.440
in her frame of reference.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.077
So it starts here at the origin.

00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:09.772
And then after one second, in the s prime,

00:06:09.772 --> 00:06:12.672
in the s prime coordinates,
it should have gone

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.741
three times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.176
After two seconds, it
should've gone six times 10

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.621
to the 8th meters.

00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.714
And so it's path on her space-time diagram

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:25.993
should look like that.

00:06:25.993 --> 00:06:28.821
That's her photon, that
first photon that was emitted

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.889
from it.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.058
So you might be noticing
something interesting.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.560
That photon from my point
of view is going faster

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.062
than the speed of light.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:40.166
After one second, its x coordinate is 4.5

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.734
times 10 to the 8th meters.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.704
It's going 4.5 times 10 to
the 8th meters per second.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.906
It's going faster than the speed of light.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.162
It's going faster than my photon,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.813
and that might make intuitive sense

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:56.616
except it's not what we
actually observe in nature.

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:58.031
And anytime we try to make a prediction

00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:00.061
that's not what's observed
in nature, it means that

00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:02.755
our understanding of the
universe is not complete

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:06.636
because it turns out
that regardless of which

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.913
inertial reference frame we are in,

00:07:08.913 --> 00:07:11.898
the speed of light,
regardless of the speed

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:14.767
or the relative velocity of
the source of that light,

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:19.172
is always going three times 10
to the 8th meters per second.

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:22.041
So we know from
observations of the universe

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.801
that Sally, when she looked at my photon,

00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:26.551
she wouldn't see it going
half the speed of light,

00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:28.753
she would see it going three
times 10 to the 8th meters

00:07:28.753 --> 00:07:29.840
per second.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.695
And we know from
observations of the universe

00:07:31.695 --> 00:07:33.725
that Sally's photon,
I would not observe it

00:07:33.725 --> 00:07:37.365
as moving at 4.5 times 10 to
the 8th meters per second,

00:07:37.365 --> 00:07:39.185
that it would actually still be moving

00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:41.915
at three times 10 to the
8th meters per second.

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.770
So something has got to give.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.410
This is breaking down our
classical, our Newtonian,

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.120
our Galilean views of the world.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.205
It's very exciting.

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:55.527
We need to think of some other
way to conceptualize things,

00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:59.762
some other way to visualize
these space-time diagrams

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:02.287
for the different frames of reference.
