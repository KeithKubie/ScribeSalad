what's happening here i need to ask
 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.590 align:start position:0%
what's happening here i need to ask

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.270 align:start position:0%

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 align:start position:0%

intimidating to me so the fact that you
 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.730 align:start position:0%
intimidating to me so the fact that you

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
could do it just like in the web browser
 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.409 align:start position:0%
could do it just like in the web browser
in<00:06:37.889><c> the</c><00:06:38.069><c> module</c><00:06:38.430><c> so</c><00:06:38.610><c> the</c><00:06:38.699><c> only</c><00:06:38.940><c> thing</c><00:06:39.180><c> you</c>

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 align:start position:0%
in the module so the only thing you
 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.689 align:start position:0%
in the module so the only thing you
needed<00:06:39.630><c> to</c><00:06:39.780><c> focus</c><00:06:39.930><c> on</c><00:06:40.229><c> with</c><00:06:40.889><c> actually</c><00:06:41.520><c> whether</c>

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
needed to focus on with actually whether
 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.180 align:start position:0%
needed to focus on with actually whether
your<00:06:41.970><c> code</c><00:06:42.630><c> was</c><00:06:42.870><c> working</c><00:06:43.500><c> or</c><00:06:43.620><c> not</c><00:06:43.740><c> was</c><00:06:43.949><c> really</c>

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 align:start position:0%
your code was working or not was really
 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
your code was working or not was really

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 align:start position:0%
helpful to me and then I think the other
 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.629 align:start position:0%
helpful to me and then I think the other
thing<00:06:46.139><c> I</c><00:06:46.380><c> appreciated</c><00:06:47.099><c> especially</c><00:06:47.250><c> about</c>

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:20.950 align:start position:0%
definitely allow students to like take

and<00:10:35.740><c> I</c><00:10:35.770><c> do</c><00:10:35.830><c> think</c><00:10:36.160><c> it</c><00:10:36.310><c> really</c><00:10:36.730><c> d</c><00:10:37.090><c> stresses</c><00:10:37.660><c> and</c>

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:37.900 align:start position:0%
and I do think it really d stresses and
 

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
and I do think it really d stresses and
like<00:10:38.230><c> the</c><00:10:39.220><c> whole</c><00:10:39.250><c> situation</c><00:10:39.850><c> of</c><00:10:40.300><c> morning</c>

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.510 align:start position:0%
like the whole situation of morning
 

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.030 align:start position:0%
like the whole situation of morning
because<00:10:40.690><c> you</c><00:10:40.780><c> have</c><00:10:40.990><c> this</c><00:10:41.170><c> other</c><00:10:41.350><c> opportunity</c>

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
because you have this other opportunity
 

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
because you have this other opportunity
to<00:10:42.190><c> learn</c><00:10:42.250><c> that</c><00:10:42.400><c> then</c><00:10:42.760><c> incorporated</c><00:10:43.420><c> into</c><00:10:43.660><c> the</c>

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:43.870 align:start position:0%
