00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.100
Now in the human genome, there's a consensus sequence that's

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.200
usually about 30 to 40 base pairs away, in front of

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.780
the transcription start site of most genes. So here we

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.460
have the transcription start site indicated by the arrow and the

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460
plus one. The coding region is over here to the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.780
right. And in front of it over here, we have the

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.820
promoter region. And in the same way that we would start

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.640
counting plus one, plus two, plus three, down our coding region.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.220
And that would start measuring counting right the number of

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.244
letters that are going to be in our mRNA transcript. We can

00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:35.030
start counting backwards to get the numbered positions for our

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.848
promoter region. So we have minus one, and minus two and

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:39.618
minus three. And we can go on back to the

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:42.160
minus 30 to the minus 40 region. So let's focus in

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.350
on this region about 30 or 40 letters or base

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.706
pairs upstream or in front of this transcription initiation site. Here,

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:54.520
I'm showing you six different samples. Not different genes,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.440
not different promoters. The same promoter from six different

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.432
people, let's say. So we have six different people

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:05.550
and this is their sequence. The, the letters in

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.880
their promoter region at this minus 30 to minus

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.430
40 region in front of a specific gene in

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.780
their genome. What I want you to tell me

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
now that you've learned about what a consensus sequence is,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070
is look at these six different sequences and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.715
tell me what is the consensus sequence for these

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.250
six positions in the minus 30 to minus

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.590
40 region of the promoter for this hypothetical gene.
