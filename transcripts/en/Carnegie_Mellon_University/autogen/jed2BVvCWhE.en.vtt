semester basically kind of talking to
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900
semester basically kind of talking to
people around who might be using these

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
people around who might be using these
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610

then kind of planning out what we

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
then kind of planning out what we
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.610
then kind of planning out what we
thought this space should be and how to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
thought this space should be and how to
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.720
thought this space should be and how to
actually make it more of a makerspace

thing is to first expose the tools you
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.180
thing is to first expose the tools you
know like walking by if you see the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
know like walking by if you see the
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.889
know like walking by if you see the
tools all of a sudden you see students

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
tools all of a sudden you see students
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.299
tools all of a sudden you see students
be like oh hey that's cool I can use

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

this what can I do with this space I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
this what can I do with this space I
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.389
this what can I do with this space I
think a lot of times people look at a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
think a lot of times people look at a
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010
think a lot of times people look at a
campus like Carnegie Mellon and they say

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
campus like Carnegie Mellon and they say
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139
campus like Carnegie Mellon and they say
you know it's been placed here we go

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
you know it's been placed here we go
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000
you know it's been placed here we go
through the system and then we finish

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
through the system and then we finish
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670
through the system and then we finish
but if you're a student is able to shape

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
but if you're a student is able to shape
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.850
but if you're a student is able to shape
how the campus comes together that can
