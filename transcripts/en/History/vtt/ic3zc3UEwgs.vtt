00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.330
- Hi, I'm Kirk Adkins.
Welcome to my shop.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm a horseshoer by trade.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.540
Graduated from high school,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.330
bought a new pickup truck
in 1971

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.830
and I've been shoeing horses
full-time

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.040
or part-time ever since.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.000
I started making my own blades

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.500
back about 25 years ago

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.170
because I had
carpal tunnel syndrome

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.080
and it was really hard on
my hands with the hoof knives.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.620
So I designed a better
hoof knife for myself

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.420
and I make a little business
out of it,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.290
selling it to other farriers.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.250
I do quite a bit of woodworking

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.080
because of the handle-making
for my knives.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.420
So I have the band saw
and the table saw

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.040
that I set up for the blanks.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.960
But right here
is the heart and soul

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.670
of my horseshoe company.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.290
It's 125-ton
hydraulic punch press.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.330
And this thing
can really smash some stuff.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.290
- Well, I can tell you about
the history of, like,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.540
almost mankind
through horseshoes.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.670
[laughs]

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.960
The shoe I'm gonna make is
called a caulk and wedge.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.960
It has a little bit
of a thickened toe

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.460
and it has two cleats
on the heels.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.920
Okay, a quick pack in the toe.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.290
These shoes were designed to be
used in the cobblestone streets

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.540
of England
and through the muddy trails.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.460
All right, we got the inside
heels done.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.170
That heel is called a wedge,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.750
so that's the caulk
and the wedge--

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.420
that's the wedge part
of the name.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.120
So I'm gonna move on
to the outside heel.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.960
Aw, scale in my coffee.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.580
- Up over my left shoulder,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.750
that's my draft horse shoe
that I designed

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.620
and now fabricating for
the California Highway Patrol.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.670
I use steel
and other kinds of metals

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.960
and I combine them with
21st-century polymers

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.540
into a contiguous unit.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.960
<i>It's a really beneficial
system for horses</i>

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.290
<i>that have to work
on hard surfaces like that.</i>

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.750
The thing that's cool about
horseshoeing is,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.880
I have my foot in
the 11th century,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.790
when the first horses
were shod,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.620
and the 21st century with
the new polymers and plastics

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620
and I combine them
into a new technology

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.210
and it's just a real
satisfying thing

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.540
to be able to go
all the way in that--

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.080
from ancient to modern and
still be doing the same job.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.960
- All right,
we're gonna do a toe bend.

continuing down

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.670

It's gonna be married

so it'll be one with the foot

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.380
and it conjoins the hoof
and the shoe really well

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.670
and it takes all the stress
off the nails.

a little 3/4 fuller
