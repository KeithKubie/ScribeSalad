00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:03.190
SPEAKER 1: You
became a developer

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.890
because you love games.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.690
You always wanted to take
them beyond what we know,

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.260
to create truly innovative
and interesting experiences.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.540
You had an idea which
you had the courage

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.310
to turn into reality.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.500
You learned skills
you didn't have.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.630
You constantly learn
and adapt and make

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.952
decisions every single day.

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:23.410
You think you're
prepared, then you

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.780
realize there's always
something new to learn.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.340
It's risky and scary and at
the same time, exhilarating--

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.250
the freedom to create,
the collaboration

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.170
with other like-minded
people, the sleepless nights,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.080
the coffees, the looks from
your family and friends,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.210
the leaps of faith, the
pride in what you do.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.870
There are ups-- your first
drawing, the first time

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.150
you make something
move using code,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.250
the moment you get
it out to the world,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.130
the reaction of the first
person who tries it out.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.400
That's what it's all about.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.830
There are many downs.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.710
You mess up on the way,
but you don't give up.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.770
When you fail, you learn.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.270
You continue with passion,
creativity, pushing yourself

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.900
forward, and the next day comes.
