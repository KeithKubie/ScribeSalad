hi um my name is sunder Skepta from

Stockholm I heard you got the Nobel

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
Stockholm I heard you got the Nobel
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.549
Stockholm I heard you got the Nobel
Prize for their Big Bang Theory

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559
Prize for their Big Bang Theory
 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.450
Prize for their Big Bang Theory
wondering do you think they could have

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
wondering do you think they could have
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.030
wondering do you think they could have
been more big banks with some kind of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
been more big banks with some kind of
 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.200
been more big banks with some kind of
parent universes with the other Big Bang

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210
parent universes with the other Big Bang
 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.150
parent universes with the other Big Bang
okay thanks

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160
okay thanks
 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.920
okay thanks
Thank You Jana it's a great question but

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
Thank You Jana it's a great question but
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.019
Thank You Jana it's a great question but
to tell you the truth I didn't originate

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
to tell you the truth I didn't originate
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.540
to tell you the truth I didn't originate
the Big Bang Theory it came from a long

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550
the Big Bang Theory it came from a long
 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.259
the Big Bang Theory it came from a long
time ago

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
time ago
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.540

Einstein's equations told us about the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
Einstein's equations told us about the
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.350
Einstein's equations told us about the
universe in 1916 and in 1922 Alexander

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
universe in 1916 and in 1922 Alexander
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180
universe in 1916 and in 1922 Alexander
Friedmann calculated from those

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
Friedmann calculated from those
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.380
Friedmann calculated from those
equations that there should have been a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
equations that there should have been a
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.290
equations that there should have been a
Big Bang it was done again by George

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
Big Bang it was done again by George
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.260
Big Bang it was done again by George
Lemaitre in 1927 and Einstein said now

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
Lemaitre in 1927 and Einstein said now
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.350
Lemaitre in 1927 and Einstein said now
that should not be but in 1929 Edwin

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
that should not be but in 1929 Edwin
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.819
that should not be but in 1929 Edwin
Hubble discovered that the universe is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
Hubble discovered that the universe is
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.190
Hubble discovered that the universe is
expanding and so we've had the Big Bang

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
expanding and so we've had the Big Bang
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.610
expanding and so we've had the Big Bang
Theory on a firm footing ever since then

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620
Theory on a firm footing ever since then
 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.760
Theory on a firm footing ever since then
what's not been sure was the details so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
what's not been sure was the details so
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.529
what's not been sure was the details so
I'm not claiming credit for the Big Bang

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
I'm not claiming credit for the Big Bang
 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200
I'm not claiming credit for the Big Bang
Theory but now you want to know about

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
Theory but now you want to know about
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.229
Theory but now you want to know about
other universes and parallel universes

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
other universes and parallel universes
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600
other universes and parallel universes
and I'm afraid that we can't really

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
and I'm afraid that we can't really
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.210
and I'm afraid that we can't really
measure we can't tell anything from the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
measure we can't tell anything from the
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.340
measure we can't tell anything from the
universe that we're in about those other

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
universe that we're in about those other
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.730
universe that we're in about those other
universes maybe someday we'll be able to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
universes maybe someday we'll be able to
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710
universes maybe someday we'll be able to
tell on the basis of some kind of theory

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
tell on the basis of some kind of theory
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.870
tell on the basis of some kind of theory
that we'll have but right now this is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
that we'll have but right now this is
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460
that we'll have but right now this is
something for a future work by future

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
something for a future work by future
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.070
something for a future work by future
generations
