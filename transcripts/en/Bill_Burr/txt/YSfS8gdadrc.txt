Speaker 1:          00:00:02       [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, March six, 2017 what's going on everybody? I am in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm isn't that exciting. Scenic Arizona. Um, it actually is madam psyched. I'm working at stand up live doing two shows tonight, two shows Tuesday, two shows Wednesday. Um, um, you know, I'm putting together my new hour and everything and I got a bunch of shit. I've actually been listening to my act. I always, you know, when I'm putting together a new hour, oh, I always record. I just never fucking listen. Well now I'm finally listening to my act. I figured it out when I can do it cause I've who the fuck months to sit there and listen to yourself, but I'm doing is I'm uh, I listened to it on the car ride home.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       You know, if I had a decent set, if I had a shitty set, what's the fucking point? You know what I mean? It's kind of like if you're always taping you

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       okay

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       your team, right. But you only watch if they win. You know? I know people who do that shit. They like, no, what the fuck happens before they watch it and if they lose, they just don't even fucking watch. So I've actually been watching and that type of shit. And uh, speaking of which you're team winning and losing all the freckles came in, uh, last night and I went to the Phoenix Suns were playing, my boss did sell decks. So I decide, you know what, I'm going to go to that game. All right. My hundred and 17th fucking franchise professional home team. I've fought ever professional sports team that I've seen a home game of hundred and fucking 17 of these motherfuckers. I got 10 more to go. I can't get on any 10. Every time I get to 10. And I'm like, oh, one more team. I'll fucking, then I'll have nine left and somebody moves, you know, I got down to 10. I'm like, all right, the next one's going to get me down to nine and then the fucking ramp, the rams move back up to 11. Right. So then I go see the thunder and I'm thinking, all right, look man, I'm down. I'm down to fucking, I'm down to nine and I'm like, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:02:13       wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       I saw the New Jersey Nets. I never saw the Brooklyn Nets soda. It's still 10. So I'm like, all right, next week, next week when I go see the sons, I'll be down to 19th left, right? So I'm sitting there watching the sons and I'm like Verizon, I'm down to single digits. The Fan Slam is going down. One of the loneliest accomplishments ever. I guess if you went with a bunch of other people, I got to find the old pictures of me at these stadiums. I swear to God, they're all like disposable camera pictures held by a stranger. Um, you know, when I was doing all these fucking gigs in the middle of nowhere and shit, and I pass through the major cities and I would just go to a Goddamn game anyways. So last night I'm thinking, all right, I'm going to the son's Celtics game. I'll have nine teams left. And I'm like, wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       The fucking charges just moved the Los Angeles. So in a month I'm working in San Antonio and I'm going to a spurs game, go into the fuck and spurs and then I think I'll finally be down to nine. You know, God forbid if the fucking Raiders don't move to Vegas after that. Um, but anyways, I uh, I went to the sun's game, right? So I show up immediately. Um, the club hooked us up with tickets, gave us great ticks. We sit in two rows buying the fucking one, one of the, uh, what do you call it in basketball? One of the nets, one of the goals, one of the backboards, right? Two, two rows back. So it's really three rows back cause they got all the fucking cameraman, you know, but still it's like great seats. And I looked down on the right and is this guy just riding the reps in the, in the first quarter?

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       And he really gives a shit. So I'm looking at [inaudible] and I'm just looking over going, look, this fucking, this guy's out of his mind. That is a guy who gives a shit. This is a hardcore season ticket holder, man. Look how much he, and I'm laughing like he's just like, he knows the refs names, he's calling them out and all that shit in verge. He starts going, he goes, I bet that's the owner. I'm like, Nah, I'm going to own it wouldn't be sitting down. He would be yelling like that if he was the owner. And he's like, well, Mark Cuban writes the reps like that. I go get the fuck out of here. So finally, you know, I go, I man, I'm going to look this guy up, right? So we've, we look them up and it's the owner.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       I gotta to tell you, Phoenix Suns, dude, you guys got a great fucking owner. Uh, Robert Sarver is his name, man. We ended up talking to him at the end of the game cause I tweeted a, I was making fun of, um, what's his face, his shoes, his sneakers, the fucking worst sneakers I've ever fucking seen. Um, Kelly Olynyk, the big white goof, the seven foot fucking pylon out there, right? I don't, I, you know, Celtics love that guy. Ain't he got so many Goddamn meds. Maybe it's a road trip or whatever, but do this. He had these fucking sneakers on, I think Garo your premium warm in there. That fucking Superbowl against the Redskins. When he fucked up the field goal two, they were like, they look like black football cleats from the early seventies the ugliest fucking things I've ever seen. So of course I tweet about that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       That's why I get, so I tweeted about the thing and I guess the owner's son was watching. He goes, oh, he's probably sitting right next to you, blah, blah blah. That's how he didn't mean the guy. But anyways, long story short, so I tweet about this fucking things, making fun of the guy's sneakers thinking. Obviously these have to be the worst fucking sneakers. Without a doubt. Even with the Internet, even with Twitter, even with all of these fucking cons that are on social media, nobody can argue with that. These are the ugliest fucking sneakers ever, right? They will low top fucking feel. Go kick a cleats on the fucking early seventies right. And all these sneaker heads are like, you mean, you mean the Colby eleven's I guess just the Colby Bryan sneaker. And what? Because it says Colby on it. All of a sudden it's the coal piece. Do do you mean the shack fourteens I fucking hate sneaker heads, but fucking can't stay at them with the 5,000 fucking pairs of sneakers, taking him out of the box, showing them off on MTV cribs and licking the soul.

We'll, he'll be like, Bill, but bill, what's wrong? What's wrong with sweat pants? You know, and you can't argue with them. Exactly. There's, there's nothing wrong with that. It's just, you know, the conversation is just like, it just doesn't need to be, most of the conversation just doesn't even need to be had to, is there anything better than just walking around in sweatpants? Dude, you put on a pair of sweatpants with some Jordan threes over over to what is better than have it on a Hoodie and a pair of Colby 11. You go to a massage parlor and she's jerking your Dick. I mean [inaudible]. Oh Man. Am I crazy? I said, so it's, it's short. It's literally, it's a joke. All right. I'm sorry. Fuck all you sneaker heads out there. God bless you with your little fucking hobby. Uh, keeping your sneakers clean and you know, fucking walking on your heels anytime there's any sort of rubbish on the ground ground.

Is there anything better? Did Jess Lan in your bed and just waking up and doing your podcast? I mean, it's a joy. It's literally, it's, it's, it's a joke. You know, I have to look up these fucking sneakers. How the Fuck Koby Bryant, one of the greatest fucking top of what, two or three players of all time, individual players, teammates. He was a fucking nightmare. Um, you went to that fucking confessional comes up. Um, let me sit down, put in my password here. Stupid Laker fans that we, Chan MVP at the guy. I hate that Celtic fans are chanting MVP at Isaiah Thomas. By the way, it reminds me of Laker fans that were always, every time fucking Colby stepped on the court and did not pass the ball and scored 40 fucking points and they lose again.

Speaker 2:          00:14:53       And they did have VAPI. Um, did you see him dunk on that guy and then they lost? Oh my God, he's unbelievable. Maybe if we get 58 free agents in here and fucking Phil Jackson, they can win a title and v p all right. I'm not what he's doing. He's wearing the Colby sees where we're in the Kobe left. I have to look these fucking sneakers up. How ugly these goddamn things are. And the fact that these sprockets, sneaker heads, you mean the Colbys? I mean the rep sneakers, those fucking cleats. This guys wearer, he looks like fucking Ken Stabler out there. Colby 11. You cannot tell me that this fucking, the computer doesn't listen to you. Oh my, those are fucking dancing slippers. Jesus. At least to get the best. He got the best color

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:15:45       they come in pink becoming red and white. They got a Miami dolphin color. Do those literally look like women's sneakers? Like you should have like the low cut sock with the little ball on the back if you wear those fucking things. And I'm looking, look, look at the ones 220 $130

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       yes.

Speaker 2:          00:16:08       I bet this, I bet if I went on youtube and this and I looked up koby 11 I bet there's some fucking asshole sitting there licking the fuck. Who is that guy? Fat Joe did that and his MTV cribs. And he goes, he had like checked, he's off. He's like the fucking George 60th. And then he licked the bottom of them. It's like, dude, do you realize the sweatshop? But those things were fucking Baden. Yeah. And you think those things didn't hit the ground in there. And God knows they probably don't. Like they probably make those people go to the bathroom at the fucking station and you're gonna let the bottom of those. Goddamn sneakers.

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:40       They were in a hermetically sealed sneaker box. Dude. They were in a cardboard box and was shipped over here from the other side of the world. I think I'll put my tongue on them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:53       All right. I'm going to look this up. I'm going to see if I can find that. I'm going to find a fucking video here. Coby 11 all right. I don't know why, but the first video that came up set exploding pool and a guy had shit on his face. Now I didn't think they did that type of stuff on fucking Colby 11 shoes. Alright. And some asshole's going to do a fucking review. Nike Colby 11 Performance Review Too. These are the ugliest fucking sneakers I've ever seen in my life. These ones are actually worse.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       Colby. Bryan gives the Brian James's autograph shoes. God, what the fuck did they talk about other than winning championships?

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       That'd be like listening to fucking superman and like fucking Batman talking. All right. Coby gives away shoes to a fan. Here's a shit all over the guy. He's like the nicest guy ever. Colby helps a busload of sick children get to the staples center by towing it with his own body and his Colby eleven's or maybe I was wrong. Um, Nike. Kobe, I gotta get off this fucking subject. What am I gonna listen to some guy do a fucking review of the sneakers. Nike Colby 11 performance overview. My initial thoughts. I fucking love Youtube. Who gives us, I guess you guys are listening to my thoughts, but I'm just being a fucking moron. Anyways, let's get back to the Goddamn game. All right, so Kelly, a Lennox out there and is Coby eleven's dude, they will fucking crazy, dude. You get a seven foot white guy and Kobe 11.

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       It's all, it's all, I mean the black guys are still going to go right around them and have their nuts in his face when they dunk on it, but I mean his, his feet from the ankles down, it's, it's always going to be a such a joke. It's literally a joke. Um, all right. Anyways, so we go, we watched this game. The owner of the sons is a fucking riot. I'm totally this watching him ride in the referees, like old school guy, you know, right down there on the court watching the game and uh, you know, he's not about some luxury box or anything like that. Right. So anyway, so we'll watch it in the game and the Celtics come out flat, which you knew they were gonna you knew they were gonna cause they've just beat the Lakers anytime. I'm telling you this right now, gamblers, gamblers, anytime the, the, any Boston team, I, the y would say the Bruins are the fucking uh, Celtics going that west coast trip.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Okay. If you want to make some money, bet against them the day after they'd play either the, the clippers, the kings or the Lakers, cause they fucking go to la. And after the game they all go out. They Bang a bunch of fucking broads, a bunch of fucking actresses or whatever the fuck it is they do. And then the next game, when they go to San Jose, down to Anaheim, out to Phoenix, up to Portland, whatever the fuck they go next, there's always a let down. So the Celtics come out flat. The fucking sons are all over him. Um, love the God was on the sons was just as fast it seems as Isaiah. So he was right up on them. Um, frustrating the hell out of them. He, Isaiah had I think four files in the first half. And um, so we're watching the game and I'm just going like, I fucking knew it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       I've, I'm so excited to finally see this team. I've been watching, seeing almost every game of this year and they come out flat. I'm like, Oh man, am I really going to the fucking hangover game? Ah, what do I give a shit? I got three fucking tickets, but still, you know, there's a bunch of Celtics fans there. They're all going fucking nuts and everything. We had like nothing to cheer about. I think we were down by like 10 after the first half. Um, and we just start chipping away, chipping away, chipping away. First half was ugly. I mean it was like, it was like a first quarter score with like four minutes to go. It was like 30 to 27 it seemed, maybe it was like six minutes to go. So what the half? I think they were both like the f forties ain't don't even remember. And a, and I said, Paul Jokingly, I go, you watch, the bolt's going to score over a hundred, they're going to eat up or whatever. So of course they come out, everybody starts hitting their shots, it turns into this great game. Um, and then the fourth quarter comes and we start chipping away, chipping away, chipping away with done by like 10 or 11, and then went down by eight, then went down by five and then without my four. And next thing you know, we're up by like two. So you guys all know how the fucking game ends, right?

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       We fucking missed what's his face? Uh, Brown missed that foul shot and Isaiah, Mr. Foul Shot, that would've fucking iced it. And uh, we let him hang around, hang around and fucking hang around the end. I can't remember who was tied. We were up by one. It all happened. So you know, it happened so fucking fast when you're at the game and you don't have an announcer holding your hand and you don't have something that you can actually look at, there's too much shit to look at. So we go to inbound. The fucking ball.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       right. This guy goes around Jae Crowder I think tied it up with like fuck right. That's right. We were up by two instead of being up by three and forcing him to take a three and they probably would have missed a fucking thing. That's right. And the guy goes right around, Crowder lays it in, crowd's going nuts. There's like four seconds left. The guy and I can try to get a toy. Isaiah Thomas, let's see what happens. We fucking inbound the ball. Isaiah, one of the only times I've seen him mess up this year messed up the past. Who's kind of looking up court, you know, cause there's only four seconds left before he caught the ball. They kick it out to this fucking dude. What the hell was his name? I actually wrote it down so I would give him the respect he deserves. Tyler ulous, they kick it out to him and he hits a fucking three point or the buzzer to beat the Celtics. Now here's the thing, I had second row fucking seats. And guess what? I didn't even see the play. It happened on my end. You know why? Because the fucking assholes who were in there in the front fucking row.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       they inbound the ball and they could see that, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       Um, Thomas was, was fucking it up. They stand up, you're in the fraud. Fucking run. What are you standing up for? There's nothing in front of you. You fucking cunt. And all of a sudden I just saw the ball go to the net and everybody goes and the horn goes off. Everybody goes nuts. I go, what the fuck does that count? Did that just go with what the fuck just happened? I had to go home to watch the replay to see what the fuck happened. I was sitting in the second row. I couldn't see it because he's fucking assholes stood up in front of me. Um, I don't, I don't understand standing up when nothing's in your way. They haven't. You ever heard that expression? Why stand when you could sit by sit, when you could lay down? Why stand up when you were in the front fucking row and what is blocking your God view anyways? All right, I'm done. Fucking bitch in here. I had a a, I had a great time and evidently Kobe eleven's are fucking crazy man.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       You know

Speaker 2:          00:23:52       dude, Chris Everett should wear that fucking sneakers. That's what it looks at. It looks like the one that different colored ones. I'd like, you know, do you know something that is a testament to how great Colby Bryant was. You know, it's almost like he's so fucking good. Nike was at the factory going like how fucking ugly do you think we could make a sneaker if we put your name on it? These people that lick the bottom of the fucking sneaker, will they still buy these goddamn things? You know what? Now that I'm looking at him, cause I'm an old man, they don't look like you played basketball. Great. They look comfortable as hell as far as when they're in a different color. I guess they look like slippers. Now here's the thing. What I want is I want to fucking ask you. Coby had that horrific, uh, Achilles.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:41       Um, injury, I swear to God, which is like, that was the end of anybody's career. That is like the classic old man basketball injury is you go to take a step in your fucking Achilles, goes right up the back of your leg. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:59       I mean, I don't even let me, I usually, obviously I don't fucking play hoop it all, but I still fucking, I'm always stretching my fucking Achilles. I swear to God before I get out of bed, that's, I don't know what it is about that injury. I just know like five or six people that have had it and I want no part of it. I want no fucking, you never walk right again. I mean, if he got Kobe's money, you know, you can go to Germany and meet the grand sons of the Nazi fucking doctors and they'll spend your fucking blood in a centrifuge, whatever the fuck they do. And then you come back and you can still dunk or whatever. You know, but most people don't have Coby money. So what's going to happen is, is you're going to go down to the veterinarian down the street and he's going to sell that thing back and you're never going to, you're never going to be, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       God help you. If you're ever in a situation where there's panic and the crowd starts running and it's a stampede and you've blown out your Achilles at some point in your life that's you're going to get trampled.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:26:00       you're going to be that zebra in the Serengeti that gets eaten by the fucking alligators, basically what's going to happen. Um, but he, you know, he has the low tops. I wonder if that probably had nothing to do with it. I'm just surprised guys are wearing low top fucking sneakers again. Like it's a,

Speaker 1:          00:26:17       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:26:17       cause you know, I, I don't pay attention to shit. I usually watch hockey. Right. And versus going like, no, no, no. Colby kind of brought the low tops back. Everybody's wearing. So I looked out on the court and I saw a number of people with low tops or people still had like these high top sneakers on, but the amount of ones like that, that they were like Velcro, you know, like a little kitty can't tie sneakers. See, have they had like velcro high tops with like a fucking belt around your ankle. And I was,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       I dunno, I dunno about those either.

Speaker 2:          00:26:48       You know what's hilarious? How arrogant I am that I actually think that the world cares what a 48 year old white guy thinks about fucking sneakers. Oh, why don't you just get a pair of shell toes? Um, so anyways, we went to the Goddamn game and uh, we had a great fucking time. Um, Robert Sovereign, his family are great. We met, we met him briefly, but, and just talk to him, just great people like that guy. Dude, if I was a feed experiment, I would be very happy with that guy. As an owner, even though I know you guys are rebuilding, that guy fucking loves his team. There's a lot of owners, they don't give a shit. You know, they own a team so they can have hookers and blow it up in a fucking sweet dude. That guy, he was, it looked like he, I was going to say, it's like he had money on the game and he does. He's paying the fucking players.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       Um,

So I've been listening to a bunch of fucking old school country, not all the way back to Hank Williams, but like that outlaw shit, you know, right before the outlaws. Shit is George Jones considered outlaw, I dunno, but listening to him late, obviously, um, to all of these other fucking guys, right. And uh, I ended up listing, I remember that the song, do you guys remember Johnny paycheck? Johnny paycheck was this country singer and he, I swear to God, he had a hit song called take this job and shove it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       And it was such a fucking hit. It's so struck a chord with people that they actually turned it into a movie. There was actually a movie called take this job and shove it. It was just a, it was about a fucking guy who was working in a job that he hated and he wanted to tell him, you know, basically tell him to go fuck themselves. But he didn't have the nerves. And I think it was because the lyric was someday I'm going to get the nerve to say it and everybody could relate to it being like, Hey, I also hate my fucking life and I want to make a change, but I don't know how to do it. You know what I mean? It's like the whole Donald Trump fucking phenomenon, not the informed people. You know what I mean? I'm talking about the, the, the mouth breather.

Speaker 2:          00:38:22       You know what I mean? Like what the Hillary Clinton, you had the informed person that wanted to vote for her and then you had the hissy fit, fucking dope. This will be great for women. Like your life was really gonna fucking change. Um, I swear to God, I, I just don't, I don't, I don't understand adults who haven't fucking figured it out yet. That you're, you're on your own. Okay. Play time is over. Nobody cares about you. Okay. I don't care what color they're fucking tired them for. Their Bra is they, they don't, the level of money that you have to have and then you have to give it to these people to, for you to even be on their radar, you have to be going to these 10,000, a hundred thousand $50,000 fucking plate dinners with them. And then you have to stand in a line of people that all paid that money.

Speaker 2:          00:39:11       Okay? And you got to get up there with your fucking shapeshift or fucking lizard eyeballs and you got to try to appear into their soul. I didn't think you'd talk to him. You just walk up with a Napkin that says how much money are you going to give to them? And then you're on their fucking radar. Has nothing to do with your genitalia anyways, so all the, okay, so I'm getting off the rails yet. So this fucking guy, Johnny paycheck, he's got this fucking shot. The song called take this job and shove it. It's the funniest fucking, just, there's no way to listen to this song and not fucking just be, I played it for Paul Versey. He was crying, laughing. He goes, this can't be a real song. I go, dude, not only is it a real song, I was turned into a movie. Just the way he says, shove it, his voice drops way down. He goes, take this job and shove it. I work in here no more. My woman Don lab took all the reasons why I was working for these are the actual lyrics. You better or not try to stay in the my way cause I'm walking out the door. You could take this job I working here no more than the stupid baseline comes on boot but du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du and it gets all like [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:40:29       kind of quiet. You don't want to red neck gets quiet, you know and starts talking, leans in. It's fucking scary. You know non Whitey. Even for white people. That's fucking scary. There is nothing scarier than a redneck leaning in at a bar thinking that you were all on the same team. That's some fucked up shit cause you're immediately like, I don't want to do, I don't, I don't want any part of what you're about ready to tell me sir. And I want to try to get out of this conversation gracefully. How do I dismount out of this fucking conversation? The second they went on a fucking redneck looks the opposite way of the conversation and then leans in. I'm telling you, this should be like a fucking an injector seat on your bar stool to get you the fuck out of it. Where did it go? Did I get left behind? Um, so I swear to God. So when he gets into the verse, right? He, it's like he's leaning in happy and working in this factory for now on 15 years all his time.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       Or Watch my woman drowning in a pool that tears. You know, and I, what I love about all those old school country songs is it fucking women always leave. They're always crying or whatever, but these fucking assholes, they never say why. And whenever I listen to these songs, it's just like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? I get it. You're working at this factory. You don't like the job. Why is your woman drowning in a pool of tears? What the, I mean, are you taking this fucking, so you don't have the balls to try to get a better job? Tell your boss to fuck off. So what happens? You come home, you take it out on your wife. Is that what you're doing? I bet. Shit jobs. I've had law pay up for the first fucking, I don't know how many years of being a comedian. Was it a low paying job? I never had a girlfriend drown in a pool of tears. I mean, I definitely made him cry, but that's because I was an asshole. Had nothing to do with my fuck. I wouldn't blame my job.

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:36       I've been featuring on the road for now on 16 years on of these days. Anyways. You got, you just listen to the fucking song. You gotta hear this song, you gotta you, um, Johnny paycheck. Um, I know I'm making fun of him, but I actually, I dunno, there's something about this. I listened to this fucking song and just gives me all kinds of ideas for characters and shit like that and movies and whatever. Um, but I'm in download, George Jones, George Jones. Tammy way net, all of these fucking people, and I swear to God, you got to, you got to listen to George Jones these days. These days I barely get by is inadvertently one of the funniest buckets. Songs you ever gonna listen to your life. Do you have one of those friends that just calls up and complains all the time and you, you try to help them out and go, hey, well what if you do? Nah, I can't do that. And one blow the fucking guy who just resigned himself.

Speaker 2:          00:43:45       You know what I mean? I've got a couple of friends like that. After awhile you just like, dude, you're a white guy and the United States of America. How far down the fucking track before the race starts that you have to be Jesus fucking Christ? How the fuck are you complaining? I'm complaining. I'm not saying that white people should not complain. Okay. I know there's a lot of people down in a pool. It tears harder these days. I'm going to get the, I'm going to blow my top. It's like, dude, why don't you just address the fact that you don't like your job? Apply from some other jobs. If you don't have the training, take some night courses. You know, get the training you need instead of sitting there seething coming home, taking it out on your fucking well. George Jones has another fucking song called the grand tour. I listened to that. I'm telling you, you got to listen to these fucking songs, right? I listened to that song. It's like, George, what in the fuck did you do to your woman? It's like, step right up. Come on in. If you'd want to tag the Grand Tor, Oh, below where? How's the woods was home. Sweet home. You're like, Jesus Christ and this motherfucker. He goes through his whole house

Speaker 1:          00:45:08       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45:08       It is the chair where it should bring the pipe to me and sit down on my knee and whisper, Ooh, I love you. I you're like Jesus Christ right there. You want to get out of the house? This motherfucker won't stop straight ahead. It is the bed where we lay low, boom. So thought he gets all away to the nursery. You're like, oh Jesus Christ.

Then I actually feel good. Yeah, get the fuck out I and get that kid out of there told me that if I'm supposed to feel bad for you.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47:15       All right. Maybe I'm taking these fucking songs a little too seriously. Um, I, I have a problem with that. Like when I listen to rap music, you know, like who? Suzette new group that everybody's Migos. When I, when I watch their videos and shit and they've coming up in those supercars and they're holding the fucking money out, it just, it literally, I have to look in the other direction. It just drives me not seeing artists doing that. I just, I'm always thinking in my head, please, please buy some real estate. Please don't blow it all on fucking Coby eleven's. Oh my God, Dude. Watch an artist's watch and people who don't understand money I guess. But I would say artists, you know the shit that we fucking do. It's just the dumbest, you know what's another stupid fucking thing? I love these people that buy watches that are like you. It's like dude, that thing you could hang that on the fucking wall. I'd know what time it was from across the room. Why do you have that on that roof on your wrist? The amount of guys that are like my height and my size walking around with a watch that only would look right on like a fucking offensive lineman is,

Speaker 2:          00:48:26       it's like, did you take that out of a submarine?

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       I was like, what are you gonna get it for fucking East? Get some Ash Wednesday flowers. Why are they advertising it? Cause you know what, they probably had their maximum appeal. They probably hit their maximum fucking, I just realized it's probably somebody sleeping on the other side. I mean, I'm waking them up with my fucking Johnny paycheck saying, let me get over here. Um, anyways, so they'd probably be like, well, how can we get people that fucking buy flowers all year round? How can we create a need? Everybody's got an anniversary. Everybody's got a birthday birthday, right? Hey, I like the way you're thinking Carl. We could sell flowers to hoe he around.

Click on the microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinbirdthatstamps.com enter [inaudible]. All right, I'm getting up against it here. You know what I'm doing today, by the way, I'm going to go see, oh Cleo Odeo. I'm going to see my dog Cleo. Um, the, the people that ended up, uh, rescue getting her from us live out here. So, um, I'm actually gonna get to see her. I'm visiting her today and tomorrow and, um, I can't wait to see her in everything. She's probably not going to give a shit cause she's probably gonna be so in love with the other people.

Speaker 4:          00:54:53       Cause I kinda realized that going well. She was in love with the people that had her before us and within a week she fucking loved us. I mean, dogs should they adapt, they just fucking adept. So, um, I've got another five minutes here and then I, I gotta take off. So I got time for like one question here. Let me see. Um, let me get, let me get a good one here. Uh, Alrighty. Rady a dictator bill. I'm 19 years old and I've been with my girlfriend, my Wallman Dolan left. I'm with my girlfriend now for two years. Uh, I know what you're thinking too young for all these silly problems. That's not what I'm thinking. I'm thinking good for you. Way To go where to go. Fell. Um, anyway, for the first year of our relationship, literally everything was perfect. I still love her just as much as I did then. I'm sure she loves me just as much. However, during the second year of our relationship relationship and overnight shift changed.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:55:53       Um, and then we stopped having sex it based, it's basically nonexistent and now and again, every couple of months it will happen. But I know she's not enjoying it. This is because she was on the implant contraception injection. At first I was questioning myself and if it was me that wasn't getting her in the mood anymore, but she promises me that it isn't because of the implant. She says it's that what the fuck is a contraception injection? [inaudible] okay. Oh Jesus. I, I didn't mean I've never heard of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:56:31       It's an injection so you won't get pregnant. Dude, if you literally told me contraception actually meant it's going to get you pregnant, I would believe that too. This week. One of those fucking words that I just ignored my whole life. You know, like Soliloquy, like what the fuck does that mean? You know, contraception, implant official site. Get the facts. Fuck that. I don't want facts. I want pictures. Images. Okay. They're showing it that it's nice and small. For some reason they keep putting it up against the bicep. They stick it in your fucking arm

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       watch.

Speaker 4:          00:57:27       So say some fucking robot shit.

Speaker 4:          00:57:31       Okay. It's birth control implant. They stick a fucking toothpick in your arm and then you can't have a baby. I don't get it. Anyways. Well yeah, that's probably fucking annoying to have it in there. You know what I mean? She goes to hug you in the inside of her arm hurts. Anyways, after the first I was questioning [inaudible], she says that that is caused her to completely lose her sex drive. She says she just had it removed and it's been a few weeks since and nothing has changed yet. I feel so much resentment towards her every day and what I can only describe as depression. As soon as I see her, most of the time I find myself being such an angry short tempered person. Now when normally I'm usually happy and smiling, a Jesus might be time to get out of this relationship buddy. But you know something, if it really affected her like that, it depends on how long she had it in there.

Speaker 4:          00:58:18       Maybe she needs longer than two weeks. Um, but you know, if you're going to be an angry lunatic, I mean if you don't leave eventually she's gonna. But you know what, you get yourself a song on a warm dawn port a to pick in her arm. Now she won't suck my Dick one of these days. I'm going to whip it out and wipe it on the wall. You can take mod dick and shove it, um, Rodney and your fucking mouth, you whore. But do, do, do, do. But do you do okay? I always try. I always seem to try and hide my need for sex and act like I don't ever want it and tried to show disinterests but I never can. I guess it just must be more important to me than it is to her. I never thought sex was such a big deal, but the last year has taught me that when there's bad sex life in a relationship, it can really cause the whole thing to just break down.

Speaker 4:          00:59:08       It just got to the point now that I've said we need some space and a break, cause the last thing I want is to ruin our relationship. Um, dude, you're fucking miserable man. And you have to, you have to, you know, it's, you gotta be with somebody and like understand them and, and you know, be there when they're going through a tough time, but like, you know, if they're not understanding how fucking miserable you are, you're just gonna. You just going to keep getting more miserable and then, you know, then they're going to be miserable. And then in the end, they're gonna fucking break up with you and you're gonna be like, what the fuck? I should have done that to them. I'm not breaking up with somebody. It's not something you should do to them. It's something you should do for yourself. All right?

Speaker 4:          00:59:51       This is the deal, dude. You're not fucking happy. All right? You're not happy. It's great that you've taken a fucking break. And I would go out and I'd fucking go try to enjoy myself and meet somebody that doesn't have a fucking toothpick in their arm that doesn't want to touch my dick. You know? I mean, that's just getting down to brass tacks here. That's what's going on, right? They stuck that shit in her and a, you can't stick your shit in hurt. So I mean, why you gotta get the fuck out? I get out. You're young, dude, you're 19. What are you gonna marry her? What do you in the military? People in the military get married when they're 19, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:00:26       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:00:26       But, and dawn left, um, that's what you do. I, it's just sounds like a, you sound like you, you need like a long time away from each other. The way that was read, dude, that sounded like a fucking 40 year old guy rather that Indian 19. So that's kind of a good sign that maybe she get the fuck out. Um, who knows? But I, I would not say anything mean I would not. And uh, I just, you know, you want to be able to see the person again and not get a glass to the head. You know what I mean? That's kind of what you're going for. So the art form is you just tell them how you're feeling.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:01:03       You know, I'm just not happy. I'm sorry. That's just how I feel. I'm just not happy and I'm finding myself less and less happy and, um, it's affecting my moods. Everything you just said.

Speaker 1:          01:01:17       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:18       And I'm finding that I'm getting angry and I don't want to be angry around you and create any misery in your life. So as much as this is going to hurt you, I'm walking out the door, you can take this relationship, shove it. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:01:33       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:33       That's it. They walk out the door, you know, and you'll probably walk out that door and you'd be sad a little bit and your walk a little more. Then you start skipping and then you're running down the street. Yeah, yeah. It might be one of those breakups

Speaker 4:          01:01:50       or it could be the one, oh, why did I do it? I don't fucking know. But you're 19, you know, if you got the whole, you got your whole fucking life ahead of you. You don't need to be in this. This sounds like you're fucking married. I'd get up. All right. That's it. Okay. And that's the fucking podcast for this week. Go fuck yourselves. I will check in on you on, I'm on Thursday. And uh, that said, I'll let you know how she and all clear the next couple of days is, which is going to be fucking awesome. And it's also, you know, and I'm psyched that, you know, we've got a cool family and uh, you know, I think I'll come out to Phoenix a couple times a year, you know, do a run of shows like I'm doing here. Go to a game or something like that, I'll hang out with the dog. It's kind of Nice, you know? All right. That's it. I'll talk to you guys on Thursday.
