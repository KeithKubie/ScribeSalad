JULIE WISKIRCHEN: So
I'm Julie Wiskirchen.

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.250
I'm from the authors team
here at Google Los Angeles.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.562
And today I'm very excited
to welcome Dean Koontz.

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.500
When Dean was a
senior in college,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.960
he won an "Atlantic Monthly"
fiction competition,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.950
and he's been
writing ever since.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.219
He's one of the world's
most iconic writers,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.270
with books published
in 38 languages,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.850
and has sold over
450 million copies.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.740
14 of his novels have
risen to number one

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.190
on the "New York Times"
hardcover best-seller list,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.190
making him one of only
a dozen writers ever

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.189
to achieve that milestone.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.980
The "New York Times"
has called his writing

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.480
psychologically complex,
masterly, and satisfying.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.990
"Rolling Stone" has hailed
him as America's most popular

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.950
suspense novelist.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.890
Dean's new novel is
called "Innocence,"

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.142
and he's going to
discuss it with us today.

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:46.100
So please join me in
giving a very warm welcome

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.682
to Dean Koontz.

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.598
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:53.030
DEAN KOONTZ: Thank you.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.370
I normally stand at
a podium and speak,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.950
so this is a little
more relaxed.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.540
I don't have my
notes in front of me,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.980
so it'll be more confusing.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.630
But hopefully-- and we'll try to
make it more with some question

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.380
and answer as we go.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320
And maybe I can
mingle some stories

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.670
in about things that
have happened to me.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250
Normally when I
speak, I just talk

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.060
about stupid things that
I've done during my career,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.890
or stupid things that
have happened to me.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.990
And I have files and
files of stupid stories

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.170
of things I've done.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.426
So I usually have no
shortage of material.

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:27.300
But I thought today,
since this is different,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.050
I'd probably tell you
a little about where

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.670
I came from, a little bit
about where I grew up,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.060
and some things that
happened to me that probably

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510
drove me to be a writer.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.320
And by the way, I see golden
retrievers here today.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.900
We saw them out in the thing.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.570
And I brought mine,
because we were

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.880
told we're
dog-friendly territory.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.260
So maybe at some point,
when people get done eating,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.910
I would release Anna if
nobody has a dog allergy

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.320
and let her wander around.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.440
She loves people.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.550
So we'll wait until people
get through their food,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.400
because she won't be
quite so people loving,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.990
she'll be food
loving until then.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.690
I grew up in the little town
of Bedford, Pennsylvania.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.070
And we lived in what was
the next thing to a shack.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.720
It was two stories,
but it probably

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.140
was a total of 400
or 500 square feet.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.610
It had a tar paper roof.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.195
There's a picture
of it I always keep

00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:26.520
to remind myself
where I came from.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.630
My dad had a serious
alcohol problem.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.420
And he was always
getting in fights.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.070
And by the time he
didn't work anymore,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.946
my wife and I counted how
many jobs we could remember he

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:40.720
had had.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.510
And it was 44 jobs in 34 years.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.927
And there were periods
where he didn't work.

00:02:45.927 --> 00:02:47.510
And the reason there
were so many jobs

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.570
is he also had a
tendency to violence.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.150
And he had a
proclivity to punch out

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.100
the boss, which
isn't a career move,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.130
even at Google, where they're
so good with their employees

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.140
that you can get away with it.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.140
And so there were
periods of this time

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.060
he didn't work at all.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.182
He was a gambler
and a womanizer.

00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:05.640
We never knew
whether we were going

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.870
to have that roof over our
heads the next day or not.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.950
In addition to all
that-- and I didn't

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.940
talk about my father for a long
time after I was successful.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.770
And then one day
I was asked to go

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.250
speak to a group of
Walden bookstore managers.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.440
Walden and Borders,
no longer with us.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.044
And I just did my
normal speech, telling

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:30.460
stupid things that
happened to me.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.470
And the audience was very
with me and it was wonderful.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.150
And then we got to the
Q and A. And somebody

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.670
said, how did your childhood
affect your writing career?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.230
Your parents must have
encouraged you to read a lot.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.520
And I said, oh, no, books were
not really welcome in my house.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.690
And books were considered
a waste of time.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.190
And my father was
a violent alcoholic

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.710
who made my childhood
a kind of-- I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.210
had to escape into books.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.580
But I had to hide the
fact that I had books,

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.390
or that I was getting
them out of the library.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.400
And that audience, suddenly,
I lost them entirely.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.234
They just went dead.

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:10.941
And they were all
looking at me, like-- I

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:12.330
realized, oh, I blew it.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.940
Now they think I've had
a terrible childhood.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.019
And it wasn't a
terrible childhood.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.795
I always felt happiness is
a choice, no matter what

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:22.670
you're going through.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.650
And as a kid, there
were things I liked.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.910
One of them was books.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.030
And another was I got a
bike that an uncle gave me.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.200
And I could travel 30 miles,
40 miles a day on that bike,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.410
and go all over this little
farm town where I was raised.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.210
And I could be away
from that house.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.950
My mother was a great person.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.400
But if my father
was there, the house

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.930
was not place anybody
would want to be.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.710
Then I said to
them, but you know,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.550
I don't mean to say
my childhood was bad.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.430
I told them happiness
is a choice.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.840
And I said also my father
had a funny side to him.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.620
He was a very good salesman.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.090
He could get people to invest
in inventions that he created.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.780
And he could actually
raise significant money

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.340
for those days to
produce the invention

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.840
in a number of copies, hundreds
of them, thousands of them,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.660
warehouse them.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.480
But they were never
anything that he could sell.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.150
You'll see why in just a minute.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.470
But he could get people
to raise the money.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.330
And it always amazed me,
because we never saw the money.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.000
He gambled it away or spent it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.140
And he often had investors
trying to put him in jail.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.040
And he couldn't
hold onto his money.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.860
But he could invent things
that I thought were absurd,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.810
but some people thought
were good investments.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.530
One of the ones I remember
was he had this big exercise

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.050
machine.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.054
And this was in
the days-- he may

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:45.720
have been correct
about this-- he called

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.510
it the first electric
exercise machine.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.710
And it may have been
true, that in those days,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.430
treadmills were actually
run by your own power,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.350
and they weren't electric.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.890
But it was about the size of an
old console model television.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.600
I'm the only one here old
enough to remember those.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.260
They were about this high,
and this wide, and that deep--

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.800
a huge box.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.660
And this was all it
was, was this huge box.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.280
It had a little hole on
one side, and a hook.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.620
And you pulled the hook out.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.070
And this rope came on the hook.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.610
And then you were supposed
to, into a door frame,

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.090
screw a little eye hook, so
that the hook could go into it.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.100
Then you turned on the
electric jump rope.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.740
And an engine or
motor turned it.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.100
And it sounded like this.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.280
[MOTOR NOISES]

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.210
And it turned this jump rope.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.307
And I stood there
looking at this machine.

00:06:39.307 --> 00:06:41.390
He actually got investors
to produce 200 of these.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.710
He never sold any.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.600
And I said, but Dad, who wants
to buy an electric jump rope?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.570
And he got angry very quickly.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.510
And he said, everybody
will want to buy one.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.500
And I said, but when you're
exercising with the jump rope,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.060
part of the exercise is
the arms, the upper body.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.770
It's not all about the jumping.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.350
And he said, this is for
people who want to exercise,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.575
but not too damn much.

00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:09.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.310
And I had no answer to that.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.760
And then, because he knew
that I wasn't really approving

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.010
of this, he said, this is
also the only exercise machine

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.190
that a blind man can use.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.340
And I was really
baffled at that.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.810
And then he pointed out to
me that every time the rope

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.680
hit the apex if its
arc, a bell rang.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.120
So a blind man would know when
it was starting to come down.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.674
And a friend of
mine, years later

00:07:34.674 --> 00:07:36.090
when I was telling
him this, said,

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.640
boy, I could see Ray
Charles in the TV commercial

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.930
already, singing
"Ol' Man River,"

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.480
and the jump rope coming around.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.110
These were always a great
horrible thing for my mother.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.850
Because my mother knew that when
he got people to invent things,

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.160
or to finance his
inventions and produce them,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.690
that they would be
coming after us.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.210
And we wouldn't have the money.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.640
And it would just mean he
wasn't working at a job

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.760
where he might actually succeed.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.500
And the only thing he
really succeeded at

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.840
was insurance sales.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.350
He could sell people anything.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.230
But he could never
hold onto the money,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.120
even to bring it home for food.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.920
Another one of his was-- this
was maybe the most mortifying.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.400
He invented-- we
didn't have dogs,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.730
but he invented a dog bed.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.850
Now, it's not the dog
bed that you think of,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.880
which we see in any dog supply
store or pet supply store.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.790
My father had an elevated dog
bed that sat on a metal frame

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.020
and was sort of almost
like a hammock, strung

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.390
kind of tightly.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.780
And I said, well,
why do dogs want

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.773
to climb up on something
like that to sleep?

00:08:39.773 --> 00:08:41.814
If they want to climb up,
they'll sleep on a sofa

00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:43.490
or they'll sleep on the floor.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.160
And he said, no dogs
don't want to be

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.250
down there where
the bugs might be.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.980
And I didn't no dogs
had a thing about bugs.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.250
And he said, also, this is the
only dog bed that's heated.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.790
And I thought,
well, dogs have fur.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.440
And I know some
small breeds, maybe,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.140
need to be warm, because
they don't have thick coats.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.850
But I said, well,
how are you going

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.235
to get a dog to sleep on this?

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:11.110
I don't think a dog's
going to sleep on this.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.950
And he said, we're making these,
and we're going to sell them.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:15.839
And they made them.

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:17.630
They always made them
before they found out

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.030
if there was a market.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.330
And he found out he couldn't
sell these everywhere

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.090
where you would sell dog things.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.360
So then he knew a man who had a
series of 14 service stations.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.160
So my father decided that
these would be a perfect object

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
to sell out of a
service station.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.010
When you go to a service
station to get gas,

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.510
and you see this
dog bed, and you've

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.150
got dogs, well, of
course you'll buy one.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.310
Google would be nowhere with
my dad as your marketing guy.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.450
So he had all these, but
he couldn't sell them.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.820
But he decided on this.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.730
And he talked to this guy who
had all these service stations.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.830
And this guy decided
he'd look at it.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.810
And so my father set
up a demonstration.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.330
This was after my
mother had died.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.320
And my father had a
string of girlfriends.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.050
And the girlfriend
had this little dog.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.280
It was a mutt.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.510
But it was cute.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.010
And dog's name is Fluffy.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.140
And my father--
oh, I almost forgot

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.590
one of the most
interesting things.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.600
My father had
pamphlets printed up.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.770
And the name was
also on the thing.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.190
And it was called
the Koontz Komfy Kot.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.880
And my father thought
it would be clever

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.760
if it was spelled KKK.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.830
It never occurred to
him that he alienated

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.960
98% of the people
who saw the bed.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.670
And so the pamphlets
had Koontz Komfy Kot,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.870
and the K were bigger
than anything else,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.050
so you read it as KKK.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.580
And Fluffy was there, and
the girlfriend was there,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.080
and my father was
there, and I was there.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.210
And they couldn't get Fluffy--
encouraging Fluffy to get up

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.032
on the bed, they
couldn't encourage him.

00:10:56.032 --> 00:10:57.740
Fluffy wanted nothing
to do with the bed,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.550
like I sort of suspected.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.590
So my father grabbed
hold of Fluffy,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.840
who was a nervous little
dog to begin with.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.870
And in front of this
guy he's demonstrating

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.930
it to, picked Fluffy
up, set him on the bed.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.300
And Fluffy did what
nervous dogs tend to do.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.580
He urinated.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.630
And that's when they found
out the heating pad was not

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.100
waterproof.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.720
It was like a Road
Runner cartoon.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.900
Fluffy just wanted
right off the thing.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.520
He wasn't electrocuted.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.400
But he was a very
suspicious dog thereafter.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.200
And of course, once
that was revealed,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.120
the fella with 17
service stations

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.130
didn't want to sell
it there either.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.450
So then my father
didn't only invent,

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.790
he also sometimes
got business ideas.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.824
And one of them
that he got was-- he

00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:50.240
thought it would
be a great idea--

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.960
he bought a used
steam cleaning rig.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.140
It was all on wheels, and
it was pretty unwieldy.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.150
And it was a thing that
generated steam and was

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.220
gasoline powered.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.220
And then you had the steam
wand, which sent the steam out

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.540
under high pressure.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.390
And he was going to start a
company to pressure wash truck

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.460
engines.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.575
We lived in a town that had a
number of depots for roadway

00:12:15.575 --> 00:12:16.910
and a number of trucks.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.620
So they had a lot of trucks
there at any one time.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.540
Why they wouldn't
necessarily feel

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.130
it was advantageous to them
to have their truck engines

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.180
steam cleaned on a regular
basis, I have no idea.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.910
And as it turned
out, they really

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.720
didn't find that
very interesting.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.360
But he thought that was
going to be a big deal.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.630
And it was over the summer.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:40.660
And so I used to work at summers
when I was in high school.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.420
But that summer, I
was not permitted

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.600
to go back to the supermarket
where I worked other summers.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.910
And I was to work with him.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.710
And because he was the boss,
he got the prestige job

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.310
with the steam wand.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.370
And my job was to do
whatever he told me to do.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.430
But there was one thing
that had to be done

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.470
and was really essential.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.720
And that was the release valve,
pressure valve on this thing.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.640
When the pressure built up
so far that it was dangerous,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.920
it was supposed to release.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.470
There was a pressure
release valve.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.800
Except it sometimes-- in fact,
a lot of times-- would stick.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.250
And what I was supposed to do
was when it stuck and started

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.230
to whistle, I was
supposed to take a hammer

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.920
and go up to the
generator and smash it

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.050
at the side of the thing
until it popped loose.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.140
I thought I was going
to die that summer.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.500
But I'd go up and hammer
it, and it would pop loose.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.000
And the truck thing
didn't last very long.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.560
And nobody seemed to want it,
except the car crazy people

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.860
wanted their car engine
to look really clean.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.670
But it wasn't enough
to make a business at.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.990
So then he got the
idea that supermarkets

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.820
would like to have their carts
cleaned, because they care

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.330
so much about you may be
touching germs on your cart.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.360
Well, he did get one supermarket
to clean a couple hundred.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.318
But after they looked at
them and they couldn't

00:13:58.318 --> 00:14:00.650
see that much difference,
that was the end of that.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.990
So the big deal he came
up with was cemetery.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.780
It was his idea
to go in and sell

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.190
through the cemetery
people a deal.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.550
If you have a
relative buried here,

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.925
we will come in once a month
and clean your tombstone

00:14:16.925 --> 00:14:21.160
of your relatives, and it
will always looks pristine.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.105
Because, you know, motors
throw grass up on the stone,

00:14:25.105 --> 00:14:27.530
and birds do their
thing, and there's dust.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.790
And so we would
steam clean these.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.796
So he did set up
another demonstration

00:14:31.796 --> 00:14:33.295
for the people who
ran the cemetery.

00:14:33.295 --> 00:14:36.200
And there were two men and
a woman there for this.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.090
And he set up a stone.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.250
And this was back in the
days when we were first

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.220
beginning to see these--
the medallions that

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.100
would have a picture of
the dead person on it.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.940
And that was sort
of a new thing.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.880
And it was sort of inset.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.960
And it was glued, of
course, [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.610
And he chose to
clean one of these.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.190
And when he took the
steam wand across the disk

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.430
with the picture on
it, it popped loose

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.490
and flew like a martial
arts killing star.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.040
And everyone went, ah!

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.084
And it goes across the cemetery
and smashes into another stone.

00:15:09.084 --> 00:15:11.000
And as that thing is
tearing loose and flying,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.280
my father goes, whoa!

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.189
And he pulls the
wand up like this.

00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:15.480
And there's a tree overhanging.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.460
And he blows leaves
off the tree.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.030
It's summer.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.510
He kills the tree.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.030
The leaves are
blown off the tree.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.540
And birds come exploding
out of the tree.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.720
And the demonstration's going
very badly, at this point.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.740
Even he knows this.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:36.820
And at that moment,
the valve sticks.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.810
And I grab up the hammer.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.210
And I go over and
start hammering on it.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.330
And this is the one time
that the hammering on it

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.200
isn't working.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.230
And my father has
always told me,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.640
if it doesn't come lose in
so many times you hit it,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.870
then just run.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.680
So I'm hitting it
and hitting it.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.350
And it's not coming loose.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.130
And so I not only
run, I yell, run!

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.270
And I turn and run.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.540
And now these people, these
two men and this woman

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.780
with the cemetery,
they start running.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.180
And we're all running
away from the generator.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.100
And the woman falls,
trips and falls.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.720
And I'm a polite young man.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.950
And I stoop over
to to help her up.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.230
And I-- let me help you up.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.800
And I take her by her arm.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.940
And she looks around at me.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.540
And I've got the
hammer like this.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.250
And she goes, no!

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.290
We didn't get that.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.430
And that was the end of
the pressure washing event.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.660
So somehow I survived
that childhood.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.770
And there were many nights
where-- we had one car.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:43.580
Not much of a car.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.360
But we'd be called at a
quarter to 2:00 in the morning,

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.700
because bars closed at two.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.944
But we'd have to
walk to the bar,

00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:51.360
because he was
drunk on the floor.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.910
And there were all those
humiliating things.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.970
And so I always felt
like an outcast as a kid,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.140
and pretty much was.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.940
I said, my father
wasn't the town drunk.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.420
But he was one of them,
and widely known for that.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.310
So books saved me.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.650
It was books that
I could escape,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:17.349
and I would know that
people live different ways.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.760
And it's kind of funny
when you're a kid,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.794
and you're living in
that kind of environment.

00:17:21.794 --> 00:17:23.460
And you can come to
think that everybody

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.430
lives this way when
the doors closed.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.210
And so books showed
me that that wasn't

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.660
the case, that there were
other ways to live lives.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.850
It also helped me to escape.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.434
My mother was the
sweetest person.

00:17:34.434 --> 00:17:36.850
And I don't know why she put
up with this all those years.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.380
But she also was not
much about books.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.060
And she used to say to me, books
are a total waste, especially

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.200
as I got to be 13, 14.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.210
And I said, well they're
not a waste of time to me.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.860
She said you could be
spending that time learning

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.047
to fix your car.

00:17:52.047 --> 00:17:53.130
Well, I didn't have a car.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.460
And she said, one day
you're going to have a car.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.230
And nobody in our
family is ever going

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.180
to be able to afford a mechanic.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.720
So you better learn
to repair your car.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.220
And I said well,
then I'm just going

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.150
to have to be the
first one in the family

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.320
ever to afford a mechanic.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.370
The irony of me is
it was books that

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:15.090
helped me afford a mechanic,
and a pretty good car, too.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.100
So I was a happy to
get out of that house.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.330
And I worked my way
through a teachers college

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.980
and taught in the poverty
program for a year

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.960
when Lyndon Johnson
was president.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.800
And that was an eye-opening
experience for me.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.630
I was in a program
where the teachers

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:41.820
were supposed to pick students
in their class that were highly

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.250
intelligent, had lots
of potential and desire,

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.260
but who came from
extremely poor families

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.920
and would benefit, therefore,
from having almost a tutor

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.510
program for the day.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.760
So teachers were supposed
to pick 16 children out

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.320
of all their classes.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.970
They were to come to me for
English in small groups.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.780
And I got this job because I
hurried my way through college.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.460
I wanted to get
married to Gerda,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.970
and so I took extra
classes and got through

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.860
in three and a half years.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.120
And I was graduating
and going into this job

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.910
in a school district
in late October.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.030
And it never occurred
to me to think, well,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.740
wasn't this job filled at
the beginning of September?

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.750
Yes, it was.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.310
But the fellow who
had the job, which

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.580
I didn't learn until the
day I showed up for work,

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.670
had been run off
the road by students

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.770
and beaten up so badly he was
in the hospital for six weeks,

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.770
and decided he didn't
want to come back to work.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.400
So they filled the job with me.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.740
And I thought, well, that's odd.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.060
It's just teaching English.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.630
It's not like he
was-- you know, I

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.810
might have wanted to do
that to my phys ed teacher,

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.600
but never to my English teacher.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.100
And so then I discovered
that what happened

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.930
was the teachers
took this differently

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.540
than the program intended.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.690
What they wanted to
do was not yet rid

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.330
of their most
intelligent students,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.420
but their most
troublesome students.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.270
So they got rid of the ones
who'd been in reform school

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.830
or had police
records or whatever.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.500
So that was a very
interesting year.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.680
And at that, I said, you know,
I don't want to do this either.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.470
And I managed to
get through the year

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.410
without getting beaten
up and put in a hospital.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.560
But it was only
because I realized

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.650
that these kids had
huge amounts of energy.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.590
So we would do things like I'd
bring a rubber ball to school.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.050
Not a hard one, but not
a super soft one, either.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.540
These days, I'd probably
be put in jail for this.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.580
But when we were
talking doing lessons,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.820
I had the license to
ask you a question.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.300
If you couldn't answer it, I
could throw the ball at you.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.300
And if I missed, you could throw
it at me anytime you wanted.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.810
You could keep it for
a half hour and do it.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.350
So we did things like
this to keep it energetic.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.630
And by the time they were
done at the end of the day,

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.916
they didn't want to
bother beating me up.

00:20:57.916 --> 00:20:59.290
And then I taught
regular school.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.710
And then my wife said, I
know you want to write.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.440
I was selling short stories in
a couple of paperback novels.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:10.070
And she said, I know you
want to write novels,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.390
so I'll support you for five
years while you try to do that.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.460
She was working at a credit
bureau in those days.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.970
And so I took her up on it.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.560
I tried to bargain
her up to seven years.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.390
But she's got Sicilian
blood, so she always

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.850
wins those arguments.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.830
And it took four
and a half years

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.520
before she was able
to quit her job

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.000
and go to work running
the business side of mine.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.300
And we've now been
married 47 years.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.650
And it's been the greatest
relationship of my life.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:47.020
But that's how I
got into writing.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.650
And I wrote paperbacks, a
lot of things over the years.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.440
And finally I got
to the point where

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.340
books started to
actually sell, which

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.550
was a whole new idea for me.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.020
I mean, I'd sell them,
but very few people

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.540
would buy them for many years.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.977
And royalties were not great.

00:22:01.977 --> 00:22:03.060
But we could live on them.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.650
And then suddenly one day,
things started to change.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.260
And people started
to find the books.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:12.070
And I had a publisher then
who didn't, let's just say,

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.990
have a lot of faith in me.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.310
But when the books started
to work a little bit,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.860
then she said, I wonder.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.510
And I had this book
called "Strangers."

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.260
and it was a big book
with 12 leading characters

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.060
and lots of different stories.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.560
And it all has to do
with these characters

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.310
all experience something
in the same place

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.810
at the same time a
few years before.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.330
And they've all been
brainwashed to forget it.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.530
But the brainwashing
isn't holding.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.489
And different things are
happening to all of them.

00:22:40.489 --> 00:22:42.780
And they don't understand
why these things [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.185
Some are having nightmares.

00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:46.990
Some are having
moments of fugue.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.739
Others are having all kinds
of different problems.

00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:51.780
And gradually they find
their ways to each other.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.400
But in the beginning
of the book,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.030
there is the one
lead character who

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.910
keeps waking up from
nightmares and finds

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.050
he's been sleepwalking.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.500
And he wakes up at
the back of closets.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.100
He wakes up in
different places where

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.990
it's clear he's
hiding from something.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.850
But he can never
remember the dreams.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.830
And he doesn't know
what he was hiding from.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.520
In the first part of the book,
he wakes up at one point.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.150
He mentions that he wakes
up behind the furnace

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.800
in the garage.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.040
And it so happened
when I delivered

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.520
"Strangers," my
publisher said, I

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.650
think you should not
have a commercial editor.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.110
I think you should
have a literary editor.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.150
And I'm going to give
you a literary editor.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.816
And I though, this
is going to be great.

00:23:32.816 --> 00:23:34.890
It's like Thomas Wolfe
and Ernest Hemingway.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.190
I wonder what a literary
editor would be like.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.780
This is going to be fun.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.650
And so I really
liked this fella.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:42.650
He was a great guy.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.640
His name was Alan.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.110
And I delivered this book.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.400
And it was 940 manuscript pages.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.030
And my publisher came back,
said, I love this book.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.320
But you're going to
have to cut in half.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.930
It's too big.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.820
And I could see no
way to cut in half.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.610
If any of you've
read my stuff, I

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.430
tend to write pretty
tightly structured books.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.240
And I said, I don't
see how I can do that.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.040
And she said, Alan is going
to show you how to do this.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.270
So I thought, well, this
is going to be amazing,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.300
because I don't think
it's possible to cut 400.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.482
She said, just cut 430 pages.

00:24:16.482 --> 00:24:17.690
You don't have to go halfway.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.510
So Alan said, I'm
going through it.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.090
I've read it.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.690
I love it.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.740
But I can show you how
to cut it and everything.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.660
And he said that the way
it's probably going to happen

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.610
is, you've got 12
lead characters,

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.700
and we'll just cut
them down to nine.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.210
And I thought, yeah, but all the
stories kind of move like this.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.290
And what happens if
he pulled this thread?

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.424
Isn't this going to
unravel over here?

00:24:43.424 --> 00:24:44.340
He's going to show me.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.245
He's a famous literary editor.

00:24:46.245 --> 00:24:50.392
So OK, I'll bite my tongue and
we'll see what happens here.

00:24:50.392 --> 00:24:51.850
But then he said,
you know, there's

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.380
something that really
bothers me in this book.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.150
You know that moment early on
when the lead character wakes

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.570
up behind the furnace?

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:01.310
And I said, yes.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.090
He said, the furnace
is in the garage.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.560
What would the furnace
be doing in the garage?

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.240
And I said this is Southern
California where where he's

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.184
living, and most furnaces
are in the garage.

00:25:14.184 --> 00:25:15.100
Some are in the attic.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.474
But they're mostly
in the garage.

00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:18.060
Well, why aren't
they in the basement?

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.100
I said, see, in
Southern California,

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.310
very, very few houses
have a basement.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.140
They're built on
slabs of concrete.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.340
Oh, still, people, when
they're reading it,

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.470
who don't know that,
are going to say,

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.480
what's the furnace
doing in the garage?

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.200
And they're going to lose
track of the story right away.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.665
And I said, I don't think so.

00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:43.220
If the story isn't
gripping enough

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.600
to get past the furnace--

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.207
And he says, well, I don't know.

00:25:47.207 --> 00:25:48.790
I'm going to have
to think about this.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.640
But he said,
meanwhile, I'm going

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.920
to show you how to
cut these pages.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.150
Which I said, OK, we'll
see how this goes.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.090
So about six weeks go by.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.700
And the manuscript lands for me.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.140
And it comes with a letter.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.800
And the letter said, Dear Dean,
I have redlined some things

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.650
I think we can cut.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.230
And you'll see that
I have redlined

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.700
10 pages worth of cuts.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.700
Now all you need to do
is find the rest of them.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.830
He was joking a
little bit, because he

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.400
was trying to tell me,
without dissing the publisher,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.010
that this wasn't
going to be possible.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.760
But then it was around that time
that my publisher learned this.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.950
She said, OK, I guess Alan
knows what he's talking about.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.080
But if you ever
write a book again

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.300
like this with all
these characters,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.060
please write it so
that some of them

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.880
can be pulled out without
hurting the story.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.600
And I tried to
imagine doing that.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.890
Yeah, I'm going to spend
an extra three or four

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.880
months on the book,
writing all this stuff in,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.490
so they can pull
it out and it won't

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.040
affect the rest of the book.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.690
But I didn't say anything.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:03.720
So Alan also when he called
me to say he knew I had it

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.700
and he called me and said, yeah,
find how many pages you can.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.660
But you're never going
to find what is wanted.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.010
Just do the best you can
and see what I've done.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:14.990
I said, OK.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.130
He said, but I'm still
really upset that furnace

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.175
in the garage.

00:27:19.175 --> 00:27:21.730
And you know, I just
realized, there's

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.570
another moment where there's
a furnace in a garage later

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.800
in the novel.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.690
And I said, well, Alan, I
can't do anything about it.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.530
Because it is
Southern California.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.360
And that's the way it
is here in California.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.311
And a few days go by.

00:27:34.311 --> 00:27:35.560
And I'm working on the script.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:40.110
And I get a overnight
messenger thing from him.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.520
And it's a high-end
real estate magazine.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.200
And there's a
post-it on one page.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.780
And it's a post-it for a big
mansion in San Francisco.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.490
And it's like on Nob Hill
or somewhere like that.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.880
And he's undermining
the description

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.910
about it having an 11,000
square foot basement.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:27:59.580
And I said, yes.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.000
But see, that's a
mansion in San Francisco.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.460
This is a tract home
in Southern California.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.700
It still bothers me, he said.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.110
And then when I ended up cutting
30 pages out of the text,

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.390
out of 940.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.780
And we sent it off to them.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.250
And it went to typesetting.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.520
And when the typesetting
came, he said,

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.800
Dean I'm sending you the
typesetting tomorrow.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.700
And you'll proofread
the typesetting.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.880
And you just please
understand there's still

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.640
time to fix that
furnace problem.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:38.280
So at that point, and I
hated to dis an editor,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.830
so I tried to do it with humor.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.370
I wrote him back,
and I said, Alan,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.000
I've written a paragraph I hope
will fix the furnace problem.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.980
And this is the
paragraph I sent him.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.150
"In the garage was a furnace,
but not just any furnace.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.870
An immense furnace, a
huge bastard of a furnace,

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.100
so enormous that
natural gas needed

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.860
to operate it could have heated
the homes of 1,236 families.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.000
A furnace of such flagrant
excess and ungodly

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.120
dimensions that no room was
left in the garage for cars.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.330
A furnace so complex
in its engineering

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.820
and so formidable
in its mechanisms

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.950
that while performing
routine maintenance,

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.700
three repairmen had been killed.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.700
A furnace into which
a clever murderer

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.670
could jam the body
of his editor,

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.180
with every confidence
that no speck of evidence

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.430
would survive the flames."

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.220
And he came back to me
and said, point taken.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.250
And the furnace stayed in it.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.400
That book went on to be my
first hardcover best seller.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.310
And the next book
was "Watchers,"

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.200
which had a golden retriever
in it in a major way.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.350
And that book did
much, much better.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:51.450
And the next book, "Lightning,"
almost went to number one.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.090
And I could see
this progression.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.000
And it was very
exciting, because I

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.980
had been working for 20 or
more years, trying to get here.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.840
And very next book after that
was a book called "Midnight."

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.360
And it was my first
number one best seller.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.840
And this is absolutely true.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.270
My publisher, Phyllis Grann,
she was a very good publisher

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.430
for a certain kind of thing.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.260
I always irritated
her, because I

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.890
didn't do the same
book every time.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.080
And she really liked
publishing writers

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.720
who did the same book every
time, because it was a product

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.610
and she knew how to sell it.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.262
So we already were at
odds with each other.

00:30:28.262 --> 00:30:29.720
But I had a lot of
respect for her.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.594
And she called me up.

00:30:30.594 --> 00:30:33.370
And you learn about the best
seller list-- your first week,

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.170
you learn about it 10 days
before it appears in the "New

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.860
York Times," because the
book review comes out,

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.350
they have to print that earlier.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.040
And they do the calculation.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.290
So you find out early.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:47.951
And she called me up and said,
I have very wonderful news

00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:48.450
for you.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.440
You're going to debut
with this book at number

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.780
on in the "New York Times."

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.630
And before I could
say a thing, she

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.570
said, I just want
you to understand,

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.560
this will never
happen for you again.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.240
You do not write
the kind of books

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.010
that can go to number one.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.030
We had five number
ones in a row.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.130
And every time I
had a number one,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.410
she told me the same thing.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.120
And I'm a little slow,
but not that slow.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.640
I said, you know what, I
need a different publisher.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.870
And I moved on from there.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.010
So that's been
some of my career.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.880
And we want to leave time in
this for-- I can babble on--

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.840
but for some
question and answers.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.150
I assume you have
some questions.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.722
AUDIENCE: So
basically, I've been

00:31:29.722 --> 00:31:30.930
reading your books for years.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.100
I've really enjoyed them.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.270
And it's exciting when
a new one comes out.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.890
But one of the
things I like to do

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.820
when I go to talks by
authors that I really like

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.400
is ask them who they're reading.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.197
So do you have any people,
especially up-and-coming people

00:31:44.197 --> 00:31:46.530
who you think are writing
really good and exciting books

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.530
right now that I might use
to expand my reading list?

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:54.780
DEAN KOONTZ: I like this--
now I'm going to draw a blank.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.640
Michael Michael Koryta is a very
good suspense writer, young,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.020
starting up.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.590
I don't have a lot of time
at this point in my life

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.510
to read fiction like I used to.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.956
If you've read my
books, you know

00:32:07.956 --> 00:32:09.390
there's a lot of
research in them,

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:14.570
because I learned early that
if you screw up a detail,

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.570
there are people reading
you who will know that.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:17.694
And then they'll write you.

00:32:17.694 --> 00:32:20.520
And then you'll
feel like an idiot.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.360
Especially if it's a gun detail.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.380
Oh my, you will get mail.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.970
So I make sure all
detail in it is right.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.290
And I just tend to
be writing subjects.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.530
When I was a kid in
college and high school

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.200
and I had to go to the
library to research something,

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.630
I hated that.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.510
I hated research.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.720
This is mortifying to
admit now, but it's true.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.890
So in high school,
I would always

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.430
just-- when I had to do
a paper on something,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:51.630
I would make up the titles of
the books that I referenced.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.950
And I would make up the authors.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.390
And I'd assigned the book to
Doubleday or somebody else.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.940
And I'd cite the page
and chapter number.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.160
And nobody ever caught me at it.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.520
And I got good grades.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:10.500
And so I could have gone
into a life of crime.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.450
But when I went to
college, I fell in love

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:15.970
with pinochle in my
first year in college.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.107
And it turned out I
was pretty good at it.

00:33:18.107 --> 00:33:19.940
And I met this other
guy who was good at it.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.440
And we became the two to beat.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.730
So we'd have all-night
pinochle things.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.960
And I wouldn't
often go to class.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.620
And so I took up the habit
of faking my research papers.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.030
And I never got caught
at it in college either.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.540
You should never bring your
own children to one of my--

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:45.150
And then when I was a junior,
at the end of my junior year,

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.647
a professor of mine had
submitted a short story

00:33:47.647 --> 00:33:49.230
I'd written to the
"Atlantic Monthly,"

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:52.100
for the college writing
competition they did.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.050
And it won the
short story prize.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.090
And after that, I really
became a slacker in college,

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.640
because my final year was
nothing but English classes

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.850
and literature classes.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.170
And I was the first
person at the university

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.280
ever to win one of these.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.490
And I could do no wrong.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.980
It was just fabulous.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.620
So I played more pinochle
and made up more papers.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.270
But when I became a novelist
and I had to get it right,

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.929
I found out I loved research.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:25.230
And so now I do so much
of it, outside of Michael,

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:29.540
I love this-- she
writes kids books,

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.060
but adults will love
them-- Kate DiCamillo.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:37.310
And she has this book called
"The Tale of Despereaux,"

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.909
and another one.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.230
Adults will laugh their
heads off at these books.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.590
Kids do love them, but
there's humor in them

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:47.920
that only adults will get.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.610
For instance, she has this
one "The Incredible Journey

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:55.719
of Edward--" I can't
remember the second name.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.800
But Edwards is a
ceramic rabbit that's

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.850
clothed and has bendable
ears and is an antique doll.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:06.500
And he's not animated
like other kids.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.570
He thinks, but he can't
talk and he can't move.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:12.570
So Edward is simply
the victim of what

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.470
happens to him in his journeys.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.820
And it's hilarious and moving.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.550
And I just think she's great.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.000
And she writes books, "The
Magician's Elephant," a little

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.720
short book.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.580
And it's a wonderful,
absolutely wonderful book

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.060
about how our life-- and I
wrote a really long book called

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.220
"From the Corner
of His Eye," which

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.170
takes quantum mechanics,
spooky effect at a distance,

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:41.610
and says that that not only
works on the subatomic level,

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.830
it works in human relationships.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.760
Everything we do has spooky
effects at a distance.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.040
When we do something good in
our lives or something bad,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.550
it affects other people.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.009
It changes what they might
do to somebody else that day.

00:35:55.009 --> 00:35:56.800
And it ricochets through
everybody's lives.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.794
And years later, if
you are able to see it,

00:35:59.794 --> 00:36:02.210
you would see, if you were
able to pull back and look over

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:05.507
the years, how what you
did had this effect.

00:36:05.507 --> 00:36:07.340
You did it in Pittsburgh,
it had this effect

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.520
in San Diego three years later.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.790
I took like 800 pages of this.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.200
Kate DiCamillo does it
in this little kids' book

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.060
that any adult will
love it as well.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.130
So those are people.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.460
But mainly I read research
and philosophy these days.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:27.280
DEAN KOONTZ: Sorry,
that's a long answer.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:29.235
First I just wanted
to thank you,

00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:30.915
because I had
isolating childhood.

00:36:30.915 --> 00:36:34.640
And at age 13, I
read "Whispers."

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.390
And I escaped
through your books.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.670
And so I just wanted
to thank you for that.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:45.980
Also my question is, you are
one of if not the most prolific

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.760
author I've ever heard of.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.950
And it brings your
readers great joy

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.684
to be able to keep
reading stories,

00:36:52.684 --> 00:36:54.850
like you said, like your
publisher pointed out, that

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.520
aren't all the same.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.646
So I was wondering a little
bit about your process.

00:36:58.646 --> 00:37:00.520
I know everybody, when
they're falling asleep

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.680
has a million ideas.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.130
And I can't even imagine
someone who has so many ideas

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.850
they have the book
that you have.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.590
Do you have stuff just
come at you all the time,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.600
and you have to
process it in a way?

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.425
Or do you just sit down?

00:37:16.425 --> 00:37:18.550
DEAN KOONTZ: Each book is
different to some extent.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.480
Some I can tell you
where the book came from.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.850
And it was a struggle,
or it wasn't.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:31.250
I was coming home from a
meeting at a studio in LA

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.440
on a film development
project with a bunch

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.590
of studio executives.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.330
And you always come
out of those meetings

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.990
in a psychopathic frame of mind.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.480
And I had driven my wife's SUV.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.980
And so the deck was filled
with Simon &amp; Garfunkel,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.430
Because she likes that,
or Paul Simon on his own.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:55.090
And I was coming home, and
a song came up, "Patterns."

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:56.982
And there's a line
in it. "My life

00:37:56.982 --> 00:37:59.810
is made of patterns that
can scarcely be controlled."

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.930
And at that moment I thought,
there's a novel in that.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.200
Somebody knows that there's
a pattern of things going

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.810
to happen in his life, and
he has no control over them.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.500
What would that
mean in his life?

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.850
And in about 15
minutes, I had the idea

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.640
for this guy who's
an ordinary baker.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.740
And he comes from
a family of bakers.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.720
And they're proud of
their expertise as bakers.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.740
And the book would open
the night he was born.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:35.860
And his father would be in the
hospital to witness his birth,

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.920
but was also in the hospital
because his father's father is

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.720
dying after a stroke.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.270
And he's going back and
forth from death the birth

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:45.430
in the hospital.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:50.770
And in the fathers lounge,
expectant fathers lounge,

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.800
which in those days would
have done it a different way.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.090
Our lead's father is waiting
to be told he's been born.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:00.810
And the only other
person in there

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:04.340
is this angry, chain-smoking--
and when I was writing it,

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.680
I wrote clown.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.410
And I stopped.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.570
I never do outlines.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.250
So I just take a
premise and go with it.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:12.790
And I stopped and said, clown.

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.700
That's too ridiculous.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.430
And then I wrote him as what
an Emmett Kelly clown is.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.640
Not somebody with the giant
shoes, but a sad sack.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.090
Might have a funny
nose on, but he's

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.590
a different kind
of clown than that.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.840
And it turned out that if
I hadn't written clown,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.590
that novel would never
have been the novel

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.140
it was, because it
became everything.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.245
Because it became a
psychopathic family of clowns.

00:39:35.245 --> 00:39:39.120
And it's a comic novel
that's also a suspense novel.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.900
That wrote almost
itself, because I

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.500
was having so much fun.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.560
Certain other books are harder,
maybe because you're not

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.880
having as much fun.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.950
And then every great
once in a while,

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.090
you write one in a flow state.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.880
The reason prolific is because
I get up at quarter of 6:00

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.960
in the morning.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.120
I shower, walk the dog.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.420
I eat breakfast at the desk, and
I'm at the desk by, 7:00, 7:15.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.950
And I work through until dinner.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.690
And I do that at
least six days a week.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.750
If I'm on a deadline,
it goes to seven.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.340
And so there's a
lot of time put in.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.780
But if you get into a
flow state, which athletes

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:24.984
call being in the zone, I do,
like, 20 drafts a page or more.

00:40:24.984 --> 00:40:26.650
But I don't go on to
page two until I've

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.230
done that many on page one.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.760
I just refine it
until I feel that-- I

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.980
have a lot of self-doubt.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.300
So I have to feel
that the page is

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.340
really good before
I can move on.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.030
And I go through
a book that way.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.590
It's sort of like
coral reefs are

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.760
built with all these dead
little calcareous skeletons.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.470
And mine are done with all these
dead little abandoned sentences

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:52.510
that I've piled up
until the book is right.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.120
But there's some times that
I'll still do those drafts.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.780
But they fly by, because
you're in this place

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.450
that you can't make
yourself go to.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.640
And "Innocence" was
a book like that.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.090
"Innocence" just
flew. "Watchers"

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.090
was a book that had
a lot of that in it.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:11.290
So you're not in control.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.140
I say to young writers,
the best thing you can do--

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.320
and I have a lot of problem
with writers understanding, even

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.990
writers I know and respect.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.340
I say, I never
planned the character.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.290
I know a little bit about him.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.220
I know what his central
problem will be.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.760
And then I give him free will.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.480
God gave us free will to do
the right thing, wrong thing,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.290
screw up, not.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.440
And I give the
character free will.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.295
But people say,
but no you don't.

00:41:36.295 --> 00:41:37.545
You're creating the character.

00:41:37.545 --> 00:41:40.060
And I say, the
strangest thing happens.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:43.540
If you don't think it ahead,
and I don't think ahead

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.240
what's coming.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.280
I just let the characters
interact with each other.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.680
When I'm writing, if it's
comic element in the novel,

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.480
I'm often laughing
out loud in my office.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.260
At other times, I can
be moved to tears,

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.250
and be sitting there
crying at the typewriter.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:01.550
My assistant is here today.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.700
I think people who
work in the house who

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.970
pass my office door think I
should be in an institution.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:09.210
And there's many
other good arguments

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.810
for that, but not just this.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:12.490
But that's how I work.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:13.620
And it all gets done.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.870
And I'm always amazed that
there's a new book done.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.180
But it does.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.440
And I think you have
to love it to be

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.450
able to stay at it
all these years.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.500
And I do love it.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.715
I love the process.

00:42:23.715 --> 00:42:25.470
AUDIENCE: Well, we
love that you love it.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.320
We're always amazed
by the end product.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.800
And I'm halfway
through "Innocence."

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.882
I preordered it.

00:42:30.882 --> 00:42:31.590
I was like, yeah!

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:33.806
So thank you, so much.

00:42:33.806 --> 00:42:34.930
DEAN KOONTZ: No, thank you.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.830
You buy my shoes.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.595
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:38.595 --> 00:42:40.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming, and thank you

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.030
for telling us about
your writing process.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.590
I was interested in
what you had said

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.610
about your very early
research process.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:50.270
I'm just wondering if you could
maybe say a little bit more

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.680
about how you research now.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.610
I mean, it must
be very disruptive

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.120
compared to your
regular writing style.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.500
So can you tell us a little bit
more about how you research,

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.530
and how it's changed
over the years?

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:06.590
DEAN KOONTZ: Well, in many
ways, it hasn't changed for me.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.020
From the day I could start to
afford to buy hardcover books,

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.520
I went completely nuts.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.370
And if I was in a
bookstore and I saw a book

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:20.410
on a very bizarre subject,
you know, like-- I can't even

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:21.990
think of a bizarre
subject right now.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:25.440
But if I saw a reference
book that I thought,

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.510
I'll never see that subject
again, I would buy it,

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.200
until we got a
library that probably

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.040
has something like
70,000 books in it.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.650
And I built this library
that almost anything

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.970
I want to know about I've got
a number of books about it.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.520
Then this other thing
happened as books

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.910
became more and more successful.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.550
I would get letters from
readers in the mail.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:53.186
And some of them would be people
who say-- well, one example

00:43:53.186 --> 00:43:54.560
I can give, this
fellow wrote me,

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.940
and he was in the Marine Corps.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.200
And he taught actually
not just marines,

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.950
but helicopter pilots
in all the services.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.220
And he ran all the
simulators for them.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.390
And he said to me, if you ever
need a military helicopter

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.960
in this and you
want to know what

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.050
it's like, I can
give you details.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.140
And also you can come and
run through the simulator.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.940
So at that point,
I realized there's

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.300
some value in keeping
a drawer in my office

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.580
where I just keep all these
people with specialized

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.530
knowledge.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:26.370
And there's nothing better
than calling somebody like that

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:28.310
and asking him,
or going and being

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.450
put through the simulator, which
I crashed over and over again.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.820
And it's why I don't fly.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.830
I think even as a passenger
I'm going to crash the plane.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:42.080
But I don't go online
to do the research.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.080
Because you'd be amazed at
what computer I'm working on.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.450
I'm on DOS yet.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:49.770
And the reason is I
have to first Windows.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.570
Isn't that Windows?

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.110
First Windows.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.540
And I didn't like Windows.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.950
I liked the word
processing enormously.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:59.510
That's all I do on it,
is write letters or text.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.770
I didn't want to be
going through Windows.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:05.430
And Linda, my assistant,
took Windows out of it.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.670
Well, in later versions, you
couldn't take the Windows out

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.170
of it.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:12.185
So now I'm still
working-- I still

00:45:12.185 --> 00:45:14.860
have that logic unit,
as they called them.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.300
I still have one
of those towers.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.940
We have a spare
in the other room.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.170
I have a new keyboard,
but new keyboards

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.760
won't work with my
antique arrangement.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.730
So we have one that will,
if that one breaks down,

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:30.950
and a printer that will work,
and another one to back it up.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:34.450
And I'm so stick
in the mud, I don't

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.500
want to learn new software,
which will slow down

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.750
my writing more than
the research would.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.910
So I just want to stay with it.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.620
And when someday
it all explodes,

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.890
then my career is over.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.330
Or I have to learn
a new software.

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:51.350
I did an interview with Anthony
Mason for CBS "Sunday Morning."

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.252
And he's a wonderful
interviewer.

00:45:53.252 --> 00:45:54.960
And they were there
for a couple of days.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.340
And the second day, we
walked into my office.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.500
And they hadn't seen it.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.200
And he looked, and he said,
what the hell is that?

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.140
And I said to him, it's
amazing it isn't steam driven,

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:09.410
given how anti-technology-- not
anti-technology, but how slow

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.760
I am to pick up technology.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.710
So if I want to use the
internet now for research,

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.826
I go to Linda over
there and say Linda,

00:46:15.826 --> 00:46:16.950
here's what I need to know.

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:21.280
And it's amazing to me how
quickly she gets it to me.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.770
So I know it must be an
amazing world out there,

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.250
but my world is inner.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.200
Fiction is a very
internal thing,

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.590
and you have to get lost
in yourself to write it.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:34.330
And yes, you also have to
love people and the world.

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:35.900
But when you're
writing it, you have

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.230
to separate yourself from that.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:42.290
And I have to turn off the
world when I'm doing it.

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:46.270
And as Linda will
testify, it gets

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:49.930
so bad toward the
last few weeks of it

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:52.290
that I'll get up in the
morning, and I'll forget.

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.620
For like three
days, I won't shave.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.602
I won't shower.

00:46:55.602 --> 00:46:57.560
I'll think I showered
yesterday, but I haven't.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.460
I pull on a baseball cap.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.540
And I go down.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.700
And what does everybody
in the house call it?

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.120
LINDA: I call it troll mode.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.130
DEAN KOONTZ: Troll mode
is what she calls it.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.090
And I probably pretty
much look like a troll

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:09.050
by the end of that.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.820
But I get so caught up in it,
I just want to get back to it

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.976
with no interruption when
I'm right at the end.

00:47:15.976 --> 00:47:17.350
That's as much as
I can tell you.

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.760
Although I will say
there's one other change.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.830
A lot of what I do
now with research

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.020
is not researching anything.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.470
More and more, I've been
reading all kind of philosophy,

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.610
because philosophy can drive
different kind of ideas,

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:33.590
then you get other ways.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.049
And it can drive the
sort of subtext of books

00:47:36.049 --> 00:47:37.840
in ways you wouldn't
otherwise think about.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.300
So there was this
sociologist but philosopher

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.860
called Phillip "Reef" or Rieff.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.959
He was out of Princeton.

00:47:44.959 --> 00:47:46.500
I've never heard
his name pronounced.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.958
And he's written
a number of books.

00:47:47.958 --> 00:47:49.040
Died not too long ago.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.670
And they're cultural criticism,
but they're also philosophy.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.280
I have gotten numerous ideas
out of just reading those books.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.230
They're very difficult, but
they're also very illuminating.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.400
So that's it.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:03.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.470
DEAN KOONTZ: We probably
have some time for a few more

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.969
questions.

00:48:05.969 --> 00:48:07.537
We don't want to--

00:48:07.537 --> 00:48:08.370
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dean.

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:08.710
How you doing?

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.270
Thanks for coming
out and seeing us.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.750
But seeing around here
all the golden retrievers,

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.250
I think this is going to be
a very relevant question.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.730
The first book I actually ever
read in my life was "Watchers."

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.220
|t was given to be my mother.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.490
And I think I was
around 10 years old.

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.100
And I think my question
I have for that

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.620
is-- this is more particular.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.450
Where did the idea for the
antagonist, a creature,

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.910
as well as the other
antagonist, like Vince Nasco,

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.230
where did that stuff come from?

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:41.620
And I'm assuming since
you're a dog lover, that

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.100
fueled the Einstein
portions of the book.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.680
But my main question is where
did that book in its entirety

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.810
come from?

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:53.690
DEAN KOONTZ: That goes
back such a long way now.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.950
People assume I had golden
retrievers, or I had dogs.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:00.520
I didn't.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.670
I'd never had.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:03.700
When I was a kid,
my father got a dog

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.155
for a very short period of time.

00:49:05.155 --> 00:49:08.040
He was going to teach
to be a hunting dog.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.125
He kept it on a
chain in the yard.

00:49:10.125 --> 00:49:11.500
It's the worst
thing you could do

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.060
for a dog is tie it up outside.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.610
They're pack animals.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.900
And the dog only lasted a
week, because I went out

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.580
to play with it, and it
was so enthusiastic it

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.960
wrapped its chain
around my neck.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.741
And if my mother
hadn't looked out,

00:49:22.741 --> 00:49:24.240
it probably would
have strangled me.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.090
Because when she came out
and managed to get it off,

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:31.060
for days, I had the imprints of
chain lengths around my throat.

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.399
And then we had a little dog
for a week or so that somebody

00:49:35.399 --> 00:49:37.315
gave us because they
couldn't take care of it.

00:49:37.315 --> 00:49:39.420
And it died shortly thereafter.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.500
So I'd never had a dog.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.900
But I loved golden retrievers.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.870
And I had an aunt who
didn't have a retriever,

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:45.130
but a dog I loved.

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:46.210
And I just loved dogs.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:49.440
And where the idea came
from that I would write

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.800
a novel about genetic
experiments and enhanced

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.182
intelligence, and they
would be working on a dog,

00:49:55.182 --> 00:49:56.640
and it would be a
golden retriever,

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.780
I can't tell you
where that came from.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.890
But I do know that
because you have

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:05.490
to have conflict in
any work of fiction,

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.730
it came to me pretty quickly
that this same outfit might

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:12.680
have been doing experiments
on a new kind of soldier

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.560
for the battlefield.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.920
It would be a
genetically-engineered creature

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.590
it would be completely obedient,
just a killing machine.

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.040
And then that these two would
be too smart for the people who

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.880
built them and made them,
this very intelligent

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.520
golden retriever with
human-level intelligence

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:31.440
and this creature
would both escape.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.180
And the creature
hates the golden,

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.550
because everybody loved the
golden and everybody was

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:37.170
fearful of the creature.

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.710
And then the idea that
the creature-- you know,

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.150
this Frankenstein monster
is pretty pathetic

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:44.770
when you actually look,
especially in the movies.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:46.942
There's this pathos in it.

00:50:46.942 --> 00:50:49.400
And I thought this should be
this very frightening monster,

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.650
but it should also be
something that when

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:54.510
you get to the end of it,
you have such pity for it,

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.630
you almost hate to
see it be killed.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:04.940
And then when it comes
to my human bad people--

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.820
the question or
the thing-- my wife

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.540
used to go to book
signings a lot.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.870
And I never knew
why she would put up

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.650
with this, because
sometimes there

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:17.450
will be 2,000 people
in line, and it would

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.460
take seven hours or eight hours.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.980
And she would stand beside
me and open the book

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.540
to the right page,
or fold it to me.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.820
And at one point, I said
to her, I know what it is.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.952
You think if one of them
turns out to have a gun,

00:51:29.952 --> 00:51:31.910
you want to be there to
take it away from them.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.720
Because you know I'm
not capable of it.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.850
And she said, that's part of it.

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:39.270
My wife's 5 foot 2", but you'll
agree she could probably do it.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:44.044
But people at those
books signings

00:51:44.044 --> 00:51:45.960
would say to her-- the
one question most often

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:50.130
was, his villains-- how
do you sleep at night?

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:53.565
Because they think all this
is actually part of who I am.

00:51:53.565 --> 00:51:57.950
And maybe it is, but so
far I haven't acted on it.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.750
Having grown up in
a house-- my dad

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.940
lived-- he drank a
fifth a day, plus beers.

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.580
He smoked three to four
packs of cigarettes a day.

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:11.430
He ate a very high-fat diet.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.000
He did everything wrong
you can imagine in a life.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.550
My mother died at 53.

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.620
My father died at 83.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.360
And he was healthy up until
the last couple years.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.840
But he began to develop
degenerative alcohol syndrome,

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.630
which is the hollow
spaces in your brain

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:34.780
that are filled with fluid and
serve a purpose in your brain

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.980
begin to enlarge.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.350
People with this begin
to lose brain tissue.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:43.150
And my father later in life
was diagnosed as a sociopath.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:47.755
He'd been diagnosed as a
borderline schizophrenic

00:52:47.755 --> 00:52:50.820
with tendencies to violence,
complicated by alcoholism,

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.230
which is a very bad thing.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:56.770
That he didn't get diagnosed
until he was in his mid

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:58.920
to late 70s.

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.570
Then one day a friend
of my father's called.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.360
I'm a little off the
subject, but not.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.146
I'll get back to it.

00:53:07.146 --> 00:53:09.980
A fishing buddy of my
father's called me up.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.880
We had moved to California.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.290
And finally we
didn't have to worry

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:16.390
that there would be a
pounding on our door at 2:00

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:20.087
in the morning and it
would my father, drunk.

00:53:20.087 --> 00:53:21.670
But we were out here
less than a year.

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:26.490
Then a friend of his called
up and said, he's destitute.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.810
Which he always was.

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:29.520
And you could send
him money, and he

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.811
wouldn't have it the next
day, because he'd go to a bar

00:53:31.811 --> 00:53:33.360
and buy drinks for everybody.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.860
And he said, he's destitute.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.530
And he's in terrible health.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.310
He's not going to last a year.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:42.490
So my wife and I sat down and
had to figure out what to do.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:45.120
And it was the hardest
decision of my life,

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.810
but we decided we couldn't.

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:49.375
He was never there
for me and my mother.

00:53:49.375 --> 00:53:52.140
And my wife was
a saint for this.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.780
She knew what she
was getting into.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.920
We moved him west, got him
an apartment, paid his bills.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.880
But we said, this
is only for a year.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.640
He lived 14 years.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.990
And it was 14 very bad years.

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:10.300
But my wife dealt with
it in a fabulous way.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.840
But I grew up with this
example of evil in their life.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.760
I mean, my father was
a pathological liar.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.530
He would lie to you
sitting across the table

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.400
from you, knowing
you know he's lying.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.390
And he'd get this
smile on his face,

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:27.940
just to see how long
you'd put up with this.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.950
And there was no reason
not to put up with it,

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:33.270
because all he'd do if you
called him on it was explode.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.620
And he'd cause a scene.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.420
And when we'd take him out
on Father's Day for dinner,

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.130
we'd go to a restaurant and
we'd be sitting across from him.

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.780
And he'd start
things like telling

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.860
Gerda about my uncle Ned.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.330
Now, I don't have an uncle Ned.

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.910
And Gerda, the first time
this happened, she kind of

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.610
looked at me.

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:54.850
And she said, I didn't
know you had an uncle Ned.

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:57.110
And I though, oh, just wait.

00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:59.320
My father would go into all
these stories about him.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.680
And they'd be colorful stories.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.846
And at some point, Gerda
would start to get it.

00:55:03.846 --> 00:55:05.220
And I could see
when she'd start.

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.420
Oh, no.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.560
None of this is true.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.610
Well, when you grew up
with all that and saw it,

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:14.240
I just have an
understanding of people

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.980
who are that way, who'd rather
lie than tell the truth,

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.030
even if telling the truth
would be better for them.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:24.020
And when he was
diagnosed as a sociopath,

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.220
it was after he made
an attempt on my life

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.520
in front of a bunch of
witnesses with a knife.

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.700
And you had to go into
a psychiatric ward.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.540
And he later ended
up-- we got him

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.620
on anti-psychotic medication.

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.250
And they were able to take
him into a retirement home

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:43.870
setting which had
nurses, so that he would

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.570
get the anti-psychotics
every day.

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:47.960
And he was there a year.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.710
And there was a
trouble, but he was

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:52.650
the best behaved he'd ever been.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:56.380
But when they called me up--
the doctor in the psych ward

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.600
called me up after
he'd been in there.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:03.400
And he said, are you able
to talk about your father?

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.650
And I said, sure.

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.590
And he said, would
this be painful to you.

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:09.430
And I said, not talking about.

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.840
Living through it was painful.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.090
And he said, tell me
about your father.

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:17.020
And I said, well,
what you want me to--?

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.610
He said, no, let me tell you
some things about your father.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:22.230
When you were
young, he threatened

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:23.940
to kill you and your
mother, didn't he?

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.700
And I said, oh
yeah, all the time.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.660
And he said, and you believed he
would do that sooner or later.

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:30.430
And I said, oh yeah.

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:32.380
I'm amazed he never did.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.740
And he said, your father
was never a religious man.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:36.340
No.

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.190
And he said, but when things
went really bad for him,

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.330
he'd go buy a Bible, and he'd
sit reading it by the hour.

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:45.610
And he'd make you
read it with him.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.350
It was like this man
had been in our home.

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:50.840
And he went through behavior
after behavior like this.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.590
And they were all things
that my father had done.

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.960
And I said, you're about
to tell me something.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.850
You know what my father is.

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.230
And I've been told he's a
borderline schizophrenic

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:04.700
with tendencies to violence,
complicated by alcoholism.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.190
And he said, no, your
father is a sociopath.

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:11.610
He has no ordinary
feelings, as we,

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.600
but he's very good
at faking them.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.160
And it was one of
the most-- it may

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.030
be the most amazing
moment of my life.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.140
All of this stuff clicked.

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.270
All of the things
you wondered about,

00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:24.370
you couldn't understand
why these things happened,

00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:26.680
why somebody would be that way.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.140
It just suddenly clicked.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.650
You're living with Hannibal
Lecter, except he never

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:31.890
went that far.

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:32.970
He was always in fights.

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.920
He ended up in jail
a number of times.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.270
And he was very violent.

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:40.430
But it never went
that extra step.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:44.210
And so we were very fortunate.

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:48.030
But that's where I have this
affinity, which people tell me

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:51.880
I do, to write really
bad, bad characters.

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.550
And I do research on that, too.

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:55.950
The character and the
intensity is actually

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:59.020
based on a genuine
serial killer.

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.890
And I had to tame it down.

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:03.870
Because if I had written
what this guy really did,

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:06.110
nobody would want
to read about it.

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:11.120
So it's life experience,
but also research again.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.590
So did that answer
your question?

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:14.881
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's interesting
because the worse that

00:58:14.881 --> 00:58:17.486
character does, the stronger
he gets, presumably.

00:58:17.486 --> 00:58:18.360
He perceives himself.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:18.830
We don't know.

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:21.330
You write it in such a way where
you don't know if he's just

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:23.960
crazy, or he's got some
supernatural ability to absorb

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.602
people's--

00:58:24.602 --> 00:58:26.560
DEAN KOONTZ: I'm trying
to lead you along that.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.170
But he's not.

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.222
He just thinks
he's supernatural.

00:58:29.222 --> 00:58:31.180
AUDIENCE: But you could
interpret it both ways.

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:34.360
But I always thought it was
just him being a psychopath.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:39.000
And the worse I do, the
more innocent the victim,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.501
the stronger I get.

00:58:40.501 --> 00:58:42.750
DEAN KOONTZ: I'll tell you
one funny thing about that.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:46.260
Well, I think it's funny.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.420
He's a particularly
nasty character.

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.250
And there's a point in the book
where he kills a scientist.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:55.120
He's assigned to kill
these people who's

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.390
been involved in this.

00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:01.160
And he kills this woman
scientist with a hammer.

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.240
And I do not write gore.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:03.880
I just don't.

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.960
I never have.

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.089
And I would have people come
up in book signings to me

00:59:09.089 --> 00:59:10.380
and say, oh, I love your books.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.680
But when it gets
to the gory scenes,

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.700
sometimes I just I can't.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.650
And I'd say, the gory scenes?

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:18.340
Tell me one.

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.980
I heard this awhile.

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:25.110
And often, when I would
start to ask where,

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:26.920
I found out it was
the same scene, often.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:30.060
And it was this hammer
scene in "Watchers."

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:34.750
And I'd say to them, how
long do you think that is?

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:38.370
How long is it from the
moment he picks up the hammer

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:39.680
until she's dead.

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.410
How many words?

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:41.430
How many paragraphs?

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:44.220
And the answer would
always be, oh, it's

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.790
like two or four pages,
or something like that.

00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:49.784
And I said, no, he tells
her what he's going to do.

00:59:49.784 --> 00:59:51.450
And then he undresses
because he doesn't

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:53.080
want to get blood
on his clothes.

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.210
And we know he's crazy.

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:59.510
But from the moment he picks up
hammer until he's killed her,

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:04.260
it says, "The first
blow struck her kneecap.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.270
80 blows later, she dead."

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.380
That's all.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:11.080
But in your mind, you're
seeing the other 80 blows

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.320
to some extent, that's
how the mind works.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.530
You imagine it.

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:16.660
And so you don't
have to do the gore.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.900
You just have to set
the situation up and let

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.850
the imagination of
the reader take it.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.840
But it's interesting
you brought that up,

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.590
because that's the
one that often people

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.410
find that just too chilling.

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.720
AUDIENCE: It's a chilling
book, but if you are dog lover,

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.120
it's something very special
about friendship and connection

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.319
to an animal or to,
particularly, dogs.

01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:39.860
That's why I connect with it so
much, because I love animals.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.055
I love animals and dogs.

01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:43.080
DEAN KOONTZ: The book is
ultimately about love,

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:47.530
and love for each other
and for the animals.

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:50.090
You have to go through hell
to get to the love part.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.730
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
give the golden retrievers

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.362
a shout out for that.

01:00:54.362 --> 01:00:55.320
DEAN KOONTZ: Thank you.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.310
You were great.

01:00:56.310 --> 01:01:03.132
