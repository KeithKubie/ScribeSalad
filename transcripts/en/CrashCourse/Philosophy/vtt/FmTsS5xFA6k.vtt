00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.060
It’s about time that we had a serious talk
about religion.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.880
The philosophy of religion is often confused with theology, which makes sense, because they both take God and religion as their subjects.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.220
But theology starts by assuming that God exists,
and then figures out what follows.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.100
Or theology might try to solve philosophical problems that might arise from a belief in God.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.420
But one thing that’s never on the table
in theology is simply not believing in God.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.160
Atheism is not an option.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.170
This is what separates the philosophical study
of religion from the theological.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.870
Philosophers take nothing as a given – and
that includes religious belief.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.020
Everything is on the table, and everything
needs an argument.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.240
So, no area of belief is sacred, and that means even your sacred beliefs are going to need to be examined, and evidence will need to be given.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.620
Some people say religion is the one area where you don’t need arguments – that faith alone is enough.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.240
But philosophers don’t take faith for an
answer.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.440
After all, I might have faith that the moon
is made of green cheese. So what?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.960
Faith is definitionally unprovable, which makes it,
from a philosophical perspective, not valuable.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.880
So, if you’re a theist, now’s the time to offer some justification for your religious beliefs.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.220
And if you’re an atheist, it’s time for
you to pay attention too.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.500
No one’s off the hook – we all need to pay attention to these arguments, because religion is hugely important.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.840
Can you think of many things that have been as influential in shaping history than religious belief?

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.000
Probably not. So if we can get to the
bottom of it, we should.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.120
[Theme Music]

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.840
I’ll get to God in a minute.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.119
But first I want to go over a few other things
that the philosophy of religion is not:

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.969
It’s not about believing whatever your parents
taught you.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.840
Because that doesn’t prove anything about
the truth of a religious belief.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.280
If how you were raised proved something about religious truth, then every religion – and therefore also no religion – would be true.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.300
So, how you were raised can give you a reason that you hold a certain belief, but it says nothing whatsoever about its truth.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.620
Philosophy of religion is also not the study of the Bible, because you can’t use what’s written in a book to prove the truth of the book.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.899
You need outside evidence.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.200
There’s a whole area of scholarship devoted to understanding the Bible, by considering the time and place in which it was written.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.450
And such study can be very helpful in understanding
certain things about religion.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.990
But it doesn’t help us here.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.060
Philosophy of religion is also not religious anthropology, or religious sociology, or a psychological understanding of our reasons for religious belief.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.400
Those are all things you can study, but they
are not what we’re studying here.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.600
What we are doing is considering whether we can offer arguments in support of belief in God’s existence.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.420
And a long time ago, there was a man who argued that God’s existence is provable: 11th century French monk Anselm of Canterbury.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.520
He offered a deductive argument for the existence of God, based on what he understood to be the nature of God’s being, or the definition of God.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.080
Because the study of being is called ontology, this argument, and others like it, are called ontological arguments.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.760
Now: What do you think God is like?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.080
Long, flowing white beard, robe to match?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.520
Nice guy, hard to reach on the phone?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.400
Well, Anselm aimed a little bit higher.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.680
In fact, he thought that God is, by definition,
the best possible thing we can imagine.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.580
THE. BEST. THING.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.000
Just try to think of the coolest, awesomest,
most amazing and wonderful thing you can imagine.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.019
And whatever you’re thinking of, Anselm
said that God is better.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.239
He’s just the best.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.940
In Anselm’s words, God is “that than which
no greater can be conceived.”

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.280
So what does that mean?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.970
Well, it means God must exist, according to
Anselm.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.630
After all, he pointed out, there are just
two ways in which something can exist.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.820
Something can exist only in our minds and
be strictly imaginary – like Santa, or unicorns.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.780
Or it can exist in our minds but also in reality, like pizza and horses – something that we can imagine, but that’s also real.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.080
Anselm pointed out – and he does appear to be right about this – that any good thing would be better if it existed in reality as well as in our minds.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.680
I mean: unicorns.
They’re pretty great.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.050
But wouldn’t they be better if they were
real?

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.100
Or the perfect romantic partner: smart, funny, hot, likes the same movies and games that you do? Pretty rich?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.240
Would be pretty nice in your mind, but EVEN
BETTER if they actually existed.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.780
Well Anselm thought so too.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.280
And from there, he believed he could prove
God’s existence.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.579
Because, if we define God as the greatest thing we can conjure up in our minds, the only thing that could possibly be greater than him would be – a real version!

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.560
And since we’re already imagining the greatest thing possible, there can’t be anything better.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.540
Therefore, God has to exist, both in my imagination
and in reality!

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.360
Anselm was sure he had done it – deductively proven God’s existence in a way that was immune to error.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.260
Here it is, one more time,
laid out as a philosophical argument:

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.220
God is the greatest thing we can think of.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.000
Things can exist only in our imaginations,
or they can also exist in reality.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.340
Things that exist in reality are always better
than things that exist only in our imaginations.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.220
If God existed only in our imaginations, he wouldn’t be the greatest thing that we can think of, because God in reality would be better.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.120
Therefore, God must exist in reality.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.260
Anselm thought this was a tidy little argument.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.980
But one of his contemporaries, a fellow French
monk named Gaunilo, wasn’t satisfied.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.940
He suggested that we could run the same line of reasoning to prove the existence of literally anything we can imagine.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.740
He came up with an argument with the exact same formal structure as Anselm’s, to prove that a mythical Lost Island exists.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.140
He proposed: The best island I can imagine is one where I can swim and relax on a tropical beach and ski down snow-covered mountains all in one afternoon.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.270
I can imagine it, so it must exist.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.340
Otherwise, it wouldn’t be the best island – there would be one better and that one would have to be real!

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.780
Basically, Gaunilo said, you could make the same kind of argument to prove the existence of whatever you wanted most – but it wouldn’t make it real.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:42.140
Anselm responded to Gaunilo’s criticism by saying he’d missed the point, that the argument only works for necessary beings, of which there is only one – God.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.500
Folks, what we have right here is a classic example of the fallacy known as begging the question.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.660
A fallacy is a flaw in reasoning, something
that weakens or destroys an argument.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.140
And when you beg the question, you assume the very thing you’re trying to prove with your argument.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:03.220
By adding this idea of “a necessary being” to his definition of God, Anselm makes God’s existence a part of the definition of God.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:10.540
A necessary being is one that must exist, so Anselm’s response assumed the very point of contention to be true – that God exists!

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.500
Other philosophers since Anselm have tried to save his argument by tweaking it in various ways, and dissenters have continued trying to deflate them.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.860
One of the most famous objections came hundreds of years after Anselm’s time, from the 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.380
Kant offered the point that, as he put it,
“existence is not a predicate.”

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.920
A predicate is just something that’s said
of another object.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:37.200
And Kant thought Anselm’s mistake was in thinking that existence is something that can be predicated upon a thing, or be used as a defining characteristic.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.560
For example, if a triangle exists, it necessarily
has 3 sides.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.140
But it could be that no triangle exists at
all.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.500
Because the idea of existence isn’t part
of how we define a triangle.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.360
Likewise, Kant would say, if God exists, then he must be the greatest being we can imagine – but that doesn’t mean that he does exist.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.600
Predicates add to the essence of their subjects, Kant explained, but they can’t be used to prove their existence.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.820
British philosopher John Wisdom came up with a thought exercise that sounds a lot like like a debate over an ontological argument.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.500
It’s called The Parable of The Invisible Gardener, which brings us to this week’s Flash Philosophy.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.840
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.460
Person A and Person B return to a garden after a long absence, and notice that a few of its plants are still thriving.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.320
Person A says, a gardener must have been tending
the garden while they were gone.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.660
Person B doubts this is true, so they agree
to wait and see if a gardener shows up.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.960
After some time passes, they see no one, so
Person A says: “The gardener must be invisible!”

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.830
So, they put up traps and bring in bloodhounds
to catch him.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.010
When no one is found, Person A says the gardener
must be intangible as well as unsmellable.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:44.040
To which “B” replies: “What’s the difference between an invisible, intangible, unsmellable, entirely undetectable gardener and no gardener at all?”

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.260
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.380
Can you guess who A and B are really talking
about?

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.880
To give you a sense of just how long this
back-and-forth has been going on among philosophers

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.740
– trying to either prove or disprove the
existence of God –

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:00.080
John Wisdom came up with this parable in 1944, nearly a thousand years after Anselm and Gaunilo.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.820
Today we introduced a new area of philosophy
– philosophy of religion.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.320
And we learned about Anselm’s argument for God’s existence, while also considering objections to that argument.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:16.120
An important point to note here is that both Gaunilo and Kant agreed with Anselm’s conclusion – they also believed in God’s existence.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.480
They just thought Anselm’s argument didn’t
prove it.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.960
So remember, you can think an argument fails,
even if you accept the conclusion.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.520
When this happens, you should look for a better
argument in favor of your conclusion.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.340
This is exactly what Thomas Aquinas did, and
we’ll consider him next time.
