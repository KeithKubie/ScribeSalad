[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.840
DAWN ENGLE: My name
is Dawn Gifford Engle.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.750
And my husband
and I 23 years ago

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.510
decided to start
something called PeaceJam.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.820
And it's our program which
allows young people to connect

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.040
with Nobel Peace Prize
winners, and to learn

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.660
how to become
leaders themselves,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.280
and to change the world.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.420
And we have been
going for 21 years.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.960
We have 1.3 million
young people who've

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.850
participated in our program.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.290
And we're all over the world.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.630
So it sounds like
a big thing, right?

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.730
That's our mission.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.850
But when we started, it was
just a couple of factory worker

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.200
kids from Detroit.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.150
Ivan and I are just a
couple of factory worker

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.230
kids from Detroit.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.970
And he had a big idea.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.920
And his big idea came out
of a summer of violence

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160
in Denver, Colorado, a
lot of gang violence.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.600
And he is a passionate
Bulgarian, wild man, artist,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.010
the former lead singer of a punk
rock band called The Ramrods--

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.500
who are still
infamous in Detroit,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
so you can only imagine how
over the top they were--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.340
and writer for "CREEM" magazine.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.710
And he's very artistic.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
And he as an artist was living
in the worst part of Denver

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.440
and a place where there
was a lot of gang violence

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.940
that summer.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.460
The newspapers called it
the "summer of violence."

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.670
And 13-year-olds were killing
14-year-olds, drive-by

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.570
shootings-- it was bad.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.820
And one day he saw somebody
in his neighborhood--

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.010
young kid, 14 years
old-- carrying a gun.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.040
And he called the kid and
his friends over and he said,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.070
what's going on?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.070
You're not in school anymore.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.930
I see you during the day.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.690
What's going on?

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.690
And they said, well,
we have a business

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.119
and we have a turf to protect.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.660
And he goes, OK,
you have a business,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.937
maybe it's selling drugs.

00:01:56.937 --> 00:01:58.770
If you have a business,
you have to be smart

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.240
and you need to be in school.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.614
And they said, no, we're out
of school, we don't care.

00:02:03.614 --> 00:02:06.280
He was really worried about them
so he kept talking and he said,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.988
who's the President
of the United States?

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:09.479
And they said, I
don't know, and I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.970
don't care because he
doesn't represent us.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.350
They were really disengaged.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.760
But he kept talking to them.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.860
He was so worried, he
kept talking, and talking,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.320
and they stumbled over
the topic of South Africa,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.080
because the miracle in South
Africa had just happened,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.450
this peaceful transfer
of power in South Africa

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.320
had just happened.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.750
And these young
people, they knew all

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.140
about Desmond Tutu,
Nelson Mandela.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.280
They went off.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.740
They went on and on about
how inspiring they were,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.590
and they stood up to
the man, and they did it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.030
without violence, and they
got their country back.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.660
And Ivan just had this big
light bulb go off over his head

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.660
and he said, wow--

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.170
if we can put young people
together with Nobel Peace Prize

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.110
winners, maybe
that energy that's

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.490
going in a negative
direction, it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.810
can go in a positive direction.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.630
Maybe their lives
can be transformed.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.760
Nobel Peace Prize winners
who are walking the talk,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.060
putting their lives on the line
for peace around the world,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.950
these should be the role models
that these young people have.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.270
And so he came and he
started talking to me.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.600
And he started talking
to me because I'm

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.920
like the opposite of Ivan.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.410
I'm very linear.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.820
I'm an economist.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.712
I worked for Congress
for 13 years.

00:03:19.712 --> 00:03:21.420
I was the youngest
woman ever to be chief

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.130
of staff for a US senator.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.267
And when I was in
Washington, D.C.,

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:26.850
I was one of the
very first volunteers

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.310
for the International
Campaign for Tibet.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.290
So I knew the Dalai Lama.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.450
So he came and said, we have
to meet with the Dalai Lama,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.950
we have to meet
with the Dalai Lama,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.540
get us a meeting
with the Dalai Lama.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.457
And he kept talking,
and talking, and talking

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:40.290
about this big idea.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.230
And finally I said,
OK, I will do it.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.270
We got the meeting
with the Dalai Lama.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.040
And Ivan said, great,
when is the Dalai

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.150
Lama coming to Denver?

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.310
And I said, no, no, no, no.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.380
No, we have to go to India.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.390
And he said, I have $1.72
in my checking account--

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.380
which was true.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.470
So we had to borrow
money from friends.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.950
And we went and flew to India.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.319
The Dalai Lama loved the idea.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.860
And he said, don't
just work with me,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.776
though, work with these
other Nobel laureates.

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:11.670
He gave us a list
of seven others.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.270
And we went back to
Ivan's artist's loft

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.740
in Denver with no heat, asbestos
hanging out of the ceiling,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.540
we've got our coats
on, it's cold.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.570
But we have a big
idea, and a telephone,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.340
and the Dalai Lama said yes.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.970
So we just colcalled the rest of
the Nobel Peace Prize winners,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.140
honest and truly.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.780
Hey, Desmond Tutu, this is Dawn
from Denver, you don't know me

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.700
but we have a big idea and
the Dalai Lama said yes.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.910
And we were able to get eight
Nobel Peace Prize winners

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.570
to say yes to be our board.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.430
Before we were
incorporated, before we

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.980
had any money, before
we had a curriculum,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.540
before we had
anything we were just

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.750
two people who were so
on fire with this idea

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.030
that we got eight Nobel
Peace Prize winners

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.120
to agree to be our board.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.060
And we asked them 10 years
later at our 10th anniversary,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.600
why did you say yes to us?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.310
And they said, well,
it was a good idea

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.742
but it was a really hard idea.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.700
No one had ever brought
all the Nobel laureates

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.080
together like that before.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.830
And I figured if
anybody could do it,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.800
it was those two
crazy Americans who

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.570
had been sitting on
my front porch step

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.690
for a week waiting
for a meeting with me.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.120
And it's an example that
we give to young people

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.950
because passion matters, ideas
matter, being tenacious really

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.820
matters.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.390
And as you see here,
we ended up actually

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.110
being married by Desmond Tutu.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.870
We were friends,
we were colleagues,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.140
we started doing PeaceJam,
and we fell in love,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.450
and Desmond Tutu
married us in his church

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.281
in Cape Town, South Africa.

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:46.530
And then at the end of the
service, he pulled us aside

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.290
and he said, now, people who I
marry, they never get divorced.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.930
So it was like, yes, sir.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.424
So we are stuck with each
other for all of eternity,

00:05:54.424 --> 00:05:55.840
but we're really
happy about that.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.100
We're very, very
happily married.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.600
And and we're a great team.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.420
And we've now ourselves
been nominated 17 times

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.330
for the Nobel Peace Prize,
so pretty incredible.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.390
And this is what we've
been able to do so far.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.750
It's almost up to 1.3
million young people

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.970
who have participated in
our yearlong programming.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.700
What happens is young people
study the life of a Nobel Peace

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.130
Prize winner, they
look at what's

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.010
going on in their own community,
they create a project that

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.780
makes things better
in their own community

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.940
or in some other
part of the world,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.022
they get to spend a weekend
working side-by-side

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:31.230
with this Nobel Peace Prize
winner whose life they've

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.320
studied and presented
them their project.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.820
Then they go out
and do the project,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.830
they gather again
six months later,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.760
and the cycle goes
on year after year.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.590
So it's education, which is our
curriculum; inspiration, which

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.020
is the Nobel Peace
Prize winners;

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.130
an action, the most
important part.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.050
It's easy to come
up with a good idea,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.880
it's hard to
implement a good idea.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.460
So we teach those skills so
that young people can become

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.560
empowered agents of change.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.990
And we have-- oh,
the slide needs

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.130
to be updated-- we're up
to 33 million projects

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.430
and we're up to 145
countries for our One Billion

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.453
Acts of Peace Campaign.

00:07:07.453 --> 00:07:07.953
Thanks.

00:07:07.953 --> 00:07:11.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.860
So we were doing a
speech in Silicon Valley.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.600
We were at Microsoft
headquarters

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.860
and we were doing a speech.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.010
And we got offstage and somebody
from Google came up to us.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.030
And it was Meng--

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.990
Chade-Meng Tan.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.020
Has anybody heard of Meng, who
started Search Inside Yourself

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.410
and meditation here at Google?

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:36.680
And he bowed to us and he said,
you're doing what I want to do.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.720
I want to create world peace.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.210
And I'm going to kidnap you
and take you to someplace

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.700
where they have better food.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.550
And so he did.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.920
He kidnapped us, put us in
his car, drove us to Google.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.400
And we sat there for
three, four hours--

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.870
we just kept
talking and talking.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.640
We were so excited
about what could happen

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.930
if we started working together.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.675
And so we were able to get--

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.720
Google is our lead donor and
tech developer for the Billion

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.710
Acts of Peace Campaign.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.440
It's incredible.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.310
We've had over 100 Googlers
working on-- and YouTubers

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.300
working on--

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.200
this project.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.650
We have half a million dollars
in Google AdWords' budget

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.250
every year.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.450
And it's been an
extraordinary partnership.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.230
And we are almost
tripling every year.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.330
We're definitely going
to make the billion goal.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.380
We were just at
Mountain View doing

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.049
our annual strategic
planning meeting,

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.640
and the campaign is going great.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.450
The campaign itself, the One
Billion Acts of Peace campaign,

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.107
has been nominated nine times
for the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:08:42.107 --> 00:08:44.190
And we are up for the Nobel
Peace Prize this year.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.170
So cross your fingers, maybe
on October 6 we will win

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.880
and even more people
around the world

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.560
will be able to join the effort.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.120
But the idea is that, you know
what, our governments are just

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.520
polarized, or they're
paralyzed, or they're not

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.710
dealing with the really
crucial issues that

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.880
are facing humanity, so it's
time for us to act ourselves.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.560
We're not going to
wait any longer.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.770
We're going to get together--
businesses, nonprofits,

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:15.840
universities, cities, towns,
high schools, young people,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.800
old people, everybody,
just a citizens' movement

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.310
where we work on what the
Nobel laureates have identified

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.620
as the 10 key issues
facing humanity--

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.960
things like alleviating
extreme poverty,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.710
access to clean water for
everybody, ending racism

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.620
and hate, rights
for women and girls.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.100
So we have a campaign with a
lot of high-integrity moral

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.850
leadership.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.890
And this is what we're
focused on doing.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.050
Implementing our
transformational education

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.550
program.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.799
We just got a big grant from
the European Commission--

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.220
the European Union--

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.590
to work with young
people who have just

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.280
arrived in Europe who
are refugees-- mainly

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.830
Muslim refugees-- and
helping to integrate them,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:01.280
social inclusion grant working
to build stronger communities

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.242
where there is a lot of
divide right now in Europe.

00:10:04.242 --> 00:10:05.450
So we're expanding in Europe.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.149
We just started in Singapore,
we just started in Colombia,

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.440
we're about to start in Turkey.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.310
So we're expanding
around the world.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.750
And we have our One Billion
Acts of Peace Campaign.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.700
I believe we're going
to reach that goal.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.330
And then I believe that the
Nobel Peace Prize winners--

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.070
they're my bosses.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.110
When Ivan and I
started this program--

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.850
we're not on the board.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.900
We could be fired tomorrow
without any reason.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.140
It's Colorado, so you can fire
anybody without any reason.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.880
And we are just employees.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.647
We really wanted this program
to be of, by, and for the Nobel

00:10:37.647 --> 00:10:38.480
Peace Prize winners.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.880
We wanted it to be their
educational outreach program

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.170
to the youth of the world.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.270
And I'm certain that
once we hit a billion

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.870
they'll say, great,
now let's go for 10.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.460
And then we have a film series,
the Noble Legacy Film Series,

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.670
which is really incredible.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.499
It captures the spirit,
and the essence,

00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:55.790
and the cutting-edge work of
all of our Nobel laureates

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:01.010
around the world, people like
the Dalai Lama or Desmond Tutu,

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.940
who are getting older.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.920
And we want to capture
them, and their essence,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.200
and their spirit for
all time to share

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.090
with people around the
world as a continuing

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.512
source of inspiration.

00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:11.970
And we've been nominated a lot
of times for the Nobel Peace

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.620
Prize.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:18.050
I was saying to Jeremy it's
a little nerve-wracking right

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.850
now, because we're
getting phone calls

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.605
at our house from the
Norwegian Nobel Committee.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.680
So I think we're
on the short list--

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.930
at least they keep calling.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.550
So we'll see what happens.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.830
But yeah, it's wonderful for
Nobel Peace Prize winners

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.570
to believe so strongly
in this movement

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.100
and it's wonderful to see
that it's being recognized

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.160
internationally as well.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.490
And here's a shot from
our Desmond Tutu film,

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.150
beautiful film called
"Children of the Light,"

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.920
and the rest of the
films in this series.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.070
So that's all I
really wanted to share

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.995
with you is that this
work is going forward.

00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:01.870
I don't know if you saw
at the United Nations

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.300
yesterday-- a lot of things
happened at the United Nations

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.010
yesterday, some good, some bad.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:11.564
But Governor Brown of
California was there

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.480
and he was talking about
something good, which

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.150
is that even though our
president has decided

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.530
to not implement the
Paris Climate Accords,

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.407
cities, and states,
and businesses,

00:12:23.407 --> 00:12:25.240
and all sorts of people
are getting together

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.860
and we're going to
implement it ourselves.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.400
And so these are the kinds
of citizen, action citizen

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.880
mobilization--

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.287
working together, we can
actually create the change

00:12:36.287 --> 00:12:37.120
that we want to see.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.190
And we're going to go
ahead and start doing it.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.880
We are doing it.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.360
We have 33 billion projects
so far and we're on our way

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.650
to a billion.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.740
And hopefully someday our
leaders will follow us.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.570
So that's all I wanted
to say to give you

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:50.990
an overview of PeaceJam.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.490
Thanks.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.843
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.940
JEREMY STANIFER: Thank you
again for being here, Dawn.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:07.890
Making peace as a job just
sounds like a dream job.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.662
Tell us what about your
job is the best part.

00:13:11.662 --> 00:13:12.870
DAWN ENGLE: I'm very hopeful.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.270
I get up every morning and--

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.390
OK, I read the paper and then
I try not to get too upset.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.630
Especially since
the election, it's

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.320
been every day you read the
paper and it's like, wha?

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.734
But I work with
incredible young people,

00:13:27.734 --> 00:13:29.400
and they're working
to change the world.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.441
And they're full of hope,
they're full of energy,

00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:32.640
they're full of enthusiasm.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.070
So I'm always optimistic.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.690
I see the best of
everybody every day.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.910
JEREMY STANIFER: And laughter.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.790
I'm missing Ivan
right now, because one

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.560
of my favorite things
about him is just

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.740
being together and
just the light spirit

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.720
that you guys bring.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.270
And not only that, but all
the laureates that I've

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.380
had the opportunity to meet.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:59.744
It's a big part of the
culture of PeaceJam.

00:13:59.744 --> 00:14:02.160
Can you talk a little bit about
the importance of laughter

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.349
and just kindness in the
everyday of what you do?

00:14:05.349 --> 00:14:07.140
DAWN ENGLE: Well, I
think one of the things

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.990
that Desmond Tutu said that we
hold up as one of our key goals

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.330
is never take yourself
too seriously.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.400
And he laughs a lot.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.960
When Desmond Tutu
walks in the room,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.740
it's like a champagne bottle--
just the cork comes out,

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.270
and the bubbles
fly out, and it's

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.900
like excitement in the air.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.010
He's just funny, and
laughing, and goofing.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.340
And yeah, when he and Ivan
get together it's nonstop.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.080
And we are always doing
things to make it really fun.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.870
When we do a PeaceJam
youth conference,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.780
maybe the theme is
extreme poverty.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.310
It's a hard theme.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.520
But we start by
doing silly games,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.354
and dancing, and just
really silly, goofy things.

00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.020
And then we do something
really serious.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.430
And then we do something
really, really fun

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.555
and we run around the room.

00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:04.440
And then we do something
really serious.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.400
Because it should be fun
to be working for change.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.690
It's exciting to be with a lot
of other people who also care.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.580
I think that's the
thing that blows

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.990
the minds of most young people.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.660
It's so transformational because
they know that they care,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.790
but they think maybe
they're the only one.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.570
And when they're with 300,
400 young people they've never

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.180
met before who are focused
on working for change

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.630
but are doing it in
this exuberant way,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.460
it's very, very, very,
very transformational.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.630
JEREMY STANIFER: One
of my favorite moments

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.040
seeing Desmond Tutu was
one of the kids asked him

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.170
what it takes to be a
Nobel Peace Prize winner.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.570
And he said, you have
to have nice legs.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.565
DAWN ENGLE: He's very
proud of his legs.

00:15:50.565 --> 00:15:52.940
He says you have to have a
name that's easy to remember--

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.380
like Tutu--

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.750
you have to have a
big nose like mine,

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.056
and you have to
have very sexy legs.

00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:01.300
So these are our bosses.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.747
So yeah, we're goofing
around all the time.

00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:05.330
JEREMY STANIFER: I
think so many of us

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.020
want to be involved
in world peace,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.190
in this project especially.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.520
And I think some of the
questions that always come up

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.545
is just like where do you start.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.200
I know we have key focus
areas in the project.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.930
Are some examples that you
can have where people can just

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.650
do simple acts of peace
today, get them logged,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.944
and get started
with this project?

00:16:29.944 --> 00:16:32.360
DAWN ENGLE: That was the whole
genesis behind the platform

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.170
that we built together
with the Google team.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.930
The idea is that
people are good,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.160
they want to do something.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.874
They don't know what,
they don't know how.

00:16:42.874 --> 00:16:44.540
Or they feel like
they're going to do it

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.670
and it's not going to
really make any difference,

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.170
it's going to be a
drop in the ocean

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.400
and it's not going to make
any difference at all.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.420
So we've created the
platform billionacts.org

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.400
where you bring people along.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.440
You start as a tourist, and
then you become a traveler,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.050
and then you become a guide.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.090
We make it easy for you to
do something really simple

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.280
and then to look at other things
that are happening in your area

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.710
or in the issue area
that you care about.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.876
And you can replicate them
or you could join them.

00:17:11.876 --> 00:17:13.250
And then maybe
you get to a place

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.119
where you're doing a
project of your own.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.339
But the concept that
it's a continuum,

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.450
and that you're not expected
to do anything big, or fancy,

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.369
or hard when you start.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.290
It's just getting started.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.520
I'll give you an example.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.170
In Colorado there's
a city called

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.650
Arvada that wanted
to do a volunteer

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.480
challenge for a month.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.540
And they wanted to
have 15,000 projects.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.030
And they had tried
it the year before

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.770
and it was a big failure.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.560
And so they came to
us and worked with us

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.640
to use our platform.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.430
And we gave them
a designated page.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:51.420
And they knew that they could
get the word out to Arvada

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.360
that we're all going
to work together

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.910
as a community for a month.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.960
They knew they had 35 different
nonprofit organizations

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.510
in their community
who needed help.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.695
But they had no bandwidth really
to go out and get volunteers

00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:07.970
and to organize around this.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.650
It was too hard.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.810
And they knew that they wanted
to capture what happened

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.530
and have data so that they could
show at the end the impact.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.460
But just out of
their own website

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.949
they tried the year
before and it was really--

00:18:23.949 --> 00:18:25.490
they spent all their
time just trying

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.980
to build a website for this
and it didn't work in the end

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.090
anyway.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.670
So we were able to provide--

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.660
with our platform we
made the magic happen.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.730
We worked with the
nonprofits and they all

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.430
signed up all the different
volunteer opportunities

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.260
that were available.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.547
We worked with the chamber
of commerce in the city

00:18:45.547 --> 00:18:47.255
to get the word out
to all the volunteers

00:18:47.255 --> 00:18:49.357
that they had 35
different choices.

00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:51.940
There was a way that they could
create their own projects too,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.060
if they had something else
that they wanted to do.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:59.450
And the goal was 15,000
and they hit almost 30,000.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.930
So having our platform
and connecting

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.970
the people who have need--

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.670
the nonprofits-- with the
people who have heart--

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.310
the volunteers--
and everyone wanting

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.810
to work together in a community
and have a combined impact,

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.400
that's what we were able to do.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.260
So a lot of tools like that.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.250
That actually turned out
to be the real sweet spot

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.030
for the campaign.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.830
When we first started
working with the Google team,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.121
we were thinking we were
going to be building something

00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:27.190
that was for individuals.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.780
As it turned out, what
we built is something

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.890
that's for power users.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.430
It's for businesses, for
nonprofit organizations,

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.130
for universities, for
cities, high schools

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.620
and elementary schools
doing school-wide campaigns.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.850
That's who have become our
network members and our power

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.310
users, and that's
what's happening

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:51.160
and how we're allowing them
to take an idea or a desire

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.750
that they have to
make a difference

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.896
and to create change and
have their employees engaged

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:57.520
in something powerful
that's meaningful

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.020
that they can measure
the impact of,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.424
and really being able to do it.

00:20:00.424 --> 00:20:01.840
JEREMY STANIFER:
One of the things

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.550
I love most about
this project is

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.310
that it shows just how
much peace there really

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.130
is in the world.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.270
You look like what's happening
right now in Mexico City--

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.880
we were talking
about this before.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.900
You know just today there
was probably in Mexico City

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.540
a billion acts of peace
happening just today.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.270
Especially with 7 billion
people in the world,

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.820
there's probably
exponential number

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.580
of acts of peace
happening every day.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:35.590
What's the most difficult part
of getting all of those acts

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.904
of peace logged
by the year 2020?

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.820
DAWN ENGLE: I'm sure we
won't log all of them.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.660
Our goal is to inspire
many new acts to happen.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.070
So it's not just an aggregation.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.362
But it's also a
different narrative.

00:20:48.362 --> 00:20:50.320
If you get up and read
the newspaper every day,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.090
it just feels like
things are horrible,

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.590
and the problems
are overwhelming,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.110
and what are we going to
do, and it's hopeless.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.310
And you feel like a victim--

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.610
you feel helpless,
hopeless, I give up.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.370
But the reality is that
people are working together

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.150
in very effective ways and
really creating positive change

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.080
all over the world every day.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.470
And we hold up the Nobel Peace
Prize winners as role models.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.105
We also hold up those who are
doing good work as role models,

00:21:16.105 --> 00:21:18.300
and I'll give you one example.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.750
There's a young man in India.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.410
His name is
[? Harish. ?] He's 14.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.400
He read something in the
paper about landmines--

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.380
up in Kashmir between India and
Pakistan, a lot of landmines,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.480
a whole lot of landmines
are still there

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.400
in the ground, and
soldiers who are

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.960
being blown up
when they're trying

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.810
to clear those minefields.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.870
14 years old, and
he decides, I'm

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.510
going to do
something about this.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.420
And what he decides to do
is he takes some drones--

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.880
he had three drones--

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.550
and he retrofitted them--
and I'm not an engineer,

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.600
but he figured out a way
to make the drones set up

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.210
so they could fly
over the landmines,

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.920
detect them, and then drop a
little device that blows them

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.992
up with only a drone around,
no human beings, no dogs

00:22:08.992 --> 00:22:10.450
or anything like
that, so that they

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.240
could clear landmine fields.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.880
And so it's a wonderful project.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.350
He's a very smart young man.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.930
He deserves to be known about.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.240
So his project was
logged on our site.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.660
We picked him as the winner
of one of our hero awards.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.070
And every year in Monte
Carlo we have a big event.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.960
We have a premiere
of one of our films.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.730
We have a PeaceJam
youth conference.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.420
And we give awards
to the projects

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.390
in the world that are the best.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.230
And we always say that we treat
peacemakers like celebrities.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.100
And it really is
fantastic to be there

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.030
and to see them get a
international spotlight.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.470
He got a TED talk.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.380
His project's been bought
by the Indian government.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.520
He's on his way.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.830
So being able to
hold up people who

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.870
are doing inspirational,
incredible stuff

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.640
around the world--

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.124
and he's just 14 years old.

00:23:04.124 --> 00:23:06.040
You may say, oh, he's
so much smarter than me.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.210
But then we have
other people who were

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.334
doing other things as well.

00:23:08.334 --> 00:23:10.810
So you don't have to
have a Ph.D. to start.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.690
You don't have to be brilliant
to make a difference.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.720
You just have to have heart and
soul, and reach out your hand,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.220
and help at least
one other person.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.960
All of us can do
that, regardless

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.950
of our circumstances.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.402
And if we all did that, the
world would be transformed.

00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:26.360
JEREMY STANIFER: I agree
that's super powerful.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.193
I think that the story
about [INAUDIBLE]----

00:23:28.193 --> 00:23:30.700
it's interesting because this
week at the United Nations,

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.640
at the Social Innovation Summit,
one of the things that was most

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.780
talked about was using the
power of technology for not only

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.950
to innovate but for human
progress versus just solely

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.690
financial reasons.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.900
There's an urgency
with all of that,

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.530
now especially with the
climate that is changing,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.070
especially all the hurricanes
and things that are happening

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.380
with the environment.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.160
Can you talk a little bit about
the urgency in today's climate

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.530
about a project like this?

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.410
DAWN ENGLE: Well, absolutely.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.340
I was reading something in
the "New York Times" yesterday

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.260
about climate change--

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.640
we'll break it down for you.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.990
How bad is it?

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:15.220
It's real bad.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.000
What can we do?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.440
Ooh, we'd better hurry.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:23.070
So if you want a good, really
very simple but clear breakdown

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.010
of where we are, the world
has warmed two degrees.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.140
If it gets up to
eight degrees, we

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.830
won't be able to support
this amount of people

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.050
alive on planet Earth.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:36.160
So what does that mean?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.310
We are already seeing
environmental refugees, people

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.610
who where they live it's
flooded, it's a drought,

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.700
it can't sustain life.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.624
Wars will be fought.

00:24:47.624 --> 00:24:49.540
Many people will die
from the extreme weather.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.040
We're seeing the
extreme weather.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.600
We're seeing the rising seas.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.050
It's already happening.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.700
We can't stop it from happening.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.260
But we can lessen the degree to
which it happens if we act now.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.030
But we really have
to take it seriously.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:06.720
And again, it's hard when
our leaders don't lead.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.480
But we can lead ourselves.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.950
And that's our point,
is coming together.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.160
And then you don't feel
like you're all alone.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.160
Like, OK, I'm recycling,
I turned off the lights

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.660
when I left the room, it's not
going to make any difference,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.070
the world's going to hell.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.600
That's the feeling that
a lot of people have.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.650
And to have people be inspired,
and part of a movement,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.250
and to be in
community with others

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.860
who are doing the same
work, you don't feel lonely.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.390
You feel empowered, you feel
excited, you feel enthusiastic,

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.960
you know you're reaching goals.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.400
And that's what this
campaign is all about.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.010
It's about unleashing goodness.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.590
We really, really believe that
every single human being who's

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.080
born on planet Earth
has goodness in them

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.750
and greatness in them and
we're unleashing that.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.210
And if we see ourselves
in a different way,

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.160
we can be empowered
and we can be

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.466
extraordinary agents of change.

00:25:58.466 --> 00:26:00.840
JEREMY STANIFER: How do you
see technology's biggest role

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.150
in all of that, considering
what we just talked about

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.040
with the Social
Innovation Summit?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.559
DAWN ENGLE: Well
again, the examples

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.100
that I give from
our campaign-- there

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.260
are people who want to do good.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.370
They don't know how.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.100
They want to be part of a
community, it doesn't exist.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.880
They want to create a campaign,
or a movement, or a project;

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.110
they need support.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.770
So it's providing
the underpinnings

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:24.717
to make all of
those things doable

00:26:24.717 --> 00:26:27.300
as opposed to sitting there by
yourself feeling like, ah, it's

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.380
too hard.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.326
So it's allowing
people to get started,

00:26:30.326 --> 00:26:31.950
at least with the
technology that we've

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.990
developed working with Google.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.955
But I think in the
broader sense--

00:26:35.955 --> 00:26:37.830
we're talking about the
example of the drones

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.170
and the landmines--

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.450
technology can be used
for tremendous good,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.580
it can be used for
tremendous evil.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.590
So it depends on the
ethics of the people who

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.781
are creating the technology.

00:26:50.781 --> 00:26:52.530
So I think that's also
very important too.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.690
So that's one of the
reasons that we really

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.390
care deeply about sharing
these Nobel Peace Prize

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.730
winners as moral
examples for the world,

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.880
having an alternative narrative
to the things that we're

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.040
hearing so constantly
that are so negative.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.770
The most recent
film that we did is

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.900
called "Without a Shot Fired."

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.210
It's about Costa Rica and
how they made the decision

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.210
70 years ago to not
have an army and instead

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.960
to invest their money in
health care, the environment,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.390
education, and housing, and the
impact that had on Costa Rica

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.960
and the rest of the world.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.310
And it's a choice.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.160
So we don't have
to say that we're

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.190
going to solve our problems
with military force

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:42.430
or by having a doubling
of the size of our army.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.880
A lot of the things
that you're hearing now,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.430
there are alternative
ways to go about it.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.770
And different countries
and different leaders

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.080
have tried different approaches,
and they have worked.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.230
And so having
other voices heard.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.750
So we want to amplify the
voices of our Nobel Peace Prize

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.600
winners, and of all of the young
people, and all of the others

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.141
around the world
who are doing things

00:28:02.141 --> 00:28:04.180
in a positive, nonviolent way.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.690
But we really, really believe
in the path of nonviolence.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.356
There was a study
that was just released

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:10.710
that shows about
working for change

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.620
and if you use techniques of
violence versus techniques

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.820
of nonviolence.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.680
And nonviolence is the
change that will last.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.190
It has the best
chance of succeeding

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.740
and it has the best chance of
actually lasting and making

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.510
a difference for social
justice in that situation.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.810
So these are the
stories that we're

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:29.439
trying to share with the world.

00:28:29.439 --> 00:28:30.855
JEREMY STANIFER:
One last question

00:28:30.855 --> 00:28:34.350
and then I'll open it
up to the audience.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:34.860
Why youth?

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.000
DAWN ENGLE: I love working
with young people because--

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.542
JEREMY STANIFER:
You and me both.

00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:47.200
DAWN ENGLE: It doesn't matter.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.180
PeaceJam started because of
some young people in a gang

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.410
and Ivan got into a
conversation with them.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:01.000
And even the toughest kids,
they're like puppy dogs.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.470
They have their heart and
their soul is right here.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.810
And maybe it's buried
under a few layers

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.580
of trying to be tough,
but they want to be loved,

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.000
they want to belong,
they want to matter,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.830
they want somebody
to see the goodness

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.120
and the beauty in their soul.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.450
That's what they want.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.310
And if you do that,
they bloom like flowers

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.570
turning towards the sun.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.580
It's incredible to
see that change that

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.550
happens with young people.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:29.650
Our program starts at age
6 and goes through age 25.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:34.751
In the elementary schools,
a lot of young people

00:29:34.751 --> 00:29:36.500
don't know that there
is this thing called

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.190
the path of nonviolence.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.120
There's the words
that adults say

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.010
and then there's what adults do.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.070
So in the movies, what do we
do when somebody does something

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.030
that we don't like?

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.160
We go and bomb the
hell out of them.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.520
What does our government do?

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.620
We're going to wipe
North Korea off the map.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.480
Young people are smart, and
they're paying attention,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.280
and they're seeing
all of these things.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.600
Maybe the adults are saying
nice words, like "be kind,"

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.040
but they're not being kind.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.760
And so they look at all
of these role models that

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.930
are being presented in
media, in video games,

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.460
in leadership around the world.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.862
And when they start studying
the PeaceJam curriculum,

00:30:20.862 --> 00:30:22.320
they're like, ah,
there's something

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.640
called the path of nonviolence.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.500
It's a huge discovery for them.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.220
And we didn't expect
this, but in schools

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.400
where our curriculum is being
taught, one of the big impacts

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.460
is on behavior, because
young people now

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.362
have nonviolent role models.

00:30:38.362 --> 00:30:40.320
The teachers say that
they're in the playground

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.800
and they're like, well,
Rigoberta Menchu wouldn't

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.130
do that, or, what would
the Dalai Lama do?

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.680
So giving them
positive role models

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.170
who are solving
really hard problems

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.634
but do using the path of
nonviolence to solve them.

00:30:55.634 --> 00:30:58.050
In elementary schools there's
something called an incident

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.880
report when there's a fight.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.370
And in some schools,
especially with schools

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:07.849
that have a lot of turnover,
transient populations,

00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:09.390
poorer schools-- a
lot of our schools

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.210
have a lot of youth
who are homeless

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.920
or who with the job
insecurity for their parents

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.270
there's a lot of moving.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.900
And so in those schools,
it can be for teachers

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.750
that they spend all of
their time just trying

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.960
to get everyone to sit down,
be quiet, stop fighting, pay

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.260
attention, and very little
time to actually teach.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.950
So in schools where the PeaceJam
program has been implemented,

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.689
the incident reports of
fights has gone way down.

00:31:34.689 --> 00:31:36.480
And the teachers have
been really thrilled,

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.580
because they get to
spend their time teaching

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.830
and the young
people are engaged.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.110
JEREMY STANIFER:
Almost here too they're

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.816
inspired too not only by these
Nobel Peace Prize winners,

00:31:45.816 --> 00:31:47.190
but Nobel Peace
Prize winners are

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.060
going against the status
quo, which is probably also

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.710
inspiring to someone
who is a teenager

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.920
and seeing things that might
not make sense to them.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.950
If you do reach those
billion acts of peace,

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.310
you said the next step would
be 10 billion acts of peace.

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:10.370
It's this exponential curve.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:14.480
You see and you hear all
this white nationalism,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.420
all these weird things that
are happening in our country,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.530
and that can sometimes
be the story for us.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.310
But it's sometimes
this exponential curve

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.310
that you're seeing that
actually the goodness is

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.030
starting to come out.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.910
Do you think that once you hit
the one billion acts of peace,

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.730
do you think 10 billion acts
of peace will be a lot easier?

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.179
DAWN ENGLE: Anything
can become normal.

00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:35.720
And I think that's
what we have to be

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.240
really careful about right now.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.070
The kinds of things that white
nationalists, and racists,

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.920
and hate speech--

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.390
there are things that were
maybe underground that

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.520
have been legitimized
in a way, they

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.180
feel like they've been
legitimized by our leadership

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.650
in this country right now.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:33:01.100
And a lot of stuff's come out
that is pretty concerning,

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.240
like it's OK to do certain
things in certain ways.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.951
And peace can become normal too.

00:33:10.951 --> 00:33:12.340
Kindness can become normal.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.790
Compassion can become normal.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.190
Anything can become normal.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.520
So it's what we focus on
and what we model ourselves.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.140
So that's the idea.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:24.250
Really the core idea behind the
Billion Acts of Peace campaign

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.930
is that we have
to work at scale.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.140
If we have 7 billion
people on planet Earth

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.140
and we have a
billion acts of peace

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.360
and then 10 billion
acts of peace,

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.890
it's enough so that it can shift
the consciousness worldwide,

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.160
and that we can see that
there is another way,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.180
and that it is a
very successful way,

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.220
and that there's enough of
it happening in communities

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.840
around the world.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.000
We're in 145 countries
around the world so far.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.910
And just making it
normal to reach out

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:02.350
your hand, to help someone
else, to be compassionate,

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.790
to care, to act.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:08.699
Emotion without
action is irrelevant.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:11.909
You feel really bad when you see
those stories about the people

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:12.744
in--

00:34:12.744 --> 00:34:19.170
the Rohingya being expelled from
Myanmar, but they need help.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.060
They need compassion.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.770
It's good that you
care, but they need

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.630
people to actually help them.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.110
And some of it's social justice,
some of it's humanitarian aid,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:31.530
some of it's legal rights.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.340
So we can create
a different world.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.243
It's just that we
give up our power.

00:34:37.243 --> 00:34:38.659
So that's the last
thing I'll say.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.360
I'll end with that, is that
we have the power in our hands

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.030
to create whatever kind of
world we want to create.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.469
We give our power away.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.500
And we vote once
every two years,

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.129
once out of every four
years, and then we're done.

00:34:51.129 --> 00:34:52.920
And we just, oh, well,
that's the way it is

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.560
and there's nothing I can do.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.770
And we need to take our power
back, as human beings who care,

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.939
and work together to
create the world that we

00:35:02.939 --> 00:35:03.980
know that we want to see.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.540
We know we can do
better than this.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.380
Come on, we can do
better than this.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.770
And so we're not going
to wait any longer.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.050
We're not waiting, we're
creating that new world

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.110
together.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.160
So we're just really,
really grateful to you

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.010
for being a member of our
team and such a good friend

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.710
and to everybody at
Google and YouTube

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.690
who has been so
incredible supporting us.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.780
We have three wonderful
executive sponsors--

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.320
Bradley Horowitz, and Karen
May, and Susan Wojcicki.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.670
And it's just been a
beautiful partnership,

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.450
and I know it's going
to continue to grow.

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:40.760
So we're very, very happy to
be in partnership with you all.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.740
And thank you to everybody
who came to this talk today.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.390
Thanks so much.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.765
JEREMY STANIFER:
Thank you, guys.

00:35:45.765 --> 00:35:48.910
