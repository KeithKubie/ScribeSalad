1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,850
There are two general situations
in which Mitch mismatch can occur.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,170
One is when there is rapid change
and culture, uh, over time.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,320
And the other is when
humans move in space,

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,760
the Miss Masters in time are caused by
the major cultural and epidemiological

5
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,630
transitions that have been occurring.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,770
And there we can see an estimate of
how fast things can happen by studying

7
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,990
lactase persistence because
we have a time point when, uh,

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,090
we started dairying culture and that
is when selection began for lactase

9
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:43,050
persistence in space.
We can study emigration and immigration,

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,260
they are moving people between different
kinds of selection regimes and we can

11
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:52,590
start with the agricultural
and industrial revolutions.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,170
So in the left panel we have a historical
timeline running from the Paleolithic

13
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,080
about 10,000 years ago
up through the present.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,320
In the center panel we have lifestyle.

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,680
And over here we have the microorganisms
that were associated with that.

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,820
So in the Paleolithic, we were in
small groups of less than a hundred.

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,690
And the agricultural revolution was
associated with the first epidemiological

18
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,770
transition.
Prior to the agricultural revolution,

19
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:27,771
we have worms mycobacteria
a happy gut microbiota.

20
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:34,530
We had healed helicobacter
pylori, Salmonella Toxoplasma
and lack of facility.

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,730
Then in the agricultural revolution,

22
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:42,630
we started living in the larger social
groups. We domesticated animals,

23
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:46,890
we had cats and dogs around. There
was increased oral fecal transmission.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,533
At this point,

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,720
about 97% of the population was still
living in a rural environment where they

26
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:57,840
were living on farms, exposed
to animals, feces, mud,

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,550
untreated water and so forth.

28
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:03,060
And that continued up to the 18th,

29
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:04,650
the 19th century in Europe.

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,720
In this period there were
measure microbial changes.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,440
So the more settled lifestyle actually
led to more worms and more oral fecal

32
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:16,464
transmission.

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,430
And there were novel infections
that epidemiology suggests
we're not part of the

34
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,110
Paleolithic community of pathogens.

35
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,410
They include a whole group of viruses,
the Pyrrole,

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,180
Mixel viruses and so forth
that are mumps and uh,

37
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,070
things like that.
Measles,

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,110
this is where influence of BNC came in.
And also where smallpox,

39
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,160
cholera, plague and typhus appear to have
entered the human population to become

40
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:48,390
significant diseases.

41
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,360
The next major transition as much more
recent, that's the industrial revolution.

42
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:57,600
And the associated second
epidemiological transition.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,550
Our lifestyle shifted to being urbanized
where there was a lot more concrete and

44
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:07,810
tarmac where soap and
detergents became widely used,

45
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,410
food was washed,
there was less oral fecal transmission.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,660
Chlorinated water became available,

47
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,340
there was less contact with animals
and there were antibiotics, vaccines,

48
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,530
deworming, Asians, so we had
fewer worms, less toxoplasma,

49
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,380
less helicobacter,
less Sudoku,

50
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:29,920
commensals from mud and water analyst,
Very Gut Microbiota.

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,041
Now,

52
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:39,041
much of this mismatch we
currently experience is the
result of these two events,

53
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,900
the agricultural revolution
and the industrial revolution.

54
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,880
So before agriculture,
more worms,

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,230
helicobacter salmonella gut
for diverse gut Microbiota,

56
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,610
tuberculosis. We ate fruits,
vegetables, nuts, meat and fish.

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,820
With agriculture we picked up
measles, mumps, flew, smallpox,

58
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,730
cholera and typhus.
We domesticated animals,

59
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,660
we drank milk,
we shifted to eating more green.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,860
We were living on farms and had
more oral fecal transmission.

61
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,610
Then with the industrial revolution, came
syrup to toe detergents, antibiotics,

62
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:21,890
deworming,
less exposure to helmets,

63
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,410
less toxoplasma helicobacter,
Salmonella and less varied gut microbiota.

64
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,290
So with the postindustrial world,

65
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,020
we are more sedentary and
we have more global travel

66
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,240
to interpret the kinds of changes
that go on in these major transitions.

67
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,490
It helps to focus on lactase persistence,

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,730
the ability to continue to
digest milk as an adult.

69
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,310
Prior to agriculture,

70
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:53,840
the ability to digest milk was president
in infants up to about two years of age,

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,960
but then disappeared
with the domestication of
dairy animals that made it

72
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,580
advantageous for adults to digest milk.

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,780
And we know that daring originated
about three to 9,000 years ago.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,680
So lactase persistence,

75
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,600
the ability of adult adults to digest
milk is hot. Currently not universal.

76
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,290
It's prevalence ranges from about 95 to
97% in Scandinavia to only up to 10% in

77
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:24,680
East Asia.
Some populations can't do it at all.

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,590
So data and theory together suggest that
the selective advantage of digesting

79
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:35,030
milk as adults has been about oh
0.5% to 3% which is pretty strong.

80
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,340
The 3% selective advantage means that a
person who can digest milk is an adult,

81
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,170
has on average 3% more grandchildren.
Then does

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,490
the person who cannot digest milk.

83
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,230
So the message is that evolution takes
hundreds of generations to adjust

84
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,040
populations to new conditions.

85
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,450
It has not yet completed that adjustment
for this important element of our diet.

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,010
Now what if immigration,

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,040
immigration done to mismatch immigrants
bring with them diseases that the

88
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:15,640
populations into which they're
moving have not yet experienced?

89
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,620
They also leave some pathogens and
symbiotes behind them. When they move,

90
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,710
they switched to new diets and lifestyles
and all three effects results in

91
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,840
mismatches that have health consequences.

92
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Here is what happened when
Europeans brought small pox
into populations that had

93
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:42,470
never experienced smallpox.
There were huge epidemics.

94
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,130
So in Hispaniola between 1507 and 1518
up to 300,000 people died in Mexico in

95
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:51,921
just one year,

96
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:56,921
1520 to 1521 between two and 15 million
people died in Peru between 1525 and

97
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:03,971
1527 at least 200,000 died in Brazil
between 1550 and 18 1880 about 3 million

98
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,070
died and so forth.

99
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,280
So when smallpox entered the new world,

100
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,580
it caused enormous epidemics.

101
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,670
There are other effects that pathogens
can be left behind. So for example,

102
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,050
when the slave trade brought
African Americans to the new world,

103
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,030
they left malaria behind an Africa,

104
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,580
but they retained the costs
of sickle cell disease.

105
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,350
Immigrants today to develop countries
suffer more allergies and asthma than do

106
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:38,841
locals.

107
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:43,100
They are leaving their microbiota behind
and they're moving into a more hygienic

108
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:47,660
environment. They also switched
to new diets and lifestyles.

109
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,320
So when Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii
about 1890 to 1910 they switched from

110
00:07:55,401 --> 00:08:00,110
a diet high in fish, rice and tea
to a diet that had more red meat,

111
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,820
animal fat and milk

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,110
men of Japanese ethnicity in Hawaii.

113
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,760
We're then twice as likely to die of
heart disease is those who lived in Japan

114
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,170
and the children of Japanese immigrants
were about 10 centimeters taller than

115
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:20,610
their parents as a result of the milk
and animal fat in their diet when they

116
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:23,970
were growing up.
So to summarize,

117
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,570
mismatchers can occur
in both time and space.

118
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,770
The agriculture and industrial revolution
produced major shifts in lifestyle and

119
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:36,840
in Diet.

120
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,220
And an exposure to microorganisms in our
biology has not yet had time to catch

121
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,054
up with them.

122
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,430
We experience serious health consequences
from the agricultural revolution,

123
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:52,780
so the domestication of living in
cities brought with it. Things like flu,

124
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,880
measles, smallpox, cholera,

125
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,320
and typhus that Paleolithic Hunter
gatherers did not normally encounter

126
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,290
with the industrial revolution.
The consequences include obesity,

127
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:12,210
type two diabetes, osteoporosis, colon
cancer, and cardiovascular disease,

128
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,220
as well as some of the benefits such as
lower infant mortality and longer life,

129
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,510
which are both reasons that we are now
exposed to some of these chronic diseases.

130
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,370
Immigrant's experience changes
in Diet and in Microbiota.

131
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:31,020
They can actually dramatically change the
prevalence of noncommunicable diseases

132
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,500
and immigrant populations,
so they have more asthma and allergy.
