love optimization but it's about

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.129
love optimization but it's about

love optimization but it's about
conversation and deviating from

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130
conversation and deviating from
 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.150
conversation and deviating from
optimization and for me as a chess

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
optimization and for me as a chess
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.650
optimization and for me as a chess
the reason I've always liked chess is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
the reason I've always liked chess is
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.749
the reason I've always liked chess is
precisely because there is no an

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759
precisely because there is no an
 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.019
precisely because there is no an
immersive chance and he won't and avoids

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
immersive chance and he won't and avoids
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.419
immersive chance and he won't and avoids
in some ways but exactly with some of

trumps so how do you connect well those

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499
trumps so how do you connect well those
 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.370
trumps so how do you connect well those
two things together the vagaries of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
two things together the vagaries of
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.060
two things together the vagaries of
chance to actually meet it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
chance to actually meet it
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130
chance to actually meet it
well um you can't always manipulate

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
well um you can't always manipulate
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.439
well um you can't always manipulate
chance favorably that's I think that's

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449
chance favorably that's I think that's
 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.900
chance favorably that's I think that's
the bottom line but what you can do is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
the bottom line but what you can do is
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.900
the bottom line but what you can do is
actually try to try to just maximize

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
actually try to try to just maximize
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.930
actually try to try to just maximize
what you can control so what I always

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
what you can control so what I always
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610
what you can control so what I always
what I always do what Eric has always

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
what I always do what Eric has always
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680
what I always do what Eric has always
taught me to do is make sure you're

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
taught me to do is make sure you're
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.319
taught me to do is make sure you're
making the right decisions for the right

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
making the right decisions for the right
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.329
making the right decisions for the right
reasons and so I might play a hand in a

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339
reasons and so I might play a hand in a
 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.640
reasons and so I might play a hand in a
very strange way because I am exploiting

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
very strange way because I am exploiting
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.120
very strange way because I am exploiting
someone who I think is being so because

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
someone who I think is being so because
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280
someone who I think is being so because
I'm female one of the things that often

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
I'm female one of the things that often
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.050
I'm female one of the things that often
happens is people become much more

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
happens is people become much more
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.819
happens is people become much more
aggressive against me because they think

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829
aggressive against me because they think
 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.649
aggressive against me because they think
they can get me to fold a lot of hands

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
they can get me to fold a lot of hands
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.660
they can get me to fold a lot of hands
and so they'll 3bet me which means

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
and so they'll 3bet me which means
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.319
and so they'll 3bet me which means
raising my opens much more often with a

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329
raising my opens much more often with a
 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.990
raising my opens much more often with a
lot of weaker hands or you know when I'm

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
lot of weaker hands or you know when I'm
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700
lot of weaker hands or you know when I'm
in one of the blinds so I have to be in

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
in one of the blinds so I have to be in
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.230
in one of the blinds so I have to be in
the hand they'll raise me much more

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
the hand they'll raise me much more
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330
the hand they'll raise me much more
widely so they'll do things like that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
widely so they'll do things like that
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.760
widely so they'll do things like that
and then sometimes I'll have a horrible

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
and then sometimes I'll have a horrible
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609
and then sometimes I'll have a horrible
hand and one that I would never in a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
hand and one that I would never in a
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560
hand and one that I would never in a
million years floor bet but I'm going to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
million years floor bet but I'm going to
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.179
million years floor bet but I'm going to
for bet I'm gonna actually rear ace them

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
for bet I'm gonna actually rear ace them
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609
for bet I'm gonna actually rear ace them
with garbage because I know what's going

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
with garbage because I know what's going
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.980
with garbage because I know what's going
on and sometimes I'll run into a really

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
on and sometimes I'll run into a really
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.719
on and sometimes I'll run into a really
strong hand but more often than not I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
strong hand but more often than not I
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.230
strong hand but more often than not I
won't and so you can that's what I meant

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
won't and so you can that's what I meant
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.690
won't and so you can that's what I meant
by exploitation I'm still not going to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700
by exploitation I'm still not going to
 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.399
by exploitation I'm still not going to
be able to get away from the chance

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
be able to get away from the chance
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.899
be able to get away from the chance
elements that happen in any hand so what

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909
elements that happen in any hand so what
 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.700
elements that happen in any hand so what
what Eric is always very careful to tell

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
what Eric is always very careful to tell
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.950
what Eric is always very careful to tell
me is never you know he doesn't care

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
me is never you know he doesn't care
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.539
me is never you know he doesn't care
actually what happens at the end of the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
actually what happens at the end of the
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.399
actually what happens at the end of the
hand he doesn't want to know you know if

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
hand he doesn't want to know you know if
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.679
hand he doesn't want to know you know if
I won or lost like at the once the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
I won or lost like at the once the
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.740
I won or lost like at the once the
decision is done it doesn't matter and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
decision is done it doesn't matter and
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.369
decision is done it doesn't matter and
so it the outcome you have to divorce

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379
so it the outcome you have to divorce
 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.480
so it the outcome you have to divorce
yourself from the outcome

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490
yourself from the outcome
 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.310
yourself from the outcome
you have to say am i making the right

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320
you have to say am i making the right
 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.870
you have to say am i making the right
decision am i thinking about it the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880
decision am i thinking about it the
 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.610
decision am i thinking about it the
right way at every single step of the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
right way at every single step of the
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.440
right way at every single step of the
hand can I defend why I'm doing

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
hand can I defend why I'm doing
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.240
hand can I defend why I'm doing
something even if I'm doing something

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
something even if I'm doing something
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430
something even if I'm doing something
really weird that I wouldn't normally do

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
really weird that I wouldn't normally do
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.040
really weird that I wouldn't normally do
in a spot like this do I have a reason

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
in a spot like this do I have a reason
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.020
in a spot like this do I have a reason
for it and if the answer is yes and if

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
for it and if the answer is yes and if
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.490
for it and if the answer is yes and if
the reason is a good one

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
the reason is a good one
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.830
the reason is a good one
then then I played the hand to the best

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
then then I played the hand to the best
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.270
then then I played the hand to the best
of my abilities and it actually

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
of my abilities and it actually
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.010
of my abilities and it actually
sometimes helps when I'm in a tough spot

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
sometimes helps when I'm in a tough spot
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.230
sometimes helps when I'm in a tough spot
to know that I'm going to be explaining

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
to know that I'm going to be explaining
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.360
to know that I'm going to be explaining
this to someone that I'll be explaining

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370
this to someone that I'll be explaining
 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.280
this to someone that I'll be explaining
it to Eric or that I'll be explaining it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
it to Eric or that I'll be explaining it
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.620
it to Eric or that I'll be explaining it
to Phil or to someone then I then I know

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630
to Phil or to someone then I then I know
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.050
to Phil or to someone then I then I know
that I actually have to think through my

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
that I actually have to think through my
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.710
that I actually have to think through my
reasons rather than just act reflexively

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
reasons rather than just act reflexively
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.960
reasons rather than just act reflexively
which can be very easy to do

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
which can be very easy to do
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.310
which can be very easy to do
sometimes you don't you're like oh I

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320
sometimes you don't you're like oh I
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.870
sometimes you don't you're like oh I
always do this here I'm just gonna do it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880
always do this here I'm just gonna do it
 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.760
always do this here I'm just gonna do it
quickly but to actually stop and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770
quickly but to actually stop and
 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.730
quickly but to actually stop and
question it and then happen what may it

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740
question it and then happen what may it
 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.050
question it and then happen what may it
can still be really tough when you make

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
can still be really tough when you make
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.600
can still be really tough when you make
the right decision and then you end up

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
the right decision and then you end up
 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.060
the right decision and then you end up
losing you know it's not pleasant but

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070
losing you know it's not pleasant but
 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.940
losing you know it's not pleasant but
you have to try not to think about that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
you have to try not to think about that
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.530
you have to try not to think about that
and to remember that you just made the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540
and to remember that you just made the
 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.840
and to remember that you just made the
best choice you possibly could given the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850
best choice you possibly could given the
 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.640
best choice you possibly could given the
information that you had available and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
information that you had available and
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.260
information that you had available and
sometimes you know it's easy to

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270
sometimes you know it's easy to
 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.120
sometimes you know it's easy to
criticize other players when you see

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130
criticize other players when you see
 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.100
criticize other players when you see
them do something really weird you're

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110
them do something really weird you're
 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.570
them do something really weird you're
like how you know how could you have

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580
like how you know how could you have
 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.450
like how you know how could you have
done that there but you have to remember

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460
done that there but you have to remember
 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.880
done that there but you have to remember
that you see all of the information you

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890
that you see all of the information you
 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.060
that you see all of the information you
