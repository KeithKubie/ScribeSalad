so yeah I think there's a few things

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740
so yeah I think there's a few things
 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.410
so yeah I think there's a few things
that need to happen for crypto

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420
that need to happen for crypto
 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.200
that need to happen for crypto
currencies to become kind of a global

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210
currencies to become kind of a global
 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.730
currencies to become kind of a global
replacement for either reserve

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740

liquid right I mean if you think about

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910
liquid right I mean if you think about
 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.050
liquid right I mean if you think about
dollar as a reserve currency there's

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060
dollar as a reserve currency there's
 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.660
dollar as a reserve currency there's
trillions of dollars in circulation it's

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670
trillions of dollars in circulation it's
 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.150
trillions of dollars in circulation it's
globally liquid across tens of thousands

that's not totally true of crypto

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:37.999
that's not totally true of crypto
 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.389
that's not totally true of crypto
currencies yet if you take Bitcoin which

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399
currencies yet if you take Bitcoin which
 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.579
currencies yet if you take Bitcoin which
is the most successful crypto currency

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589
is the most successful crypto currency
 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.590
is the most successful crypto currency
its market cap is around two hundred

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600
its market cap is around two hundred

the liquidity of Bitcoin versus even the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629
the liquidity of Bitcoin versus even the
 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.989
the liquidity of Bitcoin versus even the
US dollar is relatively low which means

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999
US dollar is relatively low which means
 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.539
US dollar is relatively low which means
it needs to be worth a lot more if it

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549
it needs to be worth a lot more if it
 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:59.829
it needs to be worth a lot more if it
would become like let's say a digital

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839
would become like let's say a digital
 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.289
would become like let's say a digital
gold gold is worth trillions of dollars

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299
gold gold is worth trillions of dollars
 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.570
gold gold is worth trillions of dollars
in the aggregate right the coin is not

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580
in the aggregate right the coin is not
 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.340
in the aggregate right the coin is not
yet worth that much and that's important

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350
yet worth that much and that's important
 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.859
yet worth that much and that's important
because if if it's not worth trillions

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869
because if if it's not worth trillions
 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.380
because if if it's not worth trillions
of dollars and billions of people want

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390
of dollars and billions of people want
 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.459
of dollars and billions of people want
to use it there's not enough to go

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469
to use it there's not enough to go
 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.349
to use it there's not enough to go
around so you need to be able to break

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359
around so you need to be able to break
 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:15.999
around so you need to be able to break
it up into tiny pieces so everyone can

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009
it up into tiny pieces so everyone can
 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.490
it up into tiny pieces so everyone can
use it just like gold and and that's not

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500
use it just like gold and and that's not
 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.319
use it just like gold and and that's not
true until it's worth a lot more money

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329
true until it's worth a lot more money
 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.810
true until it's worth a lot more money
than it is today but it becomes a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
than it is today but it becomes a
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.700
than it is today but it becomes a
circular discussion because the usage

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710
circular discussion because the usage
 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.099
circular discussion because the usage
will also drive the price higher right

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109
will also drive the price higher right
 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.109
will also drive the price higher right
just like speculation sometimes can can

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119
just like speculation sometimes can can
 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.969
just like speculation sometimes can can
drive the price higher so over time it

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979
drive the price higher so over time it
 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.660
drive the price higher so over time it
should get there by its ability to be

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670
should get there by its ability to be
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.749
should get there by its ability to be
fungible with fiat via these exchanges

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759
fungible with fiat via these exchanges
 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.209
fungible with fiat via these exchanges
as kind of an on-ramp into digital

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219
as kind of an on-ramp into digital
 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.959
as kind of an on-ramp into digital
currency but also it should you know it

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969
currency but also it should you know it
 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.580
currency but also it should you know it
should meet the liquidity requirements

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590
should meet the liquidity requirements
 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.559
should meet the liquidity requirements
that we need meaning the price should be

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569
that we need meaning the price should be
 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.569
that we need meaning the price should be
high enough the ability to get in and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579
high enough the ability to get in and
 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.160
high enough the ability to get in and
out via traditional money should be

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170
out via traditional money should be
 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.590
out via traditional money should be
reasonable globally over the next few

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600
reasonable globally over the next few
 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.830
reasonable globally over the next few
years and then I believe you can really

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840
years and then I believe you can really
 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.440
years and then I believe you can really
have a viable discussion about using a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450
have a viable discussion about using a
 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.120
have a viable discussion about using a
crypto currency like Bitcoin as a viable

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130
crypto currency like Bitcoin as a viable
 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.480
crypto currency like Bitcoin as a viable
reserve currency so crypto currencies

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490
reserve currency so crypto currencies
 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.709
reserve currency so crypto currencies
eventually will look like traditional

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719
eventually will look like traditional
 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.169
eventually will look like traditional
commodities in my opinion whether it's

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
commodities in my opinion whether it's
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.130
commodities in my opinion whether it's
gold or platinum or other

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
gold or platinum or other
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.020
gold or platinum or other
you know metals or is probably the best

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
you know metals or is probably the best
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790
you know metals or is probably the best
but could look like oil and gas things

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
but could look like oil and gas things
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.160
but could look like oil and gas things
like that and and so they they are

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
like that and and so they they are
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.920
like that and and so they they are
starting to trade in in a fashion that's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
starting to trade in in a fashion that's
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.840
starting to trade in in a fashion that's
more and more similar to traditional

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850
more and more similar to traditional
 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.750
more and more similar to traditional
commodities but the difference right now

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
commodities but the difference right now
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.750
commodities but the difference right now
is they're not as liquid yet right so so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
is they're not as liquid yet right so so
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.660
is they're not as liquid yet right so so
that means that the price is is very

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
that means that the price is is very
 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.430
that means that the price is is very
inefficient for the markets for crypto

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
inefficient for the markets for crypto
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.410
inefficient for the markets for crypto
currencies are very inefficient so most

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
currencies are very inefficient so most
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.180
currencies are very inefficient so most
people who are holding crypto currencies

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
people who are holding crypto currencies
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.010
people who are holding crypto currencies
are long-term holders they're not

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
are long-term holders they're not
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.710
are long-term holders they're not
selling okay so that actually means that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
selling okay so that actually means that
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750
selling okay so that actually means that
the price of Bitcoin and ether for

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
the price of Bitcoin and ether for
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.140
the price of Bitcoin and ether for
example is largely driven by the volume

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
example is largely driven by the volume
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.990
example is largely driven by the volume
of buyers so if there's large volumes of

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
of buyers so if there's large volumes of
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.550
of buyers so if there's large volumes of
buyers coming into the market it drives

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
buyers coming into the market it drives
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.600
buyers coming into the market it drives
the price higher because there's not a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
the price higher because there's not a
 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.150
the price higher because there's not a
lot of sellers but if the the buyers dry

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
lot of sellers but if the the buyers dry
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.860
lot of sellers but if the the buyers dry
up right then the price goes down

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
up right then the price goes down
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.330
up right then the price goes down
regardless because there's still not a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
regardless because there's still not a
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.900
regardless because there's still not a
lot of sellers so so that'll change over

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
lot of sellers so so that'll change over
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.759
lot of sellers so so that'll change over
time because if the price skyrocket so

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769
time because if the price skyrocket so
 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.800
time because if the price skyrocket so
for example if institutional money

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
for example if institutional money
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.840
for example if institutional money
starts to come into the cryptocurrency

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850
starts to come into the cryptocurrency
 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.060
starts to come into the cryptocurrency
market in large numbers which I think it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070
market in large numbers which I think it
 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.310
market in large numbers which I think it
will that will force the price higher

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320
will that will force the price higher
 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.360
will that will force the price higher
because there's not enough

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370
because there's not enough
 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.360
because there's not enough
cryptocurrency to go around okay and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370
cryptocurrency to go around okay and
 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.699
cryptocurrency to go around okay and
that'll also cause some of the holders

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709
that'll also cause some of the holders
 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.710
that'll also cause some of the holders
to loosen up their purse strings because

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
to loosen up their purse strings because
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.850
to loosen up their purse strings because
they're gonna want to reap the profits

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860
they're gonna want to reap the profits
 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.310
they're gonna want to reap the profits
that they've been waiting for for 10-15

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320
that they've been waiting for for 10-15
 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.520
that they've been waiting for for 10-15
years by the time that happens okay and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530
years by the time that happens okay and
 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.860
years by the time that happens okay and
that'll also create more liquid in the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
that'll also create more liquid in the
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.920
that'll also create more liquid in the
system which will create a really

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930
system which will create a really
 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.509
system which will create a really
positive feedback loop which should

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519
positive feedback loop which should
 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.580
positive feedback loop which should
drive the price even higher the other

thousands of dollars in their own right
 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.680
thousands of dollars in their own right
right so that's that gives the utility

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690
right so that's that gives the utility
 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.350
right so that's that gives the utility
of Bitcoin a lot of leg room for the

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360
of Bitcoin a lot of leg room for the
 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.540
of Bitcoin a lot of leg room for the
long term because even if the value goes

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550
long term because even if the value goes
 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.650
long term because even if the value goes
up to trillions you'll be able to

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660
up to trillions you'll be able to
 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.330
up to trillions you'll be able to
subdivide it into small amounts to make

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340
subdivide it into small amounts to make
 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.070
subdivide it into small amounts to make
it useful for small payments

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080
it useful for small payments
