Deja vu: why do I feel like we’ve done this
episode before...

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:18.110
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and most,
if not all of us, have at some point or another,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.110
experienced deja vu.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.170
It’s that familiar feeling that you’ve
somehow experienced this moment before - and

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.779
even though a lot of people claim it has a
spiritual basis, perhaps linked to reincarnation

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.440
- there’s actually a number of scientific
theories as to why we experience it.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.069
The term Deja vu - which translates to “already
seen” - was first coined in 1876 by French

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.469
philosopher Emile Boirac.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.519
And in the years since then, researchers studying
the phenomenon - have come up with several

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.969
different types of deja vu that people experience.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.789
In general, though - it’s lumped into one
of two categories.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.780
There’s associative deja vu, which is the
most common type that’s usually experienced

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.780
by healthy people.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.100
And then there’s biological deja vu - which
is almost exclusively experienced by people

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.100
with epilepsy.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.339
Often times, they say it occurs immediately
before having a seizure.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.600
And that medical basis actually makes it a
lot easier to study than associative deja

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.830
vu, which relies entirely on secondhand experiences.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.050
For most of the 20th century, researchers
relied on the paramnesia theory to explain

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.050
deja vu.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.080
It was an idea proposed by Sigmund Freud,
that said the phenomenon was likely caused

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.680
by repressed memories of a stressful event,
that people couldn’t access anymore, as

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.130
part of their regular memory.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.350
It wasn’t until recently, when things like
brain imaging became standard, that real scientific

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.880
research - and not just speculation - was
poured into the subject.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.470
Nowadays, it’s widely agreed that the medial
temporal lobe - the part of our brain involved

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.050
in conscious memory - plays a significant
role in deja vu.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.810
This region happens to contain the hippocampus,
and more specifically, the parahippocampal

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.030
gyrus - which is what enables us to determine
what's familiar and what isn't.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.450
Of course, knowing that this part of the brain
is related to deja vu - still doesn’t explain

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.660
why we experience it.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.250
So in attempt to explain that, Dr. Alan Brown
from Duke University, concocted something

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.780
called the Cell Phone Theory, which revolves
around the idea of subliminal cues.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.179
In his study, he showed a group of students
a series of photographs of various locations

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.880
- none of which they’d actually been to
- and then he asked them how familiar those

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.549
locations were.

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.830
Just beforehand, though, he flashed SOME of
the photos on a screen for 10-20 milliseconds

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.579
- which is just long enough for their brains
to register it, but not enough to actually

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.670
be consciously aware of what they saw.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.160
Sure enough, the images that were subconsciously
flashed - appeared more familiar to the students,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.519
than ones that weren’t.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.700
And those findings, he argued, could be applied
to deja vu.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.610
The idea being that whenever we feel like
we’ve seen or done something before, it’s

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.469
because we have - but during that prior experience,
our brains were distracted - allowing us to

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.150
subconsciously process that moment, without
actually remembering that we experienced it.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.950
Seems solid enough, but that is just one theory,
of many.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.290
There’s another one, called the Hologram
Theory, proposed by Dutch psychiatrist Hermon

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.749
Sno, that likens humans memories to holograms,
in the sense that our brains are capable of

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.620
constructing whole 3D images from smaller
fragments of other memories.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.730
So for example, if we were to step into a
room that looks similar to a room we’ve

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.110
been in before - then our brains might reconstruct
an entire false scenario based around that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.349
one memory fragment.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.519
Again, an entirely plausible theory.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.980
But there are some different ones out there
- like the Dual Processing theory - which

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.469
claims that past experiences actually have
nothing to do with deja vu, and instead, chalk

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.249
it up to a delayed neurological response.

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.749
The idea behind this one, is that because
there are multiple pathways through which

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:33.400
our brains process incoming information, it’s
possible that those pathways may not always

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.689
synchronize correctly.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.040
So any delay between the time it takes for
our left brain hemisphere and our right brain

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.460
hemisphere to process information, could force
our brains to register something we’ve JUST

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.469
seen, as a previous memory.

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.940
Of course, like most areas of science, there’s
really no simple explanation as to why we

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.059
experience deja vu.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:56.340
These are just three, of the hundreds of theories
out there - and of which seem equally plausible.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.569
Still interesting to think about though!

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.299
And who knows, maybe you guys have some theories
of your own.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.739
Or at the very least, interesting stories
to share.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.530
If so, just leave em in the comments below,
and as always - thank you guys for watching!
