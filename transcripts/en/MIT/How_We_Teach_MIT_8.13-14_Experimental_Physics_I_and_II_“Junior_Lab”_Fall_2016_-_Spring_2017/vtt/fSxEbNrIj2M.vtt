ATISSA BANUAZIZI:
So I think it's

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.500
somewhat of a misconception
that communication

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.700
can be separated from the
work that scientists do.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.890
Because so much
of what scientists

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.280
do in their daily
lives is communication.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.910
If you are a scientist, and
you are doing really, really

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.780
exciting work, that
work is not going

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.310
to have any kind of impact if
you can't tell people about it.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.330
And a lot of the actual
work that scientists

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.840
do is writing up their results,
is talking about their results

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.010
in all kinds of settings
and to all kinds of people.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.520
And MIT students, they're
very proud of their work.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.900
And they want their
work to have impact.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.410
And I think there
is an understanding

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.520
that the way to have
impact is to make sure

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.860
that other people understand it.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.030
And if other people don't,
then the work languishes.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.650
And there are all sorts
of reasons why people

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.420
want to communicate their work.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.380
They may want to communicate
their work in classes, sure,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.760
to get a good grade.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.330
But they also eventually
will be asking for funding.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.920
They will be
communicating their work

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.030
to change the direction of
research in their field.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.980
They want to change the world.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.970
That's going to happen if and
only if they can talk about it

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.750
and write about it effectively.
