00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:09.361
You're facing a giant bowl

00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:12.454
of energy packed Carbon Crunchies.

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:15.451
One spoonful. Two. Three.

00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.812
Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:19.703
that comes from your meal.

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:22.813
But how did that energy get into your bowl?

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:25.502
Energy exists in the form of sugars

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:28.313
made by the plant your cereal came from,

00:00:28.313 --> 00:00:29.979
like wheat or corn.

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:33.313
As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone,

00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:35.011
and plants get their fix of it

00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:38.515
in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2,

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:40.433
from the air that we all breath.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.602
But how does a plant's energy factory,

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:45.021
housed in the stroma of the chloroplast,

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:47.811
turn a one carbon gas, like CO2,

00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:51.774
into a six carbon solid, like glucose?

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:55.029
If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right.

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:58.240
But photosynthesis is divided into two steps.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.782
The first, which stores energy from the sun

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:05.343
in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.

00:01:05.343 --> 00:01:08.842
And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:10.928
and turns it into sugar.

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:13.296
This second phase represents one of nature's

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:15.796
most sustainable production lines.

00:01:15.796 --> 00:01:20.426
And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory.

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:21.844
The starting materials?

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:24.308
A mix of CO2 molecules from the air,

00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:26.760
and preassembled molecules called

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.399
ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP,

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.261
each containing five carbons.

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:36.178
The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco

00:01:36.178 --> 00:01:39.614
that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:41.593
with the RuBP chain

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:44.618
to build an initial six carbon sequence.

00:01:44.618 --> 00:01:47.873
That rapidly splits into two shorter chains

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.874
containing three carbons each

00:01:49.874 --> 00:01:54.391
and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short.

00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.550
Enter ATP, and another chemical called

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.678
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,

00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:04.806
or just NADPH.

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:07.725
ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy,

00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:13.511
while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains,

00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:15.427
changing them into molecules called

00:02:15.427 --> 00:02:19.610
glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.531
Glucose needs six carbons to form,

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.242
made from two molecules of G3P,

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.426
which incidentally have six carbons between them.

00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:30.844
So, sugar has just been manufactured, right?

00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:32.511
Not quite.

00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:35.878
The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line,

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:38.178
meaning that those original RuBPs

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:40.272
that kicked things off at the start,

00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:42.727
need to be recreated by reusing materials

00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:44.359
within the cycle now.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.976
But each RuBP needs five carbons

00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:49.809
and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six.

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.394
Something doesn't add up.

00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:54.195
The answer lies in one phenomenal fact.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:57.225
While we've been focusing on this single production line,

00:02:57.225 --> 00:03:00.725
five others have been happening at the same time.

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:03.662
With six conveyor belts moving in unison,

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:05.809
there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.416
to one RuBP chain,

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:11.590
but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.091
That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two,

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:18.726
meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist:

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:21.308
the precise number needed to manufacture sugar,

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:24.392
and rebuild those RuBPs.

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:27.187
Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together,

00:03:27.187 --> 00:03:28.940
two are siphoned off to form

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.309
that energy rich six carbon glucose chain.

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.614
The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success!

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:37.617
But back on the manufacturing line,

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.617
the byproducts of this sugar production

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:44.202
are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs.

00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:46.892
That requires 30 carbons,

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:51.002
the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS.

00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:54.315
Now a molecular mix and match occurs.

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:56.422
Two of the G3Ps are welded together

00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:58.589
forming a six carbon sequence.

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.875
By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.957
The first RuBP, made up of five carbons,

00:04:05.957 --> 00:04:07.599
is cast from this,

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.559
leaving four carbons behind.

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.104
But there's no wastage here.

00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:14.293
Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule,

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:16.315
making a seven carbon chain.

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.541
Added to a fifth G3P molecule,

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.707
a ten carbon chain is created,

00:04:20.707 --> 00:04:24.074
enough now to craft two more RuBPs.

00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:26.875
With three full RuBPs recreated

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:29.204
from five of the ten G3Ps,

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:31.207
simply duplicating this process

00:04:31.207 --> 00:04:33.875
will renew the six RuBP chains

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:36.671
needed to restart the cycle again.

00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.089
So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:40.793
of elements and processes

00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:43.375
required to keep this biochemical production line

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:45.208
turning endlessly.

00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:47.127
And it's just one of the 100s of cycles

00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:48.625
present in nature.

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:49.959
Why so many?

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:53.060
Because if biological production processes were linear,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.730
they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.444
at using energy to manufacture the materials

00:04:58.444 --> 00:05:01.238
that nature relies upon, like sugar.

00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:03.355
Cycles create vital feedback loops

00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:06.857
that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients

00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:08.609
crafting as much as possible

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.987
out of the planet's available resources.

00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:12.768
Such as that sugar,

00:05:12.768 --> 00:05:14.819
built using raw sunlight and carbon

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.650
converted in plant factories

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.653
to become the energy that powers you

00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:21.652
and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life.
