[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:07.490
KYLE MCDONALD: Hey, I'm Kyle.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.770
MANNY TAN: I'm Manny.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.450
YOTAM MANN: Hi, I'm Yotam.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.202
This is something we made called
the Infinite Drum Machine.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:17.277
[PERCUSSIVE SOUNDS]

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:19.860
It's basically an experiment to
see how machine learning might

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.460
organize everyday sounds.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.680
So anyone who's ever had
to work with a lot of sound

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.090
can see why this is hard.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.480
For example, we can all hear
that this is similar to this,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.310
but totally different from this.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.480
But it's hard to
articulate exactly why,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.040
because sounds are complicated.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.160
But this is the kind
of thing the machine

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.450
learning is really good at.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.050
So we ran a little test.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.050
We played thousands of
sounds for the computer.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.230
We didn't give it descriptions,
or tags, or any hints on how

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.960
people usually organize sound.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.140
We wanted instead to see
if it could listen to them,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.690
and automatically learn its
own way to organize them.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.810
KYLE MCDONALD: This experiment
uses a technique called t-SNE.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.690
First, the computer
creates a fingerprint

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.020
from each sample,
which is like an image,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.590
or a set of numbers
that represents

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.280
that particular sound.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.170
Then t-SNE compares
all the fingerprints,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.470
and places similar
sounds closer together.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350
One way to think about
t-SNE, is that it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.400
taking these fingerprints from
high-dimensional space, which

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.540
means a space with more
than three dimensions,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.420
and reducing them.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.660
In this case, to two dimensions,
so that we can visualize it.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.470
MANNY TAN: And our
test basically worked.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.430
This is the t-SNE that we got.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.856
We put it on the web so
anyone can play with it.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.790
You get these neighborhoods
of similar sounds

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.460
that you can explore
by dragging around.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.529
[PERCUSSIVE SOUNDS]

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.570
And make beats with them
using this drum machine.

[PERCUSSIVE SOUNDS]

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.970
We're hoping people find
it fun, whether you're

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.380
more into the machine learning
side or more into making music.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.830
You can play with it and get
the code at g.co/aiexperiments.
