00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.120
PROFESSOR COPELAND: So,
the number 197.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.380
And what I'm going to
do is I'm going to

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.750
add the three digits.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.780
So 1 plus 9 plus 7 is 17.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.150
Now what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to form a number out

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.760
of the last two digits
of the original

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.900
number and the new number.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.850
9 plus 7 plus 17,
and that is 33.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.410
And now I'm going to
do the same again.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.230
So, it's 7 plus 17 plus 33,
and that gives me 57.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.820
You're beginning to
get the idea.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.110
17 plus 33 plus 57, and
that gives me 107.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.180
And now--

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.440
ready, you've been
very patient--

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.310
the Keith number is
about to emerge.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:56.550
33 plus 57 plus 107, and look
what I get when I do that.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.090
I get 197.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.395
BRADY HARAN: That's
quite interesting.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.960
I can't decide if these would
be really, really rare or

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.410
really, really common.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.970
Intuitively, it strikes me
that this would be rare.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.270
PROFESSOR COPELAND:
They're very rare.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.080
This is a number with
three digits.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.920
There are only 80 of order 80
numbers, 80 Keith Numbers,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.080
with less than--

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.720
BRADY HARAN: Of order 80.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.150
Hang on.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.850
I don't like this of order.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.760
PROFESSOR COPELAND: There
are in fact 84.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:35.980
84 Keith numbers with
less than 26 digits.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.280
BRADY HARAN: Once you get more
than three digits, how do you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.300
start this process?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.660
PROFESSOR COPELAND: So you start
with 2785, for example.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.430
Then you would begin your
process with 2 plus 7 plus 8

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.300
plus 5, which is equal to--

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.040
10, 17--

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.060
22.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.640
And the next stage along the
line is you take the preceding

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.520
three digits and add the fourth
from the new number.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.275
So it would be 7 plus
8 plus 5 plus 22.

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:11.800
There are, for example,
two-digit numbers.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.350
OK, so if I take d equals 2,
and 14 is a Keith number,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.820
you'd go 1 plus 4 is 5.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.800
4 plus 5 is nine.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.140
5 plus 9 is 14.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.210
Mike Keith, who's a
mathematician and discovered

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.830
them in 1987--

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.050
for me, this is recreational
mathematics.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.080
It's how I got into
mathematics.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.480
My hero wasn't a physicist early
on, it was actually a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.870
guy called Martin Gardner.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.460
I'd never heard of [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.380
earlier on when I was
at school in Gauss.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.050
But Martin Gardner was this guy,
brilliant mathematician,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.230
that worked--

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.490
I knew him as the guy working
for "Scientific American." And

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.020
I subscribed to "Scientific
American," and I never

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.250
understood as a single
article I read.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.310
I kept trying to, and so I'd
reread it, and it'd be a blur.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.380
But you had these mathematics
puzzles at the back, and I

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.000
generally couldn't do them
either, but I was

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.940
fascinated by them.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.840
They were little numerology
things.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.400
And then I went and bought some
of his books and just got

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.710
into it, just playing around
with numbers, and you just get

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.800
to love them.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.270
BRADY HARAN: So the people who
watch Numberphile and get a

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.950
bit sniffy about our
recreational maths videos,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.080
what do you say to them?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.970
PROFESSOR COPELAND:
Oh, you shouldn't.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.990
You should just enjoy it.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.040
Embrace it.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.140
And just have fun.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.830
Just have fun playing
around with them.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.340
There's plenty of occasions when
you doodling thinking,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.040
what shall I do.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.240
And just play around with
numbers, and you'll be amazed

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.560
some of the coincidences
that can come up.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.110
And out of some of these
things come major

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.890
breakthroughs.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.810
We're not quite finished.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.530
There's just a couple more
things which are around there.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.800
There's one called the reverse
Keith, and this is where--

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.300
so again, it's best just to
show you an example of the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.310
reverse Keith number.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.980
It's where the reverse number
appears in the sequence.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.210
So if I begin say with 12.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.020
OK.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.770
So we just follow the
prescription that we've had.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:22.360
So we go 1 plus 2, 2 plus 3, 3
plus 5, 5 plus 8, 8 plus 13,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.680
and that's equal to 21.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.330
And that's your reverse
Keith number.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.140
You've reversed the order of the
integers in the original.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.515
There's even fewer of what you
could call Keith clusters.

00:04:35.515 --> 00:04:39.030
Mike Keith has got a conjecture
about these Keith

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.980
numbers, his numbers.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.540
He's allowed to have a
conjecture about his own

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.700
numbers, of course.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.220
And they're to do with the
clustering of these numbers.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.870
And what he's done is he's said,
how many ways can you

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.110
cluster the Keith numbers such
that in any cluster, which

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.755
could have--

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.875
of course, a cluster has to have
more than one number-- so

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:01.670
it could have two numbers, three
numbers, four numbers.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.880
Each number in that cluster is
an integer multiple of the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.620
lowest number.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.940
His conjecture is
the following.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.670
There are three that are known,
just three, and he says

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.220
he believes that's
all there are.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.540
So I think it's quite an
interesting challenge for some

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.410
of the Numberphile people to go
and maybe find some more.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.685
So--

00:05:20.685 --> 00:05:21.840
BRADY HARAN: So what's
a Keith cluster?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.020
PROFESSOR COPELAND: So
here's an example

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.360
of the Keith cluster.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.790
So the number 14 and 28 are
both Keith numbers, and of

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.630
course, 28 is twice 14.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.040
And another Keith cluster
is the number 1,004--

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.660
1,104 and then if I
double that 2,208.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.250
You've also got to have
the same number of

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.720
digits in the sequence.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.100
There is, remarkably, one
cluster of three Keith numbers

00:05:52.100 --> 00:06:04.520
which is 31331, of course,
62662, 93993.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.850
I think that's amazing.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.080
Each of those are
Keith numbers.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.960
They all satisfy the properties
that we've been

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.390
describing, and they
form this cluster.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.840
So the conjecture
is that's it.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.480
I used to do these puzzles on
the bus going to school.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.180
I had to get two buses, and
I'd just try and do, well,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.140
whatever I could.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.440
Usually, I got stuck,
especially with the

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.520
geometrical ones.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.310
He has geometrical puzzles
as well as sort of basic

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.770
algebraic ones.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.023
And then he has his own
puzzles and paradoxes.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.270
How can you get a infinite
number of people in a hotel

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.550
with an infinite number of
rooms and then double the

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.240
number of people and things?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.490
It was great.
