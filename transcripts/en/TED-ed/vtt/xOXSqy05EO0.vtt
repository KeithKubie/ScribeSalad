00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.507
Can plants talk to each other?

00:00:10.507 --> 00:00:12.347
It certainly doesn't seem that way.

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:16.434
Plants don't have complex sensory
or nervous systems like animals do,

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.008
and they look pretty passive,

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:19.197
basking in the sun,

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:23.389
and responding instinctively
to inputs like light and water.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:26.994
But odd as it sounds, 
plants can communicate with each other.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:30.788
Just like animals, plants produce 
all kinds of chemical signals

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:32.880
in response to their environments,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.370
and they can share those signals
with each other,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.000
especially when they're under attack.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.905
These signals take two routes:

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:40.793
through the air,

00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:42.367
and through the soil.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:43.832
When plant leaves get damaged,

00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:47.233
whether by hungry insects
or an invading lawn mower,

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.400
they release plumes
of volatile chemicals.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.422
They're what's responsible for the smell
of freshly cut grass.

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:57.315
Certain kinds of plants, 
like sagebrush and lima beans,

00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:00.213
are able to pick up on those
airborne messages

00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:03.981
and adjust their 
own internal chemistry accordingly.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:08.489
In one experiment, sagebrush leaves
were deliberately damaged by insects

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:11.074
or scissor-wielding scientists.

00:01:11.074 --> 00:01:12.185
Throughout the summer,

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:14.438
other branches on the same sagebrush plant

00:01:14.438 --> 00:01:17.721
got eaten less 
by insects wandering through,

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:19.844
and so did branches on neighboring bushes,

00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:24.514
suggesting that they had beefed up
their anti-insect defenses.

00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:28.570
Even moving the air from above
a clipped plant to another one

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.149
made the second plant 
more insect-resistant.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.039
These airborne cues increase 
the likelihood of seedling survival,

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.799
and made adult plants produce
more new branches and flowers.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.822
But why would a plant warn
its neighbors of danger,

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:47.307
especially if they're competing 
for resources?

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:52.003
Well, it might be an accidental 
consequence of a self-defense mechanism.

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:56.219
Plants can't move information through
their bodies as easily as we can,

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.955
especially if water is scarce.

00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:01.663
So plants may rely 
on those airborne chemicals

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:05.526
to get messages from 
one part of a plant to another.

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:08.547
Nearby plants can eavesdrop 
on those signals,

00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:13.026
like overhearing your neighbor sneeze
and stocking up on cold medicine.

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:16.728
Different plants convey those warnings
using different chemical languages.

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:19.462
Individual sagebrush plants 
in the same meadow

00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:22.458
release slightly different sets
of alarm chemicals.

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:27.602
The makeup of that cocktail influences
the effectiveness of communication.

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:31.051
The more similar 
two plants' chemical fingerprints are,

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.850
the more fluently they can communicate.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.941
A plant will be most sensitive to the cues
emitted by its own leaves.

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.932
But because these chemicals seem
to be inherited,

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:42.828
like human blood types,

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:45.352
sagebrush plants communicate 
more effectively

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:48.139
with relatives than with strangers.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.880
But sometimes, even other species
can benefit.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.126
Tomato and tobacco plants can both
decipher sagebrush warning signals.

00:02:56.126 --> 00:03:00.437
Plants don't have to rely solely
on those airborne broadcasts.

00:03:00.437 --> 00:03:03.851
Signals can travel 
below the soil surface, too.

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.683
Most plants have a symbiotic relationship
with fungi,

00:03:06.683 --> 00:03:11.443
which colonize the plants' roots
and help them absorb water and nutrients.

00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:14.823
These fungal filaments 
form extensive networks

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:17.043
that can connect separate plants,

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:21.623
creating an underground super highway
for chemical messages.

00:03:21.623 --> 00:03:23.618
When a tomato plant responds to blight

00:03:23.618 --> 00:03:26.671
by acitvating disease-fighting 
genes and enzymes,

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.865
signaling molecules produced
by its immune system

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:31.789
can travel to a healthy plant

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.336
and prompt it to turn on
its immune system, too.

00:03:35.336 --> 00:03:39.514
These advance warnings increase
the plants chance of survival.

00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:42.897
Bean plants also eavesdrop
on each other's health

00:03:42.897 --> 00:03:45.056
through these fungal conduits.

00:03:45.056 --> 00:03:47.278
An aphid investation in one plant

00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:52.518
triggers its neighbor to ramp up
production of compounds that repel aphids

00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:56.348
and attract aphid-eating wasps.

00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:59.509
If you think of communication
as an exchange of information,

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.371
then plants seem to be 
active communicators.

00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:05.202
They're sending, receiving, 
and responding to signals

00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:06.686
without making a sound,

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:11.319
and without brains, noses, dictionaries,
or the Internet.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.992
And if we can learn to speak to them
on their terms,

00:04:13.992 --> 00:04:19.564
we may gain a powerful new tool to protect
crops and other valuable species.

00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:22.255
It all makes you wonder 
what else are we missing?
