00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:02.464
- [Voiceover] Okay,
there's one more feature

00:00:02.464 --> 00:00:05.008
of complex numbers that
I want to share with you

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.341
and we'll do that down here.

00:00:10.775 --> 00:00:15.101
So, our definition of
j is j squared equals

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.424
minus one, and now what I want to do

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:20.731
is a sequence of multiplications by j.

00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:25.405
This is a really important
property of this imaginary unit.

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:27.617
We're gonna do powers of j

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:30.099
and I'm going to plot them,
while we're doing that

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.541
I'm gonna plot them on the imaginary,

00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.511
or on the complex plane.

00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:38.678
So, this is the real axis and
this is the imaginary axis.

00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:40.966
So, I'm gonna take powers of j,

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:45.077
so first one j to the zero,
and anything to the zero

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:47.660
is one, so j to the zero is one

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:51.719
and if we plot that on the imaginary axis,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.802
here's one, and there's no real part.

00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:02.187
So, it's just right on the real axis.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.182
Okay, let's do j to the one,

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:06.977
that's j times itself one time,

00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:09.130
so that is equal to j.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.708
If I plot that number, that's up here,

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:16.875
that's up on the imaginary
axis right there, there's j.

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:22.905
Alright, this has no real
part, it's all imaginary.

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:24.508
Let's keep going.

00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:28.359
Let's do j squared and
what is that equal to?

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.732
Well, I wrote it down up here,

00:01:29.732 --> 00:01:32.999
j squared is equal to minus one.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.907
So, j squared is equal to minus one,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:36.802
where's that in the complex plane?

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:39.302
That's over here at minus one,

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:46.657
on the real axis, no imaginary part.

00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:48.285
Let's do the next one.

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:49.702
Let's do j cubed.

00:01:50.964 --> 00:01:52.388
What is that equal to?

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:56.555
J to the third power is
equal to j squared times j

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.892
and we have those two right here,

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:06.642
j squared is minus one
and j to the one is j,

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:11.855
so that equals minus j,

00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:15.364
and where do we plot that?

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:18.131
We plot that down on the imaginary axis

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:22.411
in the complex plane, right here, minus j.

00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:24.509
Okay, now we've got four answers.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.678
Let's go one or two more.

00:02:26.678 --> 00:02:30.156
Okay, j to the fourth is equal to what?

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:33.489
It's equal to j squared times j squared.

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:35.376
Let's look that up.

00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:37.959
It's minus one times minus one,

00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:41.182
and what does that equal to?

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:42.515
That equals one.

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:45.327
So, let's go plot that.

00:02:45.327 --> 00:02:46.810
Well, we've already plotted it,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.268
so that's this answer right here.

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:50.858
Alright, so we already have that,

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.895
let's do one more.

00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:55.286
J to the fifth, what is that equal to?

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:58.286
That equals j to the fourth times j,

00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:04.189
and j to the fourth is
right here, it's one times j

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.939
equals j, let's go plot that one.

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:11.451
Well, we've already plotted it,

00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:13.589
it's already right here.

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:17.166
Okay, so, you can see
there's a pattern here,

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.166
one j minus one minus j.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.425
One j, it's gonna by
minus one and minus j,

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:26.008
it keeps repeating.

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:29.183
Here's what's interesting
about this, okay.

00:03:29.183 --> 00:03:32.605
If we draw this as
vectors, if I draw these

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:36.112
imaginary numbers as
vectors, when I multiply

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:39.173
by j, when I multiplied one by j,

00:03:39.173 --> 00:03:41.173
it rotated it 90 degrees

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.132
and then that was the
first step right here

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:49.830
when I multiplied one times j, I got j.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.472
Now, when we went to j squared,

00:03:51.472 --> 00:03:52.810
we ended up at minus one.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.698
So, multiplying by j again,

00:03:54.698 --> 00:03:59.033
caused the vector to
go down here, like that

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:02.385
and that was another 90 degrees

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:04.302
and if I take it again,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.367
the next one went this way

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:13.685
and the final one went this way.

00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:16.665
So, this is the property of j,

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:19.413
this is the key property
of the imaginary unit,

00:04:19.413 --> 00:04:21.544
multiplying by the imaginary unit,

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:25.784
the nature of it is
this 90 degree rotation.

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:28.511
There's this idea of a number that causes

00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:32.494
other numbers to rotate
and that's the feature of j

00:04:32.494 --> 00:04:34.335
that makes it super important

00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:36.176
and it's the reason we use

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:39.834
imaginary numbers in
electrical engineering.

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:43.167
So, the key idea here is that j rotates.

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.220
That's the point.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.917
That's what we love about j.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.176
So, the last thing I want to mention

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:55.300
is the negative powers of j.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.990
What happens if we have
j to the minus one?

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.278
Let's figure out what that means.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:02.793
So, that, of course, is one over j

00:05:02.793 --> 00:05:05.626
and if I multiply this by j over j

00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:09.984
and anything over itself is one,

00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:12.504
so I haven't changed the value of this

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:16.671
and that equals j on top
over j times j or j squared

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:22.885
and what is j squared equal to?

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:25.918
We wrote it down right here,
j squared is minus one,

00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:29.918
so this equals j over
minus 1 or equals minus j.

00:05:34.552 --> 00:05:37.148
So, whenever we see a j in a fraction,

00:05:37.148 --> 00:05:39.748
j to the minus one,
basically it introduces

00:05:39.748 --> 00:05:41.701
a minus sign and the j comes up

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.965
to the top out of the fraction.

00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:47.048
So, j to the minus one equals minus j

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:53.164
and we'll use that occasionally
to help us in our math.

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:55.375
So, this was a really quick review

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:58.458
of complex numbers and if any of this

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.793
was new to you, I really encourage

00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:04.923
you to go back and watch Sal's
videos on complex numbers

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:07.217
and if this is something
you've seen before,

00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:09.209
I hope it knocked off some of the rust

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:12.212
and we're ready to go
and use these numbers.
