00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Today, we're going to show you
how to build a DIY teleprompter

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.178
that will let you
read out a script

00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:05.800
while you're looking
right at the camera.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.600
[Music]

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.680
Guys, believe it or not,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.800
almost everything
that we've said on this channel

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.180
has been without the use
of a teleprompter.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.880
Some of you may be
surprised to learn that,

00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:21.233
because in my first videos,

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:24.200
I was awkwardly staring straight
at the camera, rarely blinking,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.040
or interacting
with my surroundings.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.180
It was a struggle for a while.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.656
I'd like to think
I've gotten better,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.460
and don't need
to do that anymore.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.600
However, we are going to show
you how to build a teleprompter,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.500
because they can be very useful.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.020
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.700
Using foam core, hot glue,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.884
and a sheet of acrylic,

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:42.478
we can help you make
a teleprompter that will fit

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:44.100
to your camera and smartphone.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.670
So guys, a lot of YouTubers

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.460
and a lot of people
on TV use teleprompters.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.000
They're incredibly useful.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.280
They make it really easy.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.600
If you have a lot
of bullet points,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.300
you've got to hit really fast.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.100
Well, you've got
to memorize that,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.960
unless you have a teleprompter.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.800
Teleprompters aren't
for every situation.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.600
If you're acting
on stage, or screen,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.660
something like that,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.300
then you can't be looking
right at the camera,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.220
which is where the cues are
usually going to be scrolling.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.000
But for anything
where you're really trying

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
to just focus on the camera
itself, maybe vlogging,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.740
or showing a DIY video
that has a lot to say,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.840
it can really save a lot of time

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.540
so you don't have to sit
and memorize lines forever.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.200
The supplies you'll need
to build this are

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.330
actually very simple.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.962
We've got a sheet of acrylic.

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:27.835
This is an 8x10 sheet I picked
up at the hardware store

00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:29.600
for like less than four bucks.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.358
We've got a sheet of craft foam.

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:33.300
This stuff comes
from Hobby Lobby,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.390
costs about $1.50.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.800
This is the thickest
stuff they have.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.500
You could get something
a little bit thinner,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.320
but I like it with
the thicker version.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.940
We have a hot glue gun,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.680
pretty much any hot glue gun
is going to work.

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:44.288
And then we also have foam core.

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:46.290
This is the stuff
that's paper on the outside,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.940
and like a styrofoam middle.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.740
We've got a
clicking razor blade,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.340
very useful because
if it started get to dull,

00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:52.892
you can just break the tip off,

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:54.194
and keep using the rest of it.

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:55.767
Pencil, it's good
for marking things,

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:56.967
and this piece of paper,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:58.800
which were actually
just going to fold,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.160
and use as a 45
degree angle guide.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.800
The other things you're going to
need are a camera to film with,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.388
and a smartphone to run
the teleprompter app.

00:02:06.388 --> 00:02:09.300
This app that I'm using is
the Parrot Teleprompter app.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.102
The Parrot Teleprompter
is a commercially

00:02:11.102 --> 00:02:13.860
available version of
what we're building today.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100
It's a bit more sturdy than what
we are going to build today,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.900
but it cost quite
a bit more as well.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.969
The app however is free,

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.060
so that's what we're going to
be using with our DIY version.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.000
Before we started this build,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.964
I reached out to a friend
of mine named Brigham,

00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:27.100
who actually invented
the Parrot Teleprompter,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.300
and I asked him some questions

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.680
about his design
and invention process

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.600
so we could know what
we were getting into.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.900
So the design itself is
actually deceptively simple,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.600
but there are
some few basic things

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.093
that you really
want to keep in mind

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:40.800
when you're building
one of these to make

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.400
it actually flawless.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.500
One of those things is the angle
of your acrylic to make sure

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.800
that everything is actually
lining up correctly.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.600
The other thing

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.200
that you really need to take
into account is the vignette.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.511
You don't want your camera lens
to catch the side of the box

00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.100
of the teleprompter itself.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.030
We're going to want to build
this custom to our camera

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.960
and our phone.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.130
Every phone is going
to be different,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.800
a lot of cameras
are going to be different.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.900
You can see,
this right here is the camera

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.480
that our cameraman
Mark usually uses.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.000
He's currently using
our emergency backup camera,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
so we can see
his primary camera.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.600
Sorry, Mark.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.425
And so we have
to build onto this,

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.039
so that it all works smoothly.

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.900
So to start off,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.800
we're just going to cut some 4
inch strips of our foam core

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.050
that's a large enough size

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.000
that we can cut it
down to what we need,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.100
but we won't end up with
any pieces that are too small.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.500
The first piece that we're going
to want to cut out of these,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.300
that's actually going to be part
of the body of the teleprompter

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.700
is going to be the pieces
that hold our phone.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.336
This is going to be
the basic idea here

00:03:35.336 --> 00:03:36.800
is we're just going
to have a slit,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.300
a rectangular hole cut into this
that our phone fits in nicely,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.700
and that's going
to hold it in place,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.660
and just generally do
everything we want to in terms

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.500
of keeping our hardware
where we need it.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.960
[Music]

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.920
I measured correctly.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.900
That's actually quite snug.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.719
As you can see,
it's not falling out like that.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.376
That's pretty good thing,
and then trim this,

00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:01.150
I'm going to give myself
too much space here.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.400
It's not going to be this tall.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.550
This is just moving on,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.200
and now, we need to build
another one exactly like that.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.940
Got our two pieces
that hold the phone, however,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.840
with my particular phone,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.700
I have the camera
that sticks out.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.924
It's not quite flush
with the rest of the phone body,

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.140
and I want it to fit

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.910
just right so I'm actually going
to cut that notch out as well.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.300
I'm gonna show you why.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.785
So you can see
here the width that

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:27.997
the teleprompter text runs at,

00:04:27.997 --> 00:04:31.020
and we want to encase
it about that width,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.600
and so we want this side to get
in a little bit closer.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.700
But right now,
it's bumping into my camera.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.000
So I need to cut a notch
so it doesn't do that.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.360
[Music]

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.580
How did I do?

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.100
Nice.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.840
[Music]

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.100
So obviously, we're going
to cut these down to size.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.000
But the next step
is going to be to cut

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
some 45 degree angle slits
into the side,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.700
that's going to be what holds
our acrylic piece in place.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.480
Piece of paper folded
across diagonally.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.860
It should give us
a perfect 45 degree angle.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.100
Here is where we're going
to want our piece of acrylic.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.414
We've got the piece of paper,

00:05:06.414 --> 00:05:08.000
and I'm just going
to set that right

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.100
onto the screen of the phone,
and then this line,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.500
where we can mark.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.900
Same thing on the other side.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.500
We've got our 45 degree
angle lines, and now,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.600
we need to cut out a small slot,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.016
the same thickness
as our acrylic sheet.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.640
We have the lines drawn longer
than they needed to be.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.890
We don't need to have
this extend all the way down

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.260
off of the foam core.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.000
We're going to have
it stopped right here,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.500
a little bit above
the height of the phone.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.980
We can see that it's
maybe five millimeters

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.980
above the height
of the phone screen,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.000
and on the other end,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.249
it doesn't need to extend
all the way to the end

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:44.840
of the phone screen either.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.420
So we're just going to cut
it off right about here,

00:05:47.422 --> 00:05:48.384
and all the light

00:05:48.384 --> 00:05:51.100
from the phone will be shining
up this direction.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.200
This is actually an interesting
demonstration right here

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.757
about how exactly
a teleprompter works.

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:00.700
So our camera will be
filming this direction.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.000
So we'll have the lens

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.900
of the camera will be
about right here,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.400
filming out here.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.900
This is where the person
being filmed is.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.860
Phone screen is down
here pointing up.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.000
The acrylic is reflective,
but not as much as a mirror.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.725
So light coming
off of our phone,

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:17.564
the text that's
being written on it,

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:19.300
is going to bounce up.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.550
Some of it is going to go right
through the acrylic,

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.740
and it's just going to keep
going that direction.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.690
But some of the light is going
to hit the acrylic pane,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.180
and at a 45 degree angle,
it's going to bounce off.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.600
And remember, this is
where we are over here.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.500
So we're going to be able to see
what's on the phone screen

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.340
as it bounces off this way.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.080
But because of the angle,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.300
the camera isn't going
to see any of that light.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.200
The phone isn't going
to bounce light

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.300
off the acrylic this direction.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.220
That just doesn't happen.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.500
It's only going to go either
straight through the acrylic,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500
or bounce off the 45 degree
angle out towards us.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.760
So a tip for you,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.400
if you're ever cutting
mat for something

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.857
that needs to look really
really pretty, make sure

00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:01.258
that you're cutting inwards.

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:03.650
You don't want to ever cut
outwards towards the mat

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.000
you're going to be keeping.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.800
You might end up
with like a score mark

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800
that you don't want.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.500
In this case,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.200
it doesn't really matter,
but for future reference.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.900
So you cut towards the piece
that isn't going to matter.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.640
So now, to know what size
of acrylic we need,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.200
we're going to measure
the cuts we've already made.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.847
Now, what we also have
to take into account is

00:07:24.847 --> 00:07:26.494
how far apart we want these,

00:07:26.494 --> 00:07:29.258
and again, that depends
on the phone you're using.

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:32.700
So we'll start by just cutting
a 4 inch wide strip of acrylic,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.955
kind of like we did
with our pieces of foam core,

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.400
and we'll then chop it down
to the right width after.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.600
Cutting acrylic is
more like scoring

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.800
and breaking acrylic.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.800
You don't slice all
the way through it,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.100
you cut a deep enough line
that it's slightly weaker there,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.030
and then you snap it over
the corner of something sharp.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.000
All right, I've run several cuts
down through there,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.647
and I mean,

00:07:52.647 --> 00:07:55.000
I haven't even cut 1/4
of the way through,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.800
but it's enough weaker
that I can now take the acrylic,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.700
put it over the edge
of our bench here.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.560
Very nice.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.200
And it just snaps pretty clean.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.260
So in theory,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.040
this now fits into
the slot we just cut.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.860
So we want just a little bit
of extra acrylic on the sides,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.100
so we can adjust
it as necessary.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.980
So I'm just lining up
with phone screen.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.900
[Music]

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.760
Yeah.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.800
Unfortunately, acrylic

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.400
over time will get scratches
and dust on it, unlike glass,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.300
but it is a lot easier to cut.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.000
[Music]

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.180
Yeah.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.300
We don't really need
any height above the top

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.574
of the reflecting screen.

00:08:38.574 --> 00:08:39.900
So let's mark right there,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.600
and then cut both of these posts
off of that height.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.300
[Music]

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.138
So if you have the tools for,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.440
and if you know
how to cut glass,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.126
you could use a glass screen.

00:08:53.126 --> 00:08:55.300
It would last
a little bit longer,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.400
but acrylic is
very easy to cut,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.962
very easy to handle so...

00:08:58.962 --> 00:09:00.280
And it's cheap.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.840
Let's measure to put
a roof on to this.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.800
And before we start gluing
all the pieces together,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.449
there's one more step
we want to take.

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:09.400
We talked about how we
wanted to avoid vignetting.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.500
That's when there's
something on the sides

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.300
that showing up on screen,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.200
and I'm simulating it

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.399
by just giving myself
blinders at the moment.

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.097
If these are
on the edge of the lens,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.740
and they're too far forward,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.320
then you're going to see
them on the sides,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.320
and you're not trying
to record this.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.720
You just want it to be
there holding stuff.

00:09:25.727 --> 00:09:28.846
So to make sure that we
don't get any vignetting,

00:09:28.846 --> 00:09:30.740
any blocking of the visual,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.600
we're also going to cut
out just a little bit

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.390
of a curve shape into these,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.900
to try and minimize
any accidental encroaching

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.607
on the sides.

00:09:38.607 --> 00:09:39.372
There you go,

00:09:39.372 --> 00:09:41.630
and you normally will not see
that in movies,

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.333
but a really easy example,
turn on your camera phone,

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.100
and just put your hand
to the side.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.200
You'll see it.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.720
In the situation like this,
less is more.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.020
Don't melt your phone.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.640
[Music]

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.200
Let's measure for the back.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.000
[Music]

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.500
Before we attach
the back however,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.177
we need to add something else.

00:10:05.177 --> 00:10:06.295
We're going to have

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.100
this back attached
to the lens of the camera,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.660
and not just through the foam,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.800
we're going to be using
our craft foam as a collar

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.852
that fits around the lens,

00:10:14.852 --> 00:10:15.599
because that way,

00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:17.400
it won't just be one ring
around the lens,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.240
but actually a bit
more of a collar.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.370
Here's a one and a half
inch strip of our craft foam.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.500
And now, we're just going
to measure around the lens,

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.480
and glue that into a circle
that fits right around it.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:42.880
[Music]

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.400
Very nice.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.320
Now, there's our back piece.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.180
Here you go.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.500
Now, we want to trace
out the same shape,

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.400
the size of the foam,
not just the lens,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.200
but the foam itself.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.500
That's what's going to be glued
to this piece of foam core.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.466
The really nice part
about working with foam core

00:10:58.466 --> 00:11:01.000
and foam is it's
usually pretty forgiving.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.420
So even if it
isn't a perfect circle,

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.820
it's still gonna work.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.960
[Music]

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.860
Nice.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.280
Here we go.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:20.300
[Music]

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.440
Looks good.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:28.880
[Music]

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.660
Perfection.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.500
The teleprompter box
is mostly built.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.280
There's one more thing
that we might want to do.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.740
We can see how nicely
it fits right over that lens.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.160
Beautiful.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.800
And the last thing

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.000
that we want to add on is
a little bit of support,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.620
because the box itself is
actually quite lightweight.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.600
Once I add the phone,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.200
it's going to get
a little bit heavier,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.354
and it can start
to droop a little bit,

00:11:53.354 --> 00:11:54.468
and aside from that,

00:11:54.468 --> 00:11:57.700
you're really putting more
weight on the end of the camera,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.450
which is going to make
your hands tired

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.800
if you're holding the camera,
so we just want to add

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.066
a little bit of support.

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:03.700
On this one,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.400
what we're going to do is
we're just going to have a piece

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.100
that extends off the bottom,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.909
and rests up against
the base of the camera.

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:13.000
So if it does try
and tip it all,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.200
its leverage is pushing up
against the bottom

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.370
of the camera base.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.700
It should center the weight
so it's all much easier.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:31.580
[Music]

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.700
You can see what it looks
like through the teleprompter,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.000
and you can see what it looks
like from the other side,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
through the camera.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.400
There's our cameraman.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.400
Look, it's not Grant's wife.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.100
So now we want to
challenge each other.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.800
So the plan here is we
are both going to put something

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.800
on the teleprompter
for the other person,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.100
and not tell them
what it's going to be.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.920
And then see how it look.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.500
Now, while she does that,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.748
I want to talk a little bit
about what we are seeing

00:12:59.748 --> 00:13:00.403
in that lens.

00:13:00.403 --> 00:13:01.423
You may have noticed

00:13:01.423 --> 00:13:03.605
that every letter
is slightly doubled,

00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:06.200
its like there's a shadow
behind the letters,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.300
and that's because
our acrylic has two sides

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.300
that are reflecting.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.917
It's not a very
thick sheet of plastic,

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:14.439
but the letters are reflecting
off of one side of the acrylic,

00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:16.290
and then they're reflecting
off of the back

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.700
of the same side of the acrylic.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.040
So you do get
a slight ghosting effect.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.100
If you're using a
professional-grade teleprompter,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.815
they have a few ways
to get around this.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.780
One is by using
a piece of glass,

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.716
and it will usually be
a little bit thinner,

00:13:27.716 --> 00:13:30.500
and it will have a special
reflective coating applied

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.264
to it in just the right spots,

00:13:32.264 --> 00:13:34.500
in just the right amounts
so that it reflects

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.500
the words nicely,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.058
but you can still
see through it,

00:13:37.058 --> 00:13:39.300
and you don't get
that doubled ghosting effect.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.600
This however works pretty well

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.700
for a cheap version
you can throw together.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.020
And if you have
decently large text,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.500
it's not a big distraction.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.140
Good when you are.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.520
I don't know what it is
I'm about to read,

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.700
but I'm gonna give it a shot.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.700
A long time ago,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.833
in a galaxy far far away,
it is a period of Civil War.

00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:01.300
Rebel spaceships striking
from a hidden base have won

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.410
their first victory against
the evil Galactic Empire.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.180
Nice.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.160
And there's a nice title crawl,
just scroll right up there.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.500
Calli's turn.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.000
Your turn.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.500
All right.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.060
I gotta think of something good.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.300
Look, if you had one shot,

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.300
one opportunity to seize
everything you ever wanted,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.023
one moment, would
you capture it,

00:14:22.023 --> 00:14:23.200
or just let it slip?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.250
His palms are sweaty.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.460
Arms are heavy.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.860
There's vomit on his sweater
already, mom's spaghetti.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.500
He's nervous,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.300
but on the surface,
he looks calm

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.500
and ready to drop bombs.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.800
But he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.500
The whole crowd goes so loud.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.200
I think we can do this.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:39.675
Really?

00:14:39.675 --> 00:14:40.955
I give you Star Wars.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.040
You give Eminem?

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.400
That song won an Oscar.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.200
We went ahead and modified one
of our teleprompter builds,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.300
and now we just have
this nice little thing

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.100
that we can drop a smartphone

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.400
into, and use the built-in
camera on that.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.020
It's going to do the same thing.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.270
You can film through the back,
stays in place.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.420
You can see everything
that the camera sees.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.080
Thanks to my friend Brigham
for sharing your experiences,

00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:03.962
and what you learned

00:15:03.962 --> 00:15:05.950
as you're designing
and inventing this thing.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.200
It's really cool version.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.000
Guys, if you aren't going
to be using this DIY version,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.198
if it's something you think
you're going to use a lot,

00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:12.613
every day,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.460
or for lots and lots of videos,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.900
it's probably worth investing
in a professional grade version

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.400
rather than the DIY.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400
It's got some advantages,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.749
but this is definitely
going to work

00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:22.600
if you're just going
to be using it occasionally.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.400
Hey guys, that's all for today.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:24.972
But you know,

00:15:24.972 --> 00:15:26.600
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.049
If you hit that box at the top,

00:15:28.049 --> 00:15:30.200
it will take you directly
to our last video.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.239
You should check that out.

00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:32.392
The other box will show you

00:15:32.392 --> 00:15:34.400
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.300
And if you hit that bomb
in the middle,

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.136
you'll be subscribed

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:39.153
to our channel so you
never miss out on the fun.

00:15:39.153 --> 00:15:40.434
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:15:40.434 --> 00:15:41.797
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:15:41.797 --> 00:15:42.500
Talk to you then.
