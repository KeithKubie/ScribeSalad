notion of how we think about how an
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.960
notion of how we think about how an
entity actually creates value and think

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
entity actually creates value and think
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.610
entity actually creates value and think
about the cost of creating that value

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
about the cost of creating that value
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.970
about the cost of creating that value
and in a systematic way I mean again if

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
and in a systematic way I mean again if
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.280
and in a systematic way I mean again if
my roots are in economics and and that's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
my roots are in economics and and that's
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.020
my roots are in economics and and that's
where my doctorate is and in economics

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030
where my doctorate is and in economics
 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.400
where my doctorate is and in economics
there's a very simple conception of the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
there's a very simple conception of the
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.930
there's a very simple conception of the
firm which is there's a production

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
firm which is there's a production
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.699
firm which is there's a production
function there's labor capital that's

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
function there's labor capital that's
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.220

converted into output and and and and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
converted into output and and and and

that's fine for many economic

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
that's fine for many economic
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.430
that's fine for many economic
applications but in order to really

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
applications but in order to really
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.960
applications but in order to really
understand how think about strategy and

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970
understand how think about strategy and
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.970
understand how think about strategy and
competition and value you need to go

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
competition and value you need to go
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770
competition and value you need to go
beyond that so I think probably that

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780
beyond that so I think probably that
 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.740
beyond that so I think probably that
then would come the diamond theory for

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
then would come the diamond theory for
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.599
then would come the diamond theory for
looking at locations and clusters which

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609
looking at locations and clusters which
 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.550
looking at locations and clusters which
is a close cousin so there's been a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
is a close cousin so there's been a
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.849
is a close cousin so there's been a
succession of these of these frameworks

sermon almost every day in class that
it's the whole it's the parts are

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
it's the whole it's the parts are
 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.479
it's the whole it's the parts are
important it's the whole there's

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489
important it's the whole there's
 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.979
important it's the whole there's
something unique about the whole and how

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989
something unique about the whole and how
 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.150
something unique about the whole and how
you think about the whole and how you

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
you think about the whole and how you
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.249
you think about the whole and how you
get the parts to fit together and that's

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259
get the parts to fit together and that's
 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.270
get the parts to fit together and that's
the essence of

in so it's it's that struggle to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600
in so it's it's that struggle to
 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.300
in so it's it's that struggle to
understand the whole in these

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310
understand the whole in these
 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.790
understand the whole in these
interrelated domains that that really

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800
interrelated domains that that really
 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.050
interrelated domains that that really

know that that contribution has has been
meaningful and and again that that cuts

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920
meaningful and and again that that cuts
 

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.920
meaningful and and again that that cuts
across a variety of different fields but

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:58.930
across a variety of different fields but
 

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.380
across a variety of different fields but
wherever wherever that happens that's

economies you know through through
different sets of policies I think you

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:29.570
different sets of policies I think you
 

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.720
different sets of policies I think you
know and this may be this is you know

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:31.730
know and this may be this is you know
 

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.090
know and this may be this is you know
I'm always a dangerous thing to say but

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.100
I'm always a dangerous thing to say but
 

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.660
I'm always a dangerous thing to say but
I think that we are much closer now to

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:37.670
I think that we are much closer now to
 

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.690
I think that we are much closer now to
understanding what it is that works so

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:42.700
understanding what it is that works so
 

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.750
understanding what it is that works so
now the the real critical questions we

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760
now the the real critical questions we
 

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.960
now the the real critical questions we
often face are given even that even if

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:49.970
often face are given even that even if
 

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.630
often face are given even that even if
we know what works how do we actually

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640
we know what works how do we actually
 

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.630
we know what works how do we actually
mobilize a community or a set of actors

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.640
mobilize a community or a set of actors
 

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.569
mobilize a community or a set of actors
or policymakers actually do that thing

00:10:58.569 --> 00:10:58.579
or policymakers actually do that thing
 

00:10:58.579 --> 00:11:00.670
or policymakers actually do that thing
so again we see this in economic

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680
so again we see this in economic
 

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.670
so again we see this in economic

in 15 minutes we can identify six or
seven critical policy priorities that

seven critical policy priorities that
 

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.550
seven critical policy priorities that
will make an immense difference in the

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560
will make an immense difference in the
