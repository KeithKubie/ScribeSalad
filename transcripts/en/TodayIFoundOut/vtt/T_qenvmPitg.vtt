00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:37.809
Oxford 
University is well known for being one of

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.530
the most prestigious and elite places of learning
in history.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.030
Over the years, it has seen some of the finest
minds the world has ever known pass through

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.030
its halls.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.780
It’s also the place where over six centuries
ago a bunch of students and a fair number

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.829
of townsfolk were killed in a riot over a
pint.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.970
While many details about what has come to
be known as “The St Scholastica’s Day

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.189
Riots” have been lost, and others are occasionally
conflicting given the documentation of the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.010
day (which is perhaps not surprising when
reading accounts from two groups that detest

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.950
one another), we do know more or less how
events transpired.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.540
For starters, in every reputable account,
the riots began on the 10th of February 1355,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.340
which just so happens to be known as “St
Scholastica’s Day”- a day of feasting

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
meant to honor St Scholastica, the sister
of the perhaps more well known St Benedict.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.729
On that day, a number of Oxford students were
drinking at an establishment called the Swindlestock

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.270
tavern (a.k.a. Swyndlestock Tavern) when two
of the students began complaining about the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.759
quality of the ale on offer.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.479
Exactly who these students were isn’t known
for certain, but they are commonly claimed

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
to have been named Walter Spryngeheuse and
Roger de Chesterfield.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.090
Whether that was really their names or not,
the students were extremely dissatisfied with

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.020
the quality of the alcoholic beverages they’d
been served and complained to the landlord,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.479
supposedly named John de Croyden, directly.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.140
Allegedly, the landlord responded to these
complaints with “stubborn and saucie language”

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.520
which, if you’ve ever been in a pub, is
probably how approximately 99% of all landlords

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.730
would react to being rudely told their drinks
taste a bit like pigswill.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.900
The students, not liking the landlord’s
attitude, decided that they’d express their

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.300
displeasure by hurling their tankards directly
in his face.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.520
What happened immediately after isn’t clear.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.830
But eventually, the infuriated landlord roused
the local populace by ringing the town church’s

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.770
bell which in turn caused the students to
do the same with the bell located in the university’s

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.460
church, with both sides rallying.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.750
Soon after, a riot erupted between the two
groups when arrests against the two initial

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.540
instigators were attempted.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.950
The riots quickly grew out of hand including
an estimated two thousand additional townsfolk

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.319
joining the fray after rumours of the riot
and the sound of ringing bells reached the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.319
countryside.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.459
Bouts of violence involving bows, arrows,
swords, axes and, of course, fists continued

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.320
well into the night and the next day.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.370
Ultimately, the townsfolk managed to storm
the university grounds and kill 63 students,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.099
as well as injuring many more.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.500
The students, in turn, reportedly managed
to kill upwards of 30 or so townsfolk during

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500
the melee.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.370
At first glance, this may seem a little over
the top for what seems to have started as

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.390
a fairly minor altercation between a handful
of people in a pub.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.349
But the thing to keep in mind is that at this
point in history, the university and its students

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.549
held a ludicrous amount of power over the
town, to the point where the students were

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.580
in many ways above the law.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.140
As noted in the book, Student Resistance:
A History of the Unruly Subject: “At the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.780
turn of the 13th century thousands of students
roamed the streets randomly attacking hapless

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.450
citizens and sheriffs who couldn’t touch
the marauding students out of fear of state

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.450
retaliation.”

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.331
In fact, only a little over a century before,
another riot between the Oxford students and

00:03:56.331 --> 00:04:00.060
the townsfolk had started after students murdered
a townswoman.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.610
Some of the students fleeing the ensuing riot
ultimately helped found the University of

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.200
Cambridge, today the second oldest university
in England after Oxford.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.930
Beyond more or less being above the law, the
students were also exempt from being able

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.680
to be sued in court outside of their diocese,
as well as exempt from paying certain taxes.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.139
Needless to say, from the beginning up until
somewhat recently in history, significant

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.370
clashes between Oxford students and the surrounding
townsfolk were relatively frequent.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.900
The university and its students were able
to get away with all this because, at that

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.470
point in history, Oxford was essentially another
arm of the Church, meaning its power was pretty

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.740
much absolute.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.270
This was no better proved than when King Edward
III caught wind of the riot and instead of

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.750
trying to get to the bottom of what happened,
he decided instead to impose harsh penalties

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.860
on the entire town and arrest any citizen
he felt had something to do with the riots.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.240
These penalties included, among other things,
forcing the mayor to march with a bare head

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.400
to the university to beg forgiveness from
the Vice-Chancellor and then pay a fine of

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.500
63 pennies (one for every scholar killed)
on the anniversary of the riots, every year,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.690
for all time.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.570
This was a tradition that was upheld for almost
five centuries, right up until 1825 when “the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.230
mayor simply refused to continue the practice.”

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.230
On top of forcing the mayor to beg forgiveness
on behalf of the townsfolk every year for

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.640
just under half a millennium, the university
was also initially given control of certain

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.040
trade in the town, including the trade of
wine and beer.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.950
So, in the end, by all appearances it would
seem it was the landlord’s fault for not

00:05:30.950 --> 00:07:04.750
brewing better alcohol and then having the
audacity to have his face get in the way 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:20.940
of 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:55.840
the thrown drinks by 
the 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:09:24.380
Oxford students.
