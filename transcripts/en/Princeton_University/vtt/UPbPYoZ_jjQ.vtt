00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.460
MATTHEW EDWARDS: I'm studying how extremely
intense lasers interact with plasmas.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.680

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.020
MATTHEW EDWARDS: I've been interested in how
lasers interact with matter for a long time.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.100
And I got interested in this subject because
it's an extremely-- it's a new and exciting

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.539
area of physics.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.519
So we shine a laser on a piece of glass.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.269
And in this interaction, the electrons are
driven close to the speed of light, and this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.340
is the process that produces the radiation
we're interested in.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.000
This is a two-dimensional simulation.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.920
The laser comes in and it's focused, and you
can see that it starts to distort this plasma

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.940
surface.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.210
And the blue dots represent electrons.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.960
So we're driving the electrons, creating kind
of a cool pattern of oscillations.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.500
As it's reflecting from the surface, we produce
this high frequency x-ray light.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.539
We're accelerating some electrons out of the
target.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.950
So this is showing that we've created a source
of coherent radiation, as well as accelerated

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.930
fast electrons.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.470
Professor Mikhailova started here around the
same time I started as a graduate student.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.780
And it was suggested that I go talk to her
because it seemed like she would be doing

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.310
work that I might be interested in.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.090
JULIA MIKHAILOVA: The subject of our research
is extreme states of matter.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.880
It's a very interesting and fascinating subject.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.360
MATTHEW EDWARDS: She's a very accomplished
scientist, so I was really excited to have

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.190
the opportunity to get to work with her.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.780
JULIA MIKHAILOVA: I could choose many words,
like I could he's very innovative, he's brilliant,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.060
he is very kind, many words.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.939
MATTHEW EDWARDS: I do a combination of computational
and experimental work.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.520
And so for me, I mean, both of those things
are the things that I enjoy doing.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.869
When you do an experiment, when you run a
simulation, and that moment before you look

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.480
at the results and you don't know quite how
it's going to turn out, you're going to see

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.450
something that nobody has really looked at
before.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.620
And nobody knows the answer to.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.800
And so it's a chance to see something new
and hopefully, find out something new about

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800
how the world works.
