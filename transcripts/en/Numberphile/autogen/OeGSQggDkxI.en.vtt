00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.699
what's the next term in the following

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709
what's the next term in the following
 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:10.190
what's the next term in the following
sequence it goes 1 4 8 48 88 488 what's

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
sequence it goes 1 4 8 48 88 488 what's
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.620
sequence it goes 1 4 8 48 88 488 what's
the next term which actually is very

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
the next term which actually is very
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.880
the next term which actually is very
easy and why that's not so obvious well

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
easy and why that's not so obvious well
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.529
easy and why that's not so obvious well
it's a little strange for 8 48 88 for 8

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
it's a little strange for 8 48 88 for 8
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.630
it's a little strange for 8 48 88 for 8
8 and obviously the next one is going to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
8 and obviously the next one is going to
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.840
8 and obviously the next one is going to
be 8 8 8 and then for 8 8 8 the right

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
be 8 8 8 and then for 8 8 8 the right
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.819
be 8 8 8 and then for 8 8 8 the right
way to look at this is to stare at these

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
way to look at this is to stare at these
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680
way to look at this is to stare at these
numbers look at this number what do you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
numbers look at this number what do you
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229
numbers look at this number what do you
see well you see 8 but more important

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
see well you see 8 but more important
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.920
see well you see 8 but more important
you see 2 holds when you look at 48 you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
you see 2 holds when you look at 48 you
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.260
you see 2 holds when you look at 48 you
see 3 holes

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270
see 3 holes
 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.500
see 3 holes
88 has four holes in it for has one hole

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
88 has four holes in it for has one hole
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.189
88 has four holes in it for has one hole
if you draw if was that way and one has

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
if you draw if was that way and one has
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.250
if you draw if was that way and one has
no holes in it so the definition of this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
no holes in it so the definition of this
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799
no holes in it so the definition of this
sequence is it's the smallest positive

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
sequence is it's the smallest positive
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.740
sequence is it's the smallest positive
number that has n holes in it people

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
number that has n holes in it people
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.140
number that has n holes in it people
always get really funny about sequences

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
always get really funny about sequences
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120
always get really funny about sequences
and numbers that are sort of based n

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
and numbers that are sort of based n
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.460

specific this is this is how you draw

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
specific this is this is how you draw
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.289
specific this is this is how you draw
your numbers specifically if you draw

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
your numbers specifically if you draw
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.649
your numbers specifically if you draw
your for non enclosed it would be it

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
your for non enclosed it would be it
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.480
your for non enclosed it would be it
would change the sequence in that case

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
would change the sequence in that case
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.240
would change the sequence in that case
if your 4 is non enclosed then you would

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
if your 4 is non enclosed then you would
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.950
if your 4 is non enclosed then you would
make it one six eight sixty eight eighty

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
make it one six eight sixty eight eighty
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.640
make it one six eight sixty eight eighty
eight six eight eight and so on and if

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
eight six eight eight and so on and if
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.730

you'd do your twos in a very fancy way

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
you'd do your twos in a very fancy way
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.950
you'd do your twos in a very fancy way
with a hole in them then the six could

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
with a hole in them then the six could
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.499
with a hole in them then the six could
be replaced by a two this is topology um

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
be replaced by a two this is topology um
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.410

four you've partitioned the plane into

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
four you've partitioned the plane into
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.100
four you've partitioned the plane into
two parts this part and the outside so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
two parts this part and the outside so
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.679

this one is another base-10 sequence so
 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:10.639
this one is another base-10 sequence so
but it's lovely 60 120 180 240 3 3 and

but it's lovely 60 120 180 240 3 3 and
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.470
but it's lovely 60 120 180 240 3 3 and
the question is what comes next

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
the question is what comes next
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.809

don't get distracted into looking for

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819
don't get distracted into looking for
 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.920
don't get distracted into looking for
something that's too complicated

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930
something that's too complicated
 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.270

watch carefully there's nothing up my

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379
watch carefully there's nothing up my
 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.900
watch carefully there's nothing up my
sleeve I'm just gonna move the comma

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910
sleeve I'm just gonna move the comma
 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.119
sleeve I'm just gonna move the comma
then I'm gonna move that color and that

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129
then I'm gonna move that color and that
 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.539
then I'm gonna move that color and that
color and that comma and there's an

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549
color and that comma and there's an
 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.680
color and that comma and there's an
invisible zero and so the next one get

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
invisible zero and so the next one get
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.490
invisible zero and so the next one get
it 6 12 18 24 30 36 so that one after

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
it 6 12 18 24 30 36 so that one after
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.619
it 6 12 18 24 30 36 so that one after
that would be 42 their multiples of 6

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629
that would be 42 their multiples of 6
 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.650
that would be 42 their multiples of 6

you can easily prove that by looking at
all the odd numbers and check why they
