MALE SPEAKER: Everyone, please
welcome Sharon Salzberg.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.165
SHARON SALZBERG: Thank you.

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:06.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.590
Thank you so much.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.590
It's a great delight to be here.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.960
My most current sublet
in New York City

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.350
is just a few blocks away, so
I feel like we're neighbors.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.830
And I love just being
able to walk to a place.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.840
Plus, the meditation program
here sounds just fabulous,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
and I'm so happy
to hear about it.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.540
It's really funny
for me sitting here.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.760
I'm looking at what you're
looking at on the screen.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.490
And I'm reading the blurb,
"Anyone who has a job

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.910
will find treasures here."

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.970
Daniel Goleman, author of
"Emotional Intelligence."

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.330
Because Dan actually brought
me to my very first meditation

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.220
retreat in India
in January of 1971.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.540
I had heard him give a talk at
a yoga conference in New Delhi.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.950
I had gone to India as part of
an independent study program

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.750
through the university
I was attending.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.480
And I really wanted to
learn how to meditate.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.460
And I wanted what
seemed to me to be

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.722
very practical, pragmatic,
direct instruction.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:16.050
I didn't want something very
overly philosophical or deeply

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.910
embedded in a kind of traditions
so that I had to, in some way,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.010
adopt the dogma or the belief
system of the tradition.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.510
So I kind of couldn't
find that right away.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.910
And I wandered around India.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.200
And I went to this
international yoga conference,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.190
which was quite a dispiriting
affair, the low point of which

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.600
was when these yogis and
swamis were up on the stage

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.840
pushing and shoving against each
other to try to grab the mic

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.440
and speak.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.120
And I thought, oh, god.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.360
I'll never find a teacher here.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
And then Dan-- at the time, he
was a graduate student studying

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.560
meditation and psychology.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.560
And he delivered a
paper, at the end

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.260
of which he mentioned
that he was on his way

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.630
to this town called
[? Belgaum ?] in India,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.420
where he was going to do this
intensive 10-day meditation

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.430
retreat which was very kind
of direct, and pragmatic,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.080
and practical.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.020
And I followed after him,
as did probably close to 100

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.180
of us attending that conference,
went to that meditation

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.820
retreat.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.530
So it's very funny,
all these years

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.780
later, for me just to be sitting
here and seeing his name.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.960
Because of course, I owe him a
tremendous debt of gratitude.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.470
And I was also going to tell a
story about Dan Harris, who's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.010
a friend of mine.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.270
So those of you who go to
his talk tomorrow, please

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.650
bring this up in some fashion.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.000
You don't have to tell
him I told you to.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.040
Dan, as many people who
embark on meditation,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.470
who have an interest
in learning meditation,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.400
tended to really appreciate
qualities like mindfulness,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.060
presence, the
clarity it can bring,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060
the kind of perspective
it can bring,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.230
the balance it could bring.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.150
And he had a different
kind of response

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.250
to terms like lovingkindness
or compassion.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.440
And this was a lot
of what I wanted

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.360
to begin with anyway-- how there
are two things that I find kind

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.870
of provocative here, in terms
of approaching qualities

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.580
like lovingkindness
and compassion

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.350
as things that are trainable
and as things that are powerful.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.010
We tend to think,
what do you mean,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.420
"train" a quality
like compassion?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.410
That's awfully cold
or mechanistic.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.311
It's like, I'm going
to a love training.

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:03.810
You know?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.250
It's just too bizarre.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.000
Whereas in the East,
in eastern psychology,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.750
absolutely, a quality like
lovingkindness or compassion

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.990
is felt to be trainable.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.250
Because it's felt that these
are emergent properties

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.570
of how we pay attention.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.970
And so we know absolutely
attention can be trainable.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.400
And that, in fact, is
what meditation is.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.290
And so as a consequence,
we can actually

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.840
train in something like
lovingkindness or compassion.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.790
And it's felt that these things
aren't weak, or sentimental,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.895
or kind of gooey.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.720
Those are a force.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.100
Those qualities of love, or
lovingkindness, and compassion

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.800
are powerful.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.129
So that's a challenge
for most of us.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.670
It was certainly a
challenge for Dan.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.180
So the first book I ever wrote
was called "Lovingkindness."

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.560
And Dan told me that he used
to read it in the New York City

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.310
subway.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.000
And he was so
embarrassed to be seen

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.180
reading a book called
"Lovingkindness" that he would

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.375
cleverly place his
fingers over the title,

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:17.010
so nobody could see
what he was reading.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.770
And then he actually--
this is in his book.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.080
He was doing the
practice, which,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.710
of course, is a very
different thing than standing

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.020
back and critiquing
the practice.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.410
He was actually
doing the practice,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.200
and he had a very
powerful experience.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.570
And so when his
book came out, he

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.530
posted a lovingkindness
meditation on abc.com.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.910
So you can imagine how happy
I was, all these years later,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.970
to see that.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.520
And he was on "HuffPost
Live" being interviewed.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.620
And they asked certain people
to do some short videos

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.250
that he would be presented
with during his interview,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.290
and he would respond.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.530
So they asked me to do a video.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.350
And for some reason, I thought
it was kind of like a roast.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.550
Everyone else was just, like,
straightforward and praising,

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.880
and I was roasty.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.815
And so I told that story.

00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:21.880
And I said, oh, imagine
how happy I was, Dan,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.110
to see when you posted a
lovingkindness meditation

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.030
on ABC News.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.960
And so they showed him
this, and he laughed.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.180
And he said, it is the most
annoying meditation possible.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.620
And it works.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.460
He said, every
single day, my wife

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.380
is thankful that I'm much
less of a jerk, which

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.755
is the way he talks.

00:06:43.755 --> 00:06:46.530
So you might just bring it
up tomorrow, those of you.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.460
What do you think of
lovingkindness meditation, Dan?

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.880
Or what about that
compassion thing?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.230
So those I find are
actually the two kind

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.940
of major challenges
people present.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.650
How can this be trainable?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.920
That's bizarre.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.600
And I don't know
about that love thing.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.280
It's so squishy.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.040
That means you
lose common sense.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.720
You lose discernment.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.110
You lose an ability
to have an edge.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.240
You lose ambition or clarity.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.910
You just lose, lose, lose.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.650
And so that's really what
we tend to emphasize.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.920
None of that is actually true.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.320
Attention is trainable.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.280
Therefore, these
qualities will emerge.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.050
The first question is, how
are we paying attention?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.050
Are we fragmented?

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.960
Are we all over the place?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.970
Are we actually present?

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.730
In this society, where
we tend to engage in what

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.590
Linda Stone called "continuous
partial attention"--

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.320
which is kind of all over
the place all of the time.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.444
Just to gather our attention
and our energy and to be there,

00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:08.500
to connect, to listen
is a powerful thing.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:13.820
It's a powerful gift
for one another.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.200
I have a friend who, every
time we go out to dinner

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.280
or we do something
together, we ritualistically

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.180
tweet at the beginning.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.890
Having dinner with so-and-so.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.170
Having dinner with
@SharonSalzberg.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.170
And somebody once
wrote and said,

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.250
do you ever talk to each other?

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.260
Or do you just sit there?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.039
And a lot of time, we do
actually talk to each other.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:40.226
But a lot of times, don't
we-- or we wish we could.

00:08:40.226 --> 00:08:41.350
We're not really listening.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.549
We're not really present.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.410
And so the first step
in training attention

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.290
towards that quality
of, say, compassion

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.570
is gathering our attention.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.560
And it's arriving, it's being
unified, it's being present.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.490
And then the question
arises-- what

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.495
do we tend to pay attention to?

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.980
Let's say you're
the kind of person

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.760
who, at the end of the day,
you're looking back at your day

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.696
at work.

00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:12.070
And you pretty
well only remember

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.820
the things you did
wrong, and the mistakes

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:19.030
you made, and where you
didn't really show up,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.400
and what you could have
done more skillfully,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.750
let's just say, so much so that
your whole sense of who you are

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.470
and all that you
will ever be just

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.630
collapses around that
really stupid thing

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.610
you said at lunch at a meeting.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.070
The challenge, or the
training in attention,

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.290
is to not deny that or
pretend it didn't happen,

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:47.760
but to get bigger in our
perspective, in our connection.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.030
Because it's not the
only thing that happened.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.500
It's not all that we are.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.520
So it's almost as though
one is asking oneself,

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.810
anything else happen today?

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.860
Or any good?

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.770
And even when we make
a mistake, recognizing

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.700
there's a kind of
capacity to begin again,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.410
which doesn't deny that we
have something to learn,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.050
or we need to make amends, or
we need to rectify something.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.730
But we don't have
to be stuck there.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.600
We can have a different
perception of who we are

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.830
and what we're capable of.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:28.050
So we stretch beyond that
kind of collapse or fixation

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.360
of attention.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.380
And a very interesting question
is, who do we pay attention to?

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.860
Who do we objectify?

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.510
Who becomes the "other" for us?

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.300
Perhaps through fear,
perhaps through bias.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.490
And a lot of times just
through indifference.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.090
Who doesn't count?

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.730
Who doesn't matter?

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.940
Who do we look through?

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.120
Somebody plays a
role in our lives,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.865
and for all we recognize this is
a living, breathing human being

00:11:01.865 --> 00:11:03.570
who wants to be
happy just as we do,

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.860
they might as well be
a piece of furniture.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.130
It's kind of shocking when
you look at yourself--

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.590
you know, me, too--
going throughout a day,

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.990
and how many times that happens.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.330
So who counts?

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.540
Who matters?

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.950
It makes me think of--
I go to Washington, DC

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.030
a fair amount to teach.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.290
And years ago,
the facility, when

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.940
I was teaching a day-long
workshop, the facility

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.960
they rented was this
elementary school.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.720
It's since been torn down,
so we use something else.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.120
But it was this
great place, in part

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.960
because that school had
its own rules of kindness.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.570
And so whenever we'd
take a break from sitting

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.580
or we would do
walking meditation,

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:52.410
the rules of kindness were
all over the corridors

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.780
on these big pieces of paper.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.446
And we'd just stand
there and read them,

00:11:55.446 --> 00:11:57.370
because they were so cool.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.790
They said things like, don't
hurt anyone on the inside

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.680
or on the outside.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.630
But my very, very
favorite rule of kindness

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.300
was, everybody gets to play.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.920
Everybody gets to play.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.124
Not, everybody is
my best friend,

00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:15.790
and I'm going to take
them home with me,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.630
but everybody gets to play.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:23.240
That's kind of the sensibility
when we actually pay attention

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.030
to others rather
than look through.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.860
We may not like somebody.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.360
We may not approve of them.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.690
We certainly may not
give them all our money

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.430
or take them home--
or the thing I always

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.610
say in New York, which
only makes here-- you never

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.380
give away your rent-controlled
apartment, ever.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.150
Right?

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.400
But you can have
that inner sense

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:51.320
of everybody's kind of
innate dignity and worth.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.880
And just include
rather than exclude.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.170
So who do we pay attention to?

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.180
Who do we ignore?

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.970
Who do we discount?

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.620
And the nature of the specific
training around lovingkindness

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.250
or compassion-- and we'll
talk about the distinction

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.610
between the two in a
minute-- is sometimes

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.230
what I call a stretch.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.290
It's seeing, oh, I'm used to
paying attention in this way,

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.530
I'm used to thanking
these five people

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.980
and ignoring everybody else.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.630
I'm used to fixating
on my faults

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.320
and not the potential within me.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.110
And we stretch.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.720
We realize, OK, I have a certain
perhaps limited, habitual way

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.930
of viewing myself and others.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.550
And I'm going to see
what it's like when

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:46.210
I go beyond that particular
narrow constraint.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.000
Not moving from a true place
to a false or phony place,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.310
but moving from a true place to
another true place, which maybe

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.990
gets a lot less air
time, usually, from us.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.260
So we kind of play.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.340
It's a very playful practice
where you walk, maybe,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.920
into that grocery
store, and instead

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.760
of looking through the
clerk, you look at them.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.490
And you think, may you be happy.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.670
May you be peaceful.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.730
May you have a good day.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:23.150
May things work out for you,
whatever your struggles may be.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.920
So it's that kind of play
in that particular practice.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.340
And then we see what happens.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.870
So there are actually
four qualities

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.510
that are usually talked
about together, in a bundle.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.740
And sometimes, just in
casual conversation,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.680
there are terms
used synonymously,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.730
but they actually have
slightly different flavors.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.840
And they work together
in different ways.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.580
So the first is
lovingkindness itself.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.510
And that's a weird word.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.770
Isn't it?

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.530
Because you wouldn't necessarily
be, say, sitting in a coffee

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.020
shop somewhere and hear the
next table's conversation

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.450
include the word,
"lovingkindness."

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:12.010
And so my concern about that is
that it might make the quality

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.660
itself seem kind of arcane, and
removed from day-to-day life,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.140
and precious in the
negative sense of the word.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.130
It's a translation of a word
from the Buddhist tradition.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.340
There's another word in
the Jewish tradition.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.270
Both are translated
as "lovingkindness."

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.360
Sometimes it's translated
instead as "love,"

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.780
which is extremely
complicated, of course,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.620
because we use that word to
mean so many different things.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.770
Sometimes we say "love,"
and it really frankly

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.380
is a medium of exchange.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.135
Like, I will love
you as long as.

00:15:48.135 --> 00:15:51.560
Or I will love myself as long
as I never make a mistake.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.130
So that isn't
going to last long.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.780
And we know how fragile,
how breakable that state is.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.104
It literally means
"friendship" in translation

00:16:07.104 --> 00:16:08.270
from the Buddhist tradition.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.010
But I think the best
way of understanding

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.810
it is a profound sense of
connection-- not liking, not

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.260
approving, but connection.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.190
That our lives are
inextricably interwoven,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.740
that we are living in an
interdependent universe, which

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.970
isn't always so nice, you know?

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.040
But it's true.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.420
What happens over there isn't
going to nicely stay over

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.130
there, and we're going to
be protected forevermore.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.610
It's going to ripple
out over here.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.120
And what we do, it matters.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.370
And it ripples out in all
these other directions.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.670
It's just the nature of things.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:57.030
Like sometimes, when I go into
a company or place of work

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.300
and teach, one of the
reflections I ask people to do

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.839
is, how many other people
need to do their jobs well

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:08.319
for you to be able
to do your job well?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.079
Because we do get awfully
kind of siloed and isolated.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.859
And we forget we actually
live in this interconnected

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.775
universe, that that's
how things are.

00:17:17.775 --> 00:17:21.339
And that's very much the
sense of lovingkindness.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.540
It's like a bone-deep
appreciation

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.640
of all the kinds of connection
that is real for us--

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.990
that our lives have something
to do with one another.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.610
And then the second
quality is compassion,

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.390
which is talked about as
a movement of the heart.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:48.610
It's a recognition either
of pain or of vulnerability.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.970
We may not all be experiencing
equal challenges in life,

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:53.520
for sure.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.510
We just don't.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.570
But we do share a kind of
inherent vulnerability.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.080
Because life's so insecure.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.880
It's mutable.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.570
It's moving.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.890
It's changing all of the time.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:10.100
And we can care for one
another in those ways.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.750
It's a way of-- not giving
in, and not being weak,

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.550
and not being
foolish, but of kind

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.950
of responding from
a heart-felt place.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.240
And it begins-- they both begin,
actually-- with ourselves.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.690
So one of the exercises
we sometimes say

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:36.760
is when you-- maybe we'll
do this as the meditation.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.040
When you undertake
anything, there

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:48.540
is the necessity to
continually begin again.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.280
The way I put it these
days is, nothing in life

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.120
is a straight shot.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.240
We go forward.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.760
We fall down.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.530
We have to get up or
let others help us up.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.120
We go forward again.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.960
We make a mistake.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.110
We have to realize that,
OK, I'm going to start over.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.380
We lose sight of our
aspiration, maybe

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.010
our tremendous aspiration.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.470
We just forget about it.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.360
We have to begin again.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.685
We lose touch with our values.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.610
We are reminded, or we remember.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.660
We have to begin again.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.140
We're constantly recovering.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.450
We're repairing.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.470
We're starting over.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.800
We're starting over.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.929
And the question is how to
do that most skillfully.

00:19:32.929 --> 00:19:34.470
And this is one of
those places where

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.050
there's a kind of controversy.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.040
Because people say, well, that
self-compassion thing-- that's

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.127
just being lazy.

00:19:41.127 --> 00:19:42.960
You know, what do you
mean, forgive yourself

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.950
and start over?

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.226
Then you'll just blow
it off the next time.

00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:47.850
And somebody said
that to me, actually,

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.840
in a class in New York.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.940
I don't believe that.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.050
Because then I'll
just say, hey, I'll

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:55.580
make another mistake in two
minutes, who cares, you know?

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.490
I'll start again.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.530
But think about it.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.070
What happens when
you make a mistake

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.130
or you have to
start over, and you

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.500
spend 15 hours in this
tirade against yourself,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.910
and you're just miserable,
and you feel like you're

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.200
an awful person, and
you have no capacity

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.820
to change or to do
things differently?

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.480
And you just go down.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.510
We end up exhausted.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.340
It takes a long time.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.220
We end up demoralized.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:29.800
We don't have the kind of
energy to begin again well.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.710
Studies seem to show-- there
are all kinds of performance

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:39.250
studies of all kinds that show
that harshness, being motivated

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:46.310
by fear-- really intense
fear, self-criticism--

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.790
will help you spike your
performance briefly.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.030
And then you crash.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:21:01.130
And that to have a sustained
effort to get something done,

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:07.390
to do it well, to really put
yourself out there in some way,

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.060
we seem to need
another kind of skill

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.555
in terms of actually what
is true about the way things

00:21:15.555 --> 00:21:16.055
evolve.

00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:18.490
We're always beginning
again, and having to repair

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.880
and having to recover, and kind
of adjust, and find balance,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.610
and things like that.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.640
And so that's the
role of compassion.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.300
It doesn't mean you don't care.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.880
It doesn't mean you're
kind of sickly sweet.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.080
It doesn't mean you're
overly sentimental.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:44.650
It's just seeing, oh, this kind
of caring-- applied to myself,

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.740
applied to others-- is actually
the most effective, efficient

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.975
way to have a life.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.310
And that's where it
begins, is with ourselves.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.610
To have that kind of resonance,
like, ooh, that hurts-- not,

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:07.850
I'm bad, I'm terrible, I'm
awful, I'm stupid-- but ooh,

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:12.220
that really hurts gives us
a very different approach

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.110
in which to go on,
and then relate

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.130
to ourselves in all kinds
of different situations,

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.170
and relate to others.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.600
So then the third quality--
I like talking about,

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.070
because it's kind
of quirky for us.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.540
And that's a quality called
sympathetic joy, which

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.620
means having happiness for the
happiness of others instead

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.800
of, when we witness someone's
success or good fortune, kind

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.530
of dying inside-- you know,
falling sway to that voice

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.270
that so often arises inside
our heads that goes, ooh,

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.930
I wish you didn't have so
much going for you right now.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.790
Like, you don't have
to lose everything,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.760
but if the light
could just dim a bit,

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.200
I would feel a lot better.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.340
So this doesn't mean that you
lose all competitive edge,

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.430
and that you lose ambition,
and that you can't go for it.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.300
You can go for it.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.610
But some of the ways that we
suffer-- it's like nothing's

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.000
ever enough.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.420
We don't feel in touch
with what we have.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.590
We only feel
consumed with what we

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.842
don't have-- and so this
kind of endless cycle

00:23:22.842 --> 00:23:23.633
of dissatisfaction.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:31.780
Sometimes what
someone accomplishes

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.250
feels like it's
been taken directly

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:40.270
from us, as though
happiness were a limited

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.690
commodity in this world, and
the more someone else has,

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.690
the less there's
going to be for us.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.845
But it's not like that.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.340
I have a retreat center
I cofounded, the Insight

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.160
Meditation Society in
Barre, Massachusetts.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.200
And I teach there every
winter a seven-day intensive

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.480
lovingkindness retreat.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:05.830
And I was giving a talk one
night on sympathetic joy.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.056
And I just used this example.

00:24:07.056 --> 00:24:08.180
It just came up in my head.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.220
I said, it's like
you're in New York.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.726
And it's Sunday.

00:24:11.726 --> 00:24:13.100
And you buy the
"New York Times,"

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.270
and you open up to the
Book Review section.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.300
And you look at the
Best Seller list.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.450
And you see that your
friend's book has gotten on

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.100
the "New York Times"
Best Seller list.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.488
And you think, that's a pity.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.680
It should have been my book.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.400
And then there's
kind of the thought,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.910
it would have been my book,
except they stole it from me--

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.310
these people, these
so-called friends.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.690
It's like, the "New
York Times" had just

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.480
typed out half the
title of my book,

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:53.660
and somehow, you subverted it,
and you grabbed it from me.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.190
It's not a logical feeling.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.340
Because of course,
it's not like that.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.620
But it feels as though
it were just like that.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.140
So I gave this talk.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.990
And by sheer coincidence,
I had three friends

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.730
sitting in the room, sitting
the retreat, each of whom

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.630
had had a book on the "New
York Times" Best Seller list.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.580
And so each one of them came up
to me after the talk and said,

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.860
is that how you felt when you
saw my book on the "New York

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.860
Times" Best Seller list?

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.259
And I said, no.
[LAUGHS] Not at all.

00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:28.800
Never, never.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.440
But we can challenge
that feeling as well--

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.490
that sense of envy or jealousy.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.490
Is happiness so limited?

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.340
Do we really have nothing?

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.945
Or do we not appreciate
and notice what we do have?

00:25:48.945 --> 00:25:51.310
Did they really take
it away from me?

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.310
Do I want them to only
suffer and suffer?

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.300
Maybe not.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.740
And so there are ways
that we kind of stretch

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.260
our assumptions and our
withholding, and so on.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.690
And then the last quality
is known as equanimity.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.560
And that means wisdom.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.790
Equanimity is a weird word, too.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:16.910
When I was first sitting
my first retreat in India,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.690
the teacher was this
man named SN Goenka.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.630
And he kept saying,
be equanimous.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.810
Be equanimous.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:25.710
Be equanimous.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.660
And those of us sitting
the retreat would whisper

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.890
to each other, is that a word?

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.310
I never heard that word.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.300
Equanimity does not
mean indifference,

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.070
or coldness, or callousness.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.460
It means the balance
born of wisdom.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.720
It's perspective.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.440
Like, in compassion,
I will do everything

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.070
I can to try to make
your situation better,

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.700
and I'm not in control
of this universe.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.360
I can't make it so.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.540
Or things can take time.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.260
I don't always see the immediate
result that I'm looking for.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.020
Maybe I'm laying the groundwork.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.510
Maybe I'm planting seeds.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.590
There's change in this universe.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.790
Nothing is fixed.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.970
Nothing is static.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.210
I will do everything,
and I also need

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:24.740
to let go of some kind of
need for things to work out

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:30.280
exactly the way I need them
or I think I need them to,

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.230
on my timetable,
and on my agenda.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.615
So these four-- lovingkindness,
compassion, sympathetic joy,

00:27:36.615 --> 00:27:39.450
and equanimity--
actually work together,

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.130
which is why, in compassion, you
don't really lose intelligence.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.990
You don't lose power.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.310
You don't lose strength.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:50.370
Because it's got this balance.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.760
It's got the balance of wisdom.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.180
It's got the balance
of equanimity.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.870
You don't go down,
because you're also

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.540
looking at joy and
sympathetic joy, right?

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:05.940
And you don't get giddy and
kind of superficial, frivolous,

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.620
because you're also looking
at pain with compassion.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.081
And so together, they
make up a bundle.

00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:14.580
What I'd like to
do is actually have

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.610
us sit together a little bit.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.450
And then we'll just
open up for questions.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.930
And have fun.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.890
So I thought,
actually, we could do

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:27.860
that very foundational exercise
of awareness or mindfulness

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.740
of the breath, but
with this emphasis.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.240
OK?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.740
So if you sit comfortably, you
can close your eyes or not.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.620
You can actually start
just by listening

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.212
to sound-- whether it's
the sound of my voice

00:28:54.212 --> 00:28:56.170
or other sounds, which
are conveniently coming.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.520
It's a way of
relaxing deep inside,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.580
allowing your experience
to come and go.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.030
And bring your attention to the
feeling of your body sitting,

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.570
whatever sensations
you discover.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:06.200
Bring your attention
to your hands.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.340
See if you can make
the shift from the more

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.440
conceptual level--
like, oh, fingers--

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.800
to the world of direct
sensation-- picking

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.990
up, pulsing, throbbing,
pressure, whatever it might be.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.270
You don't have to name
these things, but feel them.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.350
And bring your attention to the
feeling of your breath, just

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.300
the normal, natural
breath, wherever

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.980
you feel it most distinctly.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.882
Maybe that's in the nostrils,
or the chest, or the abdomen.

00:31:06.882 --> 00:31:10.250
When you find that place,
bring your attention there

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.905
and just rest.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.535
See if you can feel one breath.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.540
And if your attention
wanders, you

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.160
find yourself lost in thought,
spun out in a fantasy,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.140
or you fall asleep,
don't worry about it.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.020
This is the magic moment.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:54.900
It's the next moment
after the distraction.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.660
Listen to how you
speak to yourself.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.050
How much anger is there?

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:03.680
How much compassion is there?

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.200
See if you can practice
gently letting go.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.660
It's what one of
my teachers once

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:17.110
called exercising the letting-go
muscle-- gently letting go

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:21.850
and beginning again,
shepherding your attention back

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.570
to the feeling of the breath.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.630
This is actually the
transformative training.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.920
It's letting go, and with
compassion for yourself,

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.220
starting over.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.800
So if you have to do that 10
billion times in the next five

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.070
minutes, that's totally fine.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.500
Isn't that incredible?

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.199
That no matter what happens,
we can always begin again?

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.280
So right there,
that's the moment.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:03.210
We say that the healing
is in the return,

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.620
not in never having
wandered to begin with.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.350
That's resilience.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.285
And when you feel ready,
you can open your eyes.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.150
Do you have any
questions or comments,

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.836
anything you'd
like to talk about?

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.680
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to
follow my own instructions.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.760
So Sharon, thank you so much.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.080
So you had that
comment earlier about

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.990
how lovingkindness is kind
of an embarrassing word.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:53.100
So if you had the power
to just, like, rebrand it,

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.036
what would you use?

00:37:55.036 --> 00:37:56.910
SHARON SALZBERG: Probably,
if I had the power

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.975
to totally rebrand it,
I'd say, connection.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.420
The word in Pali, the language
of the original Buddhist text,

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.830
is metta-- M-E-T-T-A. And for
a while, at different times,

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:16.200
I had hoped that that word
might enter the culture,

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.370
as words sometimes do.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:19.350
And it never happened.

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:25.190
And my most recent hope had been
when-- he was then an LA Laker

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.800
basketball player-- Ron Artest
changed his name to Metta World

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.520
Peace.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.970
And I got really excited.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:37.240
And then I guess last
season or the season

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.619
before, he behaved
badly on the court.

00:38:39.619 --> 00:38:41.910
And my friends were sending
me these headlines, saying,

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.980
"Metta fails us,"
and things like that.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.150
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.510
He elbowed someone in the head.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.218
SHARON SALZBERG: And
then he just changed

00:38:47.218 --> 00:38:48.560
his name again, someone told me.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.960
He changed it to something else.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.230
So that's not going to happen.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.505
I'd say connection, probably.

00:38:55.505 --> 00:38:56.380
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:39:01.484 --> 00:39:02.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:09.940
So you were seeking practical
meditation forty years ago.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.180
What can you tell
us about it now?

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.470
Because fine, I'll admit it.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:16.370
Maybe I'm lazy.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.050
I'm also looking for
practical meditation.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:20.890
SHARON SALZBERG: OK.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.010
I think practical
meditation's really good.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.660
I see meditation practices
as skills training, really,

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.460
in three major arenas.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.020
One is concentration,
or that kind

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.260
of gathering of our normally
scattered attention.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.970
Mindfulness, which is
waking up to our experience

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:43.920
in a different way.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.020
It's not having so
many filters intruding

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.560
on the way we perceive things.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.585
One common filter is
projection into the future.

00:39:54.585 --> 00:39:57.466
If something feels
uncomfortable right now, we

00:39:57.466 --> 00:39:58.840
tend to start
thinking, what's it

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.048
going to feel like next week?

00:40:00.048 --> 00:40:02.520
What's it going to
feel like next month?

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.760
Or dismissing certain things,
or having a big overlay.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.650
I'm the only one who ever feels
this, something like that.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.340
I should have been
able to stop this.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.590
I shouldn't have this come up.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.880
So mindfulness is a way
of uncluttering attention,

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.320
so that we have a cleaner,
clearer perception

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.380
of what's going on.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.780
And then the third
great skill is

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:28.700
lovingkindness or
compassion, which

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.720
we practice in lots
of different ways.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.783
So many methods will bring
these three together.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.180
I think daily practice, or
close to daily practice,

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.260
is the most crucial element.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.610
And by that, I mean a dedicated
period of 5, 10, 15, 20

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.480
minutes where you
are only seeking

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.740
to strengthen these qualities.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:00.960
Because then it can
appear during your day.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.790
So for example, we just
sat for 10 minutes.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.870
And if you do that
for 10 minutes a day,

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:14.630
using something like the feeling
of the breath as your anchor

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.020
for your attention,
fortunately, the breath

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.530
goes to work with you.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:20.140
Right?

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.415
It goes to the doctor's
office with you,

00:41:23.415 --> 00:41:24.940
where you may have some anxiety.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.200
Or it goes on your
commute with you.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:34.542
And so it's a way of-- what
one of my very venerable

00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:39.200
old meditation teachers called
the goal-- short moments

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.070
many times.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.750
Short moments of awareness
many times a day.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:47.500
Short moments of focus
many times a day.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.840
And so if you're accustomed
to using something

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.740
like the feeling
of the breath, it's

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.380
very practical,
because then you could

00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:01.090
be at work-- I always feel funny
when I say this at a workplace.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.300
Let's say there's a
really contentious meeting

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.240
at some other workplace.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.890
And tempers are
starting to flare,

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.870
and anxiety is
starting to go up.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.622
You don't have to
open up a closet door,

00:42:13.622 --> 00:42:16.080
and pull out all this equipment,
and sit down cross-legged,

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.550
and look funny.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.990
You can be breathing.

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:22.820
And no one has to
know you're doing it.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.010
You're resting your attention.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.670
You're coming back
to yourself, you're

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:27.940
coming back to the moment.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.850
You're cutting through the crazy
momentum going on around you

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.060
just by coming
back to the breath.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.630
And so it's very private.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:39.050
It's very personal.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.290
And it's very practical.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:45.766
So theoretically, you don't
have to take, say, that 5-, 10-,

00:42:45.766 --> 00:42:50.900
20-minute period of just
devoting yourself to practice.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.650
But I think that's
highly speculative

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.990
that we'll even remember.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:03.100
One of the now classic
recommendations

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.930
is, don't pick up the
phone on the first ring.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:08.370
Let it ring three
times and breathe,

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:09.550
and then you pick it up.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:11.300
But how are we going
to remember that

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.160
in the middle of a kind
of chaotic or busy day?

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.630
I think if we've got those
building blocks in place,

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.440
we're more likely
to remember it.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.159
And I did go into a
company somewhere,

00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:27.450
and I made that recommendation.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:31.540
And I looked up, and there
was panic on everyone's faces.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.360
So I said, how about twice?

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:38.270
Just let the phone ring
twice-- two or three times.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.930
You have to see what's
realistic for you.

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.390
But really, we can take
short moments many times,

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:45.890
if we remember to do that.

00:43:53.095 --> 00:43:53.970
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sharon.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.740
Thank you for
sharing your wisdom.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:56.690
SHARON SALZBERG: Sure.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.773
AUDIENCE: It's very funny.

00:43:57.773 --> 00:43:59.930
As I was sitting up
there for meditation,

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:03.140
I was framing the questions
to ask you, and then you said,

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.780
let go.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.780
If I sound incoherent,
please be compassionate.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.730
I have two questions for you.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.210
One is, do you have
any examples of leaders

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:19.010
in the corporate context
that embody the four values?

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.300
And if you could talk
a bit about that.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.480
Because in my mind, they
seem a little orthogonal,

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.030
the leadership quotient and
the compassion quotient.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:31.040
And the second question is, we
just did an annual performance

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.640
review that we all
have to fill out--

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.340
different attributes that
we rate our peers by--

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.610
and its execution, and
thought leadership,

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.620
and the traditional stuff.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.970
It seems that if the
underlying drivers

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.460
for true, long-term,
sustainable performance

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.980
are those four qualities,
how do we bring awareness

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.310
to those in a more
structured way,

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:56.750
so that we can cultivate
them as individuals

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.940
and get supported
by the organization?

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.190
SHARON SALZBERG: Well, I
think in terms of the second,

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:17.435
there's a necessary place both
for empathy and for equanimity.

00:45:17.435 --> 00:45:21.560
And it would be a
fantastic element, I think,

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.220
of a performance review.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.770
Because ultimately, if we
talk about a kind of team,

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:38.000
or teamwork, some sensibility
like that, really, it's

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.950
both individual
excellence and the ability

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:44.407
to have that kind of resonance.

00:45:44.407 --> 00:45:45.990
I mean, that's why
it's so interesting

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:50.210
that so many sports teams
are bringing in meditation

00:45:50.210 --> 00:46:00.950
coaches-- including, apparently,
the Knicks because of Phil

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:05.910
Jackson, you know, and his
own interests, and his past

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:09.072
with the LA Lakers
and the Chicago Bulls.

00:46:09.072 --> 00:46:11.449
So I think it's just fabulous.

00:46:11.449 --> 00:46:12.490
But it's that same thing.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:15.660
It's realizing that individual
excellence, and a premium

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.830
on that, does not
negate the need

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.700
for that sense of
communication, and resonance,

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.410
and being able to work together.

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.000
And so I think it would
be a fantastic element

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.520
to bring into a
performance review.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:39.766
And in terms of a
leader, actually-- I'm

00:46:39.766 --> 00:46:41.390
sure they exist in
the corporate world.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.760
That's not the first
thought that I had.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.690
And you could probably tell
me more than I would know.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:55.180
But I actually thought
of different people

00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:04.040
I know working in
different fields.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:09.560
One-- I'm part of this
project through this place,

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.950
the Garrison
Institute, which is now

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:20.720
working with international
humanitarian aid workers,

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:27.630
and bringing tools like
yoga and meditation to that.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:34.080
And I see the creative,
dynamic, phenomenal leaders

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:40.890
of those organizations
that are willing to support

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:45.670
in a very different way the
people who are going out there.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:53.130
Because I think
the cultural norm--

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:56.130
and I've been told this
by different agency

00:47:56.130 --> 00:48:02.850
heads and so on-- they're fine.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.370
Or we can't spend any money
on "staff enrichment,"

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:07.350
is what they call it.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.382
And the consequence of
that is that, you know,

00:48:14.382 --> 00:48:17.910
these people are working in
incredible arenas of suffering

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:19.260
and trauma.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.670
And there's tremendous
burnout and kind

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:26.210
of emotional consequences,
psychological consequences,

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:29.050
for a lot of people.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.080
But there's a very
macho sort of norm,

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:38.130
plus probably some
fear about liability,

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:41.420
and admission of any kind
of vulnerability people

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.726
might be exposed to.

00:48:43.726 --> 00:48:47.760
So to see what seems to me
the courage and creativity

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.540
of an agency saying, we have
to take care of our people.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:57.590
This is not something frivolous
like staff enrichment.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:05.300
This is something that-- the
mission isn't just external.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.175
The mission is
internal, as well.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:11.850
To have that kind
of uniform view--

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:16.070
I feel like I've seen
that in different places.

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:17.540
And I really admire it.

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.020
And so you can
tell me where that

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.794
exists in the corporate culture.

00:49:20.794 --> 00:49:22.710
AUDIENCE: No, that's why
I asked the question.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:23.070
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.000
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.125
SHARON SALZBERG: Thank you.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.252
Yeah.

00:49:32.252 --> 00:49:34.710
AUDIENCE: I just want to echo
my thanks for you being here.

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:36.520
It's really an
honor to hear you.

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:40.580
And I did read your
book, "Real Happiness,"

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.360
which I think was the 28-day--

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.750
SHARON SALZBERG:
Yeah, challenge.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.140
AUDIENCE: So in that
book, my recollection

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.110
is you have a different type
of meditation for each week.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:53.510
And I'm curious, for somebody
who's beginning again

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:55.860
in meditation and who hasn't
had a regular practice,

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.010
do you think that
there's validity

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:01.700
in attempting the same type
of meditation every day,

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.240
like just focusing on
the breathing meditation?

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.960
Or does it matter?

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.340
Can you mix it up?

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.680
What are your real
recommendations

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:14.050
for somebody who
hasn't had the ability

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.453
to make meditation stick?

00:50:16.453 --> 00:50:17.411
SHARON SALZBERG: Mm-hm.

00:50:17.411 --> 00:50:19.000
I think you can mix it up.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.740
But I think it's
probably worth doing

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:27.970
one technique for a while, just
so you feel confident in it.

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:30.230
And some of it depends
on your own mind.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:32.820
Like, I have a very
distractable mind.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.660
A lot of the stories
I tell about the kind

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:38.920
of crazy wandering mind are
true things I experience.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.810
So I have the kind
of mind where,

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:43.440
once I learned more than one
technique, I would sit down,

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.273
I'd feel a few breaths,
and I'd think, well,

00:50:45.273 --> 00:50:46.240
this isn't working.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.510
Let me do some lovingkindness.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.968
Then I'd do some lovingkindness
for two and a half seconds,

00:50:49.968 --> 00:50:51.630
and then I'd think,
wow, that's boring.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:52.160
You know?

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.710
Let me listen to sound.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:57.310
And so I saw from
that that I did better

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:01.950
with some structure-- basically
saying, OK, for this week,

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:05.840
I'm going to basically try this,
unless something huge happens

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.850
that I feel the need to change.

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:10.520
And that helps me.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.520
I had this conversation.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.510
I saw Dan Harris
yesterday, coincidentally.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.470
And he's been recommending
people sit five minutes a day.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:21.220
And I said to him,
I understand that.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:26.090
And I think in many
ways, that's good.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:27.590
Especially if you
don't have longer,

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.256
it's absolutely worth doing
the five minutes a day.

00:51:30.256 --> 00:51:32.380
But I said, you realize
that the first five minutes

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.610
are the hardest five minutes.

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:37.290
Because when we
sit down at home,

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:39.860
usually, the first
five minutes are just

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.281
this torrent of thoughts.

00:51:41.281 --> 00:51:41.780
You know?

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.990
It's like, I forgot
to call so-and-so,

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:45.310
and what's that sound?

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.620
I think it's my refrigerator.

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.710
Oh, no, what if my
refrigerator's breaking?

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:51.017
Can you get a refrigerator
repair person anymore

00:51:51.017 --> 00:51:51.600
in this world?

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.360
I don't know.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.550
Maybe I need to get
a new refrigerator.

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:54.280
How do I do that?

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.190
Where am I going
to order it from?

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.390
Does Sears still exist?

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.890
You know?

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:57.390
Like.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:58.130
SHARON SALZBERG: Right.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.629
You know.

00:51:58.629 --> 00:52:01.170
So it's just a lot of that.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.514
And let's just say that
lasts five minutes,

00:52:04.514 --> 00:52:05.930
and you sit for
only five minutes.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.950
That's good, because that's
like a discharge of tension

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.030
and stress.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.740
But you don't have a
chance to go deeper.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.100
So if you've only
got five minutes,

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.570
I say, yes, do five minutes.

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:21.310
If you can do 10 or 15 or
20, it's that much better.

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:22.890
But it's the every
day-ness of it

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:26.070
that is the most
important thing.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:27.660
OK, we need to stop.

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.286
Or you need to stop, anyway.

00:52:29.286 --> 00:52:31.710
[LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:39.260
SHARON SALZBERG: Thank you.
