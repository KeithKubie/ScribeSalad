00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.150
Good evening, I'm Homi Bhabha,
and I direct the Mahindra

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.830
Humanities Center.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.540
And when an eminent faculty
member from the business school

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.940
accepts our invitation to
speak at the Humanities Center,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.810
we know that the humanities
are back in business.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.640
So it is a great pleasure
to have our dear friends

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.140
who you will now--

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.462
who will zap you with
wonderful ideas and thoughts.

00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:40.170
You know, the whole
purpose of being here

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.380
is to be part of the discussion.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.070
Trust, the subject of
Tarun Khanna's new book

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.780
could not be more
topical at the moment.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.820
And the link between
trust and truth

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.880
and also alternative
truth I hope

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.895
will be explored in some depth.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.100
Tarun's new book is
a concern with which

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.090
humanists and
business experts have

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.000
something to say to each other.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600
And indeed, it is
for that reason

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.450
that we have Caroline
Elkins, Professors Elkins,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.640
I will introduce both
people more formally,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
but Caroline is in the
history department as well as

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.790
the business school.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.640
So we have a number of
bridging concerns and bridging

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.510
individuals here.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.380
And this is exactly what we like
to do, to bring people together

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.560
from different parts
of the university.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:54.160
The really important issue that
Tarun draws our attention to,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.350
as I understand it,
is that, as he says,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.040
trust is something that
communicates itself

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.840
most easily through
individual entrepreneurship

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.370
and individual agency.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.330
That's the most, as it were,
friendly face of trust when

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.260
you can trust somebody.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.640
But what happens when
you have to scale up

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.756
the question of trust?

00:02:28.756 --> 00:02:31.370
When you have to
trust governments.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.070
When you have to
trust institutions.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.980
When you have to
trust corporations.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.730
And in each of these
instances, you do not quite

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.780
have the face to face.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.040
Although, you may try
to do it in many ways.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.870
And, of course, one
of the prime tropes

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.250
of the media representation
of organizations

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.150
is actually the
face of the leader,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.580
or the face of the worker,
or the face of the attendant,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.920
that's the way in
which identification

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.822
is most often communicated.

00:03:05.822 --> 00:03:09.500
That's the way in which
trust is built up.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.882
Through television or
through advertisements.

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:22.420
And so my provocation is this,
and it's a small provocation,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.450
that when Tarun argues
quite reasonably

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.640
that the solution
to the problems

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.640
caused by mistrust
usually lies ultimately

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.580
with the insights of an
individual entrepreneur.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.790
And then he talks about
Sam Walton and Walmart.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.370
He said Walmart sought to
compensate for the missing

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.120
retail infrastructure in what
was then small town America.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.020
Indeed, very much like the
developing country settings

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.260
I consider in his book,
he considers in his book,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.010
ultimately, Walton earned
the trust of tens of millions

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.400
of Americans who could reliably
find affordable merchandise

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.790
in thousands of hitherto
inaccessible locations.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.220
And I think that is true.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.990
But is there not
also the problem

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.370
that in setting up these
commercial [INAUDIBLE],,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.430
much that was happening in small
town by smaller entrepreneurs,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.780
by people who had a history
of the local ecology,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.032
have often been displaced.

00:04:28.032 --> 00:04:32.230
And that is the kind of issue, I
think, that from my perspective

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.060
I am very interested
in exploring today.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.660
Of course, when these
large ocean liners sweep

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.130
into the smaller areas, there
is a great sense of mistrust

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.657
because people are displaced,
or practices, customs, trades,

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:51.240
are displaced.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.880
So I think this is
something that's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.910
very important from a
humanistic point of view.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.340
Because for us, of course,
the convenience aspect

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.630
of the large conglomerates
which certainly

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.740
keep prices down, but also
standardize a number of things.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.880
They produce a
standardization, and maybe we

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.650
need that for a certain
kind of survival,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.444
but we also need
to question that.

00:05:23.444 --> 00:05:28.780
Tarun Khanna is director of
the Lakshmi Mittal South Asia

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.770
Institute at Harvard, and the
Jorge Paolo Lemann Professor

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.290
at the business school
where he studies

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.840
the dive that the drivers
of entrepreneurship

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.380
in emerging markets as a
means of economic and social

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.740
development.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.870
His many publications include
Winning in Emerging Markets

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.400
and Billions of Entrepreneurs.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.640
And when he talks about
global entrepreneurship,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.860
he knows what he
talks about because he

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.430
speaks several languages, and
he travels across the world.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.230
He actually locates himself,
often with his family,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.700
in specific places like
China to actually see

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.180
the efficacy of the
business machine

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.530
in the context of the
cultures that he is studying.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.520
After Tarun speaks, we'll
have a short response

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.590
from Caroline Elkins.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.160
Who will then pose some
questions to him before she

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.630
opens up a discussion with you.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.450
Professor Caroline Elkins
is Professor of History

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.000
and African and African-American
studies at Harvard.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.330
The founding director
of Harvard's Center

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.510
for African Studies
and visiting professor

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.860
of Business Administration
at the business school.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.160
Her first book, Imperial
Reckoning: The Untold Story

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.970
of Britain's Gulag in Kenya,
was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.660
And her forthcoming book
explores violence and the end

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.720
of the British Empire.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:06.930
So here we have a historian
of business practices working

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.362
at the scale of the larger
business enterprises,

00:07:13.362 --> 00:07:17.990
and then we have a historian
who is interested in business

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.320
practices and whose
landscape again,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.900
is the landscape of empire.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.540
Thank you both very
much for being here.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.640
Tarun, Caroline,
please come occupy

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.670
these esteemed [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.360
Yes, thank you.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.826
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.030
We are waiting for
the laptop to wake up

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.484
because Homi turned it off.

00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:11.767
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:11.767 --> 00:08:12.850
He doesn't even know that.

00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:21.670
OK, great.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.570
Thank you very much.

00:08:25.774 --> 00:08:27.190
Carolyn and I
thought what we'd do

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.559
is I'd just spend maybe 10,
15, at most 20 hopefully, not

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:37.159
20 minutes, just
sharing the basic idea

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:42.600
of this book and then,
maybe a couple of stories.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.710
And then, hopefully,
we can have more

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.112
of a dialogue and an exchange.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.320
By training-- I mean I've
been at the business school

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.910
for 25 odd years,
and over this time

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.520
I work almost exclusively
in poor countries.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.100
The poorer, the
better for my research

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.550
interests because my
intellectual interest

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.180
is in understanding really the
role of the individual actor.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.110
What can an individual
do about the miasma

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.910
that you often find
yourself surrounded by,

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.110
and you can pick your
version of unpleasantness.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:23.240
Corruption, instability,
fake news, whatever you want.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.552
And my interest is really
less than in pointing fingers

00:09:26.552 --> 00:09:28.010
at the government
and saying you're

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.410
corrupt because that's often
self-evidently the case,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.787
or you have limited state
capacity, what have you.

00:09:34.787 --> 00:09:36.620
Not that those are not
interesting questions

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.890
for the political
scientists et cetera,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.040
but my own interest is
in sort of the expression

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.710
of individual agency
and creativity,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.830
and what is it that you
can do to get around this?

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.300
This book is just a taking
pause exercise for me,

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.930
just reflecting on
some individuals

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.860
that I've been working
with for the last year.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.360
So everybody in
this book is someone

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:03.070
that I've worked with
and respect and have

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.550
had the good fortune
to participate in

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.820
either in their success
or in some cases

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.369
their failures for
the past, let's say,

00:10:12.369 --> 00:10:14.410
10 years for the sake of
argument, sometimes much

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.040
longer, sometimes shorter.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.540
So it's really a taking stock
exercise for me, primarily.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.130
And through that, I'm hoping,
through some simple narrative

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.020
is just to create a little
bit of a conceptual framework

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.780
also that's communicated
to the reader.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.750
So that's the idea.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:37.510
These are some of the concrete,
motivating cases, if you will,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.380
that got me started on this
writing exercise roughly a year

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.330
and a half ago.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.760
I've been very involved
in the attempts

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.050
by the government in China,
when I say government,

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.730
obviously that's an
amorphous entity,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.530
but I mean different
levels of government,

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.680
attempting to do something about
what I refer to as the poison

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.270
milk scandal which gripped
China starting in about 2008.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.680
And essentially it
was unscrupulous acts

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.170
by various entities
contaminating milk

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.164
to make it look like it had a
higher protein content which

00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:12.580
then would allow
them to dilute it

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.409
and sell a mixture
of water and milk.

00:11:14.409 --> 00:11:16.450
And it turned out to be
an insidious problem that

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.390
killed a number of infants
and compromised people's

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.990
immune systems and
so on and so forth.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.240
And I like this problem,
it sounds odd to say,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.060
I like this problem because
it's truly intractable.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.880
It's been, despite the
machinery of the Chinese state,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.705
it's been almost impossible
to completely eradicate.

00:11:34.705 --> 00:11:36.340
And the second part
of the story is

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.610
that I ended up teaming
up with, working with,

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.140
a Chinese entrepreneur who
worked to address this and had,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.230
I would say, a reasonable
success addressing it,

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:52.180
so that's just one
example of this.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.460
What's another one?

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.410
I like this one, why
do multibillion-dollar

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.580
microfinance firms with
robust consumer bases,

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.970
think tens of millions of
typically poor women borrowing

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.700
small amounts of money on
a monthly basis from them

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.890
to invest in their
own livelihoods,

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.500
why do these companies
often completely collapse?

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.120
I am the main director
in one of the biggest

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.120
such microfinance
firms in the world

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.930
and had a ringside
seat in really

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.770
baptism by fire in the complete
collapse of microfinance

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:32.480
in a particular part of
India around 2010, 2011.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.650
And I felt like I learned a
lot about trust and mistrust

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.040
and the creation
of trust and so on.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.060
So that might be a good
example to learn from.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.465
That particular one is
extremely controversial.

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:45.490
So there are lots
of people who are

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.130
on every side of every possible
view that you can hold.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.250
So all I can do is tell
you what my view is.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.710
And that the view is expressed
in the book in a fair amount

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.240
of detail, et cetera.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.310
So as you can see, the
settings from which

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.850
I draw these stories in the
book are pretty wide-ranging.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.780
They're not industry specific.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.660
They're not really
country specific.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.340
Except they tend to
be countries where

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.790
I have a very deep
immersion into the country.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.200
China and India self-evidently
based on my past work

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.380
and ongoing involvement.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.850
My chair at Harvard
is a Brazilian,

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:22.800
so I end up doing some work
in Brazil and Latin America.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.330
And it's nice to have
Kerry as the interlocutor

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.980
here because Africa, though
conspicuously absent,

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.270
is one of my favorite
traveling grounds,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.312
and to educate myself and so on.

00:13:34.312 --> 00:13:36.520
So it would be nice to have
a conversation about some

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.730
of these ideas
playing out in Africa.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.625
Now, the idea of the book--

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:43.740
Well, let me back
up for a second.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.110
The idea of the book is that
if you think about something

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.130
as well-known, I
suppose in folklore now

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.050
as building Facebook
in the Harvard

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.630
dorms, that is, of course,
it's a difficult exercise,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.070
but it's not it's
not as difficult

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.510
as it might be if you tried
to do Facebook in Bogota.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.380
And the reason is that
Zuckerberg had access

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.500
to any amount of supporting
institutions around him.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.080
Lots of risk capital,
if he needed it.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.640
Lots of assessment firms.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.930
Lots of talent in the university
system surrounding him.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.800
Lawyers, people valuing
intellectual property.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.760
You could come up with
a laundry list of 20

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.680
or 30 well-structured
support systems for profit,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.660
not for profit, what
have you, that would

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.780
help him launch the enterprise.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.390
Now, in 90% of the
world, maybe more,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.772
these support
systems are missing.

00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:43.230
So the question
becomes, what is it

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.140
that you do as an aspiring
creative person trying

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.549
to address, in that case,
it's not a social problem,

00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:51.840
it's a particular problem of
connectivity that ended up

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.124
being insanely profitable.

00:14:54.124 --> 00:14:56.040
But whether you're working
on a social problem

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.190
like maternal health, or you're
working on vaccine delivery,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.730
or you're working on a get
rich quick scheme of some sort,

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.486
the point is that
you don't have access

00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:05.860
to the supporting
infrastructure.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.280
And I think that's an endemic
feature of every developing

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.620
country that I can
think of that I've

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.050
had the good and the
less good fortune

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.200
to be wandering around in.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.780
So the crux of what
I argue in the book

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.960
is that in those
circumstances, it becomes--

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.520
the central task
of the entrepreneur

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.180
becomes not just to set
out to do what she set out

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.040
to do in the first
instance, but also

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.960
to compensate for
the inadequacies

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.740
around that particular time.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.220
So I use this sort of cute
phrase in the book over

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.550
and over again because it
captures things, to me,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.670
in a succinct fashion, that
it is not enough to create,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.860
you also have to create
the conditions to create

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.040
in the first instance.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.820
You have to somehow partially
or completely, for that matter,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.740
compensate for the
inadequacies around you.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.840
And in doing so,
typically what I

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.910
found is that those folks who
have embraced that mindset

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.381
end up creating what economists
call public goods, right?

00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:05.130
So typically, we say
that the public goods

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.260
like basic primary
health, and primary--

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.840
and roads, and power
plants, and so on,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.249
are the province of the state.

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:13.290
And the state should
provide those, and everybody

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.810
else free rides on them, and
that's the social contract

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.644
that you enter into.

00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:18.643
That's what a political
scientist will tell you.

00:16:18.643 --> 00:16:20.347
That's what economists
would tell you.

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:21.930
But the question
that I struggled with

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.640
is, what happens when
you're an aspiring

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.500
entrepreneur in such
places, and the state

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.430
is a corrupt, dysfunctional,
defunct, venal, bitter

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.520
adjective, and it's simply
not likely in your lifetime

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.680
to do what it's
supposed to be doing.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.990
My argument is that
everybody is better off

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.030
if the individual
entrepreneur in those cases

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.730
engages in what I
sometimes referred to

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.470
as the partial private
provision of public goods.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.140
In other words, get on with it.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.790
Address the problem
that's actually otherwise

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.500
an endemic problem
for everybody.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.390
In the course of it you
will create solutions

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.340
that typically other people
will then free ride on, right?

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.940
So one critique that I
get from this argument

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.876
all the time from--

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:04.410
What's a canonical
critic of mine?

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.319
--would be somebody
at the World Bank,

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.400
who would say that this is
a very unfair proposition

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.400
because you're putting
too much on the shoulders

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.608
of the would-be entrepreneur.

00:17:12.608 --> 00:17:16.170
Not only do they have to
build a medical device firm,

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.480
but they have to solve all
these other issues around them,

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.772
and I agree with that charge.

00:17:21.772 --> 00:17:23.980
Of course, it's more difficult
than building Facebook

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.640
in the Harvard dorms, but
that's neither here nor there

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.270
because my challenge
as a retort to that

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.120
is, tell me a better solution.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.630
It's not as though
aid has worked.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.940
It's not as though
multilateral donor programs

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.070
have worked particularly well.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.430
Government corruption
isn't particularly

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.195
getting reduced over time.

00:17:45.195 --> 00:17:47.280
So this is a tough proposition.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.270
The task of the entrepreneur
in different places

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.950
around the world is
indeed more onerous

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.783
than it would be in
Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.610
or in the Bay Area.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.492
But it remains the
most practical purpose.

00:17:59.492 --> 00:18:01.200
Now, what the second
part of what I argue

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.926
is that in order to
be able to create

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:07.800
these conditions to
create, one of the things

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.830
that you have to do is
make explicit the objective

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.500
of fostering trust
in some ways when

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.630
you are surrounded
by several reasons

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.420
not to trust in some ways.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.400
And to make that concrete,
I think what I'd like to do

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.780
is basically, take you
through one example.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.870
The example of
microfinance just to make

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.770
it concrete from these ideas.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.786
So I'll skip ahead
here and get to that.

00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:33.910
I'll come back to this one.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.200
This is one of my
favorite examples.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.460
So do people know
what microfinance is?

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.100
Can you raise your
hand if you know?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.630
Can you raise your hand if
you don't know what it is?

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.070
Somebody is lying.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.850
Yeah, for sure.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.290
Microfinance has
been-- actually,

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.300
it's as old as the hills.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.866
It's been around forever,
in every society.

00:18:55.866 --> 00:18:57.910
It's most popularized
by Muhammad Yunus

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.500
before he won the Nobel Prize.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.992
And the idea is that there
is a self-help group.

00:19:02.992 --> 00:19:04.450
There's typically
a group of women,

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.783
though doesn't have to be women.

00:19:05.783 --> 00:19:09.310
Typically it is women in a poor,
sort of unbanked community, who

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.880
get together and essentially
traditionally would just

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.039
share their resources.

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:17.080
Somebody-- They would all
pool together the money

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.454
and lend it to
one woman one time

00:19:18.454 --> 00:19:21.230
and another woman the
other time et cetera.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.290
Organized microfinance
essentially

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:27.550
entails a formal
organization, which

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.890
may be a non-profit or a
for-profit organization,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.540
coming in and saying, we will
lend you the money, right?

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.680
But we are going
to essentially--

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.040
because we have no way
to ascertain credit risk,

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.520
since there's no information
sources on whether lady

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.350
one or lady six is the right
person to receive the credit

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.140
or is credit worthy, we are
going to free ride on the fact

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.760
that you all know each other,
and you will police each other.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.330
In other words, each loan
that we make to people

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.414
is a joint liability loan.

00:19:56.414 --> 00:19:58.621
Everybody is collectively
responsible for the payback

00:19:58.621 --> 00:19:59.140
of the loan.

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:03.760
So economists typically
break this down

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.890
and say in any lending
activity, there

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.370
is a information problem and
then a reassurance problem.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.810
The information
problem is that I

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.440
don't know who's worth lending
to and who's a deadbeat.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.785
And the reassurance problem
is that once I make that loan,

00:20:16.785 --> 00:20:19.780
am I going to be sure that
she's going to pay me back?

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.729
In both cases, you're using
the existing social structure

00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:25.270
of the village to solve those
problems because you don't have

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.270
any infrastructure to do it.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.220
A microfinance firm
is just a company

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.274
that recognizes that
it can free ride

00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:34.690
on the social structure of the
village to make these loans

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.010
and repossess them.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.180
So now what happens-- this is
probably the world's biggest

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.880
microfinance firm, and I
sit on the board of this,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.070
and I've shepherded it
through for the last 10, 15

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.910
years, 10 years.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.760
But the interesting
episode here is

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:57.180
that around 2010 about 30%
of the loans that we made

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.700
through this company
to poor women

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.100
were in the state of
Andhra Pradesh in India

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.110
which is one of the southern
states in the country.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:12.130
And the official interest rates
that we were charging women

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:17.170
at the time was around 25%,
28%, for a simple loan, which

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.600
turns out to be extremely
low when you compare globally

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.280
to interest rates
on these loans.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.850
Now, the government was
providing loans ostensibly

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.020
at 5%, but in practice
what would happen

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.340
is that women would
always gravitate to us

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.714
and firms that were run like
ours, very systematically,

00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:39.130
because they knew that they
could count on us to be there.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.030
They knew that they could count
on us to behave ethically.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.354
Not engage in unscrupulous
practices, et cetera.

00:21:46.354 --> 00:21:47.770
Whereas with a
government official

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.020
there was a lot of corruption.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.380
There were aside payments.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.440
There was abuse of all
sorts of the women,

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.910
and so they stayed away.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:22:00.020
Now, this company decided
that it would go public.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.620
It was founded by a gentleman
named Vikram Akula who

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.740
was a political scientist, PhD
from the University of Chicago,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.430
a very accomplished guy, and
built it up into this behemoth,

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.930
and decided he would
take it public.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.560
In the course of it, it
was sort of India's biggest

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.400
public listing in a long time.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.770
So it ended up being
worth billions of dollars.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.770
So this guy got extremely rich.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.930
This was like sticking
a finger in the eye

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.140
of the local corrupt
politician who

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.260
saw that he was being out
competed on the ground

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.380
since the women
wouldn't come to him.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.360
And on top of that, this
upstart got really rich.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.530
I want to make it clear
that I didn't get very rich.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.150
I was just doing service.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.680
But Vikram did get
extremely rich.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.840
And so what the government did
when they realized that they

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:50.080
were not getting rich was,
exactly as elections are often

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.800
done in poor countries,
they got an army of Jeeps,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.530
sat on the Jeeps with
the loudspeakers,

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.550
and started a campaign saying
all these microfinance firms

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.784
are guilty of
unscrupulous behavior.

00:23:02.784 --> 00:23:04.950
You don't need to pay them
back because we are going

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.950
to be banning them anyway.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.580
Now, the way
microfinance works is

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.860
if you're not paid
back on a weekly basis

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.680
or a bi-weekly basis your
balance sheet quickly

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.170
shrinks to zero, and you
can go bankrupt right away.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.910
So despite having a
track record of seven,

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.590
eight years of
incredible service

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.010
to the women of this
particular state,

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.562
once the politicians
got into high gear

00:23:30.562 --> 00:23:32.770
and spread this message that
there was really no need

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.350
to repay because we were
going to be banned anyway,

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.940
the women stopped repaying.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.550
Not just us, but all
organized microfinance.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.120
And within the
space of two months,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.830
most organized
microfinance was driven

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.090
to the verge of bankruptcy.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.960
Now, of course, the
politicians had no interest

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.790
in actually compensating for
driving out all these firms,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.890
so credit dried down, suicide
rates went up through the roof

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.462
because women were driven
back to the money lenders

00:23:59.462 --> 00:24:00.420
and so on and so forth.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.399
So this is the crisis.

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:03.940
I'm sorry for the long preamble
that I had to say what it was

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.360
and how we got to
this situation.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.900
There were arrest warrants
out for me, for the chairman,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.290
for the CEO, for all the loan
officers, a bunch of our loan

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:19.970
officers got thrown into,
yes, got thrown into jail.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.070
We had spouses and
elderly parents dying.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.730
And so this is the situation I
found myself in as the person

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.940
having to deal with this.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.760
You don't want to be
in an Indian jail.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.800
This is a bad situation
because there's

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.940
no mechanism to come out.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.450
It's Kafkaesque, and I
think that might be polite.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.580
So the social fabric
in the village

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.290
is completely devastated.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:55.270
Suicide rates have gone
up, arrests and trauma.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.120
The global media is
busy writing stories

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.575
saying this is a travesty
because they were seeing

00:25:00.575 --> 00:25:02.200
the way that we were
actually managing,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.370
and they realized
what was going on.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.745
So we op-eds in the Financial
Times, Wall Street Journal,

00:25:05.745 --> 00:25:07.750
saying, you know the
state government has

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.070
got to stop this, and
do something better.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.830
Well, the global media is
irrelevant in a local conflict.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.490
Nobody in the streets
of Andhra Pradesh

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.730
reads the Financial Times, the
Wall Street Journal or anything

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:20.510
like that.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.260
They read the local
vernacular media,

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.030
and I must say I was
completely stymied.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.397
I didn't realize that there
was an entire vernacular,

00:25:28.397 --> 00:25:30.980
of course, I knew intellectually
there was a vernacular media.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.854
I could see it, but did
you realize that this

00:25:32.854 --> 00:25:35.160
where the conversation was
going on in the background.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.544
And that was printing
lies and innuendo,

00:25:37.544 --> 00:25:38.960
and it just turned
out that it was

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.020
owned by the very same
politicians who had actually

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.810
started spreading the rumors.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.280
Every single firm
in the industry

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.210
went bankrupt, except us.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.970
We decided that we would
somehow stick it out.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.900
And at that point, it was
pretty clear to myself

00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.100
and my colleagues that
the fabric of trust

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.850
had irreparably
frayed at this point.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.670
And that it was so easy for
unscrupulous politicians

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.110
to essentially poke a
hole in this carefully,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.940
carefully set up over
five, seven years

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.000
business model that we
had cultivated over time

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.700
and had taken to material
success and success

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.020
for the 50 million odd women
that we were lending money to,

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.810
and whose lives had been
literally transformed.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.000
I am actually extremely
proud of this company.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.490
And the amounts of lives
that I think we've touched

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.610
is really quite something.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.110
I'm sorry.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.800
So here is what we actually
did to sort of rebuild

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.661
trust in some sense.

00:26:39.661 --> 00:26:41.410
And this, the journey
that I'm describing,

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.290
is 2010 to 2018 now.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.180
It's about a eight-year
journey, right?

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.650
First, we shrunk the company
to about one-third its size.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.570
In other words,
we had to conserve

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.652
what little money we had.

00:26:55.652 --> 00:26:57.610
The way this works is
you have a certain amount

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.420
of working capital and
capital flow coming in.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.670
You're lending it out in
$50, $100, $200 amounts,

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:09.260
so even as little as $10
to millions of women.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.800
But if you need the money
to repay other people

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.774
and maintain the fabric
of what you've built,

00:27:13.774 --> 00:27:15.190
you no longer have
money lend out.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.940
So that's what I mean
by saying we shrunk.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.180
So we went from serving
50 million women

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.160
and making these
numbers, directionally

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.290
down to say 12 million
or 13 million women.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.820
So the firm essentially
collapsed, but it was solvent.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.250
The entire team committed
that we would not

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:35.110
quit because I felt that
if any of us walked away,

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.009
that would begin.

00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:38.800
It's difficult for me
to communicate to you

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.010
the drama of the situation
because even in my home

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:46.180
in Newton Mass, we were getting
threatening lawsuit letters.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.890
My wife would get
upset at me saying why

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.098
the heck aren't you quitting?

00:27:49.098 --> 00:27:51.430
Because you get these
big fat subpoenas saying

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.830
show up in this court
et cetera Threatening

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.110
letters, voice mails,
the whole nine yards.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.310
And all of us, the entire
senior management, and I

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.080
recognized that for
me it was actually

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.030
a lot easier because
I could always

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.850
leave Hyderabad, the city
where this was unfolding,

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.032
and come back to my
comfortable home in Newton.

00:28:09.032 --> 00:28:10.990
But these guys were living
it on a daily basis,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.320
on the ground with accusations
and counter-accusations.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.950
None of these people quit.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.121
We repaid every single bank
from whom we had borrowed money.

00:28:19.121 --> 00:28:20.620
So we borrowed money
from the banks,

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.720
and then we lend it
out in tiny amounts.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.360
Every single bank,
on time, no haircuts.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.710
In other words, a haircut just
means that you owe a bank $50

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.990
and you say, hey
listen I can't pay you,

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.580
why don't you just
accept 25 bucks?

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.000
This is what-- What is an
example of a haircut right now?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.176
Argentina is doing to
its global debtors.

00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:41.050
It's basically saying
I really can't pay you,

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:41.980
so I'll pay less.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.590
Do you want to take
it or leave it, right?

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.780
So we said we're not
going to do that.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.060
We immediately shut down
our business in that state

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.600
because we could see
the corruption levels.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.120
And then we took the high
road with the regulators

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.815
and the central bank governor,
the minister of finance,

00:28:57.815 --> 00:28:59.440
personally going to
every single person

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.590
and saying this is
what's actually happened.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.956
In the heat of the moment,
nobody believes you.

00:29:04.956 --> 00:29:07.300
But you simply keep repeating
it and keep doing it

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.485
and so on and so forth.

00:29:08.485 --> 00:29:14.200
Cut a long story short, we
recovered, this is 2010,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.157
and this is today.

00:29:15.157 --> 00:29:16.490
This is sort of the stock price.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.340
You can see it's essentially
back to where it was.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.930
It's a eight-year journey to
repair the torn fabric of trust

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.100
through individual
actions, right?

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.840
Now, with the
benefit of hindsight,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.690
right, there are a
number of things that--

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:29.690
I won't go into details.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.140
There are a number of things
that we could have done back

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.922
before the crisis started
that would have strengthened

00:29:35.922 --> 00:29:36.755
the entire industry.

00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:39.170
It would not have benefited
us disproportionately

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.680
but would have benefited
the entire industry.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.810
That would have reduced
the odds of something

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:48.160
like this happening.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.460
I wish I had the wisdom at the
time to have recognized that.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.770
So an example of
this would be, there

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.290
were plenty of unscrupulous
firms in the industry that

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:02.270
were doing things like
resorting to coercive behavior

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.445
when repossessing the loans.

00:30:03.445 --> 00:30:06.170
So when they would go to a
self-help group like the women

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:10.580
that you saw and they would
say, OK, you guys pay up,

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.980
and the collective would say,
it's difficult for us to pay,

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.350
so we're not going to pay.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:16.970
They would beat them up.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.310
So there were people who
did things like that.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.920
We knew it, or I
believe that we knew

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.070
that other people
were doing this,

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.689
and we chose to be silent.

00:30:27.689 --> 00:30:29.230
Including me, we
choose to be silent.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.522
We didn't do anything about it.

00:30:30.522 --> 00:30:32.771
And that came back to haunt
us even though we were not

00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:34.370
engaging in unethical
behavior, there

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.850
were people in the
industry who were.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.670
And I often ask myself now,
what should we have done?

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.485
And I don't really
know the right answer.

00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:42.782
And I'm not--

00:30:42.782 --> 00:30:44.240
I don't have enough
hubris to think

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.200
I could have stopped
it all, but I certainly

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.450
think we could have done more.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.810
And that created an opening for
the unscrupulous politicians

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.550
to basically say,
there plenty of people

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.470
who are beating women
up, and so, therefore,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.780
we should shut this thing down.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.190
And in a very, very
narrow technical sense

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.620
they were correct because there
did exist a few people who

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.492
were doing that.

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:02.700
And we could have stopped it.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.116
And so there are
a series of three

00:31:04.116 --> 00:31:07.130
or four things that at the
level of conduct and structure

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:11.720
of the industry, I do believe
we could have done much more.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.640
And that's what I mean
by saying creating

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.140
the conditions to create.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.350
So if there isn't a policing
mechanism out there--

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.431
Another example that
makes it very concrete,

00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:24.410
if there is a woman who
is borrowing from me

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.050
and finds that she can't
pay me, if there is no check

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.760
and balance she has
a strong incentive

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.260
to go to the next
microfinance firm

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.760
and borrow from
them to pay me back.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.010
And then to go to the third,
and the fourth, and the fifth,

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.635
and there are these
little Ponzi scheme

00:31:35.635 --> 00:31:36.920
like entities that are set up.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.400
The only solution to that is
to have a credit registry where

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.770
anytime you make a loan it
gets recorded centrally,

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.930
so that the next
person who comes along,

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.540
when she asks for a loan can
check against the registry

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.150
to say, has this
person taken too much

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.700
is it beyond her capacity
to repay, et cetera?

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.192
We were contributing
to the credit registry.

00:31:55.192 --> 00:31:56.900
Again, we knew that
other people were not

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.399
contributing to the
registry, but we

00:31:58.399 --> 00:31:59.640
didn't do anything about it.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.520
We fixed that problem.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.510
So what I mean is that
the credit registry

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.320
is a good concrete example.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.800
It's an institutional
mechanism to reduce

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.080
certain forms of
behavior that compromised

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.580
the entire structure.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.701
It has to be created, in theory,
by the regulator who was asleep

00:32:17.701 --> 00:32:18.950
at the wheel and didn't do it.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.110
In theory, by the
political process

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.090
which is asleep at the
wheel and didn't do it.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.965
We are the leading firm
in the industry making hay

00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:26.840
while the sun shines.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.805
We can see that the
infrastructure is lacking.

00:32:29.805 --> 00:32:31.430
What I'm saying in
this book is that it

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.320
is our responsibility,
and actually

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.190
in our self-interest in
the longer run to do it.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.150
But at the moment,
very few people do it.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.920
So that's really the
message of the book

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.070
is that to build
enterprises that end up

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.130
being robust and trustworthy
when you're surrounded

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.710
by mistrust, in effect.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.470
You have to go the extra mile
to cobble this all together.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.566
Otherwise, it's not
going to happen.

00:32:53.566 --> 00:32:55.212
So let me just stop
with that example

00:32:55.212 --> 00:32:56.670
because there are
plenty of others,

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.271
and I think it captures
what I wanted to say.

00:33:00.271 --> 00:33:00.770
OK.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.070
You can leave this
nice picture up.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:09.820
OK.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:09.990
Sure.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.489
Yeah.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.110
Well, thank you Tarun,
that was wonderful.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.410
And Homi, we thank you so much
for inviting me this evening.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.300
Sarah and your entire team.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.810
And I want to say a few
words about the book itself.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.880
And then make a
few observations,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.050
and then we can have a
chat about a few things.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.800
But you said in your
introductory remarks

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.160
that this is just sort of
a taking stock exercise.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.470
It's much more than that.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:48.540
I think-- Well, Tarun it's
an extraordinary triumph

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.840
in so far as the book is a true
integration between somebody

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.090
who is a practitioner
consistently having

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:59.390
a ringside seat and who thinks
about the framing of this

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.270
and the conceptual framework
which I'll come back to.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.400
Both with an academic and a
quantitative lens in many ways,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.650
but as a humanist, right?

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.110
And so this picture is
actually perfect when I was--

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.659
Already in my
remarks, it's up here

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:16.610
because to give one example
you don't explicitly say this,

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.219
but you're talking about Victor
Turner and ritual processes

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:21.199
when it comes to
these centers, which

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.190
is what this is called up here.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:27.830
And the ways in which there are
these consistent daily rituals

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.469
of these women
around microfinance.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.110
The calling of the
meeting, all of this,

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.610
in order to create the capacity,
as you call the capacity,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:38.690
to aspire.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.429
And how successful that is.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:42.960
Along with, of course,
the group pressure

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.960
and the rest to pay back
the loans and the like.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.011
In other words,
it's a humanist eye

00:34:47.011 --> 00:34:48.469
that you bring to
this because it's

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.760
much more than just the
graph that you saw there

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.130
that makes all of this work.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:56.860
And we can also go back to
Brazil with the Bolsa Familia

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.090
where you talk
about, where Tarun

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:04.520
talks about the state-run
enterprise or entrepreneurship

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.500
if you will, which
I'll come to, where

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.120
a family had been lent money.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.020
And long story short
there's this poignant scene

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.940
where after 25 years of
investing in new food machines,

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.950
investing in all
these kinds of things,

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.290
the couple for the first
time, and at this point they

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.370
had amassed a fair
amount of wealth,

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.950
so they could have done this
before, but for the first time,

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.070
and Tarun takes you
into the restaurant,

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.730
they go out for dinner.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:32.000
And somebody serves them.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.710
And I thought that
is somebody who

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.214
has been there on the front
lines as an ethnographer

00:35:36.214 --> 00:35:36.880
seeing all this.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.005
So I would be, I want to
go on to sort of some more

00:35:39.005 --> 00:35:42.290
substantive things, but I would
be remiss in not saying this

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.355
because that's what makes
this book so important.

00:35:45.355 --> 00:35:46.730
Particularly in
light of the fact

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.912
that over in my
life at HBS, I work

00:35:48.912 --> 00:35:50.370
on Africa, a whole
range of things,

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.010
but I teach a course
on soft skills

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.950
which is taught to all
first-year MBAs at HOBS.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.470
It's an entire course.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.250
And you can swing
a cat right now

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.595
and hit a book on trust, right?

00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:01.970
You know you go
to the bookstore.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.090
You go to Heathrow in
the business section.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:08.810
And they are organizational
behavior and management folks,

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.960
and you can kind of
reduce it all down

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.980
if you read several dozen
books, which I've done thus far.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.600
Sort of the idea that
trust is a willingness

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.899
to be vulnerable in the
management context, right?

00:36:20.899 --> 00:36:22.940
I have different things
that I would add to that,

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.150
but overall that's the
claim that many are making

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.760
in different kinds of contexts.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.630
And you're doing something quite
different with the word trust.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.000
And the intervention
that you're making

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.190
is outside of that
organizational behavior

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.700
capacity, which is a huge
field right now, to really have

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.800
a book that stands on its own.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.244
And I think that there are a few
things that strike me within,

00:36:46.244 --> 00:36:47.660
and you went through
some of them.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.930
The conceptual framework.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.620
The creating the
conditions to create

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.619
I must confess when I
first read that, I thought

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:55.720
to myself, well, what is?

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.700
You know I kind of
had to go back and--

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.010
But really this sort
of the even the gutsy

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:03.380
and creative
entrepreneurs can't merely

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.060
set out to create, right?

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.174
That they must in
the developing world,

00:37:07.174 --> 00:37:09.590
and this is what's different
between the developing world,

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.170
and I even think sort
of Walmart and 50 years

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:16.460
ago, that they must create
these conditions to create.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.690
That the foremost can condition
entrepreneurs must create

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.240
is to find and cultivate
whatever it takes

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.250
to induce this trust, right?

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.650
Because that's the currency
in which they're using,

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:31.070
and you clearly
pointed it out here.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.500
And obviously, you take
us across the landscape

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.690
where it's not just what
you saw, but you know the--

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.930
Adam Smith says trust
was the hidden engine

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.970
the economic progress
in Wealth of Nations.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.790
And you point that out to us,
and so this is in some ways

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.410
it's new, and it's not new.

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.910
But you're reminding
us of something

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:51.530
that is quite different
in the current landscape.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.350
Second is the trust induced
in institutional arrangements.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:56.360
You've talked
about some of this.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.160
I think the web of
interconnectedness

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.580
and the issues, the scope
and scale of the complexity

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.440
the problems that the
World Bank says, hey

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.550
and you gestured to this.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.029
How can you possibly
lay all this

00:38:08.029 --> 00:38:09.820
at the feet of the
individual entrepreneur?

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.610
Well, I've seen them in Africa.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.840
You have far more experience.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.730
My work has been there
across different parts

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:15.540
of the continent.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.760
The World Bank has
failed in their mission.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.790
It's very easy to be a purveyor
of doubt in your theory

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.800
and in your charge to
individual entrepreneurs,

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.200
but the bottom line is that
much of what they have done

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.147
has failed.

00:38:26.147 --> 00:38:27.730
And that the individual
entrepreneurs,

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.020
say look at a place like Kenya,
and Safaricom, and M Pace,

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.682
and Equitel, the mobile banking,
the fintechs are extraordinary.

00:38:35.682 --> 00:38:37.140
They've transformed
people's lives,

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.840
and this has been all through
entrepreneurial endeavor.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.576
Creating, as you say,
the conditions to create.

00:38:43.576 --> 00:38:46.220
Two quick last points,
and then some questions.

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.540
One of which is, which
you gesture to here,

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.680
but I want to make sure
that people understand

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.680
within the book, this
isn't just about a book

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.810
of individual entrepreneurs
in the agency, which

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.010
you point out.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.210
You do talk about states
as being entrepreneurial.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.410
And you gesture to it
one of your last points,

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:08.330
but when we think about Aadhaar
India, the unique idea that's

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:08.830
created.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.100
This new technology is
created and rolled out,

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.410
and they signed up
190 million users,

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.700
and they're hoping that
within a year or two,

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.180
they're going to have
600 million by 2014.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:24.410
Well, by January 2017 they
had 1.3 billion users,

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.484
or pardon me, 1.1
billion, 200 million short

00:39:27.484 --> 00:39:28.525
of the entire population.

00:39:28.525 --> 00:39:30.520
And it was run
through the state,

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.640
and so your capacity
to understand all this

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.240
without sort of using the
red Herring consistently

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.760
about state corruption
I think is important.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.532
So couple of questions for you.

00:39:41.532 --> 00:39:43.240
I do want to talk to
you as an historian,

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.700
but I want to ask you
first about one observation

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.830
in this book is that most
of the solutions, not all,

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:55.134
but most are actually low
tech at the end of the day.

00:39:55.134 --> 00:39:57.780
You talk about milk in
China, slightly different,

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.630
but milk in India,
low tech, right?

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.490
Women's co-ops.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.990
Dr. Shanti in NH hospital,
at the end of the day,

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.520
he's doing some pretty
fancy surgery, but some

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.850
of his solutions, daily average
accounting and the rest,

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:13.210
low tech.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.850
The microfinance.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.250
So what do you
make of this Tarun,

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:21.450
in terms of there is a very
much getting back to kind

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.060
of the current trope of
the moment of this kind

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.890
of new Savior mode around tech?

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:31.050
That tech is the silver bullet
to solve all the problems.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.570
Forget about the
ritual processes.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.100
Forget about the
humanist approach.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.310
Forget about frankly,
even some of-- all of this

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:38.601
that you're talking about that.

00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:42.990
That you can do all this
not necessarily trust

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.190
front and center,
but most importantly,

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.330
it's dismissive of these
low tech in a solution.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:52.430
So what are your
thoughts on that?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:58.790
Thanks, Cary, for the book,
for the overall comment.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.680
So one of the questions that I'd
put on an earlier slide which

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:07.800
I didn't use was to what
extent is a tech solution even

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.640
necessary or sufficient to
address a particular problem?

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.950
And my short answer is that
it's neither necessary nor

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.756
sufficient.

00:41:15.756 --> 00:41:18.460
And maybe to explain
that succinctly

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.360
I'd go back to microfinance.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:28.890
The same company where I'm
still the main board member

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.440
has become incredibly techie.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.650
In other words, we have all
sorts of biometric systems

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.830
that we use to identify people.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.970
We all sorts of
cashless delivery sort

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:40.830
of like you see in East Africa.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.110
In some cases, even
leapfrogging what's

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.670
going on in other
parts of the world.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:48.840
We have all sorts of algorithms
deciding the particular route

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.610
that the lending
officer takes when

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:55.430
he's going to visit 10 of those
groups in a particular day.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.490
We have algorithms that
do fraud detection to say,

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.950
how come you suddenly saw a
spike of cash sitting here,

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.030
and no cash over there?

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.090
That looks really odd.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:05.610
It's not what usually happens.

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.520
So there's an endless
array of things

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.912
that somebody we have within
the company has invented,

00:42:10.912 --> 00:42:13.370
or that I have thought of, or
somebody else has thought up,

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.030
and we've put into
it put into play.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.680
None of it would work
without the fabric of trust

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.820
that's sitting with those
women represented there.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.580
Who ultimately, are policing
their own immediate ambience.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.520
So what they do is they
make sure that nobody

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:35.290
in their circle is allowed if
they cannot get along with her,

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.220
right?

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.740
They cannot really look her
in the eye and trust her.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.650
Nothing about the
tech has altered that.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.380
No attempt to bypass
this structure

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.690
with a tech solution
directly has,

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:50.020
to the best of my
knowledge, really works.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.080
The only exception I can
think of in some countries

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.820
in the Western part of Latin
America are places where there

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:02.860
has been a migration of women
like this receiving loans

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:07.960
of let's call it $50-100 and
amassing a credit history with

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.920
the microfinance firms by doing
it year over year for four

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.170
or years.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.230
And then saying, even
though I have no collateral

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.510
to reassure you when
I want to borrow

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.564
say $1,000, at least I
have a history with you.

00:43:19.564 --> 00:43:20.980
I've borrowed five
times, and I've

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.220
repaid it, so allow me to
get away from this group,

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.340
and take bigger
individual loans.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.520
That's worked, but
there's no tax there.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:34.580
It's just building the social
capital to be able to do that.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:38.050
So I use that as a way
to illustrate the answer

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.390
that it's not that tech
doesn't have a role.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:44.680
In the dairy example that I
started my comments out with,

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.650
my friend Charles Chao,
who is a Chinese guy who

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:51.520
built a dairy company and
solved the contaminated milk

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.880
problem, at least in part,
using a very high tech

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.330
set of solutions.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:57.940
It's a viable
approach, and it worked

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.010
for him and it was successful.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:01.810
But then you have
examples in India

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.810
where you also have
non-contaminated milk that's

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:07.360
worked with a low
tech trust solution.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.300
So that's sort of been my view.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.280
There are some-- You know,
I'm actually currently working

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.225
with a very intriguing Peruvian
entrepreneur in Brazil.

00:44:19.225 --> 00:44:20.650
He lives in Brazil.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:24.760
Who wants to
digitize the genomes

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.634
of all species in the Amazon.

00:44:28.634 --> 00:44:29.772
That's pretty cool.

00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:30.980
That's why I'm working on it.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.850
It's cool.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.480
I know that was a really
very sophisticated response

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.275
to say, other than that
sounds pretty cool.

00:44:37.275 --> 00:44:39.150
No, it is pretty cool
because it turns out

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:44.300
to be something
like 0.1 0.2 percent

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.550
of known species in the Amazon
have their genome sequenced

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.520
so far.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.410
So what Juan Carlos
is saying is,

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.400
given the cost of sequencing
the genome, which actually

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.340
originated around
here in the Bay Area,

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.990
has fallen from
millions of dollars

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:06.540
to about the cheapest
right now is just $1,000.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.306
And it will probably go
down to 100 in a few years.

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:11.490
And now have now
mobile devices that are

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.110
starting to sequence genomes.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.950
Why don't we create a structure
and go and digitize everything.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.420
And the logic there
that he is thinking of

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.614
is a pure tech solution.

00:45:19.614 --> 00:45:21.780
He's saying that the
indigenous people of the Amazon

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.515
get ripped off every day
by global firms who go in

00:45:25.515 --> 00:45:27.600
and look for naturally
occurring substances

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.600
and active ingredients, make
drugs, make toothpaste, sell

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.320
it, but don't pay them anything.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.810
And there's no
mechanism that they

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.510
have to assert rights over
their patrimony in some way.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.410
So what he's saying is if
I digitize all the genomes,

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:44.310
right, and start writing these
so-called smart blockchain

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.840
contracts, so that
every time you

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.690
borrow a certain natural
ingredient because I know what

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.060
it is and each
natural ingredient has

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.489
a code type attached to it.

00:45:52.489 --> 00:45:54.780
I could actually write a
contract saying every time you

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.680
use this, you have to pay me.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.820
And suddenly the poor
people get something for it.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.200
And that, in turn, would
give them an incentive

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.600
to preserve the biodiversity
as opposed to slash

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.220
and burn and cultivate cocoa.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.460
So it would also
solve, since the Amazon

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.490
the lungs of the world, it would
also solve the global warming

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.800
problem.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.750
Literally, it would solve
the global warming problem.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.310
So I love that project.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.740
It's insane.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.530
It's a pure tech solution,
and it's not going to work.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:25.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.640
And the reason it's not going
to work is that it is so--

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.480
You know, the fabric
is so littered

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.197
with the carcasses of
past violations of trust

00:46:35.197 --> 00:46:36.030
that I just know it.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.100
So that's the argument with
Juan Carlos all the time.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.640
It's not going to work.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.430
I'm going to work on it with,
but it's not going to work.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.210
So we'll see.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.070
So there are people who are
working on pure tech solutions.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.870
And the fashion du jour these
days is just say blockchain.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.800
Wherever you go,
somebody says blockchain.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.550
That's the answer to everything.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.120
It's absolutely true.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.070
If you are an
historian and don't

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.490
know what you're talking about,
and you are in a business

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:56.698
meeting, just say blockchain.

00:46:56.698 --> 00:46:59.900
And everybody is like,
OK, she's on point.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.854
I learned that very early
on, blockchain, you know?

00:47:02.854 --> 00:47:03.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.492
So it's a fun project.

00:47:06.492 --> 00:47:07.710
No, it sounds amazing.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:08.210
And--

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.793
It won't work.

00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:11.117
Even if it doesn't work, it
still sounds pretty cool.

00:47:11.117 --> 00:47:12.950
I want to come back to
your point about tech

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.640
about being generally
necessary but not sufficient,

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.330
and move us from the
Amazon to Africa.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.180
And to think about--

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.650
because I think you gestured
to this in a way that

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:30.010
was immensely humble I thought.

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.640
And not entirely accurate
in some ways, right?

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.440
Because look, this
book spans multiple

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.690
continents and does
not touch upon Africa.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.180
At the same time, I was
today having a lunch meeting

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.665
with somebody who's starting
a series A fund for Africa,

00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:47.870
and there is actually, when you
look at it relative to funding

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.030
in the rest, India
and elsewhere, this

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.010
is a great space
to be in right now

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.900
if you're looking to invest.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.890
With a general understanding
of people in this landscape

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:00.170
that Africa's 15,
or 20 years behind

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.440
for the most part
on many things.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.250
For all kinds of reasons.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:05.880
I don't entirely
agree with that.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.580
I think Africa is
on the forefront.

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.760
And as we know on things like
mobile banking look, hands

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.720
down, no question.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.430
But nevertheless, there
is a lag in other areas.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:21.160
So I like to talk less about
the spectacular successes there

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.787
because we--

00:48:22.787 --> 00:48:24.370
and some of this is
selfish, everyone.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.210
We sit and chat about a lot
of this in different ways.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:31.039
What I want to talk about is
lessons that can be learned.

00:48:31.039 --> 00:48:32.580
Africa, in some
ways, is the last one

00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.482
of up the ladder
on some of this.

00:48:34.482 --> 00:48:36.190
Lesson's that can be
learned particularly

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.064
from some of the two or
three, as I see them,

00:48:38.064 --> 00:48:40.370
pretty big failures.

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:45.370
First of which is Airtel
getting into Africa, right?

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:47.710
Sunil Mittal, his approach
completely misunderstood

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.410
the lay of the land.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:52.380
My opinion, I think you
share that in some ways.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.090
Driving assumptions
about the assets

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.970
was this sort of idea of
price elasticity and demand

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.110
being very high.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.570
Basically, there was just
a misread of the consumer.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.650
And so that would
be the sort of one.

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:09.762
The second is even a
case from this book which

00:49:09.762 --> 00:49:12.220
I-- if you want one of the most
inspiring cases you'll ever

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.900
read, is about Narayana
Heart Hospital.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.610
It's just will blow you away.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.317
At the same time, it
triggered a while back,

00:49:18.317 --> 00:49:20.150
as we were talking about
the other day, sort

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:24.340
free telemedicine facilities,
and in over 50 African capital

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:31.050
cities and pretty
low takers on this.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.910
Just stunning when
you think about it.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:38.050
Particularly given the success
of telemedicine in India.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:42.610
And then thirdly, sort of
African, not necessarily about

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:47.860
Indians failing in Africa, which
were the first two, but how

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.670
microfinance just has
not scaled in Africa.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.100
So maybe we can touch upon
them in different ways.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:55.840
Perhaps on the
first two because it

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.456
does get to this larger question
about the degree to which we

00:49:59.456 --> 00:50:01.455
think across borders or
think across continents,

00:50:01.455 --> 00:50:07.070
do shared worldviews result
from shared histories?

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:10.170
And that there is this
larger issue of trust.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:14.340
And to what degree did they miss
the boat on this, in your view?

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.520
And in what other
ways equivalently,

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.250
can the lack of trust
from contested narratives

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:23.430
historically undermine
some of these enterprises?

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:27.140
And so when I think of
Airtel and NH Heart Hospital,

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.470
I think of missed
opportunity in leveraging

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.150
some of these shared pasts.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.972
And I'm curious if we can sort
of tie some of these strands

00:50:34.972 --> 00:50:36.680
together before you
open to the audience,

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.530
what are some of your
thoughts on that?

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:40.550
So let's just pick one of those.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.070
Let's pick the heart
hospital since that

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.530
is my all-time favorite case.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.356
So maybe I can say a
word or two about--

00:50:47.356 --> 00:50:48.980
Please do, because
it is extraordinary.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.340
- About the case.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.960
So one of the
chapters in the book

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.360
talks about somebody who is
a very close friend of mine.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.570
I've worked with him
for 15 years helping

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:03.710
him build what is today the
lowest cost tertiary care

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.360
facility in the
world in Bangalore.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:12.080
And to cut a long story
short, if a basic bypass heart

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.120
surgery in Boston costs
anywhere between--

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.770
Anybody have a number?

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.116
Bypass, what does
it cost in Boston?

00:51:21.116 --> 00:51:23.604
Shout out a number.

00:51:23.604 --> 00:51:24.104
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:24.104 --> 00:51:26.652
Half a-- No, wow.

00:51:26.652 --> 00:51:27.540
My god.

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.620
She's bankrupted
there faster than--

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.390
it costs anywhere
between $60,000

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.790
$160,000 depending
on which funny money

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:39.730
system you're using because
our accounting systems

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:40.520
all messed up too.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.510
But it's in the tens of
thousands of dollars.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.330
In Europe, it's probably
15, 20 thousand dollars

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:49.150
because of the socialized
medicine et cetera.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:56.660
So in this hospital, we're
able to do it for, today, $800.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.550
So we're talking $100,000
down to a $1,000.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:03.320
it's two orders of magnitude
less which is far, far, far,

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.580
far, far and away the lowest
cost heart surgery that you

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.700
could do anywhere.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.400
There is no compromise
in technology.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.520
It is actually more state
of the art than Mass General

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:16.470
because companies die to
have the latest technology

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:19.610
demonstrated in its place.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:22.750
The success rates are higher
than our local hospitals here,

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:23.890
the best places.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:27.840
So it's a hands down
amazing story of how the--

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:33.730
As it pertains to this
book, I use the example

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:37.060
to show how Davy, who's in
the name of the surgeon,

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.100
had to basically
create the conditions

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.660
to create, to make this
heart hospital happen.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.860
In other words, had to
essentially compensate

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:48.430
for the impossibility
of patients

00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:51.520
coming and finding
the heart hospital.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.440
Providing social
services to take

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.890
care of people
that weren't there,

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:58.830
and pioneering medical
insurance in India.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:01.840
Pioneer pioneering
satellite-based telemedicine

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.370
in India for the first time.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:04.564
It's not like he set out--

00:53:04.564 --> 00:53:05.980
I remember the
early conversations

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:07.300
when there was
nothing on the ground,

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.580
and we were sitting because
we had a common friend,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.310
and he said, Tarun, I want
to be insanely ambitious.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.100
We have to--

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.700
96 percent of the world
who have heart surgery

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.680
die, and that's not
morally acceptable,

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.430
so we've got to find
a way to do this.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.380
And we just started
with nothing.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.540
It's not like we start
up saying that we

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.081
are going to have
to do telemedicine,

00:53:27.081 --> 00:53:30.634
we have to do medical insurance,
but you hit the roadblock,

00:53:30.634 --> 00:53:33.300
and you realize that this is the
next thing that has to be done.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.799
It's that simple.

00:53:34.799 --> 00:53:36.590
This is the next thing
that has to be done.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.340
And you look at the
state, and you realize

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.110
the state is defunct at best.

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:43.300
So you end up finding
the solution to it,

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.900
and over time you
stitch it together.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.550
One of the--

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.280
What happened over time was
that a ton of African patients

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.880
started coming to the hospital.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.170
Those who could travel.

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.700
A ton of Iraqis from
the Iran-Iraq conflict,

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:00.184
not the Iran-Iraq, but
the conflict in Iraq.

00:54:00.184 --> 00:54:02.100
People from the Middle
East, different places,

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.960
began streaming
into the hospital.

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:08.780
So we had the idea, why don't
we just do free telemedicine?

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:12.830
We made an offer through the
Indian diplomatic services

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:15.309
saying in every capital city--

00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:16.850
How many African
countries are there?

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:17.140
54.

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.810
53.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.842
South Sudan's 54?

00:54:19.842 --> 00:54:22.330
So in all, it was
53 at the time,

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.990
all 53 African capitals
let's identify a hospital,

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:29.230
create a telemedicine
facility, pay for it,

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:31.440
and make it so that
anybody who wants

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.490
at least the beginnings of a
diagnosis can just walk in.

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:36.160
And at a particular
hour of the day,

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.920
we would staff it from
Bangalore through satellites

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.205
and provide the diagnoses.

00:54:41.205 --> 00:54:43.580
And of course, in many cases,
there's not much we can do,

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.100
but if it turns out that
there's a patient who

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.990
can make his or her
way to Bangalore,

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:49.400
then we can take care of them.

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.750
Cary was alluding to my--

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:56.750
still my shock that hardly two
of these facilities get used.

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.050
Nobody uses them.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:03.490
It just continues to be an
amazing puzzle in my mind.

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:06.670
I haven't had time to go
do something about it.

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.170
Yeah, and I mean, one of the
things we've been musing about,

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:11.540
and this is just sort of
us bantering around ideas,

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.600
is thinking about the
degrees to which--

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.620
And this gets back
to thinking about

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.220
how you're conceptualizing trust
within the entrepreneurial and

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:24.430
business landscape, but
for us to be thinking it

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:28.070
not just across space
but across time.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:33.010
And the degree to which this
sort of historically embedded

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:36.970
webs of trust between,
in this instance India

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:39.570
and not all parts of Africa,
predominately Eastern

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.470
and Southern, the degrees
to which, and this

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:46.160
would not be the
only case, right?

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.710
If we think about both other
organizations, companies

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:52.930
that have sought
to come to Africa

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.730
that have not been successful.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.820
Where they have
not leveraged what

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.554
are sort of shared worldviews.

00:56:00.554 --> 00:56:02.220
And obviously, we
know in some instances

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:03.270
they're fraught, right?

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.940
If you sort of think about
Uganda and elsewhere,

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.460
this is not true in
Kenya and Tanzania.

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:13.410
And in fact, the role of
the South Asian population

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.110
there has been an important
one in liberation struggles.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.950
It's the same thing
in South Africa.

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:20.490
And so it just strikes
me when thinking

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:23.775
about these sorts
of global networks

00:56:23.775 --> 00:56:29.340
that there is a degree to
which not all companies coming

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.590
from South Asia, and I'm
using this as an example,--

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:31.880
Sure.

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.750
--we can think about
Oman in the East Africa

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:35.700
where I think the Omanis
have been far more

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:40.070
effective at exploiting
historical ties in East Africa

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:43.650
where the largest
percentage of the Omani

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:46.710
foreign sovereign
wealth fund is invested,

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:48.710
and it's small relative
to other Gulf states,

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:50.760
is invested in
Tanzania where they

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.080
have these historical links.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.700
And so they figured this out.

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.200
So I guess I'm just
saying, I think

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.820
there's a lot of opportunity.

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.680
And not to sort of say
to flatten this too much,

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.270
but I say--

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:03.076
because obviously
there's equivalently sort

00:57:03.076 --> 00:57:05.200
of a lack of trust because
of contested narratives.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.810
But I think when we add
that historical layer,

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:08.560
I'm curious your thoughts
on the big picture?

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:08.690
No it's--

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:09.523
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:57:09.523 --> 00:57:12.960
It's extremely
interesting, and I

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.890
have to confess that despite
being a self-described history

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:20.940
buff just by reading
habits, I have

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.090
to confess that in both
the heart hospital story

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:26.820
and in the mobile phone
story, even though I

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.880
was an actor in
both those episodes,

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.220
it just never occurred to
me to leverage whatever

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.620
glimmers of knowledge I had.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:39.300
And I certainly had enough
to know what I didn't know.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.150
And to go out and find
someone like yourself,

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:46.710
as somebody who knows about
these sometimes shared

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:49.350
histories and sometimes
contested histories

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:54.090
to be able to both watch out
for misunderstandings that you

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:57.300
might inadvertently trigger,
which certainly happened

00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:03.570
in the mobile company
case, and perhaps

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:05.880
the shadows of those knowledge
bases would have helped

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.880
would have helped the
heart hospital figured out

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.086
a way to address this.

00:58:11.086 --> 00:58:14.000
So when I go home today, I'll
send a couple of emails like--

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.920
Trigger that particular one off.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.790
Well, yes and I think--

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:20.340
It's a fair point,
I think, yeah.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.440
Well look, you can only
cover so much territory

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:29.010
I think insofar as these lessons
in these emerging markets

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:31.200
are so incremental.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:35.430
And the ways in which the
individual entrepreneur

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:40.200
has to have multiple
agencies to create

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.150
these conditions to create.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:45.690
I think those who are
both observing and trying

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.944
to understand and the
rest when our toolkit has

00:58:47.944 --> 00:58:48.610
to be expansive.

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:49.510
And for some of us,--

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:52.110
I mean, that's where I think
he gets back to collaboration

00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:54.420
and maybe it's a nice moment
to open up a collaboration

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:59.650
amongst us as academics to
try to get at some of this

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.164
is, I think, hugely rewarding.

00:59:01.164 --> 00:59:02.580
Because I come at
this as somebody

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.280
who is a recovering investment
banker from 25 years ago,

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.990
but otherwise my entire
professional life

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:09.830
has been in academia.

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:11.520
Having conversations
with you who

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.590
has been so instrumental,
not just in academia,

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:17.336
but in the practitioner world,
but the overlay between this.

00:59:17.336 --> 00:59:18.960
Because especially,
when we get to sort

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.960
of these global flows of
capital and networks of trust,

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.460
they're immensely difficult to
unpack and understand, I think.

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:25.960
So--

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.450
That's great.

00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.940
Thank you.

--say history matters.

[LAUGHTER]

00:59:29.590 --> 00:59:30.090
Yeah.

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:31.546
It definitely does.

00:59:31.546 --> 00:59:36.028
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:36.028 --> 00:59:37.190
Tarun, thank you.

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:40.200
It's always a joy sitting
and chatting with you,

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.024
but I'd like to not
be selfish and open up

00:59:42.024 --> 00:59:43.190
the floor to some questions.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.296
Homi?

00:59:45.296 --> 00:59:47.640
So thank you both very much.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:50.700
It's very, very interesting.

00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:55.560
[INAUDIBLE] To the
extent to which,

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.476
as I understood it
from your talks,

00:59:58.476 --> 01:00:06.410
trust was focused around the
entrepreneurial activities

01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:12.020
of individuals or
entrepreneurial institutions.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:16.370
It seemed to me that it
was premised on a distrust

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:20.895
or mistrust of government.

01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:23.430
So I can see exactly
why that would

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:27.150
be the case in many places.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:32.170
But I'm interested in how
these activities actually

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:35.410
scale up to state
building, which

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:36.670
I think is very important.

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:39.510
Because you cannot--

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:42.130
The well-being of countries
cannot be left either

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:46.462
to entrepreneurs on the one
hand or NGOs on the other.

01:00:46.462 --> 01:00:47.920
Which is, of course,
the other side

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.850
of this entrepreneurial
activity,

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:52.330
a kind of Ngo activity.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:56.080
So in all these
situations, how does it

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:02.950
contribute to state-building,
to innovative notions

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:05.740
of citizenship,
of civil society?

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.240
All these are the
things on which

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.350
the stability of the nation
collectively will develop.

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:16.980
And of course, we do see some
public-private enterprises

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.980
in the cultural industries,
museums and so on.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.170
But I still think
that from the little

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:24.810
I know of Africa, a little
more I know of India,

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:27.780
not that much more,
state building

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.440
is what is really needed.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.100
This is the great
crisis of trust.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:37.030
The citizens not being
able to trust the state.

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.790
The police force being the
center of the lack of trust.

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:44.250
And you can, as an
entrepreneur with the best

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:49.200
will in the world, only
control so much of that.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.480
And then your set adrift
in the overwhelming--

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.020
--ocean

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:55.770
--ocean--

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:56.430
--mistrust

01:01:56.430 --> 01:02:01.950
--of mistrust, oligarchic,
nepotism, corruption,

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.470
you can only be
honest brokers so far.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:07.200
So really I wanted to
know about the connection

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.510
between these activities,
and I threw in the NGOs

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:16.790
as the other scale of them, the
other side, and long-term state

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:22.239
building, institutional building
practices, and good practices.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:33.260
So I think that's a very
legitimate and fair comment.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:38.370
It's not to say that the
illustrative stories that I

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.051
picked, not all of
which are successes,

01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:41.550
there's lots of
failures in the book

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:46.890
as well, it's not to say
that that's going to address

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:50.850
every or even most of
the problems, but I do

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.920
think I'm not--

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.800
Your comment sounded
despairing, and I'm

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.930
by nature a congenital optimist.

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:02.490
So let me go back to the heart
example for a second, right.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:05.220
So what's happening
increasingly is

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:10.350
that an entrepreneur
like that has built up

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:14.070
an enterprise that,
to my knowledge,

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:16.692
has never turned a single
patient ever, ever,

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:22.250
ever regardless
of ability to pay,

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:27.900
has acquired such
a high degree of--

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.110
is trusted so much that
he has the capacity now,

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:34.480
or his organization
has the capacity now

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.290
to begin to influence
state policies.

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:40.020
For instance, on
universal health,

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.760
on basic health insurance,
and things of that nature.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.820
Not that he's going to go and
be the state, but at least

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.420
his machinery is credible enough
that he can stare it down.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:56.050
So and it yet that occurs to
me that the government of India

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:59.680
in its infinite
wisdom finally decided

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.160
that it was going to put
a huge so-called luxury

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.290
tax on air conditioning.

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:09.140
Just some bright spark
and the government

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.810
said there should be a huge
luxury tax on air conditioning

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:14.132
because air conditioning
is used by wealthy people,

01:04:14.132 --> 01:04:16.340
and we don't have that many,
so we don't we just soak

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.140
the rich in some ways.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:22.180
Now this-- because so much of
a hospital is air conditioned,

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.160
it was going to
completely mess up

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.812
the economics of the HVAC
systems in the hospital.

01:04:29.812 --> 01:04:33.460
So this guy had to go and
lead all the hospital systems

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:38.097
to go and make a representation
to withdraw this tax agreement

01:04:38.097 --> 01:04:40.430
and had the credibility to
be able to do it and organize

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:42.790
sit-ins across the
country in a very

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:46.570
transparent and non-violent
manner that allowed a city

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:47.620
decision to be removed.

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:50.020
Now, that's not state
building, but it's contributing

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.490
to intelligent state policy.

01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:54.730
And my experience
Homi, in all this,

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.980
is that even for the
governments that I characterize

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.230
as generally corrupt, and
certainly the Andhra Pradesh

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:03.310
government has to be right
up there as witnessed

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:07.270
in the microfinance
crisis, most governments

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:10.150
are filled with ordinary
people trying to ordinary doing

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:13.210
things, and a perfectly decent.

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:16.630
So I conceptualize the problem
as once you have something

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:19.775
that's working, can you find
the right set of partners

01:05:19.775 --> 01:05:23.550
to help you to
take that to scale?

01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:25.130
That's how I think
about it anyway.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:29.300
Not that it's the not that
it's the solution, but I say,

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.100
it's a start.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.330
And oh by the way,
what's a better solution?

01:05:34.985 --> 01:05:35.695
That's fair.

01:05:35.695 --> 01:05:39.490
I'm just thinking about how
the state can structure.

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:42.040
No, it's a very good--

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.504
[INAUDIBLE] The fact is that
more [INAUDIBLE] government--

01:05:47.504 --> 01:05:48.004
Yeah.

01:05:48.004 --> 01:05:51.980
--bureaucrats [INAUDIBLE]
In my experiences in India,

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.968
you are absolutely right.

01:05:53.968 --> 01:05:56.453
Many of these
secretaries of ministries

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.441
are supremely [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:58.441 --> 01:05:59.435
Of course, yeah.

01:05:59.435 --> 01:06:01.423
Good, highly [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:01.423 --> 01:06:02.149
Yeah.

01:06:02.149 --> 01:06:04.232
Where they can, and I'm
sure that's true in Africa

01:06:04.232 --> 01:06:06.340
too, where they can exclude--

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.276
Yeah.

01:06:07.276 --> 01:06:12.895
--is the way they
are [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:12.895 --> 01:06:14.320
by the political elites.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.200
Or, just pointing
fingers at myself,

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.440
as I said in the
microfinance case,

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.420
I individually had the
capacity to do things

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:26.560
that I think would have
stopped that distress

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.190
with the benefit of hindsight.

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:33.020
Similarly, I think these
well-meaning nice bureaucrats,

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.180
I do believe in most
cases have the capacity

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.670
to do a lot more than they do.

01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:42.560
But they don't because we all
get lulled into complacency.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.720
That's just my feeling anyway.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.970
I just also want to--

01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:49.160
if it's OK, test
an idea too based

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.110
on the situation in Africa.

01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:53.010
And I just have a
couple observations.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:56.990
I think first, there
is, whether I'm

01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:00.120
in Nigeria, or Kenya,
or South Africa,

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.740
there is a discounting
for this already.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.910
Complete discounting.

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:09.920
And so, therefore, the
notion of a workaround

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.070
is just it's fully understood.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:16.760
As opposed to, I think, the
crisis of trust in states

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.890
is a very Western
phenomenon in terms

01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:23.480
of how it's impacting business
ways that at least, again,

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:28.130
my observation, is that take
an example Nigeria where yes

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:30.800
at the highest levels all
the things you described.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.050
But by and large,
a few things one,

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:37.160
most who say middle-level
civil servants

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.540
are as we describe
here, but yet they

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.800
have to keep their jobs from
government to government.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.258
And so, therefore, they're not
going to be risk-taking when

01:07:45.258 --> 01:07:47.259
deals come in that
they frankly don't--

01:07:47.259 --> 01:07:48.800
like say blockchain,
and you're going

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.890
to watch eyes roll back, right?

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:53.890
But in all seriousness, when
sort of these big PE guys

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:56.470
come in to do sort of
deals around telecom,

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:59.680
or major power plants, or
whatever the case may be,

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.840
they're incredibly complicated
in terms of the structure.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.390
There's no capacity within this.

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:07.450
So this sort of educating your
middle-level civil servant

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.360
to get them to the point
that you need them.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.270
So that you are creating
as the entrepreneur

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:16.359
the infrastructure of the
state is not created, right?

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.880
And so that's where
people's heads are at.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.580
As opposed to how we're
going to solve the government

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.310
problem of state governance
because it's completely off

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:27.100
the table, and not
entirely, but somewhat.

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.529
Just a final point
with that, there's

01:08:29.529 --> 01:08:32.970
the understanding, getting back
to Tarun's genius in this book,

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.649
of the value of trust
and the investment that

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:38.109
is made in social capital.

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:40.750
And so, therefore,
business days go

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:46.109
on for 14 hours, half
of which are spent

01:08:46.109 --> 01:08:48.450
socializing in somebody's home.

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:50.250
All the time.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:53.040
And so, therefore, this concept
of the creation this culture

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.262
of trust and social capital
in Western countries,

01:08:55.262 --> 01:08:56.970
particularly in the
US, is something that

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.790
has been eroding dramatically.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:00.990
And so I think--

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:02.939
What I think about
50 years from now

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:07.140
is sort of recreating what
Walmart replaced is actually

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.840
important because
these networks of trust

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.800
and the cultural conditions of
creating social capital are,

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.350
along with a crisis of
the state in the West,

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:18.779
are huge issues that
are simply not there

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.121
in places like Nigeria,
or India, or elsewhere.

01:09:21.121 --> 01:09:22.370
Anyway, I've gone on too long.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.115
I was just going to say in
response to Homi's comment,

01:09:31.115 --> 01:09:32.490
that it seems to
me that thinking

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:35.490
about the impact of
the colonial state

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:38.050
on eroding ideals of
trust in the state--

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:38.550
Yes.

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.660
--it's a good topic
for consideration.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.560
But I had a broader
question about what we

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.430
mean when we talk about trust.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:49.710
So I admire the way
that people in the more

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:52.529
quantitative social
sciences can actually

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:55.770
define their terms quite
nicely by pointing to numbers

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:58.680
among other things, and I know
that in a business context

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.690
you can really measure
trust because it's

01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:02.850
how willing are people to
invest in things, right?

01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:04.695
You can measure the effects
of trust, not trust.

01:10:04.695 --> 01:10:05.210
Yes.

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:05.709
Yes.

01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:07.450
That's great that
one can do that,

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:12.420
but my question is how
does that form of trust

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.780
correlate to other
kinds of trust?

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:21.240
And I just wanted to invite your
reflections on, for example,

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.610
these women obviously
have some sort of trust

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:25.110
amongst themselves.

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:28.500
So I'm just wondering how as
somebody working in the realm

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.760
that you work in you think
about what trust means

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.780
as measured by the tools
that you use in comparison

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:40.170
to the ways that we might think
about trust existing or not

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:42.870
existing, being built
or not being built,

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:46.450
in other kinds of realms of
life and human relations?

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.110
I mean actually, I
mean, my impression

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:53.730
is that, conceptually,
it doesn't

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.440
seem to be that distinct.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.280
I think that actually apropos of
the preamble to your question,

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.480
I think it's almost
impossible to measure trust.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.810
You can measure the effects
of it in different ways,

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:07.930
and even that would be a
contested measurement exercise.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.720
In fact, there are
social scientists,

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.511
I'm just thinking of
a couple of economists

01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:14.070
University of Chicago who
publish all these papers that

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.580
are technically very adept
and purport to measure

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.080
some consequence of trust.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.120
For instance,
comparing populations

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.940
from Northern Italy and Southern
Italy and saying this part

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.790
is less trusting and that part
is more trusting and so on.

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:30.200
At the end of the day, I
don't believe any of it

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.000
because a measurement exercise
is so riddled with assumptions.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.710
So that's the first
thing I would say

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:38.220
is that it's a non-trivial
exercise, and none of it

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.050
actually purports
to measure trust.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:43.230
In the same way that I think an
attempt to measure trust here

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:46.440
would be reduced to
some sort of, dare

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.680
I say it for fear of offending
some of my colleagues,

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.570
trivial survey type exercise.

01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:53.880
How many times have
you met so-and-so?

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.930
Do you really trust them?

01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:57.010
Would you share
your goat with them?

01:11:57.010 --> 01:12:00.380
Or whatever your proxy is
for some measure of trust.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:07.430
So I'm very skeptical about the
measurement exercise of trust.

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:09.600
I'm more sanguine
about the measurement

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.280
of the effects of
trust, and even that's

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.960
highly contested in my view.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.085
And I don't think there's
any conceptual difference

01:12:15.085 --> 01:12:16.980
between measuring
this kind of trust

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.730
and the corporate kind
of trust and so on.

01:12:22.406 --> 01:12:23.780
Apropos the previous
conversation

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.720
of trusting the
state and so on, I

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.790
do think that's where your,
and that's what [? Miah ?] was

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:31.810
saying also, the colonial
heritage and the distrust that

01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:35.390
has been left behind, that seems
like a fascinating topic that

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:38.330
just completely passed me
over when I was thinking

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:40.159
about this book in some ways.

01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:41.450
It's something to come back to.

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:42.070
That's the next book.

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.790
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:45.380
I also think I would add
to the degree to which I

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.870
think the quantitative
side is absolutely right.

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.470
But what has struck
me, and it is maybe

01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:54.350
because I really do come at
sort of-- even my engagements

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:56.480
with African businessmen
as the ethnographer,

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.360
and I sort of take copious
notes, and I go back,

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.622
and there's no science to this,
but the qualitative discussion

01:13:04.622 --> 01:13:06.830
on it for all them, whether
they call it trust or set

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:10.400
social capital, that's front
brain for every single one

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:10.900
of them.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.210
And I find the-- and I think
it's-- that there's all sorts

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:17.265
of things that I have sort
of spinning to my head,

01:13:17.265 --> 01:13:19.640
and then in our conversations
together sort of bring them

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:25.290
to the forefront, about the
role of this in facilitating

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:28.760
the creation of all sorts of
things to make people's lives

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.040
better that are
not state related.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.120
Because of the
inheritance of the past.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.610
And the degree that which
social capital really

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:38.360
still matters in these
areas of the world.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.590
And which it simply--

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:42.052
it does here but
in different ways.

01:13:42.052 --> 01:13:45.790
I was going to say in
different ways, and it's far--

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:47.090
it's just different, right?

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.756
And so again, something
to be explored.

01:13:53.736 --> 01:13:58.716
[INAUDIBLE] question/comments.

01:13:58.716 --> 01:14:01.200
I was wondering when you were
discussing-- because you were

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.030
discussing in a
very broad sense,

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:06.970
you're discussing bringing
the example of Facebook.

01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.860
I was wondering if you take
into account the fact that we're

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.900
privileged, race and ethnicity,
gender, that's something that's

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:14.830
very important.

01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:15.790
I don't think that--

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:17.915
well, maybe, like I said,
I haven't read your book,

01:14:17.915 --> 01:14:18.960
so I'm not sure.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.700
And the other thing is my
research has been largely

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:26.730
focused on context
where the social fabric

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:30.390
or social solidarity have been
either weakened or destroyed,

01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:33.450
and where it actually
fostered entrepreneurship

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:34.810
among young people.

01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:36.734
And we can take
the case of Brazil,

01:14:36.734 --> 01:14:38.726
the largest pool
of entrepreneurs

01:14:38.726 --> 01:14:41.714
are actually black women,
and they're largely

01:14:41.714 --> 01:14:44.702
excluded, socio,
economically, politically.

01:14:44.702 --> 01:14:47.690
And as the government
actually goes worse and worse

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:51.540
with Bolsanaro
almost being elected,

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.470
it has pushed more black
women to be entrepreneurs.

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:56.490
So it actually proves
that the missed

01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:59.072
the mistrust towards
the state has

01:14:59.072 --> 01:15:00.530
pushed for
entrepreneurship because

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:03.400
of the source of survival.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.220
So I actually found
the opposite to true.

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.620
So look at it as a section
of social solidarity,

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:15.305
entrepreneurship, and exclusion.

01:15:15.305 --> 01:15:18.299
And so I would you
to discuss that

01:15:18.299 --> 01:15:21.792
because you up some
examples, but I don't think--

01:15:21.792 --> 01:15:25.285
You brought up the
example Bolsa Familia,

01:15:25.285 --> 01:15:29.277
and I think that has
actually negative impact

01:15:29.277 --> 01:15:30.275
on entrepreneurship.

01:15:30.275 --> 01:15:34.060
And poor people are still
poor after many years.

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:34.580
Yeah.

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:35.900
I'm completely against it
So I'd like to have your--

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:36.610
Yeah, sure.

01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:39.085
No, I think it's
reasonable comment.

01:15:39.085 --> 01:15:41.600
Actually, the example of
Bolsa Familia in the book

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.060
is a negative example
exactly as you--

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.920
it's not a positive example.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.950
I'm comparing it with a
social program in India that

01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:52.340
has achieved much
more scale, and trying

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.920
to reflect in that chapter
on why Bolsa Familia had

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.960
some effect, but
certainly didn't

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.639
trigger entrepreneurship.

01:15:58.639 --> 01:16:00.930
Perhaps for the same reason
that you're thinking about.

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:02.310
So leave that aside.

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:05.410
I think your broader
point of sort

01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:10.569
of privilege and marginalization
in different senses

01:16:10.569 --> 01:16:12.610
comes through in a couple
of stories in the book,

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:16.724
but I have to admit is
not a central aspect

01:16:16.724 --> 01:16:17.890
of the stories in this book.

01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:19.265
Primarily, as I
said before, this

01:16:19.265 --> 01:16:21.650
is a taking stock exercise.

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:26.220
It's people that I happen
to be involved with.

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.580
But for sure, I mean
sometimes it's race.

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.200
In India, it would be caste.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.060
Certainly, gender issues
in different ways.

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:37.290
Different communities have
been discriminated against.

01:16:37.290 --> 01:16:40.710
All of that I think
meaningfully affects the extent

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:43.740
to which you can rely on
supporting structures to propel

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:45.110
yourself forward, right?

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:47.790
As a prosaic
example, you might be

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:51.750
part of a community that has
its own substitutes for missing

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:53.630
banking relationships,
but that's only

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:55.390
accessible to people
in their community,

01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:57.100
so that positions
you very differently.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.950
So I acknowledge
almost everything

01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:02.742
that you said sounds
correct to me.

01:17:02.742 --> 01:17:05.970
The one last thing
about the incidence

01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:08.520
of entrepreneurship
among black women

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.860
that you said, I'm not
aware of those statistics,

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.609
one thing I would say
is that there should

01:17:12.609 --> 01:17:14.827
be a distinction between--

01:17:14.827 --> 01:17:16.410
I don't know what
the right term would

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:19.719
be, a coerced entrepreneurship
in some ways, which is you

01:17:19.719 --> 01:17:21.510
don't get a job, and
there's nothing to do,

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:25.080
so you are forced into taking
some risk to fend for yourself.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.060
Versus the sorts
of stories that I'm

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.930
trying to go after here which
is, how do you go from things

01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:33.460
that are locally
successful, right,

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:38.220
which you might have been forced
into by distress in some ways

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.050
to creating impact at scale.

01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:41.610
So almost all the
stories in this

01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:44.322
are stories is not of individual
mom and pop entrepreneurs,

01:17:44.322 --> 01:17:45.780
they are stories
of people who have

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.440
started that way have
affected tens of millions

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.966
of people at least.

01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:53.340
And so it's a
really it's a story

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:58.440
of how to go from a localized
success to large-scale effect

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.450
on some social aspect.

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:02.197
On some aspect of society.

01:18:02.197 --> 01:18:03.780
That's where I think
you have to begin

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.700
to cultivate these, what
I'm trying to argue,

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:09.070
is the cultivation of trust
in addition to solving

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:10.070
your particular problem.

01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:20.330
I think it's--
other questions, no?

01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:23.100
So I think in some ways
it's a wonderful point

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.140
to end on terror
and in terms of sort

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:28.020
of bringing us full circle
about the ways in which it's

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.850
not just about
individual agency,

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:32.690
but how you
rightfully point out,

01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:36.720
the ringside seat to how this is
taken to scale and the effects

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.000
that these individuals
have ultimately

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.620
had on tens of millions.

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.150
And I think one of
the final points

01:18:43.150 --> 01:18:45.330
I'd like to make is the
degree to which I am struck

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:48.610
by your book and your own
work of how on the one hand,

01:18:48.610 --> 01:18:50.100
you have an eye
of somebody who is

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.730
the entrepreneur
and the businessman,

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:54.330
but who is driven by the
question about poverty

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.800
alleviation and making
people's lives better.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.860
And I think that's
the other point that

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.670
underscores each and every
case study in this book,

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.280
and each and every company
with what you've been working.

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.440
So I think on that
score it's academic,

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.370
it's practitioner, and somebody
who really seems to me,

01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:13.290
gets out of bed in the
morning with the idea

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.246
of how can we think
about business in ways

01:19:15.246 --> 01:19:17.230
that can make
people's lives better

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:18.870
in the most genuine sense.

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:21.690
And so I ask everybody
to applaud Tarun,

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.310
this incredible contribution.

01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.610
Thank you very much.

01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:24.110
Thank you.

01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:27.260
[APPLAUSE]
