00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.830
guess are we try to use the landscape
use the building and use the interior

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840
use the building and use the interior
 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.319
use the building and use the interior
seamlessly and maybe we're exploring

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
seamlessly and maybe we're exploring

man it was a fantasy and an experiment
that really didn't work so then we saw

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
that really didn't work so then we saw
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.609
that really didn't work so then we saw
after that whole kind of modernist thing

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
after that whole kind of modernist thing
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.109
after that whole kind of modernist thing
and you see a low-cost housing which

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
and you see a low-cost housing which
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270
and you see a low-cost housing which
ganged on to the idea of utopia which it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
ganged on to the idea of utopia which it
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649
ganged on to the idea of utopia which it
really wasn't in fact there's a place

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
really wasn't in fact there's a place
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.990
really wasn't in fact there's a place
called the utopia parkway which is kind

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
called the utopia parkway which is kind
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390
called the utopia parkway which is kind
of hilarious but so all these towers and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
of hilarious but so all these towers and
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.710
of hilarious but so all these towers and
all these core boozy and Marseille

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
all these core boozy and Marseille
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.990
all these core boozy and Marseille
blocks were built with the hope of being

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
blocks were built with the hope of being
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690
blocks were built with the hope of being
utopia but without the master doing it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
utopia but without the master doing it
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.499
utopia but without the master doing it
himself it's hard to assimilate utopia

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
himself it's hard to assimilate utopia
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.740
himself it's hard to assimilate utopia
and it was also a kind of fantasy so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
and it was also a kind of fantasy so
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719
and it was also a kind of fantasy so
after that movement we moved into a kind

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
after that movement we moved into a kind
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940
after that movement we moved into a kind
of historicism in a post modernism in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
of historicism in a post modernism in
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.459
of historicism in a post modernism in
which everybody was grabbing on to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
which everybody was grabbing on to
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.139
which everybody was grabbing on to
something from the past because they

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
something from the past because they
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.690
something from the past because they
felt as though their future had failed

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
felt as though their future had failed
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.320
felt as though their future had failed
them so then we got past that and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
them so then we got past that and
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.390
them so then we got past that and
modernism BK Dan isn't it became a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
modernism BK Dan isn't it became a
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.860
modernism BK Dan isn't it became a
revivalism so now

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
revivalism so now
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.649
revivalism so now
we're kind of in that modernist

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659
we're kind of in that modernist
 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.380
we're kind of in that modernist
revivalism and then there's this whole

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390
revivalism and then there's this whole
 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.300
revivalism and then there's this whole
group of the orthogonal and the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
group of the orthogonal and the
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.970
group of the orthogonal and the
rationalist and then there's the flying

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
rationalist and then there's the flying
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.339
rationalist and then there's the flying
shrapnel and the irrational and you have

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349
shrapnel and the irrational and you have
 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.009
shrapnel and the irrational and you have
those two things going on but but Peter

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019
those two things going on but but Peter
 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.899
those two things going on but but Peter
and I have tried to do is find a way to

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909
and I have tried to do is find a way to
 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.270
and I have tried to do is find a way to
link those things together through a

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280
link those things together through a
 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.280
link those things together through a
string in our worth not turn our back on

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290
string in our worth not turn our back on
 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.699
string in our worth not turn our back on
the past but not give up on the future

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
the past but not give up on the future
 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.930
the past but not give up on the future
either and how we could work in context

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
either and how we could work in context
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.509
either and how we could work in context
in a non-literal way in a somewhat

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519
in a non-literal way in a somewhat
 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.599
in a non-literal way in a somewhat
abstract way to bring the past and the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609
abstract way to bring the past and the
 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.550
abstract way to bring the past and the
present in a kind of synthesis and I

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
present in a kind of synthesis and I
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.130
present in a kind of synthesis and I
think that's navigating that line is

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140
think that's navigating that line is
 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.950
think that's navigating that line is
very interesting
