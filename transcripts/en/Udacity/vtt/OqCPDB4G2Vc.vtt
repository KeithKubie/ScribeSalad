00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.810
The answer is 52.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.090
Referring back to
the order of operations,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.640
we should perform operations
inside parentheses first.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.180
This expression doesn't
have any parentheses so

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.180
we can move on to simplifying exponents.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.661
Our exponent here is 6 squared,
which is 36.

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:24.774
Our new expression then becomes
20 divided by 5 times 4 plus 36.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:29.470
Next, we should multiply and
divide from left to right.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.308
So that means dividing
20 by 5 which is 4.

00:00:33.308 --> 00:00:40.964
Again, let's rewrite our expression
which now is 4 x 4 + 36.

00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:44.110
We're still working on multiplication
and division from left to right.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.040
So, next we multiply 4 by 4 to get 16.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.840
Now, our expression is 16
+ 36 which gives us 52.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.870
Don't worry if you didn't
get this right away,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.270
there are a lot of rules to remember.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.850
The good news is that with
just a little bit of practice,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.010
the order of operations
starts to feel automatic.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.739
Let's try another.
