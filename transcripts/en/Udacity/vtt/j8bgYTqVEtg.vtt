00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.300
Mm, Gradle, mm, Gradle.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.985
&gt;&gt; Jeremy, Jeremy.

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:05.766
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Hey, Mark.

00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.240
What's up?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought you were supposed
to release your Android app today.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.230
What's all of this?

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.870
&gt;&gt; Oh, I've just got to use Android's
Studio wizard to generate my signed APK

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.160
today, so
I'm just doing my wizard ritual.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.400
I hope it all works right.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.780
&gt;&gt; A wizard?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you never really know what
those build wizards are doing, right?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.460
So, you just gotta hope
nothing goes wrong.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.090
&gt;&gt; You know a wizard
isn't actually magic.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.730
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah?
Well,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.865
how does it generate its magical keys
and magically spit out a signed APK?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.040
&gt;&gt; There's nothing magic about it.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.320
Android Studio can't do anything that
you can't do from the command line.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.370
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah?

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.368
Yeah.
Android Studio,

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:41.980
all it was doing is telling
Gradle to run some tasks.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.620
And those tasks are just using
regular command line utilities.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.180
&gt;&gt; So, it's not magic?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.230
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.030
&gt;&gt; And I don't have to wear
this robe to get it to work?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.245
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank god, this is so hot.

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:54.072
[SOUND] Help me get this thing off.

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:57.590
Oh, I never should have trusted that
centaur I met in the mystical forest.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.360
I shouldn't have paid him 50 gold
pieces for programming advice.
