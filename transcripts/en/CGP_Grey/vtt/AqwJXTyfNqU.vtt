Hello internet!

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.340
I spent the last week working on a video

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.020
about some of my thoughts on the future of education

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.320
and I'm not convinced I did a great job explaining myself

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.460
so I wanted to share with you

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.380
some excellent talks

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.920
that go both more broadly and more deeply

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.320
into the kinds of developments in the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.460
world of education that interests me

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.400
I don't agree with everything in all of these videos

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.780
but I think they all point in the same direction

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.500
towards a more interesting future

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.060
so click the link to get started

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.580
and watch some excellent speakers

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.740
and let me know what you think at the end...
