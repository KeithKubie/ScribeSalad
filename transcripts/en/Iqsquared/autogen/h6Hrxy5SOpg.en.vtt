01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:46.540
question is for Cheryl about teaching
 

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.570
question is for Cheryl about teaching
kids resilience I think sometimes as a

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:48.580
kids resilience I think sometimes as a
 

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.520
kids resilience I think sometimes as a
parent you have a desire to protect your

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:50.530
parent you have a desire to protect your
 

01:11:50.530 --> 01:11:53.130
parent you have a desire to protect your
kids and shield them from heartache but

01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:53.140
kids and shield them from heartache but
 

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.870
kids and shield them from heartache but
you also I think as a parent have a

01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880
you also I think as a parent have a
 

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.760
you also I think as a parent have a
responsibility to teach them to be

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:56.770
responsibility to teach them to be
 

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.560
responsibility to teach them to be
resilient so how do you find that

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:58.570
resilient so how do you find that
 

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:02.280
resilient so how do you find that
balance and yeah if you have any advice

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:02.290
balance and yeah if you have any advice
 

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:03.390
balance and yeah if you have any advice
for that we've studied this extensively

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400
for that we've studied this extensively
 

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.160
for that we've studied this extensively
and I let Adam answer this question

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:05.170
and I let Adam answer this question
 

01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:06.270
and I let Adam answer this question
we've probably wrote a chapter about

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280
we've probably wrote a chapter about
 

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.450
we've probably wrote a chapter about
this in our book there's a great book by

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:09.460
this in our book there's a great book by
 

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.400
this in our book there's a great book by

raise an adult which is all about this
 

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.450
raise an adult which is all about this

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.550
and it says the first thing you have to
do is normalize struggle you cannot

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560
do is normalize struggle you cannot
 

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.530

protect your children from all struggle

01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:19.540
protect your children from all struggle
 

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.450

right they will have challenges whether

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:21.460
right they will have challenges whether
 

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.970
right they will have challenges whether
they fail an exam or they you know don't

01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:23.980
they fail an exam or they you know don't
 

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.940

make the football team or you know they

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:26.950
make the football team or you know they
 

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:28.530
make the football team or you know they
forget their lines in the school play

01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:28.540
forget their lines in the school play
 

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.330
forget their lines in the school play
and I think that you have to show them

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:30.340
and I think that you have to show them
 

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.220
and I think that you have to show them
that that is okay right that's normal

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:32.230
that that is okay right that's normal
 

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:33.390
that that is okay right that's normal
that happens to you and that means

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400
that happens to you and that means
 

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.210
that happens to you and that means
letting them see you struggle too the

01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:36.220
letting them see you struggle too the
 

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.350
letting them see you struggle too the
other thing we found from the research

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360
other thing we found from the research
 

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.300

01:14:21.469 --> 01:14:23.290
to scale the company and how to have a
business model so when I first showed up

01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:23.300
business model so when I first showed up

connecting people and helping them share

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640
connecting people and helping them share
 

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.610
connecting people and helping them share
but we weren't so good at making the

01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:30.620
but we weren't so good at making the
 

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.380
but we weren't so good at making the
money that would pay to connect people

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:32.390
money that would pay to connect people
 

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:35.200
money that would pay to connect people
and help them share and it turns out

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:35.210
and help them share and it turns out
 

01:14:35.210 --> 01:14:36.310
and help them share and it turns out
