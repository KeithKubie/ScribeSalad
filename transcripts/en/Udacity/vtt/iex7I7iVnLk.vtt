Now that we know stress refers to our perceived ability to meet the demands of

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:07.041
a given situation, and we know how our body responds to stress, how is it that

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:13.450
we handle stress? Well, psychologists call our ability to handle or deal with

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.785
stress, coping. Now as it turns out, there are two distinct coping strategies.

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:23.211
The first focuses on changing a situation or solving a problem. The second

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:27.046
focuses on changing one's emotional response, or regulating your emotional

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:32.472
response to a stressful situation. The first is called problem-focused coping,

00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:37.112
and the second is called emotion-focused coping. Let's talk about examples of

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:40.466
each of these. Now, I want you to think carefully about these two ways to cope

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.679
with stress, because I really think they can help us in our day to day lives we

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:49.613
encounter stress. So, let's look at two stress provoking situations. The first,

00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:53.510
untied shoes. The second, the tides of the ocean.
