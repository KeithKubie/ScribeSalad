00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.620
In the last video we covered quite
a few acronyms describing many of

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.285
the different protocols out there for
implementing web APIs.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.320
In this video, let's do some
side-by-side comparisons in order to

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.000
determine which technology is best for
what we want to accomplish.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.740
SOAP and

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.520
REST have both been proven as two viable
options for implementing a web service.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.620
Soap was originally developed
by Microsoft in 1998.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.280
For SOAP we are obliged to use XML for
our data structures, but

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.940
can choose HTTP or another underlying
application-level protocol.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.720
REST was more of a description
than a development project.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.510
The acronym first appeared in
a dissertation by Roy Thomas Fielding in

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.960
the year 2000.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.370
REST uses the HTTP verbs in order to
access and manipulate resources, but

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.530
can use any type of messaging protocol
to structure the data it sends.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.940
In order for
an application to be truly restful,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.170
it must adhere to a set of constraints
Fielding defined in his dissertation.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.200
So it seems we still have two good
options, but let's take a look at

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.059
the popularity of the two
implementation options over the years.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.040
&gt;From this data gathered by
programmableweb, we see that

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.750
REST has gained an outstanding
popularity over the past decade.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.660
A major reason for

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.150
this is because REST is generally
easier to implement than SOAP.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.710
And for web developers, working with
HTTP is already a familiar practice.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.970
For these reasons, this course will
focus on designing RESTful web APIs.
