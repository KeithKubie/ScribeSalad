00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.580
So i mean here's an example of
just showing a binary image.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.690
Okay, where you've got a circuit with
some leads that are connecting it and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.640
some of those leads have shown up well
and some of them show not so well.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.650
Or maybe some of these things are noise
and you want to get rid of them, and

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.350
here of course this is a notional
version of a binary image where you've

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.030
got ones and zeros.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.240
So binary image analysis is
used in all sorts of things.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.280
We're just showing you sort of document
inspection, but parts inspection.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.060
So you've got a part and it's supposed
to have particular property to it and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.670
you don't want to make sure there
are any holes that shouldn't be there or

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.430
the holes that are supposed to be there,
are there.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.890
Mostly for two dimensional stuff,
also manufacturing.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.870
You have some idea of what the images
are supposed to look like, but

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.490
it's basically, where is there stuff and
where is there not stuff,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.210
is what matters.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.310
And so
you can think of those as binary images.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.780
And of course, document processing,
where the where basically,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.250
if you think of it as just black
ink on a white background,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.170
it might be very fine, but there's,
there's not really supposed to be grey.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.810
Now those of you that
know about anti-aliasing,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.590
that has to do with limited resolution.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.650
We're not going to talk about that.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.480
We're just going to talk
about sort of binary images.
