00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.780
 All kinds of interactions are present in the biological systems 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.440
 Accompanied by adequate amounts of energy 

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:08.560
 But these interactions are not fast enough 

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:10.596
 Or even occur automatically 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.680
 Glucose is a good example 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.680
 We will address them in some detail 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.210
 In the binary video interactions 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.366
 Which we have already called 

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.980
 6. Phosphate phosphate 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.560
 But this interaction is very important 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 When adding a phosphate group to the glucose fraction 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.040
 The glucose portion is a basic input 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.680
 For a whole series of vital reactions 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.480
 The phosphate group gives the glucose and samma fraction 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.160
 It makes it very difficult for the glucose molecule to come out of the cell again 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.520
 This is done with a fairly clear mechanism 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.080
 We have a free pair of electrons 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.839
 On the hydroxyl group here 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.859
 If this pair has a correct formation, it tends to 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.555
 Composition of association with phosphorus atom 

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:52.898
 In the phosphate group 

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:54.748
 Now, what does not make this interaction happen automatically 

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:56.311
 Although it is more energy-efficient 

00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.234
 Once it is bonded, the 

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:01.519
 Electrons move to a lower energy level 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.056
 In other words, Delta G is a negative energy 

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:07.993
 If these particles are pre-interacting, 

00:01:07.993 --> 00:01:10.507
 This is the amount of free energy available before the interaction 

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.718
 After the reaction, the molecules have less free energy 

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.499
 And you can release some energy 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.028
 Which we would like to take into account 

00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:20.588
 To be automatic, but in order for interaction to occur, 

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:23.629
 We need a little extra energy to be supplied in the equation 

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:25.579
 Which we call "energy activation" 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.553
 You may wonder: why this? 

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.622
 Well, we have a pair of electrons wishing to form a bond 

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.813
 With this phosphorus atom 

00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:33.437
 But the phosphorus atom is surrounded by negative charges 

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:36.432
 The oxygen atom present here has a negative charge 

00:01:36.432 --> 00:01:39.903
 The oxygen atom present here has a negative charge 

00:01:39.903 --> 00:01:41.760
 As you know, the electrons do not like 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.296
 To be surrounded by similar electrons - because similar charges are repulsive - 

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:47.932
 So for this interaction to take place, 

00:01:47.932 --> 00:01:50.555
 Or to be repeated 

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.553
 It must be stimulated 

00:01:52.553 --> 00:01:55.841
 A catalytic agent is any substance that makes interaction happen faster 

00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:58.940
 Or even allow interaction to occur from the ground up 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.936
 If we talk about the catalysts in the biological equations 

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:03.835
 We are necessarily talking about 

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:06.832
 We are talking about enzymes 

00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:08.271
 Enzymes 

00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:11.882
 And how the enzyme stimulates this interaction 

00:02:11.882 --> 00:02:13.147
 We are already talking about them 

00:02:13.147 --> 00:02:16.021
 Also when explaining dual binary interactions 

00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:18.790
 The enzyme may give some positive charges 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.027
 May give some positive charges 

00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:25.426
 Around these negative charges to pull them away from each other 

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.975
 To provide space or space 

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.935
 So that the interaction continues to occur 

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.498
 This is what the enzyme does 

00:02:32.498 --> 00:02:34.896
 This curve changes - rather than being so rigid - 

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:37.182
 The curve becomes like this 

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:41.258
 Making the interaction continue to occur 

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:42.940
 But what are these enzymes? 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.332
 These are the materials they can 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.380
 It can make some important shipments 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.220
 Which allows interaction to occur specifically 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.920
 It can change the formation of molecules in a certain way 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.830
 To reveal some links 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.400
 It can be more acidic or base 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.420
 Which is best to complete the interaction 

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.546
 What are these materials that seem to have magic effect? 

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.008
 Well, from a higher perspective, enzymes are often 

00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:11.018
 Complex proteins - some other substances may increase or not - 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.540
 So we can consider them proteins 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.540
 Sometimes, they are multiple polypeptide chains 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.300
 United together, may also be associated with some 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.917
 Ions and other minerals, but overall, 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.820
 Enzymes proteins, either molecules 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.254
 Which will react 

00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:29.729
 And combine with proteins, 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.127
 We call it "pillars or reactive materials" 

00:03:32.127 --> 00:03:35.134
 So these substances have this reaction, (words incomprehensible) glucose 

00:03:35.134 --> 00:03:39.635
 And adenosine triphosphate (ATP), together form the substrates 

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:42.260
 You have to learn 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.392
 That enzyme does it 

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:44.997
 The general term of enzymes 

00:03:44.997 --> 00:03:49.462
 Which works on the sugar fraction phosphorylation like this 

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.294
 We call it "hexoxinase" 

00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:53.589
 We will express this strange painting 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.620
 This strange protein, we will touch 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.598
 To him moments later 

00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:02.030
 Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.181
 Here exactly 

00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:05.596
 Adenophenyl triphosphate (ATP) is one of the pillars 

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:08.772
 The glucose part is then linked 

00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:10.351
 Here exactly 

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:12.947
 These two interactive articles combine 

00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:15.071
 While the area where all this occurs 

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.191
 Call it "Active Location" 

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.854
 Active site is where the interaction takes place, 

00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:22.933
 Active site 

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:25.829
 Often where reactants are linked 

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:28.314
 RFID with protein 

00:04:28.314 --> 00:04:30.591
 To make cohesion stronger 

00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:32.192
 So that they become more 

00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:34.142
 More 

00:04:34.142 --> 00:04:37.226
 More appropriate to complete the interaction 

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:40.233
 The protein completely bent a slight bow 

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:42.632
 To approximate both molecules more spatially 

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:44.892
 What we call "motivational proportionality" 

00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:48.537
 Proportion of catalyst 

00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:51.165
 But what is the origin of these positive charges? 

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.661
 Well, materials may be like side chains 

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:57.094
 For example, different amino acids 

00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:00.101
 In the polypeptide chain in the protein 

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.180
 Some ions may be entered into the reaction 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.859
 In fact, 

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:06.078
 To facilitate glucose diffusion, 

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:08.688
 A magnesium atom is needed 

00:05:08.688 --> 00:05:10.463
 To withdraw some positive charges away 

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:12.940
 But there are other positive groups 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.533
 It can pull the cargo away from it 

00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:18.424
 Opportunities for completion of interaction 

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:21.122
 So the enzymes tend 

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:23.691
 To operate at maximum efficiency in specific hydrogen-specific environments 

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:25.096
 Or specific temperatures 

00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:28.165
 In general, the higher the temperature, the greater the number of interactions 

00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:29.307
 Where the movement of materials and molecules increases more and more 

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:31.559
 But if the temperature increases even slightly, 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:33.688
 The protein or enzyme stops completely from its function 

00:05:33.688 --> 00:05:34.679
 Because of its changing nature 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:39.118
 Or because it lost its spatial structure 

00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:41.188
 The most I would like to draw your attention to is 

00:05:41.188 --> 00:05:44.485
 How to meet the beauty and complexity of these compounds at the same time 

00:05:44.485 --> 00:05:45.922
 Consider the splendor of what I offer you 

00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:47.134
 This exists in all your body cells! 

00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:49.570
 This is found in 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.413
 Hoping in your hands, hoping 

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:53.925
 Everything is being around you, there are lots of 

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:56.386
 These things are going on inside your body, I hope that 

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:58.341
 Gives you an estimate of that configuration 

00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:00.558
 Within you as a living being, as well 

00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:02.024
 All living things (Hallelujah!) 

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:04.474
 We have a visual embodiment here 

00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:07.469
 For hexoxinase, as an example 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.160
 Let's take a bigger idea, 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.480
 This is part of glucose 

00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:14.120
 , This is the adenosine triphosphate here 

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.927
 The two are united together, these two articles 

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:19.226
 And unite at the active location 

00:06:19.226 --> 00:06:22.349
 There may be a stimulating fit zone, where this is about 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:23.619
 Some shipments are pulled away 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:25.999
 May degrade molecules in some way 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.865
 So as to increase the chances of interaction 

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:30.526
 Bring these materials closer together and more 

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:31.994
 Stimulate completion of interaction 

00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:33.596
 Once the interaction is complete, 

00:06:33.596 --> 00:06:36.523
 The bond between the enzyme and the reactants will cease immediately. 

00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:38.652
 I find it better to release the name of the resulting material, at this stage 

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:40.134
 Here, each composite is separated from the other 

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:41.625
 Here is a change in the enzyme 

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:43.161
 This is a characteristic of enzymes in general 

00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:45.495
 Its functionality is not limited to one use and then crumbles 

00:06:45.495 --> 00:06:48.389
 Where he can repeat his job over and over again 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.411
 One enzyme can do the job many times 

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:54.082
 During his or her lifetime 

00:06:54.082 --> 00:06:55.599
 Now I would like to present to you a stereotype 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.502
 Small three-dimensional - I got it from a website - 

00:06:58.502 --> 00:07:00.468
 Let's show it now 

00:07:00.468 --> 00:07:01.610
 I will stop my private recording here 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.485
 So I can show this simple simulation model 

00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:07.962
 In fact this is a model of hexoxinase enzyme 

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:09.372
 Hexokinaz generally 

00:07:09.372 --> 00:07:11.670
 Available in various forms 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.091
 But this model is superb and completely crossing 

00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:15.157
 It was realized from a different perspective 

00:07:15.157 --> 00:07:17.249
 If you search for photos of proteins online 

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:18.901
 Or anywhere else, you often see 

00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:20.368
 On the model of the stick and ball model 

00:07:20.368 --> 00:07:22.880
 And other times you find it in the form of a vacuum model 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.603
 Sometimes you find it in the form of this type 

00:07:24.603 --> 00:07:26.025
 Where ... This construction ... 

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:28.892
 Note here are alpha-type loops 

00:07:28.892 --> 00:07:31.306
 Which we studied when we talked about the structural structure of protein 

00:07:31.306 --> 00:07:33.175
 Here too you can see some chips of beta type 

00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:34.928
 This gives you a better perception of 

00:07:34.928 --> 00:07:37.691
 Where links are formed and how materials interact with each other 

00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:38.681
 For example, 

00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:40.996
 This is a part of the adenosine triphosphate 

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:43.067
 And who is next to him here - I think 

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:45.806
 If you look from a true perspective - this is a glucose part 

00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:48.352
 Notice the bond between them here 

00:07:48.352 --> 00:07:49.632
 They represent interactive materials 

00:07:49.632 --> 00:07:52.023
 There is an association between them at active impacts 

00:07:52.023 --> 00:07:54.370
 They can interact with each other now 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.441
 The enzyme - in our case here is hexoxinase- 

00:07:57.441 --> 00:08:00.065
 Facilitates the interaction we want to happen 

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:02.298
 Glucose phosphorylation 

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:05.236
 So I hope you give pictures like these or those 

00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:07.330
 A vision of how beautiful and complex 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.099
 These materials are of course their nature.
