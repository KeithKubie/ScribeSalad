JENNY MURPHY: Hi everyone.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.620
Welcome to this week's session
of the Google+

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.130
Platform Office Hours.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.710
This week we're going to be
talking about the new release

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.770
of the Hangouts APIs,
version--

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.740
which number?

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.782
WILL THOMPSON and
JOHN BERRY: 1.1.

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.570
JENNY MURPHY: 1.1 It adds a lot
of cool new functionality.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.010
And we have some engineers
from the team joining us.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.730
And a bunch of people from the
community, so we should have a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.890
nice, fun discussion.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.640
So before we dive into stuff,
let's tell you a little bit

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.780
about ourselves.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.930
I'm Jenny Murphy.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.510
I'm a developer programs
engineer here at Google.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.870
I focus mostly on
the [? reft ?]

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.998
APIs and the social plug-ins,
like the +1 Button.

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:46.880
But I like hacking Hangout apps
when I have the time.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.580
And I'm joined here today by--

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.900
MARTIN: Hi, I'm Martin.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.820
I'm a software engineering
intern at Google.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.216
And I'm working on a Google+
3 [? project. ?]

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:56.070
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.480
And, if you remember, he's
actually been on the other end

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.790
of these Hangouts
pretty often.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.760
So it's great to have
you in person.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.610
JOHN BERRY: And hi, yes
everybody, I'm John Berry.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.810
I'm the develop advocate for
Google+ working on Hangouts.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.510
WILL THOMPSON: I'm
Will Thompson.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.231
I'm a developer programs
engineer on Hangouts.

00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:18.670
JENNY MURPHY: And then joining
us over the Hangout from left

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.815
to right, from my view,
we have Alan.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.485
ALAN FURTZENBURG: Hi there,
I'm Alan Furtzenburg.

00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:25.630
I'm an outside developer.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.190
I mostly develop Hangout apps.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.180
I'm most known for my caption
app, and the app appearing in

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.535
my upper left hand corner is
the My Time Hangout app.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.686
JENNY MURPHY: Now say
hi to Gerwin.

00:01:40.686 --> 00:01:43.480
GERWIN STURM: Yeah hi, I'm
Gerwin from Austria.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.720
I do lots of stuff with the
Google APIs for fun, actually.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.717
So probably my most well-known
Hangout app is the Comment

00:01:49.717 --> 00:01:53.710
Tracker, but I'm doing lots of
different stuff with WebGL.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.830
And I just tried the face
tracking thing, and just

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.380
playing around really.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.835
JENNY MURPHY: Cool, we're
actually using the Comment

00:01:59.835 --> 00:02:01.260
Tracker today, so.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.130
JD?

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.150
JD SALAZAR: Hey, I'm JD Salazar,
and I'm a developer

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.400
on the Hangouts API team.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.185
JENNY MURPHY: Next, Moritz.

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:16.810
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Hi, I'm Moritz
from Germany, and I'm

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.810
also playing around with
the Hangouts API a lot.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.110
And I think I'm most common for
my two apps, I deal a lot

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.920
with the Hangout Lower
Third and the Hangout

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.232
Volume Control apps.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.780
JENNY MURPHY: And, last but
not least, Richard.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.620
RICHARD DUNN: And I'm
Richard Dunn.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.290
I'm the lead for the
Hangouts API team.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.320
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.410
According to your lower third,
you're apparently Google.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.470
RICHARD DUNN: You're
all of Google.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.210
JENNY MURPHY: You're
all of Google.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.856
JD SALAZAR: All in one, one for
all, that's what I say.

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:47.780
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.187
So we were talking about
the latest release of

00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:53.200
the Hangouts API.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.580
Richard, would you like to give
us a little overview of

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.810
what's been added
in this release?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.100
RICHARD DUNN: Sure, yeah.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.650
We added a bunch of stuff
this time around.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.930
The first thing we added was
facial motion detection and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.990
getting the data where
the face is.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.840
So in the past we've had images
that can track the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.330
face, and now we're actually
exposing that data so that any

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.100
app can use it to display
whatever they like.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.350
Or use it to control a game
or anything like that.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.230
We also released a new way of
broadcasting messages to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.290
instances of your app, which
lets it go much faster.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.890
Use it for things like sending
mouse movements or tracking an

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.900
object in a game, things
like that.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.660
We added static overlays.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.390
So images that you can overlay
over your video that don't

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.280
track a facial feature but
are fixed on the screen.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.025
And there's obviously
examples of that

00:03:57.025 --> 00:03:57.880
running in this Hangout.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.930
The Lower Thirds app, which
is fixing the names there.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.390
And I believe Alan's Time is
probably using that as well.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.710
And then we added a bunch
of miscellaneous stuff.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.982
You know, ways to figure out
whether the Hangout is an on

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:17.100
air Hangout, whether it's
a public Hangout.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.130
And we did some changes actually
based on developer

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.010
feedback, which was allowing you
to see the names of people

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.215
that aren't using the app.

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:32.640
I believe Moritz needed that
for volume control, because

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.110
you'd like to be able
to identify whose

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.454
volume you're affecting.

00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:38.470
I think that's about it.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.940
ALAN FURTZENBURG: This also has
the first of the on-air

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.500
features, correct?

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.940
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.640
So we just started with whether
the hangout is an on

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.810
air Hangout, and whether
it's broadcasting.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.110
And we obviously plan to
add a bunch of stuff

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.003
in that area soon.

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:01.753
JOHN BERRY: And there's both
the methods and as well as

00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:03.885
events for that?

00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:05.651
RICHARD DUNN: Correct.

00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.270
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.280
It's a lot of neat stuff.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.500
We're really looking forward to
seeing what people will do

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.305
with some of these features.

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:14.990
I'm kind of excited
about the face

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.600
tracking, the data stream.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.160
And there's a lot of
cool potential.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.940
I'm waiting for someone to write
a robotic camera that

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.776
tracks faces.

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:24.680
I'll do that.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.312
If someone else does
it, I'll send you

00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:27.790
a t-shirt or something.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.837
JOHN BERRY: Well, Will's
camera has got

00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:30.030
a pretty cool WebGL.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.790
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, the giant
floating robot head.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.930
Yeah, it's actually in the video
that we released when we

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.450
released the version 1.1.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.710
Yeah, it's just--

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.190
we have a roll, pan, and tilt.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.930
And I hook that up to a cube
to kind of move it around.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.590
And then, I made the mouth move
up and down with volume.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.635
Although, actually I want to go
back and change that so it

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:58.820
actually moves with the top and
bottom lip endpoints, or

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.340
attach points.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.950
The other thing is, I was able
to go zoom in and out.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.780
And we're able to do zoom in and
out by basically using the

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.280
scale between your eye and
the tip of your nose.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.106
That should stay constant
the entire time.

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:15.880
If your nose is like moving
out someplace

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.500
it's going to be bad.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.525
That person's going to have
suboptimal performance.

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:22.280
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, I actually
use the distance between the

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.520
two eyes to measure the zoom.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.150
So that's what I use for that.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.170
WILL THOMPSON: That's how
the Wii works too.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.440
It sees those two points
and zooms in and out.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.342
And that's how you know how
far away the controller is

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:33.790
from the thing.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.380
Yeah, it works really well.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.675
I would worry that if I was
using-- well, it's probably

00:06:38.675 --> 00:06:40.660
the same either way--

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.490
whether if you turn your head
and zoom in and out, whether

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.133
the two eyes close together or
these two close together are

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:48.010
going to be better or worse.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.985
But anyway, it's pretty neat.

00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:52.155
I hope to release [INAUDIBLE]
for that really soon.

00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:55.161
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.656
JOHN BERRY: You also did some
cool things like you added

00:06:56.656 --> 00:06:57.260
weighting and
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.595
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, I
absolutely used smoothing.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.220
I'll show you the code
as soon as I can.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.590
It's basically weight--

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.860
I have a five frame smoothing,
and I weight the most recent

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.350
frame the highest but still use
those other five frames.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.250
It does mean that if you shake
your head like this really

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.116
fast it doesn't move quite as
much, but that's OK as long as

00:07:20.116 --> 00:07:22.836
you're not Richard Nixon
or something.

00:07:22.836 --> 00:07:25.485
JENNY MURPHY: I think the
probability of Richard Nixon

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:27.090
using your Hangout app
is pretty low.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.170
WILL THOMPSON: That would
be pretty low.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.445
You know, I should probably
make a Richard

00:07:30.445 --> 00:07:31.500
Nixon robot head, too.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.010
That would be
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.930
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: I was thinking
about creating a

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.320
head-controlled pong game.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.790
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.030
by moving your head up and
down or something.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.850
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.290
One of the things that I would
absolutely recommend is that

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.230
you put a mustache or something
on whoever the face

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.120
is tracking right now.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.640
Because one of the things I
discovered during testing is

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.500
it would lock on to somebody
standing behind me.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.566
And I would be like, God, it's
not working, what's this?

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:56.992
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.992 --> 00:08:00.068
WILL THOMPSON: Then I realized,
oh wait it's--

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.620
JOHN BERRY: Another cool idea
that I heard was like soccer,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.250
or using your head to bounce a
ball back up and down, and

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.700
then knocking it over
to somebody else.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.655
WILL THOMPSON: Head
hacky sack.

00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:13.198
JOHN BERRY: Yeah.

00:08:13.198 --> 00:08:15.665
JENNY MURPHY: That would
be pretty cool.

00:08:15.665 --> 00:08:16.910
Cool.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.860
So I see some questions
are starting to

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.110
pile up on the feed.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.880
And this is primarily a question
and answer show.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.410
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.480
go find the announcement
post on the Google+

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.945
developers plus page.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.805
And it should be pretty
close to the top now,

00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:36.659
because it's active.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.110
And it's also linked from the
original post of this

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.689
broadcast. And ask your question
there and we will

00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:44.002
respond to it live at some
point in this session.

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:45.805
WILL THOMPSON: I have
some questions.

00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:46.220
JENNY MURPHY: You do Will?

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.840
WILL THOMPSON: I do.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.040
I actually have questions that
Alan asked on the newsgroup

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.220
and I haven't had a chance
to respond to it yet.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.740
I figured we could ask
Richard and JD.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.950
Here, I'm going to
read from Alan.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.630
So if we don't set the scale for
our bottom thirds, for our

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.800
non-tracking overlays, what
does the system assume?

00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:20.412
JD SALAZAR: I believe the
default is width--

00:09:20.412 --> 00:09:23.120
the references width
and a scale of one.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.370
WILL THOMPSON: OK.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.770
Also, I know there's a method
to get to display ratio.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.810
Will the ratio change
during the Hangout?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.590
JD SALAZAR: No, it shouldn't.

00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:40.130
WILL THOMPSON: OK.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.490
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: I think
there's a slight small issue

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.091
or mistake in the reference.

00:09:46.091 --> 00:09:46.582
JD SALAZAR: OK.

00:09:46.582 --> 00:09:51.860
Let me just find it.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.800
WILL THOMPSON: Live document
debugging right here.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.700
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.180
We could to change it
at the same time?

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:04.323 --> 00:10:06.751
MORITZ TOLXDORFF:
I can't find it.

00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.580
JOHN BERRY: If you can actually
send us that link.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.270
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah,
send us the link.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.520
JOHN BERRY: We'll be
happy to update it.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:14.910
WILL THOMPSON: OK.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.983
And the last question is about
resolution of the feed.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.860
One of the things that's
interesting is how wide is the

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:31.950
feed exactly, so that I can make
ideally-sized overlays.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.960
And I guess it would be
interesting for you guys to

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.090
address some of that.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.740
JD SALAZAR: Sure.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.140
So the problem with that is
it's camera-dependent.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.130
So even more than that, it's
camera-dependent and what we

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:53.280
detect with reference
to your computer.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.000
Like how much load there
is and so forth.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And so you can't really
guarantee anything about the

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.240
resolution.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.900
I think we could look into
giving some guidelines on

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.450
approximate image sizes that
we think might look good.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:15.550
But I don't think we'll ever
be able to tell you exactly

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.160
what the resolution is so that
you can optimize perfectly.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.880
ALAN FURTZENBURG: And I think
we can understand and

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.720
appreciate that.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.860
I think guidelines would
really, really help.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.100
Or at the very least, an API
method that told us what the

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.770
maximum resolution is, or
something along those lines.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.268
Because I know when I started
playing with the static

00:11:36.268 --> 00:11:41.270
graphics, I pretty quickly
figured out what the numbers

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.570
were going to be that I
usually ended up with.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.995
And that gave me an idea
for what maximum I

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:49.340
should design for.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.470
But even scaling down from that
doesn't always look good,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.700
and certainly if I needed to
scale up to that, it'll come

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.960
out really badly.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.220
JD SALAZAR: Right.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.630
Yeah, I think that there's
definitely work we can do in

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.160
both providing guidelines
outside of the API to what

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.260
looks good, and also trying to
come up with ways in the API

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.000
to give you feedback on what
might look good in specific

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.940
situations.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.090
That's definitely a to-do
item for us, I think.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.280
JOHN BERRY: And you know, we
say this all the time, but

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.405
since you've experimented, I'm
sure other developers would

00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:26.230
love to hear about those ranges,
and how you found

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.610
those useful.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.984
And we'd love to hear feedback
in terms of what we could be

00:12:29.984 --> 00:12:32.620
recommending, too.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.870
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.720
JOHN BERRY: So that was
all the questions?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.023
WILL THOMPSON: Those are
Alan's questions?

00:12:40.023 --> 00:12:41.917
JENNY MURPHY: Unless you
thought of any in

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:42.870
the interim, Alan.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.410
ALAN FURTZENBURG: Oh,
I've thought of

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.195
plenty in the interim.

00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:49.815
And in fact, I know I emailed
some of them last night while

00:12:49.815 --> 00:12:53.500
I was in the middle of trying
to get the clock working.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:01.880
The documentation indicates
that the URLs for an image

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.440
resource should be either HTTP,
HTTPS, or a data URL.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.440
I had trouble getting the
HTTPS one working.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.160
And one of the things I realized
is that there's no

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.360
error called if it can't
load an image resource

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.840
for whatever reason.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.960
A, am I correct about the fact
that HTTPS is not supported?

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.635
And B, is there supposed to be
some indication somewhere that

00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:34.480
it can't load a resource?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.540
And I guess the follow up to C
is, if either of those are no,

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.160
what can be done
to change this?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.310
JD SALAZAR: OK, so an
HTTPS should work.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.140
And if you're experiencing
problems, then--

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.830
WILL THOMPSON: Well, one thing
you can do is absolutely send

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.980
us a piece of sample code that
demonstrates the error.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.831
And we can take a look
at that, definitely.

00:13:54.831 --> 00:13:58.190
I saw your email and was like,
yeah that's interesting.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.800
Let me go try that.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.990
And I haven't had a chance
to try it yet.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.400
J.D. SALAZAR: B, you are
correct that we do not

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.140
currently provide any feedback
as to whether the image was

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.210
loaded or not, and we're
working on it.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.040
That's definitely high on the
list of things that we want to

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.290
add, I think.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.684
JOHN BERRY: Just get better
feedback, or specifically

00:14:23.684 --> 00:14:24.460
about the overlays?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.955
WILL THOMPSON: Just when a
overlay fails to load.

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:27.920
JD SALAZAR: Yeah, I think
in general for any image

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.410
resources we'll look into adding
some type of event that

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.920
tells you when it loaded
and if it loaded.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.795
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: In my case--

00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:38.566
I just posted the code
in the chat.

00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:42.260
I'm basically just doing the
forward slash, and just

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.030
leaving out the HTTP or
HTTPS, so the Hangout

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.520
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.890
whatever it should use.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.610
But actually, it should use
HTTPS, because the Hangout is

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.835
running HTTPS as well.

00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:54.820
And this is working
fine without

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.950
any error or something.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.900
ALAN FURTZENBURG: I couldn't
get it to use a

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.370
relative URL at all.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.610
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.170
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: I had some
issues when I was running my

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.090
apps on my own server, but it
has issues with a non-trusted

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.130
certificate and stuff.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:15.220
But since I run everything
on AppSpot, it's running

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.440
perfectly fine.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.320
JD SALAZAR: Yeah, that would be
my I guess for you, Alan,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.600
is that it has something to do
with the certificate that is

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:22.960
being used.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.820
The talk plug-in isn't quite
as accepting as Chrome is.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.550
So you might be able to hit
the URL in Chrome, but the

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.160
talk plug-in might have issues
with the certificate.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.660
But we can look at that.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.493
JOHN BERRY: Alan, I'm more
talking about a protocol

00:15:40.493 --> 00:15:42.370
relative URL.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.220
WILL THOMPSON: So instead
of just a

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.960
relative URL, it's HTTPS.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.505
And instead of saying HTTPS
colon slash slash, whatever,

00:15:49.505 --> 00:15:52.560
you just leave off the first
HTTPS colon slash.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:59.030
And then whatever protocol you
used to get there, it'll use

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.235
that one to get the
next resource.

00:16:01.235 --> 00:16:03.530
JOHN BERRY: You'll see--

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.470
ALAN FURTZENBURG: But in this
case that would have failed.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:11.710
Because it loads the rest of the
resources securely, but it

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.210
can't load the image
resources securely.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.300
WILL THOMPSON: Well,
in your case.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.135
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:16:18.135 --> 00:16:19.770
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, we'll
get to the bottom of it.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.830
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.710
Send us some code and a link
to the image that's not

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.435
working, and we'd be curious.

JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

in the Hangout?

What about adding animated
GIF support?

GIFs as overlays?

MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.670
Right now you probably can
load PNGs and JPEGs.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.350
JOHN BERRY: And data URLs.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.800
WILL THOMPSON: Well, data
URLs may contain--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:50.660
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.462
Sure.

00:16:51.462 --> 00:16:54.295
An animated GIF would
be quite cool.

00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:57.460
I had some ideas with that.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.780
JD SALAZAR: Yeah, I think
that's an option.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.130
I think also just better support
for animating image

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.190
resources in general.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:11.069
Such that you can have some
guarantees about showing and

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.220

the same frame, could help

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.300
with that too.

It's not the same.

An animated GIF is obviously
an easier way to do it.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.660
But I think both of those
things are something

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.922
we should work on.

Like, just adding somewhere a

What kind of thing are
you looking for?

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.530
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: What was it?

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.230
WILL THOMPSON: Where in
the interface do you

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.580
want to add this text?

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.570
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, can you
give us the specifics?

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.365
You know, a story, tell us the
story about how you'd use it?

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.960
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: For example,
my volume control app, right?

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.890
I have the mute Hangout button,
and that if I want to

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.910
place the button not inside the
left extension pane, and I

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.020
want to move it up where the
microphone and video mute

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.680
buttons are.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.300
Something like that.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.830
JOHN BERRY: So you want
to influence the outer

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.140
Chrome of the UI.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.080
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Right.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.335
JENNY MURPHY: That would
be really cool.

00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:37.328
It's a lot of potential
there but--

00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:39.830
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: I mean, sure
you can mess around a lot

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.980
then, but if you do it
right you can produce

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.150
some awesome stuff.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.640
WILL THOMPSON: Just put white
boxes over everything.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:49.512 --> 00:18:51.285
JENNY MURPHY: You can
no longer exit.

00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:51.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.760
WILL THOMPSON: Yes,
it's the no exit.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.010
JENNY MURPHY:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.345
JOHN BERRY: Until the
Hangout cuts out.

00:18:58.345 --> 00:18:59.940
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah, that
way you can actually create

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.390
your own themes for Hangouts.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.680
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.780
JOHN BERRY: All right,
so [UNINTELLIGIBLE]--

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.390
ALAN FURTZENBURG: It has been a
feature that a lot of people

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.660
who were broadcasting without
using Hangouts on air have

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.910
been requesting.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.052
JOHN BERRY: The Hangouts team
in general is every day

00:19:20.052 --> 00:19:22.130
looking at how to
improve the UI.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.810
And we've gone through at least
two major UI refreshes

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.680
since we launched.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.590
And the developer feature has
to go hand in hand with the

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.200
user experience, you know,
the end user feature.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.080
So that's great feedback for
thinking of the future.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.820
There is no plan I know of
today to add that, but

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.050
something to look into.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.090
JENNY MURPHY: Yep, cool.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.030
ALAN FURTZENBURG: A broad
question about resources and

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:48.860
image resources.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:54.300
There's a note in the API guide
that warns us that once

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.630
images are allocated in the
plug-in, they can't

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.560
deallocated.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.830
How big of a problem is this
really, and is there any work

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.940
being done on being able to
free up those resources?

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.430
JD SALAZAR: Yes, there
is work being done.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:14.150
And it's probably not a problem
unless you're loading,

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.410
like, hundreds or thousands
of images.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.480
WILL THOMPSON: I was going to
say, I've definitely crashed

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.520
the Hangout when I was loading
images like crazy, but that

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.373
was when I was loading them
almost every frame.

00:20:27.373 --> 00:20:27.846
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:20:27.846 --> 00:20:31.800
JOHN BERRY: I mean, certainly we
can try it with 100 images

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.484
on a MacBook Air and it works,
for 100 overlays, and that's

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:36.696
not a problem.

00:20:36.696 --> 00:20:38.620
So I can tell you that's
my benchmark.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:41.090
ALAN FURTZENBURG: OK.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.710
The reason I ask is, I know
Moritz and I had been talking

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.100
about doing digital clocks.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.750
And one of the questions was,
well why don't you just create

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.140
a canvas, put the text on it,
and replace the image from the

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.260
canvas every minute
or every second?

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.820
And I'm like, well, because
you're allocating all these

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.990
images and they're never
going to get freed up.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.540
And there was--

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.540
MORITZ TOLXDORFF:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] will crash.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.500
ALAN FURTZENBURG: And there
was some people who were

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.875
surprised like, come on, you've
got to be freeing up

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:09.330
the image resources somewhere.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.410
And I'm like, the documentation
says they don't

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.660
get freed up.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.390
JD SALAZAR: Yeah.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.340
It's definitely important for us
to provide a way for you to

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.170
free them up to do
things like that.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.630
But for now I would say, as a
general guideline, if you're

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:32.133
in the low hundreds of images
it's probably, won't have much

00:21:32.133 --> 00:21:32.615
of a problem.

00:21:32.615 --> 00:21:34.660
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, it depends
on how big they are.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.190
JOHN BERRY: And also--

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.160
JD SALAZAR: Yeah, that's true.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.410
JOHN BERRY: I noticed, that also
includes other overlays.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.741
So the sound overlays also
take up memory and do

00:21:42.741 --> 00:21:44.220
not get freed up.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.760
So if you have a bunch of images
and a bunch of sounds,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.130
you should be [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.850
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: By the way,
are the sounds broadcasted to

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.445
all the participants,
or only locally?

00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:54.590
I think only locally, right?

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.350
J.D. SALAZAR: Yeah.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.750
That's correct.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.100
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.860
And actually, if you play them
through the plug-in, they are

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.560
more likely to be
noise-cancelled.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.160
Which is a great use for if
you want to alert somebody

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.410
without alerting everybody,
rather than using an HTML5

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.550
audio tag or something, you
can just be like, bong,

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.453
through the plug-in.

00:22:15.453 --> 00:22:18.222
So if you're making a game
that takes turns or

00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:18.350
something like that.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.120
It's a very easy part.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.500
JD SALAZAR: Yeah, that's
probably the best part about

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.730
using the audio in the API is
that you should get echo

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.990
cancellation most of the time.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.880
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Are you
planning on broadcasting

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.090
sounds to our participants like
you do with the overlay?

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.070
JD SALAZAR: Yeah, that's a
heavily requested feature and

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.805
something we're looking
at adding.

00:22:38.805 --> 00:22:41.580
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Cool.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.180
And also, what I would
like to see--

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.333
I mean, with my volume control
when I mute the Hangout, now I

00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:49.530
have the overlay to indicate
that I muted the Hangout.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.130
And it would also be cool if I
get notifications on top of

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.240
the Hangout, that I'm able to
broadcast these notifications

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.260
to all the participants.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.430
Like, when I block someone
it shows up

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.750
on everybody's Hangout.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.610
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] the
people in the Hangout that I

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.380
muted the Hangout for me.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.262
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, we only
provide that the same way we

00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:11.130
did the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] avatar,
which is that you

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.780
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] state, and
then have each of the

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.610
individual apps post
it themselves.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.860
WILL THOMPSON: But yeah,
that's cool.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.940
JENNY MURPHY: Agreed.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.270
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: And another
more general thing is a lot of

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:31.820
people asking me how they can
remove an app they installed.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.070
Which is currently
not possible.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.795
Because when you try out a lot
of apps, at some point you

00:23:39.795 --> 00:23:41.870
just think the app is not worth
having it installed.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.410
And you want to remove it.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.300
There's no way to do it.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.630
You can revoke access, but
this is not enough.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:53.450
The app is still showing up in
your Recent tab and whatever.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.730
WILL THOMPSON: It can be
incriminating, depending.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.390
If you have poker in
there and you're

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.640
working out or something.

00:24:00.885 --> 00:24:04.130
JOHN BERRY: Unless you work
for a video game company.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.520
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah, we agree.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.920
We definitely need
a way to do that.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.110
It's in progress.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.120
You can revoke the permissions
for the app.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.400
WILL THOMPSON: Yes.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.500
You can go to
Google.com/dashboard, and

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.460
click on the revoke
permissions.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.440
RICHARD DUNN: I mean,
they really have

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.410
no permissions out.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.385
If you don't run them in the
Hangout, they really have no

00:24:23.385 --> 00:24:25.010
permission to do anything.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.420
I mean, they're not running.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.070
It's not like they're
offline apps.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.294
But yes, that will
be coming soon.

00:24:32.294 --> 00:24:35.880
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, this is an
artifact of the fact that, on

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.750
the Hangouts, we're moving
really fast. So lots of cool

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.150
stuff is coming out.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:46.370
This is just one of those
rough edges where

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.610
we'll clean it up.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.105
Hang tight.

00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:51.550
RICHARD DUNN: It's a happy
problem to have, that people

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.232
have too many apps that
they feel like they

00:24:53.232 --> 00:24:54.140
need to remove some.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.230
JENNY MURPHY: Exactly.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.310
JOHN BERRY: I mean, as I develop
a lot, I have probably

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.280
40 that are just called
Hangout app.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.180
So I'd love to get
that feature.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.480
RICHARD DUNN: So fill in
your metadata people.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.190
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah,
especially you.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.975
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, I was going
to say, I may actually

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:13.630
be the person who has the most
apps in their API console.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.020
I think I win.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.200
Yeah, and everybody who calls
them Hangout gadget--

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.200
I have this sea of
Hangout gadgets.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.290
JOHN BERRY: Cool, you want to
jump to the comment screen?

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:26.770
JENNY MURPHY: Sure.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.520
So I'm going to be reading
some questions from the

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.410
comment stream.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.350
So again, if you're watching
and you'd like to ask a

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:38.520
question go to the Google+
developers page

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.570
and you can ask there.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.230
There's an announcement post
where you can post your

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.840
questions, and we'll find
them and answer them.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.110
So I'm going to start from the
oldest questions first. And

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:51.745
Joshua Owen asked, yesterday--
way ahead of the curve--

00:25:51.745 --> 00:25:55.030
asked the question, is there any
way through the [? dom ?]

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.300
to identify the user's filmstrip
partitions on the

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.733
bottom filmstrip?

00:26:00.733 --> 00:26:03.580
It would be great if we could
drag and drop things from our

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.550
Hangout app onto a person's
partition to initiate actions.

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.770
RICHARD DUNN: So, two
answers to that.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.210
One, yes, you do have their
filmstrip position.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.780
It's in the participant
object.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.680
So you can use that.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.240
And I don't know if we'll do
anything as complicated as

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.540
drag and drop, but we've
definitely identified that

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.620
people want a quick way to
do some action that's

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:30.630
based on the user.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.970
So we'll be looking into ways
that maybe we can either

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.530
circle, click events on
the film strip or

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.430
something like that.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:43.790
So that people can initiate an
action on a particular user

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.390
without having to reimplement
that UI.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.790
Like--

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:47.516
ALAN FURTZENBURG: Well--

00:26:47.516 --> 00:26:48.400
no, sorry.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.690
Finish first.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:51.870
RICHARD DUNN: Like volume
control, right?

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.650
I mean, you have that list, but
it might just be easier if

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.550
it's, like, click on a person,
and then adjust their volume.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.050
ALAN FURTZENBURG: I think
related to that is also the

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:04.650
question that I get a bit is,
are you guys looking at being

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:11.200
able to position the individual
small thumbnails

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.460
elsewhere on the screen, like
we can position the large

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.680
video stream anywhere
on screen?

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.005
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah, we're
definitely looking at that.

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:21.945
ALAN FURTZENBURG: OK awesome.

00:27:21.945 --> 00:27:25.530
JOHN BERRY: And, you know, I've
seen people experiment

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.580
with the filmstrip position
for example.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.810
Because if you know how many
persons you have, and you kind

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.230
of know how wide
each object is.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.130
And you're using the drag data
from the JavaScript, you know

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:39.140
you've exited the eye frame.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.190
Right?

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.950
So you can just assume, kind
of, that they're there.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.270
JENNY MURPHY: So you can put
little air hockey gates at the

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.380
bottom of the screen?

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.790
RICHARD DUNN: It's definitely
hack, though.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.670
Because any minor tweak to the
UI could screw that up.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.590
JD SALAZAR: There's also a
problem where if you have an

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.870
extension open, then you can't
actually get to some people on

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.001
the filmstrip.

00:28:05.001 --> 00:28:05.380
Right?

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.460
It will obscure the people
on the left, for example.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:09.940
JENNY MURPHY: Right.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.690
So if you do something like
that, put a visual indication

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.110
on the bottom of the screen, the
approximate location, it

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.703
will probably help
a little bit.

00:28:16.703 --> 00:28:19.120
But it would be a hack.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.290
But it would work, probably.l

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.940
RICHARD DUNN: We will definitely
look into a way to

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.803
have some way to select people
via the filmstrip.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.515
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:28:30.515 --> 00:28:35.030
OK, so moving on to
the next question.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:35.770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:40.620
asked, I need a consistent
unique ordering for all

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.650
participants of a Hangout.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.405
I thought display index would be
suited for this, however, I

00:28:46.405 --> 00:28:49.360
periodically run into the
situation where it seems

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.760
multiple participants have the
same display index value.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.860
Can somebody explain this?

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.750
This seems to be related to
whether a user is just present

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:05.810
in the Hangout or they've
started my Hangout app.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.470
RICHARD DUNN: Interesting.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:11.380
Well, taking it from the end
back, I would say multiple

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:15.700
people having the same display
index seems like a bug to me.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.942
So we should probably look into
whether that happens.

00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:22.930
And as for the first part,
like just getting the

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.290
consistent number, I think,
Will, you've had a feature

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.250
request opened for
that as well.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.810
Like an absolute ordering
based on when they--

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.965
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, I'd be
really interested in knowing--

00:29:32.965 --> 00:29:34.520
and either an absolute order.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.065
You can do it a little bit by
looking at the time stamp on

00:29:38.065 --> 00:29:41.000
when they arrived
in the Hangout.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.570
You know, you have somebody
just call a set

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.380
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] as soon
as they walk in.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.120
And then just declare that's
an arbitrary order.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.222
It's not necessarily the order
they appear in the thumb

00:29:49.222 --> 00:29:52.490
strip, but it is an arbitrary
ordering.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.300
JD SALAZAR: If you don't care
about the ordering and getting

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.730
people jumping in the
middle [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.880
like Hangout ID or
something, too.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.480
It just depends on what you're
looking for, I guess.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.350
RICHARD DUNN: I would definitely
like to add--

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.385
just because it's super easy
for us to add, I would

00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:10.830
definitely like to add some
sort of absolute ordering.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.170
But in terms of the display
index, my expectation would be

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.890
that they were always
different.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.000
So that's a surprise to hear.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.280
JOHN BERRY: He actually updated
his post with an edit,

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.770
and said, just realized I'm
using Get Participants while

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:26.940
using Get Enabled Participants
guarantees that

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.360
display index is unique.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.610
Consistent order across
all users.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.510
And he ends with a
question mark.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:36.385
So I think the question
we should raise is Get

00:30:36.385 --> 00:30:40.100
Participants versus Get
Enabled Participants.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.140
RICHARD DUNN: Actually,
I know what this--

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:47.450
I wonder if that might be
that, if they leave--

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.950
well, then they'd disappear.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.320
GERWIN STURM: I think
that problem might

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.430
be the display index.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.540
If I have to display index two
for someone, someone else in

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.490
the Hangout might have
the same person

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.720
display index three.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.760
Because the ordering isn't
unique among all participants.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.710
So that might be the problem
he's having.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:07.530
JD SALAZAR: I think
that's true.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:12.080
I think that you can't guarantee
that participants

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.850
will be displayed in
the same order for

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.780
everyone in the Hangout.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.780
GERWIN STURM: So that might
be the problem.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.320
That the display index two is
different for me than for

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.875
someone else in the Hangout.

00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:22.040
RICHARD DUNN: Well, Jonathan,
can you forward

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.220
that message to me?

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.650
We'll definitely fix that.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.005
WILL THOMPSON: Assuming it's
buggy, we will fix it.

00:31:28.005 --> 00:31:28.490
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.118
Thanks for the bug report.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.090
So moving on to the
next question.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.760
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.310
asks, is it possible to access
Picasa photos within a Google+

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:48.340
Hangout that were shared from
another Picasa web account?

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.590
So within--

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.770
or actually, someone else
like to field this one?

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.540
I will field--

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.080
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, actually
it is possible, because if

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.090
it's a public photo
you can access it.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:02.150
Because you can access all
Picasa photos, so you can use

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.070
the Picasa data API to
access those photos.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.070
You just would need the Google
ID of the person you want to

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.340
have the photos access of.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.950
And now with the possibility
that you can actually add

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.170
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:20.740
to your Hangout, the ones you
want, you can actually request

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.390
limited photos as well, which
have been shared with you in

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:27.150
some cases.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.890
JOHN BERRY: That is a super
awesome feature

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.320
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] just
rolled out.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.260
And I know you worked
on a photo app.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.490
So why don't you explain a
little bit about what you had

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.330
to do to do that?

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.445
Because it's not so
straightforward.

00:32:39.445 --> 00:32:41.280
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, so actually
for my photo app I'm

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.540
using the Picasa data API
to access the photo.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.320
So I'm taking my Google IT,
and use it to access the

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.280
Picasa data API that can request
albums which I have.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.440
And I can request the photos in
the albums, and then just

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.790
put the link to the photo
actually put into the shared

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.680
state, so the others can
have the link for

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.100
the photo to be displayed.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.500
And this should work for my
photos or for the photos of

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.180
others as well.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.720
So if I know the link
to a photo I can

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.530
share it in the Hangout.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.320
JOHN BERRY: Pretty neat.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.520
GERWIN STURM: Actually, I could
just screen share the

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.650
app if you want, if anyone's
interested.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:19.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.680
JOHN BERRY: And you're using
the JS client, right?

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.930
The--

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.080
GERWIN STURM: Actually for the
data API I'm just using the

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.340
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.030
requests to access it.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.512
So let's see if I can
screen share this.

00:33:43.427 --> 00:33:45.790
OK, do you see it?

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.070
So actually what I'm doing on
this side here, I'm just

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:52.720
loading all my Picasa albums.
The public Picasa albums.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.420
Where the Picasa data
API and then just

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.960
can choose one album.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.320
So this side part here, this is
only private to me in the

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.210
Hangout app.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.505
And now I can choose
one photo.

00:34:05.505 --> 00:34:08.840
It shares the link with all
the other people who

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.612
are using the app.

00:34:09.612 --> 00:34:11.726
And they can see the same
display if they

00:34:11.726 --> 00:34:13.530
are using the app.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.250
So that's about it
what I'm doing.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:20.100
And if you, actually it should
be possible if you do access

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.659
albums of other people, as long
as they are public and

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:23.460
you have the IT.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.900
So in this case I'm just
refilling the API

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.530
with my Google IT.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.170
So it accesses my albums, but in
the same way you can access

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.710
the public albums of other
people as well.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.860
So you could actually just
say, I want to access the

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.179
public albums of Richard, and
then it would be able to

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:44.159
display them and share
those photos as well.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.230
JOHN BERRY: And again, that's
using the Picasa

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.440
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.050
API, which [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:53.370
unrelated Google+, but because
Picasa and Google+ photos are

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.630
related, he's able to do that.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:54.980
Cool.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.000
Cool integration.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.050
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, the photos
on Google+ use the Picasa

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.080
backend, so that's the
relationship between them.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.560
The Picasa APIs allow you
to access some of them.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.310
Cool, thank you very much
for demoing that.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.250
That was really--

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.760
So continuing on through
the questions.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.130
Joshua asks another question.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.390
What is the best way
to detect when a

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.600
Hangout app gets unloaded?

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.430
So that I could do some
cleanup once it's been

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.680
unloaded, for example?

00:35:26.995 --> 00:35:28.245
Anyone?

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.840
JD SALAZAR: Sorry.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.560
Could you repeat the question?

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.070
JENNY MURPHY: What is the best
way to detect when a Hangout

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.840
app becomes unloaded?

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.391
For example, if you want
to do a clean up.

00:35:41.391 --> 00:35:45.010
RICHARD DUNN: So we don't
really have--

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.260
We don't have this notion of--

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.100
I guess there's two answers
to that, right?

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.090
There is the other
people that are--

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:00.000
other instances of the
app can detect that.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.630
Yeah, so other instances of the
app can detect that that

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:07.390
person's left the app, if they
want to do clean up there.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.990
What we don't have is, we don't
have a way that the app

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.750
instance itself, when
it gets unloaded,

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:15.880
has time to do anything.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.630
We basically just kill it off.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.220
So it's an open question
of whether that's a

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.370
good thing to do.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:28.030
I guess there are some nice
things that can be done there.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.090
WILL THOMPSON: Well, yeah.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.950
It's certainly sort of like
the OnApp hidden event.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:34.977
JOHN BERRY: Yeah, so there's
the OnApp hidden, which I

00:36:34.977 --> 00:36:36.730
think is the second
answer to that.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.370
Because apps don't run
if you hide it.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.690
So for example if you toggle an
extension, or if the app,

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.050
you switch over to the video
feed, at that point, we fire

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:46.666
an event that says--

00:36:46.666 --> 00:36:48.330
I think that's exactly
what you call

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.700
the app, OnApp hidden.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.926
So if you have animation,
you might want

00:36:51.926 --> 00:36:52.660
to pause the animation.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.425
Or if you want to-- if you've
queued up background data that

00:36:55.425 --> 00:36:57.370
you need to send out to your
server, that may be a good

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.180
time to do that.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.520
And if you want to do something
if the user leaves,

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.450
and there's other users on your
app, then you could do

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:10.940
the On Enable Participant
Changed, and say, hey, we have

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.490
a lost user and it's
changed the games.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.347
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:37:14.347 --> 00:37:16.890
That's [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:17.940
ALAN FURTZENBURG: People have
asked me this question as

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.020
well, in regards to suggestions
that I've made

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:25.690
about how to trigger something
when a Hangout is

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.780
started with an app.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.520
How it can then go communicate
with a web server.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.940
They said, well how do
you do the opposite?

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.400
If a person leaves without
anybody showing up, how do you

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.390
clear that value?

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.560
And I said, uh, that's a
really good question.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.190
And the best solution that I
had come up with, that I

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:46.010
hadn't tested yet, was to attach
something to the iframe

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:51.000
and detect when the
iframe was close.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.200
So when it receives an
On Close event for--

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.330
I forget the correct
name of the event.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.440
But I haven't tested it yet, and
I don't know for sure how

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.460
it'll work, how well it will
work, or what other problems

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.980
that are associated with that.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.080
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.550
Thanks for the possible
solution.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.110
Which would work
in most cases.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:15.570
Someone killed the process
in the web browser.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.460
You wouldn't get that--

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:18.730
WILL THOMPSON: In that
case, you almost

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.510
might consider a KeepAlive.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.010
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, a KeepAlive
or a heartbeat?

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.867
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, just once
a minute, be like, oh, this

00:38:23.867 --> 00:38:26.560
Hangout's still going with this
app, and then, nope, this

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.710
Hangout's not going anymore.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:31.297 --> 00:38:31.740
JENNY MURPHY: Interesting.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.510
JOHN BERRY: In KeepAlive 108,
which I've been experimenting

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:37.966
with this morning, is
Google analytics.

00:38:37.966 --> 00:38:39.810
JENNY MURPHY: Google analytics
for KeepAlive?

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.010
JOHN BERRY: Yeah, right.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.400
So with the new real time
infrastructure.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.212
JENNY MURPHY: Oh, the real
time [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:38:45.212 --> 00:38:46.004
RICHARD DUNN: Are you
actually working on

00:38:46.004 --> 00:38:47.120
editing that, Johnson?

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.340
JOHN BERRY: No, I was just
playing around with Google

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.290
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] this morning,
and I've been doing some

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.940
things around trying to look
at the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:53.590
API, right?

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.070
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.310
API, as well as the JavaScript
wrapper.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:58.710
So there's some cool things that
you can experiment with

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.960
inside of the Hangout.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.500
JENNY MURPHY: This is actually
a problem that's existed in

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.145
web applications pretty much
from the beginning.

00:39:06.145 --> 00:39:08.390
Is you don't know when
people disappear.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.775
So there are a lot
of solutions out

00:39:09.775 --> 00:39:10.300
there on the web.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.220
And any solution that's been
out there to solve this

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.410
problem for regular, traditional
web applications

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:17.090
will also be able to help
you figure out--

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.215
for example, if you have server
side state that you

00:39:19.215 --> 00:39:21.110
need to clean up when the
Hangout app is closed.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.810
WILL THOMPSON:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.016
Whatever it is that
you need to do.

00:39:26.016 --> 00:39:26.500
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.090
Cool.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:28.620
Okey doke.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.985
So moving on to the next one.

00:39:30.985 --> 00:39:34.780
Chad asks, is there any chance
that facial tracking will be

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.270
able to support multiple
faces?

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.430
So like we have right here,
four people on camera.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.550
WILL THOMPSON: Wow, that
would be cool.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.935
JENNY MURPHY: It would.

00:39:44.935 --> 00:39:45.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:45.412 --> 00:39:46.662
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:51.212 --> 00:39:54.140
JENNY MURPHY: OK, moving
on to the next one.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.150
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Then we
have [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.490
games in the Hangout.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.960
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, we have no
announcements about that.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.980
JOHN BERRY: I will say, as we're
developing two of us on

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.340
the screen, the standard use
case for Hangouts is you in

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.890
front of your laptop.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.640
Definitely right now we're
behind a camera and it's

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.400
getting all four of us.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.520
But most people use Hangouts
while their on their laptop.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.030
WILL THOMPSON: This is the use
case why you need a mark when

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.330
you're doing puppets.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:25.930
Like [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.500
or playing a game
with your head.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.950
Mark which face you are
actually attached to.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.968
WILL THOMPSON: It should
say "one-up."

00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:38.370
WILL THOMPSON: P1.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:39.305
JENNY MURPHY: P1.

00:40:39.305 --> 00:40:41.631
P1, P2, P3, P4?

00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:42.870
That would be cool.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.990
WILL THOMPSON: I think his
next question was, gosh,

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.360
wouldn't it be cool
if there's WebGL?

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.520
And the answer is, yeah,
that'd be so cool.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.530
That's how the 3D robot
floating head works.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.280
It's in [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.280
So again--

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.630
JOHN BERRY: Yeah.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.100
He said something simpler.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.985
He said, I want to see a face
tracker in my [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:59.985 --> 00:41:00.690
image.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.030
And somebody was demoing--

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.960
JD-- the--

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.660
JD SALAZAR:

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.070
J.D. SALAZAR: I don't actually
have this app.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.785
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:08.785 --> 00:41:12.790
JOHN BERRY: But it was a picture
of John Malkovich, and

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.684
his mouth was moving
with your mouth.

00:41:14.684 --> 00:41:17.823
And it was pretty striking,
as well.

00:41:17.823 --> 00:41:20.363
It's doable with the
current API.

00:41:20.363 --> 00:41:23.380
JENNY MURPHY: Is that one
open source anywhere?

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.400
JOHN BERRY: I have no idea.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.880
JD was the one who was
playing with it

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.775
JENNY MURPHY: So a lot of the
hangout applications are

00:41:27.775 --> 00:41:28.310
actually open source.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.150
So if you track them down,
sometimes you can figure out

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.991
how people did them, too.

00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:35.150
WILL THOMPSON: Right
click, Resource.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.400
JENNY MURPHY: That
works, also.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.080
Cool, so just moving up the
stream of questions.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.500
WILL THOMPSON: But yeah, I would
actually add that WebGL

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.050
is really great in the Hangouts,
as opposed to Flash,

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.954
because it's running natively
rather than

00:41:52.954 --> 00:41:54.682
running in a plug-in.

00:41:54.682 --> 00:41:55.400
It's awesome.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.586
JOHN BERRY: Gerwin has some
experience, right?

00:41:58.586 --> 00:41:59.040
GERWIN STURM: Yeah.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.190
A little bit.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.260
JOHN BERRY: I think, Gerwin,
you're the first person to try

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.240
WebGL inside of Hangout.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.090
So you get that--

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.120
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, I think it
was the first thing I tried

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.660
with a Hangout app actually.

00:42:13.455 --> 00:42:14.230
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:18.983
OK, so there's a question
unrelated to Hangouts API that

00:42:18.983 --> 00:42:23.010
Harold asks, that
I will answer.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.520
Harold asks, how do I use the
Google+ +1 button on a web

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:32.980
page, and it seems that Google
apps users can't use it.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.290
The complaint is that
login is required in

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.600
response to the RPC call.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.960
He's also having trouble with
the badge, which renders as a

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.770
big white box.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:46.700
So this could depend
on a lot of things.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.165
And the easiest thing is for
us is just hook up and

00:42:49.165 --> 00:42:50.040
troubleshoot.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.350
It could be an issue because
it's a JavaScript that's

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:55.640
running on your page it can
sometimes be in conflict with

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.470
other JavaScript on your page.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:00.810
Or even web server
configuration, because our

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:04.110
buttons will fetch your page to
create the snippet, and if

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.600
they can't access it for some
reason, our page fetchers

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.860
can't access it, that will
cause problems, also.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.695
So in other reasons, there's a
lot of things that could be

00:43:11.695 --> 00:43:13.530
causing these issues.

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:16.960
So I'll look back with you after
the broadcast, and we'll

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:23.365
solve your problems. We'll
get back to you.

00:43:26.488 --> 00:43:28.680
So, moving up the thread.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.285
While I'm poking around on the
thread, does anyone in the

00:43:31.285 --> 00:43:33.010
Hangout have any other questions
or comments they'd

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.800
like to chat about?

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.680
Announcements?

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.375
GERWIN STURM: So I actually
don't have a question--

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.430
So I actually don't have a
question, but a suggestion,

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:48.010
really, because you just start
with the on-air functionality

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:48.660
in Hangout apps.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:53.110
There's actually three things
I want to see in there.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.790
Actually, I think would be
interesting to see who's the

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.800
one hosting the Hangout
on there.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.240
So which of the participants
is the one who broadcasts?

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.160
So that he maybe can get special
privileges inside of

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.280
the Hangout app.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:15.350
Then there's the thing with
the YouTube URL, so we can

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.560
link it and I can use it
in the comment tracker.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.630
And then also the link to
the broadcast URL on

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.170
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] which
announces the--

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.230
so those are actually
the three things.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.340
Actually, I would be happy with
the broadcast, because

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.060
there's a lot of things you
could do with that.

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.332
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: [INAUDIBLE]
the outgoing volume.

00:44:32.332 --> 00:44:35.410
RICHARD DUNN: What's that?

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.380
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Being able to
adjust the outgoing volume

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.140
to the video stream, so you
can use volume control to

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.160
adjust actually the video,
audio levels from all the

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.970
participants as a host.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:47.944
RICHARD DUNN: OK.

00:44:47.944 --> 00:44:49.320
More good suggestions.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.390
WILL THOMPSON: And definitely
more metadata about the

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.340
Hangout on air, is
what I'm hearing.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.630
Has anybody ever tried to put
the Hangout on air broadcast

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.100
inside the Hangout?

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.350
What would happen?

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.630
It's like the IT Crowd.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.490
Searching for Google inside
Google causes

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:11.810
the internet to close.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:12.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.200
JOHN BERRY: Then they do a
screen share with the video--

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.480
WILL THOMPSON: Screen share the

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.070
broadcast inside the Hangout.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.250
That would be awesome.

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:22.911
We should try that.

00:45:22.911 --> 00:45:26.160
JENNY MURPHY: Do you want
to try it right now?

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.570
WILL THOMPSON: I don't want to
set fire to this room, so we

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:28.980
better not.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.530
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, we're in
a new room, which is not as

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:32.360
equipped as previous ones.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.810
So we don't want our work
lab to catch on fire.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.910
But later when it's a
different computer.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:37.150
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.040
We'll see if we open a wormhole
in time and space.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.810
JOHN BERRY: I don't know about
you guys, but I don't own a

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.222
fire retardant suit.

00:45:43.222 --> 00:45:44.635
JENNY MURPHY: You don't?

00:45:44.635 --> 00:45:45.460
JOHN BERRY: Nope.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.710
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:48.195 --> 00:45:49.440
JENNY MURPHY: They're
useful when

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.620
doing things like welding.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.025
All the wool.

00:45:52.025 --> 00:45:54.970
Wool clothing is very
fire resistent.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:56.590
Just in case you were
wondering, everyone.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.072
WILL THOMPSON: You don't
have asbestos gloves?

00:45:59.072 --> 00:46:00.430
JENNY MURPHY: No, I
actually don't.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:01.920
WILL THOMPSON: They gave those
to us in high school.

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.050
It was amazing.

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.070
It was like, later on,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:08.320
But as it was.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:13.890
JENNY MURPHY: Anyway,
moving on.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.980
asked a question earlier about
the Picasa photos being

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:21.110
accessible from the Hangout
app, actually

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.900
clarifies the question.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.640
Actually, I mean for non-public
Picasa web photos

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.660
shared via Google+ from
a different account.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.200
So I'm assuming this would be if
Martin would share a photo

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.370
with just me, would I
be able to access--

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:41.640
oh, we can access our own Picasa
web via [INAUDIBLE],

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.760
but there doesn't seem to be a
way to access the photo that

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.190
Martin shared to me,
for example.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.680
Is there a way?

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:54.420
So this is starting to get to
one of the corners where using

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.590
these multiple APIs together
doesn't always work

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.260
wonderfully.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:06.660
The Picasa web APIs do not
include all of the features of

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.370
the security model Google+, for
example, which is built on

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.070
the same backend, but uses the
slightly different system for

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.920
managing all the sharing
and stuff.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:21.835
I am not aware of a way to
do this specific thing.

00:47:21.835 --> 00:47:23.500
It's a great question.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.760
I do not believe you can
do it with the current

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.560
APIs that are available.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.380
But I think you've done
more hacking on these

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.070
APIs than I, Gerwin.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.040
Do you have any input?

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.070
GERWIN STURM: Yeah, I actually
only used public APIs without

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:38.380
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE], so I'm not
sure what is possible with

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.160
the Picasa data.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.780
They're actually pretty
difficult to work with, to

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.660
actually get to know
how to use them.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:50.840
So I haven't really went into
all the stuff with the Picasa.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.370
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, they're
using our older, G data style

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.260
APIs, which are different than
the APIs that, for example,

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.530
Google+ uses.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.460
And as a result they have a
little bit more rough edges.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.590
We learned a lot when we built
all the API infrastructure,

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.900
and as a result we like our
new APIs a lot more.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.336
So you're in an interesting
case, where you're having to

00:48:10.336 --> 00:48:11.840
work with both of them at
the same time, which is

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.090
challenging.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.900
And if you can find
a way let us know.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.150
It's cool.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.080
And with that question,
we're actually just

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.270
about out of time.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.890
JOHN BERRY: Well there's one
question I wanted to answer.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:27.665
JENNY MURPHY: Oh, there's
one question you

00:48:27.665 --> 00:48:28.410
wanted to answer, huh?

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:29.803
JOHN BERRY: Somebody asked,
where you can get all those

00:48:29.803 --> 00:48:30.460
cool stickers on your laptop?

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.550
JOHN BERRY: So this one right
here, this G+ sticker, you can

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:37.460
actually buy it from the
online Google store.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:38.894
We just started shipping that.

00:48:38.894 --> 00:48:41.530
So you can get a pack of five
for a couple of bucks US.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:42.510
And I'm pretty sure it ships
internationally.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:44.240
WILL THOMPSON: And we have
the old +1 button.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.110
We have all kinds of--

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:47.760
JOHN BERRY: But the only one
you can buy is this guy.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.038
Actually, my HTML5 one, which
I'm very proud of, you can get

00:48:51.038 --> 00:48:53.656
from the HTML5 site, and a
bunch of other places.

00:48:53.656 --> 00:48:57.050
The JS one, the logo's
at opensource.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:58.660
You can print it yourself.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.570
And the Hangouts one and
the circles one, you'll

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:02.520
have to bribe us.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.370
WILL THOMPSON: You'll
have to bribe us.

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:06.810
JENNY MURPHY: You'll
have to do awesome.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:07.455
Do extra awesome.

00:49:07.455 --> 00:49:09.840
JOHN BERRY: I actually send out
stickers to people who do

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.280
cool things, or help me out,
or help the community.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.780
So if you [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.860
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah,
so do cool stuff.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.560
Let us know.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.598
WILL THOMPSON: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
like move his

00:49:18.598 --> 00:49:19.510
laundry over or something.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.120
He's like, here's a sticker.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.210
ALAN FURTZENBURG: There are a
couple of questions on the

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:30.140
YouTube page that may be of
interest. Somebody asked, as a

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:33.540
regular user, is there a page
that lists the Hangout apps?

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.480
Anything like the Chrome web
store for Hangout apps.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.200
I know that we all needed
to register with

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.110
the Chrome web store.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:43.094
What are the plans for a web
store for Hangout apps?

00:49:43.094 --> 00:49:45.586
RICHARD DUNN: Well
Hangoutapps.com has been doing

00:49:45.586 --> 00:49:49.055
a pretty good job of listing
all of them.

00:49:49.055 --> 00:49:50.140
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, that's
a community project that's

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.890
pretty cool.

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:55.380
JOHN BERRY: The short answer for
that is, there are plans,

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.250
and we're still developing
them.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.190
A lot of that is based
on feedback.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.695
The main way that people
discover is through the viral

00:50:00.695 --> 00:50:02.110
nature of apps.

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.480
If somebody's doing a Hangout
with an app and

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.050
you discover it.

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.830
And then, we're recommending
people make plus pages to

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.410
drive traffic to their
Hangout app.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:14.590
Either a Hangout app per plus
page, or if you have a brand

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.330
that you've created around
your apps, or just

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.700
my apps plus page.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:23.647
And Google's trying to strive
to build platforms for

00:50:23.647 --> 00:50:24.060
developers.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.100
So a way to distribute and
monetize is definitely on our

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.860
radar, and we're working
towards that.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.470
ALAN FURTZENBURG: You had
somebody who agrees with the

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.090
special privileges of the
Hangout creator to boot and

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:40.575
mute a user who's causing
a problem.

00:50:40.575 --> 00:50:43.040
And I know that comes up
frequently in the Hangout

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.650
discussions.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:47.770
And a request. Please implement
messaging from G+

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:53.690
app to the web browser while a
friend is within your circle.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.200
What are the plans for
interaction between the app

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.450
and the chat window?

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.870
RICHARD DUNN: Well, obviously
that's a big request. I think

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:08.820
there's some sensitivity
around chat.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.540
I don't know quite if that's
pushing stuff into the chat

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.900
window or pulling it out.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.645
Pulling it out is obviously--

00:51:16.645 --> 00:51:22.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:24.590
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah I mean, we're
looking at those issues

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.556
and we're trying to solve
some of them.

00:51:26.556 --> 00:51:28.100
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, we're
working through the chat

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.840
issue, but we're just very
cautious about interacting

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.800
with the chat too much because
we don't want it to either

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.400
become too noisy.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.920
And we also don't want to
compromise the privacy of

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.270
anyone in the chat.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:40.490
So we're taking a cautious
approach to

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.580
this particular feature.

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:46.310
But there's some cool potential
there, so we'll see.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.280
ALAN FURTZENBURG: And finally
from the YouTube chats,

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.040
several people thanking
for the answer.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.408
And finally, this is
an awesome Hangout.

00:51:54.408 --> 00:51:55.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:55.752 --> 00:51:57.840
JENNY MURPHY: And it's awesome
because all of

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.310
you guys joined us.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:02.160
WILL THOMPSON: From
Google engineers

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.590
to all of our community.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:04.620
It's really been great.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.570
JENNY MURPHY: And the overlap
of our community and Google

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:09.840
engineering.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.050
So thanks very much to
everyone for joining.

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.750
This has been a really great
session in our new location,

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.170
which will hopefully have
a dinosaur next time.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:20.010
WILL THOMPSON: Yeah, we need to
get a whiteboard so we can

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:20.270
plan a dinosaur.

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.470
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, we'll
figure it out.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.126
WILL THOMPSON: Somebody will
provide a dinosaur.

00:52:24.126 --> 00:52:27.150
JENNY MURPHY: But in regards to
this video, there will be

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:32.420
an edited version published to
the Google+ developers page.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.570
It'll include the show
notes, like we

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:36.230
have for every session.

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:38.200
And it'll be up later
today or tomorrow.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.680
In the meantime--

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.500
JOHN BERRY: And also the YouTube
Google Developers

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.470
JENNY MURPHY: It'll
also be added to

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:49.685
YouTube.com/GoogleDevelopers way
at the bottom of the page

00:52:49.685 --> 00:52:53.065
under the Google+ platform
office hours.

00:52:53.065 --> 00:52:54.900
It'll also be visible there.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.450
And the show notes will
be there too.

00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.290
Well, until next
session, thanks

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:00.370
everyone for joining us.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:00.746
See

00:53:00.746 --> 00:53:02.260
you later ALL: Bye.
