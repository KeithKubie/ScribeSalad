00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.900
Voiceover: In the last video, we showed or

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.433
we proved to ourselves that the

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.366
derivative of the inverse sine of x

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.700
is equal to 1 over the square root

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.679
of 1 minus x squared.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.996
What I encourage you to do in this video

00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:15.500
is to pause it and try to do the same

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.366
type of proof for the derivative

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.366
of the inverse cosine of x.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:24.330
So, our goal here is to figure out ...

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:25.940
I want the derivative with respect

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.366
to x of the inverse cosine,

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.038
inverse cosine of x.

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:34.038
What is this going to be equal to?

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:35.715
So, assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:37.259
let's work through it.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:38.966
So, just like last time, we could write,

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.100
let's just set y being equal to this.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.812
y is equal the inverse cosine of x,

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:46.925
which means the same thing is saying

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:50.433
that x is equal to the cosine,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:51.782
cosine of y.

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:52.704
I'll just take the derivative of

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:55.500
both sides with respect to x.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.566
On the left hand side, you're
just going to have a 1.

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.433
We're just going to have a 1.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:02.212
And on the right hand side,

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.166
you're going to have the derivative of

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.167
cosine y with respect to y, which

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:10.300
is negative sine of y times the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.166
derivative of y with respect to x,

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:16.700
which is dy, dx, and so we get ...

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.300
Let's see if we divide both sides by

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.433
negative sine of y, we
get dy, dx is equal to

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:28.700
negative 1 over sine of y.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.766
Now, like we've seen
before, this is kind of

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:34.300
satisfying, but we have our
derivative in terms of y.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.433
We want it in terms of x.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.633
And we know that x is cosine of y, so

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:39.766
let's see if we can rewrite this

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.633
bottom expression in terms of

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.700
cosine of y instead of sine y.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.823
Well, we know when we saw in the

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:49.167
last video from the pythagorean identity

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.900
that cosine squared of y plus

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900
sine squared of y is equal to 1.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.100
We know that sine of y is equal to the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.100
square root of 1 minus
cosine squared of y.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.366
So, this is equal to negative 1.

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.433
This is just a manipulation of the

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:07.233
pythagorean trig identity.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:10.766
This is equal to 1 minus cosine.

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.766
I can write like this,
cosine squared of y,

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.966
but I'll write it like this

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:17.500
because it'll make it
a little bit clearer.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.833
And what is cosine of y?

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.033
Well, of course that is x, so this is

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:28.500
equal to negative 1 over
the square root of 1 minus.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.166
Instead of writing cosine y ...

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:34.233
Instead of writing cosine y ...

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:35.566
I'm trying to switch colors.

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:36.967
Instead of writing cosine y,

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:39.833
we could write 1 minus x,

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:42.715
1 minus x squared, so there you have it.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:44.566
The derivative with respect to x of the

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:50.171
inverse cosine of x is ...
I think I lost that color,

00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:54.735
I'll do it in magenta ... is equal to

00:02:54.735 --> 00:03:00.766
negative 1 over the square
root of 1 minus x squared,

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:03.233
so this is a neat thing.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:06.300
This right over here is
a neat thing to know.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.300
And of course, we should
compare it to the inverse,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.612
the derivative of the inverse sine.

00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:13.094
Actually, let me put them side by side,

00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:15.300
and we see that the only difference here

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.766
is the sign, so let me
copy and paste that.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:22.034
I'll copy and paste it,

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:23.761
I'm going to paste it down here,

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:26.766
and now let's look at them side by side.

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:28.966
So, we see for taking the derivative

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:30.776
with respect to x of the inverse cosine

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:33.300
function, we have a negative.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.100
A negative 1 over the square root of

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.433
1 minus x squared.

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.900
If we're looking at the derivative with

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.433
respect to x of the inverse sine,

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:43.421
it's the same expression
except now it is positive.
