00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:08.525
Steel and plastic.

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:13.423
These two materials are essential to so
much of our infrastructure and technology,

00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:17.129
and they have a complementary set
of strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:18.900
Steel is strong and hard,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.249
but difficult to shape intricately.

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.885
While plastic can take on 
just about any form,

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.072
it's weak and soft.

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:28.424
So wouldn't it be nice if there
were one material

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:30.616
as strong as the strongest steel

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:33.507
and as shapeable as plastic?

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:36.092
Well, a lot of scientists 
and technologists

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:41.039
are getting excited about a relatively
recent invention called metallic glass

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.290
with both of those properties, and more.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.509
Metallic glasses look shiny and opaque,
like metals,

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.120
and also like metals,
they conduct heat and electricity.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.500
But they're way stronger than most metals,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.101
which means they can withstand
a lot of force

00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.449
without getting bent or dented,

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.193
making ultrasharp scalpels,

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.253
and ultrastrong electronics cases,

00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:03.089
hinges,

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.132
screws;

00:01:04.132 --> 00:01:05.632
the list goes on.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.019
Metallic glasses also 
have an incredible ability

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:10.755
to store and release elastic energy,

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.133
which makes them perfect 
for sports equipment,

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.258
like tennis racquets,

00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:15.320
golf clubs,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.700
and skis.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.219
They're resistant to corrosion,

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.375
and can be cast into complex shapes
with mirror-like surfaces

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:24.499
in a single molding step.

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.812
Despite their strength 
at room temperature,

00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:29.202
if you go up a few hundred 
degrees Celsius,

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:31.062
they soften significantly,

00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:34.474
and can be deformed into
any shape you like.

00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:35.832
Cool them back down,

00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:38.278
and they regain the strength.

00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:41.206
So where do all of these wondrous
attributes come from?

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:45.519
In essence, they have to do with
metallic glass' unique atomic structure.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:48.154
Most metals are crystalline as solids.

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:52.278
That means that if you zoomed in
close enough to see the individual atoms,

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:56.304
they'd be neatly lined up
in an orderly, repeating pattern

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:58.587
that extends throughout 
the whole material.

00:01:58.587 --> 00:01:59.871
Ice is crystalline,

00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:01.124
and so are diamonds,

00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:02.219
and salt.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.603
If you heat these materials up enough
and melt them,

00:02:04.603 --> 00:02:07.985
the atoms can jiggle freely
and move randomly,

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:09.590
but when you cool them back down,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.427
the atoms reorganize themselves,

00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:13.841
reestablishing the crystal.

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:17.219
But what if you could cool 
a molten metal so fast

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.055
that the atoms couldn't 
find their places again,

00:02:20.055 --> 00:02:21.914
so that the material was solid,

00:02:21.914 --> 00:02:26.356
but with the chaotic, amorphous internal
structure of a liquid?

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:28.096
That's metallic glass.

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:31.579
This structure has the added benefit
of lacking the grain boundaries

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.472
that most metals have.

00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:36.884
Those are weak spots where the material
is more susceptible to scratches

00:02:36.884 --> 00:02:38.783
or corrosion.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:43.394
The first metallic glass was made
in 1960 from gold and silicon.

00:02:43.394 --> 00:02:44.837
It wasn't easy to make.

00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:47.505
Because metal atoms 
crystallize so rapidly,

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:51.405
scientists had to cool the alloy down
incredibly fast,

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:54.527
a million degrees Kelvin per second,

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:57.456
by shooting tiny droplets
at cold copper plates,

00:02:57.456 --> 00:03:00.317
or spinning ultrathin ribbons.

00:03:00.317 --> 00:03:05.440
At that time, metallic glasses could
only be tens or hundreds of microns thick,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.657
which was too thin 
for most practical applications.

00:03:08.657 --> 00:03:10.715
But since then, 
scientists have figured out

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:14.318
that if you blend several metals
that mix with each other freely,

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:16.899
but can't easily crystallize together,

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.701
usually because they have very different
atomic sizes,

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:22.945
the mixture crystallizes much more slowly.

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:26.034
That means you don't have to cool
it down as fast,

00:03:26.034 --> 00:03:27.616
so the material can be thicker,

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:30.092
centimeters instead of micrometers.

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:34.375
These materials are called bulk
metallic glasses, or BMGs.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:37.042
Now there are hundreds of different BMGs,

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:40.109
so why aren't all of our bridges
and cars made out of them?

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.349
Many of the BMGs currently available
are made from expensive metals,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.537
like palladium and zirconium,

00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:48.022
and they have to be really pure

00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:51.374
because any impurities 
can cause crystallization.

00:03:51.374 --> 00:03:56.386
So a BMG skyscraper or space shuttle
would be astronomically expensive.

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:57.776
And despite their strength,

00:03:57.776 --> 00:04:02.089
they're not yet tough enough
for load-bearing applications.

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:05.082
When the stresses get high,
they can fracture without warning,

00:04:05.082 --> 00:04:08.206
which isn't ideal for, say, a bridge.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:12.065
But when engineers figure out
how to make BMGs from cheaper metals,

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:14.058
and how to make them even tougher,

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:15.736
for these super materials,

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:17.309
the sky's the limit.
