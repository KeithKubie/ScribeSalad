00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.570
Here's an example of a UML class model diagram describing UML.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.320
You notice there are classes for class, there's also class for attribute,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.350
there's a class for association, and there are associations among these classes.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.080
You should study this diagram, to make sure that you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.680
