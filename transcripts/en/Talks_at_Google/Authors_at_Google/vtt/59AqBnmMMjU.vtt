00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.840
PHILLIP KNOLL: Welcome, hello.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.370
My name is Phillip Knoll.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.890
On behalf of Google Chicago
and Chicago Gayglers

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.100
for Pride Week, I'm excited to
welcome Nathan Albert to Talks

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.059
at Google.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.020
He is a professional actor
turned ordained pastor,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.180
a blogger turned
author, and a single guy

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.460
turned married man and father.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.730
And he is the creator
of the podcast called

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.280
"The Why Behind the What"
and the author of "Embracing

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.190
Love, My Journey to Hugging
a Man in his Underwear."

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.486
So Nathan earned a bachelor of
Fine Arts in musical theater

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:37.860
performance from
Rockford College

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.380
and a master of divinity
from North Park Theological

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.340
Seminary.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.410
And he and his
wife Kate now have

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.050
a son named Foster and
currently live in Rhode Island.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.770
"Embracing Love" is the story
behind the iconic photograph

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.550
seen by millions
around the world.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.550
It was taken along the
Chicago Pride Parade

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.430
route where he and his friends
were bearing signs of apology

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.860
on behalf of Christians
who had failed to show love

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.076
to the LGBTQ community.

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:02.700
In "Embracing Love,"
Nathan also shares

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.231
his own personal and pastoral
stories of the LGBTQ community.

00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:08.730
For Googlers in the
audience, please

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.230
think of your
questions for the Q&amp;A.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.300
We have a microphone in
the middle of the room.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.010
And there's also a Dory.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.530
So please join me in welcoming
to the Google stage, Nathan

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.900
Albert.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.400
NATHAN ALBERT: Well, hello.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.680
And it's good to
be back in Chicago.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.020
I used to live in
Andersonville and Albany Park.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.110
So it's always good
to be back home.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.522
And I don't want to leave.

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:36.230
And it's always good
to be with Googlers.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.220
I did a talk in New York
City a few months ago,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.090
and it was great.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.250
And I fell in love with Google.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.510
Even though I don't
regularly use Google+,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.760
but I Google things.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.830
But I'm probably the
least qualified person

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.250
to ever be a Googler as a
bachelor in musical theater

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.500
performance and a
masters in divinity.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.690
But it is my new dream
to become at Googler.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.320
So if you need a tap
dancing chaplain,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.830
I could be that person
for your Google community.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.360
As Phillip said,
I'm an actor turned

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.840
pastor, which is just weird.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.090
I live in the Ocean
State of Rhode Island,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.040
originally though from
the suburbs, moved

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.820
into Chicago for a long time.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.980
Married to Kate.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.070
We have a 1 and 1/2 year
old kid named Foster.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.130
He's a rock star.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.580
So he's really cool.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.711
If this doesn't go well,
I could just switch over

00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.210
to telling stories
about him, and it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.167
could be much more entertaining
than what I'm doing.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.250
But I am the author of
this book, "Embracing Love,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.920
My Journey to Hugging a
Man in his Underwear."

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.490
And it's based off
of a few things.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.520
So today what I'll
do is kind of give

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.560
a summary of the book,
share a few stories,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.380
and then we'll open it up
to Q&amp;A and dialogue, which

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.270
is what I'm really looking
forward to as well.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.420
So the book is part
autobiographical.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.250
It kind of shares my
story of growing up

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.890
in a traditional
and conservative

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.090
Christian environment in
the suburbs of Chicago.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.960
Eventually, I was immersed into
the LGBT community, and really

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.790
the gay and lesbian
community when

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.160
I worked as a professional
actor and singer.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.740
It chronicles my journey
to becoming a pastor

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.380
and going to seminary,
and then this viral blog

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.000
post that happened in 2010.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.430
And so it kind of
shares my own education

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.310
about the gay community
and the gay rights movement

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.900
and gay history.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.200
And then it's also, secondly,
it's part theological.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.920
And so I look at the six
main passages in the Bible

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.500
that are often used to
talk about homosexuality.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.290
And I do that looking from
both a traditional viewpoint

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.000
and a progressive viewpoint.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.230
And so looking at the
Greek and the Hebrew.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.480
And how do scholars
or Christians

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.080
or church communities come
to a certain conclusion

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.070
about sexuality from a
traditional viewpoint, but also

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.320
a more progressive viewpoint,
and kind of that spectrum.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.890
And then I also talk
about what is the church,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.070
and how can the church community
or spiritual communities

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.910
remain together, even if they
might differ on certain things.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.180
And how can we, instead
of fighting ugly, how can

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.880
we really learn and
understand from one another.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.700
And then finally,
it's part pastoral.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.060
So as a pastor and as
an actor turned pastor,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.720
how do I pastor
LGBT individuals.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.089
How do I pastor parents
who come to me and say,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.220
I have a gay child.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.970
What should I do?

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.510
Or someone who
comes to me it says,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.080
I've had this conservative
belief all my years,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.590
and now I have a gay child, and
these things are in tension.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.810
How do I pastor in that?

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.030
And for me, this is
a really holy thing.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.620
And I consider
these holy moments.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.100
And so I dedicate some time
in the book to that as well.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.310
So today I want to share a
few stories from the book.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.740
And then again, we'll
open it up for dialogue.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.370
Before we get too far, I want
to make it clear that it's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.460
my hope with my book and
with my work and with my life

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.900
and at this Google talk that I
never want to speak at people,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.790
and I never want to
speak for people.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.490
But instead, I'm trying
to speak with people,

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.110
and encourage others
to speak with.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.910
And I think especially
in this topic

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.550
when it comes to religion and
faith and the LGBT community,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.180
these can become very heated.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.620
Or I mean, really any topic
that is often divisive,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.690
I think it's better
and it's crucial

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.750
that we discipline ourselves
to talk with one another

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.370
rather than at or
for one another.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.230
A quick story to illustrate.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.640
My dad, who came with me today,
he works at O'Hare Airport.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.919
And a few years ago he
asked me for some advice,

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.460
which is always
interesting when like

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.040
your dad asks you for advice.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.510
But he said you know,
Nathan, I work at O'Hare,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.410
a diverse environment,
lots of people.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.080
And you know, I'm kind of
Christian guy, a white guy.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.530
He had a coworker who
was a gay Jewish man.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.420
Total like, I mean, that makes
for the start of a great joke.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.980
A gay Jewish coworker and
a conservative Christian

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.204
are at work together.

00:05:59.204 --> 00:06:00.620
And he said, you
know, Nathan, how

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.100
do you think I can engage
this conversation at work?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.180
You know, what do I do?

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.850
And I said, well
most simply, I think

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.840
you can just ask him, you know,
what is it like to be you?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.250
And so, lo and behold, he
actually took my advice.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.430
And went to his
coworker and they

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.280
were on break in the office
and eventually you know,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.810
he kind of said you know,
coworker, I forget his name,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.890
but you know, I'm a Christian.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.150
This is a heated
topic for many people,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.620
and I just am
curious, what is it

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.260
like to be you as a
gay individual working

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.960
at this airport.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.626
What is it like?

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:41.170
Is it-- what's it
like to work here?

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.450
Are there difficulties,
are their struggles?

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.592
And that question started
a 45 minute conversation.

00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:48.550
Where at the end of that
45 minute conversation

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.120
my dad's coworker said to him,
or invited my dad and my mom

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.812
to a barbecue at their house.

00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:55.270
And so what I love
about that story

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.210
is they started as coworkers,
and within the course of 45

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.910
minutes, they became friends.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.930
And since then, their
friendship has developed.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.790
And they text back and forth.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.550
And you know,
they're good friends.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.380
But I think asking
this question, what

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.080
is it like to be you,
is one of the best ways

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.550
that we learn to talk
with one another.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.340
And it breaks down stereotypes.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.790
It allows for empathy, and the
beginning of understanding.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.240
And it can move us from being
strangers to being friends.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.520
Now when I was in high
school-- and it's crazy,

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.829
I'm not that old.

00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:27.620
But 20 years ago when
I was in high school,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.170
I didn't have many gay friends.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.550
And then Facebook
came out, and I

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.700
realized I did have gay
friends, and they weren't out.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.400
And I was amazed at
how many came out.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.490
But it was so different
than the world today, right.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.950
But I was part of a system
that demonized and dehumanized

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.840
gay individuals.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.830
And I readily
participated in that.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.420
And really not knowing gay
individuals at that time,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.250
it was really that I was bashing
maybe the more effeminate kids.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.450
Or really probably the kids that
weren't through puberty yet,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:03.970
you know.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.740
And so I was a
part of this system

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.300
that was using these
stereotypes to hurt and demonize

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.930
other people.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.960
And much of which were
these abstract ideas

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.220
about other people that in
reality were completely false.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.630
And so much of my story
is the breaking down

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.150
of these abstract
ideas about people,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.510
because I began developing
relationships with people.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:35.440
And it's also been a breaking
down of my own privilege

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.510
as I gain awareness
and understanding

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.539
of the lives of others
and their experiences.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.360
And so now many of my
relationships with the broader

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.040
gay and lesbian
community happened

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.070
while I worked as a
professional actor and singer.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.310
And so the musical theater
world, for whatever reason,

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.310
is very welcoming to the
broader gay community.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.160
And in the musical
theater world,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.340
it's basically you're gay
until proven straight.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.640
That's just how the job works.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.180
You get to rehearsal
and everyone's gay

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.500
until you find out differently.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.570
And so I developed a lot
of close relationships

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.410
in that season.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.600
And there were times where I
was the only heterosexual guy

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.490
in a theatrical production.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.780
And that just came
with the territory.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.620
But what I learned
during that time

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.800
drastically impact
the course of my life.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.730
I learned that a
disproportionately high number

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.340
of my gay and lesbian
and people that

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.520
were part of the LGBTQ
community, a disproportionately

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.390
high number of them had horrific
and negative experiences

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.430
with either people
in the church, those

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.380
who consider
themselves Christians,

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.130
or just the church or spiritual
communities in general.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.680
And I heard story
after story after story

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.060
after story of friends that had
these incredibly painful things

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.980
happen to them at the hands of
people who consider themselves

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.970
Christian.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.509
I had a friend, many
friends who were kicked out

00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:02.050
of their churches
when they came out.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.780
Or they were leaders in their
youth group and they came out,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.400
and the pastor said
you can no longer

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.170
be a part of this community.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.090
I had a friend who was
spit upon by his roommate

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.900
as they were both attending
a Christian University.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.780
I know a teenager
that when he came out,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.309
his coming out process
was also memories

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:24.850
of when he was in
fifth grade, and he

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.390
was told by a leader of a church
that gay people go to hell.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.310
And that impacted his
coming out process.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.610
So story after story of this.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.890
One story that actually
impacted me the most

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.830
was my best friend Jeff.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.476
He and I performed
together here in Illinois.

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:41.600
We did some shows together.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.933
And when our contract was
over, he moved off to Broadway

00:10:43.933 --> 00:10:46.499
and he did some
"Les Mis" revival,

00:10:46.499 --> 00:10:48.040
and he's been on
Broadway ever since.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.960
And I moved into seminary.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.090
But he shared a
story with me that he

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.310
was sharing a dressing
room with this gentleman,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.967
and his name was Dave.

00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:58.300
And they were hanging out
backstage in the dressing room

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.620
as the show was going on.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.540
And eventually, the
topic of discussion

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.307
came to bash Christians.

00:11:06.307 --> 00:11:08.140
And so they were pointing
out and making fun

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.520
of the hypocrisy of Christians.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.020
And everyone was
having a good time.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.820
And you know, sometimes
it is a good time

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.321
to bash the hypocrisy
of Christians.

00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:15.820
And so people are
laughing, and then

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.200
it kind of turned a corner.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.100
And Dave almost became mean
and said, I hate Christians.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.620
They're ignorant.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.970
And I wish that all
Christians would drop dead.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.780
And so my friend Jeff, who was
raised in a church community,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.180
kind of pulled him aside
after and said you know,

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.544
I'm your friend.

00:11:35.544 --> 00:11:36.210
I'm a Christian.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:36.793
You know that.

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:40.500
And I just want you to be aware,
like some of that stings me.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.910
And Dave responded back.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.660
And he said your beliefs
are anathema to me.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.540
And having you, a Christian,
in this dressing room

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.180
is like having a Nazi in here.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.160
And he walked away.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.090
Dave and Jeff have
continued their friendship.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.920
But one of the things
that was so astonishing

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.730
is that some other Christian
individual hurt Dave

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:08.940
so badly that for him,
a Nazi and a Christian

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.239
were the same thing.

00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:12.780
And so it's shocking
to me that there

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.480
have been people who
have done so much damage

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.530
to other people's lives who
profess to be people who

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.960
are following the way of Jesus.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.720
And my guess is that either
some of you in this room

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.960
have had similar experiences,
or that some of you,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.300
and if not all of
us, know someone who

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.840
has had a similar experience.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.210
And so as I continued
in my journey,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.670
I found myself with
these two loves

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.020
that didn't seem to
love one another.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.430
So I loved the church.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.090
I loved the spirituality.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.622
I loved some of these
ancient spiritual practices

00:12:47.622 --> 00:12:49.080
that have been
around for thousands

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.170
of years that kind of give
me a peace or a calmness

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.460
or a sense of prayer.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:59.070
Or these things that I just find
that benefit my life so well.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.240
Or places where I found
mercy and community

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.650
and great friendships and
hope and justice and love.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.690
And at the same time,
I loved my friends.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.010
I mean, I loved them.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.360
And many of them, as part
of the gay community,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.820
they have welcomed me in,
a heterosexual Christian,

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.760
into their community with
such love and acceptance.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.050
And so I had these two loves.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:27.270
And then I was confused that
my gay friends, whom I loved,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.120
didn't love or didn't want
to be a part of the church

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.110
that I loved.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.910
And the church
that I loved didn't

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.720
seem to love or want to have
my friends whom I loved.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.260
And so I was confused by this
tension between these two

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.460
loves.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:47.070
And what I came to learn, and I
think the Christian community--

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.140
some parts of the Christian
community may not realize this.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.290
But this isn't a battle
between the Christian community

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.080
and the gay community
or the LGBT community.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.990
That this is actually,
this battle is a civil war.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.892
It's a civil war.

00:14:03.892 --> 00:14:05.350
I worked with the
Marin Foundation,

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.933
which is a nonprofit
organization that

00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:08.380
was here in Chicago.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.370
And we did a national
study that looked

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.875
at the broader gay and
lesbian community and faith.

00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:18.250
And this has now been turned
into a book by Andrew Marin.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.350
It's called "Us Versus Us."

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.340
But we found in that study
that 86% of the LGBT community

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.700
was raised in a denominational
affiliated religion.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.460
So Catholic,
Protestant, Lutheran,

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.160
some evangelical
churches, Assembly of God.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.650
86% was raised in a
Christian based religion.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.840
Of that 86%, 73% said
that they are no longer

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.300
practicing the religion
in which they were raised.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.680
And there's a
handful of reasons.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.350
Some of that is theology
on human sexuality.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.260
Some of that is the hypocrisy.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.470
Some of that is some doctrines
they don't understand,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.120
and the list kind of goes on.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.360
And 20% of that is
they're practicing

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.310
a different religion,
perhaps Buddhism,

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.160
or some other religion.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.780
And what influenced-- and
this is a shocking statistic.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.430
But what would
influence a person

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.560
to return to the religion
in which they were raised,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.290
62% of the 86% said there
is absolutely nothing that

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.240
would encourage them to
return back to their religion.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.870
Now as someone who
is a pastor, this

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.170
is like one of the most gut
wrenching statistics for me.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.650
And so what I saw happening
is that the LGBT community,

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.800
they were kicked
out of churches.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.520
And they were shunned from a
community that professed love.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.310
And what did the
LGBT community do?

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.930
I think you have created their
own community, their own church

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.550
that is incredibly
loving, wildly accepting,

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:56.110
and actually does church better
than many Christian communities

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.160
do.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.470
That actually, I believe
that the Christian community

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.230
has so much to learn from
the LGBT community about how

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.650
to care, how to love, how
to defend, how to accept,

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.190
how to cherish their people.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.050
And I think that
the gay community

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:15.010
has been more like a church
than many other churches claim

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.030
to be.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.470
And so eventually,
I entered seminary,

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.310
where I assumed everyone had
a similar experience to me.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:26.650
Where going to Roscoe's and
Sidetrack, and you know,

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.190
Scarlet, like you just
always went to those places.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:35.180
And then I got to seminary and
that was not the case at all.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.780
But I did introduce a lot
of seminarians to Boystown.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.460
I will say that.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.860
And this is where I also
adapted a lot of my schoolwork

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.990
and my writing and my
reading specifically

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.710
to faith and human sexuality.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.630
Which is then what I did
was I wrote my thesis

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.750
on human sexuality.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.220
And which I condensed basically
into one chapter in my book.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.720
But while I was
doing all that, this

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.050
is where we get to this
Chicago Pride Parade in 2010.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.180
A handful of us, about
20 of us, decided

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.819
to do what we called
the I'm Sorry Campaign.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.430
And so those of you who have
been a part of the Gay Pride

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.520
Parade here in Chicago, you know
that at the end of the parade

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.800
route there is a
group of protesters.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.260
And they are some sort of
Christian organization.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.670
And they have
megaphones and they

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.619
have signs that say
pretty horrific things.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.900
And they're behind
police barricade.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:28.180
And they spend their time at
the parade shouting pretty vile

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.150
things to those who pass by.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.520
And so we decided
we wanted to be

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.470
an alternative Christian voice.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.587
The group of us decided
we kind of wanted to be--

00:17:37.587 --> 00:17:40.170
we kind of wanted to have this
as a confessional booth, right.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.900
Like confession is a part
of our religious tradition.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.500
That maybe we should
confess that we

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.950
were a part of dehumanizing
a group of people

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.930
and excluding people.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.704
And we wanted to start the
process of making amends.

00:17:53.704 --> 00:17:55.120
So what we did,
is we got together

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.869
and we made t-shirts
that said, I'm sorry.

00:17:56.869 --> 00:17:59.680
And then we got some posterboard
and we had a sign making party.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.810
And we wrote all sorts
of things on the signs.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.020
Things like, "sorry for the way
the church has treated you."

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.121
"Sorry that Christians
have kicked you out."

00:18:07.121 --> 00:18:08.620
One of my favorite
shows was "I used

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.440
to be a Bible banging
homophobe, sorry."

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.560
And we set them up in the
fence of the parade route.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.680
And we were right
at the IHOP, kind of

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.420
at the bend of the parade route.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.490
And we just enjoyed the parade.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.342
And so throughout the
parade, we had all sorts

00:18:24.342 --> 00:18:25.300
of different reactions.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.900
People came up and said,
well, what are you doing?

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.710
Why do you have--

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.830
what are you sorry for?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.230
And we got to explain
why we were there.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.170
And one moment in
particular, which

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.230
is what I wrote a blog post
about, a gentleman who I later

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.030
learned his name
was Tristan, was

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.160
dancing on top of a float
in his whitey tighties.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.750
He had abs of steel
that I could never

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.280
have if I worked at them
for the rest of my life.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.480
And he was dancing
up on the float.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.540
And he came around the
bend and he saw our signs

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.542
or he saw our shirts.

00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:55.750
And he yelled at me and
said, what are you sorry for?

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.770
It's pride.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.240
Be happy, celebrate.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.770
And I simply pointed
down to our signs.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:06.250
And I saw his face read
across all the signs.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.850
Which we have a picture
cycling through as well.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.320
And he read all the signs.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.180
And he jumped down
off the float.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.010
And he came running towards us.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.510
And there's a group
of three or four

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.134
of us that were all right there
and he just dove into our arms.

00:19:19.134 --> 00:19:20.351
And he said, thank you.

00:19:20.351 --> 00:19:21.850
The exact moment
when that happened,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.760
a woman happened to be
taking photos of the parade.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.670
And she actually
snapped that photo

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.402
and sent that to me
later in the week.

00:19:30.402 --> 00:19:32.110
I wrote a blog post
about that experience

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.300
called "I Hugged a
Man in his Underwear."

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.690
Now at the time, my blog had
like four readers, me, my dad,

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.390
my mom, and maybe my friend.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.750
So it really was, it
was not a popular blog.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.370
It still isn't.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.800
But it went crazy.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.880
It absolutely went crazy.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.060
It was viewed I think like
over 140 million times.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.190
The picture has been viewed
like 130 million times.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:59.170
It was picked up by the
BBC and Australia Herald,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.077
Buzzfeed put it in
another viral blog post

00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:05.410
that they had called "21
Pictures That Will Restore Your

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.820
Hope In Humanity."

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.240
That went viral like
almost 20 million times.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.610
It was voted Best
Picture on imgur

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.800
a couple of years in a row.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.850
All sorts of people
have tweeted about it.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.780
And usually every
year around this time

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.410
it somehow pops up
in social media.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.930
And so it's always funny when
people are like, is that you?

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.370
Are you in that?

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.460
And we never intended to
make a well-known blog post

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.780
or make any public known thing.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.920
That was not our intention.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.640
We simply wanted, as
a group of 20 of us,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.070
we simply wanted to
publicly apologize.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.534
And so sense then it's
been done almost every year

00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:45.700
at the Chicago Pride Parade.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.350
It's been adapted now.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.570
And there's actually
now a counter-protest

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.676
called Make Love Louder.

00:20:51.676 --> 00:20:53.050
So if you're at
the pride parade,

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.680
they actually are in
front of the protesters

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.940
at the end of the parade.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.860
So you'll see them
there if you're there.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.990
And yeah.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.270
And so that's what we did.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.640
And one of the things
about the protesters,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.120
there's this scripture verse
that talks about if you speak

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.190
and you don't have
love, you end up

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.940
sounding like clanging
cymbals and gongs.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.810
And the protesters at the end
of the parade route, for me,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.080
are the personification
of that scriptural verse.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.390
That they are banging
cymbals and noise,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.690
because there is no love.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.760
Now there's been all sorts
of feedback from this.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.290
Some people love it,
some people hate it.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.170
I have had countless
emails from people,

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.520
Christian individuals,
who loved what we did,

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.930
are thankful for what we did.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.890
And I had probably
even more Christians

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.200
who thought I was a
heretic and that I

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.080
am working with the anti-Christ,
or whatever it might be.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.700
Threatening our lives.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.700
And at the same time, members
of the LGBT community,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.194
there are individuals who are
so thankful for what we did.

00:22:01.194 --> 00:22:03.110
And then there are others
who have said, well,

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.630
you're really just wolves
in sheep's clothing.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.120
Or your sorry is too
late, it's not enough.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.840
And I get all of that.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.210
But the topic of sexuality
and the Bible isn't an issue.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.460
Or it's not some
problem we have to fix.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.400
Or it's not some conflict
that needs to be resolved.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.480
This is about people.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.230
It's about people created
by God, people loved by God,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:32.090
and people who long to belong
to a spiritual community.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.350
And what I've seen is that
so many people, especially

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.180
those within the LGBT
community, and I've

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.920
experienced this myself.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.230
And I think that 86%, I
think this applies to them.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.170
They've experienced
the model of church

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.070
or spiritual community
or a faith community

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.130
on a following pattern,
which I think is wrong.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.650
I call this, and this is a
section in my book as well,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.930
but there is a
way of church that

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.700
says the model is behave
and believe and belong.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.050
And so the idea goes like this.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.800
Some churches will
profess saying, you know,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.050
if you want to be a
part of our community,

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.950
you have to behave first.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.366
So you have to do
the right things

00:23:08.366 --> 00:23:09.800
and stop doing the wrong things.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.010
For some, if you're gay, well,
you need to pray the gay away.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.690
Or be celibate,
whatever it might be.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.052
And if you behave the
right way, well then next

00:23:18.052 --> 00:23:19.760
you have to believe
all the right things.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.250
So you need to believe
these things are a sin

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.810
and this is right
and this is wrong.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.800
You need to believe this about
our culture and this about God.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.919
And then if you behave
in the right way

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:31.460
and you believe all
the right things,

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.960
guess what, you can then belong
to a loving and accepting

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.330
community.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.020
But that's a complete fraud.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.870
It's not loving.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.814
It's completely conditional.

00:23:43.814 --> 00:23:45.230
It's loving with
strings attached.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.610
It's behavior modification.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.550
And in my opinion, as I've
studied the scriptures,

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.210
this is actually antithetical
to the way of Jesus

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.540
that I see in the Bible.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.710
A better model that
I've come to define

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.470
is belong, believe, and become.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.590
And so you belong
to a community where

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.130
it is a safe place
where anyone can belong.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.380
You don't have to believe yet.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.290
You can doubt, you
can just belong.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.260
You can be accepted.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.530
You can be known,
you can know others.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.500
You are warmly welcomed
into this environment.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.270
You are welcomed into the
journey that is happening,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.370
which is life.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.770
And in this space of
belonging, then you

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.050
can figure out what you believe.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.950
Maybe you doubt, maybe
you ask questions.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.320
Maybe you wrestle with things.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.240
Maybe you never come
to belief at all.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.330
It doesn't matter.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.630
But then if you do believe,
then there's this way to become,

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.220
your spirituality
helps you become

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.840
a different type of person.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.560
Or it helps you live
a life of flourishing.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.100
And that's of any type
of spirituality, right.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.490
Like it helps you flourish.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.990
And so for me, I
think it's better

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.880
to belong to a
community of love,

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.070
believe in the God
of love, and then you

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.670
become a person who
lives a life of love.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.700
Now one quick example
from the Bible.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.800
I won't spend too much
time on the Bible.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.500
But one of my favorite
characters in the Bible

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.790
is this guy named Thomas.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.470
He's also known as
doubting Thomas.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.090
I don't know how
many of you know

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.650
the story of doubting Thomas.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.110
But Thomas is this
character in the Bible.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.260
He's a follower of Jesus.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.740
And he only shows up six
times, three over which

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.650
are simply lists
of like his name.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.670
So three times it's like the
followers of Jesus were Thomas,

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.140
you know.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.309
Two times he's like
this-- he gets a bad rap,

00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:27.350
like the doubting Thomas.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.391
He's actually quite bold.

00:25:28.391 --> 00:25:30.620
So two times it's
things like Jesus says,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.890
we're going to go
down to Jerusalem.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.640
And Thomas is like,
I'm going with you!

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.979
I'll follow you!

00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:36.770
That's pretty bold.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.810
And then the second,
the other one

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.750
he says something very similar,
like I'll follow you to death.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.270
And then there's the famous
doubting Thomas scene.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.460
And in this scene, the
story goes like this.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.620
Jesus was executed.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.410
He died and he had been
raised from the dead.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.240
And the women and the disciples,
this group of men and women,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.960
are celebrating.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.930
Like our rabbi who we've
been following for three

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.540
years is no longer dead.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.110
Now Thomas does the most
human thing I think he does.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.450
And is like, nope.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.342
Like I think any of us would
do that if someone was like,

00:26:11.342 --> 00:26:12.800
our friend is raised
from the dead.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.450
Nope, didn't happen.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.380
That's crazy.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.190
You're all insane.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.380
And he says, I'm not going
to believe that until I

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.060
touch his wounds where
he was crucified,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.220
hung up on that cross.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.161
Until I touch his hands
and touch his side,

00:26:23.161 --> 00:26:24.410
I'm not going to believe this.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.576
So the story says this,
which is really interesting.

00:26:26.576 --> 00:26:28.760
It says a week goes by.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.380
And so for a whole
week, the disciples

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.376
are still celebrating.

00:26:31.376 --> 00:26:32.750
The followers of
Jesus were like,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.041
he's been raised from the dead.

00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:37.730
And Thomas is hanging out with
them like, nope, you all crazy,

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.330
you know.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.849
And then Jesus appears.

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:43.390
And the first thing Jesus does
is he says, peace be with you.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.348
Which I think is smart.

00:26:44.348 --> 00:26:46.180
Because if someone
raised from the dead

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.340
like showed up in this
room we'd all be like ah!

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.059
And he's like peace, calm
down, like chill, right.

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:52.600
So that's the first
thing Jesus says.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.010
That's my translation.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.460
And then he immediately
turns to Thomas.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:02.100
And he says Thomas,
put your hand here.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.840
Touch my side.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.374
Stop doubting, believe.

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:08.040
Now I think this is
a powerful sentence.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.040
Because he could have been
like, Thomas you're an idiot.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.320
For a whole week you
belonged to this community,

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.520
you didn't believe.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.570
He didn't.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.040
He didn't discipline.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.110
He said, come here,
come figure it out.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:25.050
And what happens is Thomas
then immediately worships God.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:26.430
He immediately worships God.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.060
And then we know that
eventually Thomas

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.140
brought the church and the
Christian faith to India.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.870
And then eventually was
martyred for his faith.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.750
So here is a man
for three years he

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.750
belonged to this community
of followers of Jesus.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.420
For three years he was
known in this community.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.090
And then other people were
believing these things

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.950
about Jesus, and he
didn't believe them.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.720
But eventually,
he came to belief.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.880
And then after that,
he, for some reason

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.620
got so passionate
that he actually

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.530
brought this message
all the way to India

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.610
and was willing to
die for his beliefs.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.520
So I think this is the model
that churches should be.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.230
When I was here in
Chicago, a group of us

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.370
started a small group.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.530
And this is a
similar story that's

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.230
more on a personal level.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.590
We started a small group
for gay and lesbian or trans

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.250
individuals.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.250
And there were about 12 or 15
people that were part of it,

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.490
a few heterosexuals, a couple
of people who were married.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.590
Some were not out
at all, so it was

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.200
like almost a very secretive
group that they were a part of.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.240
And so we started this community
basically to be a safe place.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.706
Where for many people,
they didn't feel safe

00:28:39.706 --> 00:28:41.330
in other parts of
the church community.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.520
So we started this Bible
study to care for one another

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.020
and read these
scriptures together.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.270
And so the first night we
kind of went around the room

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.320
and shared why we wanted
to be a part of this.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.730
And the last gentleman who
went, his name was Michael.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.467
And Michael had never
been to the church.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.050
He'd never been a
part of a community.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.527
I met him that night.

00:28:58.527 --> 00:28:59.610
He was the last one to go.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.776
And he said, you know, I've
been looking for a place

00:29:01.776 --> 00:29:04.590
where I can just
be me and breathe.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.481
And tonight I feel as if
I can finally breathe.

00:29:08.481 --> 00:29:11.090
And so this is what I
think life is all about.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.930
That it is creating spaces
where we can breathe,

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:19.490
where we can be fully known
and fully know others.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.420
And I think this
is especially true

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.490
among spiritual communities.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.890
That in the spiritual
life, the spiritual life

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:31.060
is about finding places to
breathe, to be yourself,

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.290
to be known by God.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.690
To let yourself have
that vulnerability

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.900
to be known by other
people, to be known by God,

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.550
to know people, to get
to know the Divine,

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.580
to be unashamed who you are,
and to know that no matter what,

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.290
you are deeply, deeply loved.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.760
Growing up, going
back to my dad,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.920
my dad used to always say Buds--

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.810
and yes, he calls me Buds.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.850
And still at 36
he calls me Buds.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:59.260
But he'd say Buds, life is
all about relationships.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.150
And it used to be just
this mantra he'd say.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.580
And it'd be like,
yeah, yeah, dad.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.617
Life is all about relationships.

00:30:04.617 --> 00:30:05.950
But I think he's onto something.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.680
That I think life is
all about relationships.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.380
There's a rabbi who said
when you don't know people,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.920
when you don't
know them, when you

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.336
don't have
relationship with them,

00:30:14.336 --> 00:30:16.720
it's easy to demonize
and dehumanize them.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.460
But when you do
know people, it's

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.930
almost impossible to
demonize and dehumanize them.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.840
And so lately, I've
seen how much people

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.860
want to be right more than they
want to be in relationship.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.820
I've been experiencing
that a lot in my life.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.524
And frankly, I don't find being
right as appealing anymore.

00:30:38.524 --> 00:30:40.690
I read a great quote actually
on my flight out here.

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:43.030
It said Christianity
isn't about being right,

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.980
it's about being loved.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.080
And I think in this
day and age, like

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.380
not just in the topic of
human sexuality and faith

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.510
and religion, but
in our culture,

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:57.050
in our political climate, many
of us don't know other people.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.340
And we isolate ourselves with
people that are just like us

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.680
or that look like us.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.400
And that we need to do a better
job of being in relationship

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.490
with other people.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.580
And I could be wrong
on this, maybe.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.260
I'm probably wrong about a lot.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.020
But I would rather be--

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.630
I'd rather be in
relationship with a diverse

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:21.100
and messy and awkward
and crazy group of people

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.620
who love one another
and care for one another

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.200
and welcome one another
and cherish one another

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.650
and honor one another and
allow one another the space

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.220
to breathe, even if that
means things are messy

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.510
and there's disagreements.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.400
I'd rather be in a relationship
with people than fight

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.930
to be right.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.470
I think I would
lay down, I think

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.380
I'd go to the floor on that one.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.250
Because I think life is
all about relationships.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.760
And when you truly know
people it changes everything.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.860
So let me just end with
one last thing as kind

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.370
of a pastoral word to
those who, especially you

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:04.570
who are here who might be a
part of the LGBTQ community.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.100
As a pastor and as a
Christian, I just first of all,

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.010
I want to apologize
for the way that you

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.370
have been hurt by people who
call themselves followers

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.630
of Jesus.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:21.370
I am sorry that there has been
pain caused to your hearts

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:26.170
and to your souls, and possibly
even physically to your body

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.140
by people who
consider themselves

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.840
followers of the God of love.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.630
I'm sorry that I was a part
of a system that demonized

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.900
and dehumanized the
LGBTQ community,

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.770
and the countless
times that I thought

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.220
it was better to remain
silent than to speak up.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.910
I'm sorry that so many continue
to believe that abstract ideas

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.810
about a community
and false ideas

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.330
about you, that they
do that rather than try

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.724
to be in relationship with you.

00:32:57.724 --> 00:32:59.140
I'm sorry that
there are preachers

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.990
who use the pulpit
where they should only

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.290
be talking about the God of
love to use it to condemn

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.270
you or people groups.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:11.080
And I'm sorry that people push
you away rather than embrace

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.920
you and create spaces where
you can simply breathe.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.640
So if there is any
inkling within your soul

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.310
somewhere interested
in the spiritual life,

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.190
I just want to encourage
you to keep going.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:28.420
Don't give up on God,
because God's followers

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.730
didn't reflect the God of love.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.560
And I would say, don't
give up on Jesus.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.740
Because Jesus'
followers, some of them

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.210
might not have been
very Jesus like.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.560
There is always space for you
and for me around the table

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.150
that God invites us to.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.400
There's always a place for us.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.650
There's always a place
for us to find a place

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.170
where we can breathe.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.970
And I would say this, especially
to the LGBT community.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.110
We, as Christians, don't
deserve your forgiveness

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.470
for some of the things that have
been said in the name of God.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.440
But I ask that you
would be gracious to us.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.240
I ask that you would
treat us the way you

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.670
wish we first had treated you.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:11.047
Because we have a lot
to learn from you.

00:34:11.047 --> 00:34:11.880
So that's all I got.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.389
So with that, I'm going to open
it up to Phillip and questions

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.894
and we'll keep the
dialogue going.

00:34:17.894 --> 00:34:18.500
So thanks.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.120
PHILLIP KNOLL: Thank you.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.949
All right.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.760
Well, thanks.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.260
Cool.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:23.859
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:25.025
You want to keep the podium?

00:34:25.025 --> 00:34:26.020
All right.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.679
All right, hello.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.420
OK, so I know we had a similar
talk like this in New York.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.380
And I have a couple of questions
that I thought were pertinent.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.129
I also want to open
it up to the audience,

00:34:36.129 --> 00:34:37.199
but I'll start it off.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:41.639
So there's a lot
probably of experiences

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.210
that you've had since
you wrote the book.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.530
So can you kind
of share like what

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.929
you think was the most poignant
or the best thing that's

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:51.300
come out of having
written this and sort

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.550
of the impact on your life
or the lives of others?

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.070
And how's that been for
you since you've done it?

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:56.903
NATHAN ALBERT: Yeah.

00:34:56.903 --> 00:35:00.480
I've gotten-- people love
it and people hate it.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.910
So it's really interesting.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.140
I think probably the most--

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.260
the feedback that I've
gotten best from people

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.900
have been parents
of gay children

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.600
that have read it
that have thanked me

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.360
for just voicing some things
that they needed to hear.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.880
And I have a whole section
in the book directed

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.320
towards parents who
have gay children.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.320
And so that's a theme
that comes up in the book.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.840
So that's always
been a feedback.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.330
And I have a bunch
of friends that

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.480
appear in the book,
many of whom are gay.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.900
And they've loved the book.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.050
So that's just encouraging.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:43.880
I have a student in Rhode Island
who, she is reading the book.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.120
She's in like eighth grade.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.030
She came out to me as pansexual.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.630
And she said that the
book is giving her

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.650
a renewed sense of faith.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:53.900
So I think that's pretty cool.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.090
I've also had people
who think I'm a heretic

00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:00.320
and have written horrific
things about me and letters.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:04.090
And so that's really fun.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.260
And I enjoy that.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:06.760
I really do.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.384
PHILLIP KNOLL: Yes,
so I guess that was

00:36:08.384 --> 00:36:09.520
one of the things I had.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:09.990
NATHAN ALBERT: A follow up?

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.580
PHILLIP KNOLL: A follow up, yes.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.220
So you said people had
questioned your own sexuality,

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.500
not just because you were
involved in musical theater,

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.360
I presume, but
because you're taking

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.620
a kind of unifying stance
on human sexuality.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.810
And you know, what
kind of-- have there

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.300
been negative repercussions
or feedback like that you've

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.460
gotten from within the
religious community,

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.920
from within LGBTQ community.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.420
I mean, how has that been?

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.050
NATHAN ALBERT: Yeah.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.080
So one of the things
I do in the book

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.480
that I think confuses
people, is especially

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.600
in the section on
the Bible, I lay out

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.280
a whole spectrum of belief.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.100
And what I don't do is
say you need to believe

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.300
one side or the other.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.620
And I'm intentional in that.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.650
Because every book I've read
says, hey, if you believe this,

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.630
you're a bigot and a homophobe.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.920
You need to believe this.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.360
And then other
books say if you're

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.150
like progressive and
really open and affirming,

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.870
you're like this crazy liberal,
and you need to believe this.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.710
And I don't think any
of that is helpful.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.251
So what I did is I
laid it out there.

00:37:08.251 --> 00:37:10.640
And then I was like, you got
to figure it out yourself.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.140
Good luck.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.070
You're all adults.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:16.060
Like you should be able to
like figure out what you think.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.520
But that actually bothers
a lot of people, right.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:23.710
Because some are saying well,
because you didn't say this,

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.050
it means you must believe this.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.060
Which means you're like that.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.340
And I'm like oh, no, that
didn't-- no, not true at all.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.440
Or vice versa.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:37.030
Whether it's like when we
did the pride parade, right,

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.940
like some people
said, well, they're

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.820
wolves in sheep's
clothing, right.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.230
So you're Christians,
but you still

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.840
believe this about sexuality.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.152
So really you're out to get us.

00:37:48.152 --> 00:37:49.110
And you're tricking us.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.500
So I think that's happened.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.090
And yeah, other
people, repercussions.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:00.010
There have been quite a few.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.500
But I guess it comes
with the terrain.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.770
I guess it's a heated, yeah,
it's heated for people.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.550
And I think some
people, when they're

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:14.530
challenged in a new way of
thinking, rather than seeing it

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.080
as an opportunity for
growth, it becomes a threat.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.040
And so for me in this
process, this isn't--

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.790
I've never been
threatened in any of this.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:22.870
I think this is exciting.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.220
Like I'm learning something new.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.250
Or I never knew those
Greek words in the Bible

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.690
could be translated this way.

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.644
In the English it
always says this.

00:38:30.644 --> 00:38:32.060
Oh, maybe it means
something else.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.350
Like that's an exciting process
for me of growth and learning.

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:40.514
Rather than a oh, I'm afraid of
what that might mean, you know.

00:38:40.514 --> 00:38:41.680
PHILLIP KNOLL: Right, right.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.885
Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:42.885 --> 00:38:45.010
I want to like, don't be
shy in the audience, also.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.505
If you have a question come
up to the mic, no trouble.

00:38:48.505 --> 00:38:50.630
Nothing on the Dory yet,
if anyone's out there that

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.950
wants to Dory, that's cool too.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:52.150
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.900
NATHAN ALBERT: Hi.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks for you talk.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.460
So I guess I just have
a question about--

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.170
I totally understand
like your point of view.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:04.210
And I completely agree with
all the things you've said.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.180
I guess my question for you
is have you ever struggled

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.610
with then why religion at all?

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.400
Like you can have
all of these things

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.660
without being a Christian or
a Baptist or anything, right.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.590
You can live as an atheist
a more Christian life

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.470
than many Christians are.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.520
As you've sort of explored this
and through your education ever

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.870
struggled with like
your faith as you've

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.730
explored this and
made it your career

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.815
and sort of like just how
this all came about for you?

00:39:36.815 --> 00:39:37.606
NATHAN ALBERT: Yup.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.320
Yeah.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.230
I mean, we're trying to--

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:49.126
the spiritual life we're
trying to wrap our minds

00:39:49.126 --> 00:39:50.500
around something
that we consider

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:56.650
to be divine, or really
completely or not completely

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.570
fathomable.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:04.260
So I think that innately brings
doubt and questions and--

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:04.790
yeah.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:11.040
But I've become convinced
that the way of Jesus

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.870
is really a beautiful
way to live.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.310
And so for me, there
are other religions

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:22.830
that I think there are
beautiful ways to live.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:28.300
And I love the way of Jesus
and following that way.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.870
Yes, so you're right.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:32.452
Like I do think there are--

00:40:32.452 --> 00:40:34.910
I just think Christians have
got to get their act together.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:39.570
You know, like when an atheist
lives a better Christian life,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:43.280
whatever that might mean,
than Christians, well,

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.240
it just makes you question what
is the definition of Christian

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:47.870
then.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.245
AUDIENCE: Right,
or why religion.

00:40:49.245 --> 00:40:51.170
NATHAN ALBERT: Or why, yeah.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.400
But I think the pursuit of--

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.800
yeah, the pursuit
of spiritual things

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:03.830
is like searching for
treasure, I guess.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.660
And I'm not sure that
answers your question.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.057
But yeah, I doubt.

00:41:09.057 --> 00:41:10.140
And I think that's a part.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:17.500
I think doubt is a part of
faith, so any faith tradition.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.630
Other questions?

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.890
Whoa.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:23.761
AUDIENCE: Hey man, thanks
so much for sharing.

00:41:23.761 --> 00:41:28.600
So in your journey, what have
been some of the highest peaks

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.760
and then what have been
some of the lowest lows

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.370
as you have kind of sought
to live in the tension?

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:36.040
And then what have been
some of the surprises

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.524
on either the upside
or the downside?

00:41:38.524 --> 00:41:39.760
NATHAN ALBERT: Hmm.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.870
Wow.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:41.950
Good question.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.710
All right, the highs, the
lows, and some surprises.

00:41:48.034 --> 00:41:48.534
Um.

00:41:52.517 --> 00:41:54.750
AUDIENCE: And the highs
can be totally superfluous.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:56.708
PHILLIP KNOLL: They can
be totally superfluous.

00:41:56.708 --> 00:41:57.990
NATHAN ALBERT: OK.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:05.180
The lows, I'm amazed that
people are willing to give up

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.627
relationship or friendship
because they disagree

00:42:08.627 --> 00:42:09.585
with the way you think.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.350
So I've had some--

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.860
I've had some people
that I don't know say

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:26.230
some of the meanest things
about me via email and letters

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:36.480
to communities or social
media that like you would--

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.930
you just shouldn't
say to someone's face.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.290
Like it's just, it's crazy.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:46.230
And so I think that always
catches me by surprise.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.350
Oh, I thought you were
like a decent human being.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:52.160
The things coming out of
your mouth right now, OK.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.900
And I don't know how to--

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.730
and I don't know how to
not take that personally.

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:06.950
So I am still learning how to
get some negative feedback.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.530
Like oh, you're
this type of person,

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:12.700
and not let that
affect me as a person.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:17.090
There's a speaker I know who
talks about that sometimes you

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:21.770
can die from paper cuts.

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.950
And so sometimes I feel as
if I get a lot of paper cuts.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:30.041
And eventually I could bleed
to death from paper cuts.

00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:32.040
So it's an image that
I've always wrestled with.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.867
So I think that's
some of the lows.

00:43:34.867 --> 00:43:36.200
I think some of the highs have--

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:49.529
I guess it's seeing
people like Michael who

00:43:49.529 --> 00:43:51.820
said I've been looking for
a place where I can breathe.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.280
Like all we did was
open up our home.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:59.080
And someone who had
such like a journey

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.480
that we don't even know about.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:06.460
It was like a space where
he could just like breathe.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:12.440
Those type of moments I think
are some of the coolest ones.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.770
Or hearing of you
know, someone who

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:21.730
reconciled with their parents
after years of you know,

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.736
turmoil.

00:44:23.736 --> 00:44:26.110
I think some of the surprises
would be some of the people

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:27.276
I get to meet along the way.

00:44:27.276 --> 00:44:30.460
So like doing Google
Talks, this is awesome.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.890
But I never thought I'd ever get
to do this here or in New York.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.640
But getting to meet
people along the way

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.120
and to learn like there is
something that unites us

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.550
as just as humans like
that can connect us.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.650
And so that I think has been
some of the surprises for me.

00:44:50.887 --> 00:44:51.386
Others?

00:44:54.134 --> 00:44:56.050
PHILLIP KNOLL: So I've
got a question on that.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:56.480
NATHAN ALBERT: Great.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.650
PHILLIP KNOLL: So you talked
a little bit about doubt,

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.524
and you talked earlier
about doubting Thomas.

00:44:59.524 --> 00:45:05.571
And that stay with it aspect
of it kind of struck me.

00:45:05.571 --> 00:45:07.070
And I know when we
were talking over

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.160
lunch we talked a little bit
about something you mentioned

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.740
also, which was who is the
other and that concept of trying

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:18.920
to work past that abstract
notion of the other person,

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.150
the other group, or the other
sort of ideology or philosophy.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.890
So I'm wondering
what kind of advice

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:28.520
do you have regarding
any perceived

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:32.810
divide or actual divide to
stay with it for Christians,

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:35.210
for LGBTQ individuals.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:39.440
I mean, how to stay with it,
how to work past that doubt.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.730
NATHAN ALBERT: I
would say that to stay

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:49.930
with it, what comes often
past the bend of stay

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.780
with it can be
reconciliation, which

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.930
is a really beautiful thing.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.660
And I see this best with
gay children and parents.

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.260
And I often say to
many of my gay friends

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.540
who when they come out to
their parents, what happens

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.760
is a shift happens.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.135
Where they become-- and we
talked a little bit about this

00:46:09.135 --> 00:46:10.310
at lunch.

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:12.490
Where they become the
parent and the parents

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.900
act like little children.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.090
So it's like my son is gay?

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:16.840
What?

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.210
And they bang and they
pout and they stomp around,

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.150
like they act like little
kids having a temper tantrum.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.950
And in that moment,
I always encourage

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.790
that the child
becomes the parent,

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:31.540
and has to parent that
parent through the process,

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.480
through this process.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.930
And every time that
I've seen that happen,

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:44.020
it has always ended in a
positive and good relationship.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:46.700
And now I think there are times
where ending relationships are

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.200
important.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.390
Where they become abusive and
emotionally or spiritually,

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:52.780
physically abusive,
there's no doubt about it

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.540
that certain
relationships need to end.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.590
So I'm not saying that.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:02.460
But I think around that
bend comes a reconciliation

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.950
and a type of relationship
that just is better

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.390
than what it was even before.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:11.590
So I think that's
one of the glimpses

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.650
of if you stay with it.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.920
And you know, the whole it
gets better campaign that

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.050
started years ago, I
don't know of anyone

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:24.472
that disagrees with that.

00:47:24.472 --> 00:47:26.680
PHILLIP KNOLL: We have such
conciliatory notions here

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.320
in Chicago, must be.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.710
A Chicagoan started that, right?

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:30.960
NATHAN ALBERT: I know, I know.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.334
So man, Chicago is the hub of
all things amazing, basically.

00:47:34.334 --> 00:47:35.750
PHILLIP KNOLL: I
like to think so.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.264
NATHAN ALBERT: Yeah.

00:47:40.264 --> 00:47:41.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.860
Because I grew up in a
Catholic family, and I've

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.220
seen this before in like family
gatherings and everything.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.950
Where I have some relatives
that aren't necessarily

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:53.700
accepting of the
LGBTQ community.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.350
They are never really outwardly
aggressive towards it,

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.760
but they will say
things that are

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.760
veiled with their kind
of aversion to it.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.620
And I'm always kind
of on the borderline

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.380
of how do you address,
how do you approach that?

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.940
Because at times,
it's like maybe I

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.106
don't say anything because
it's not worth disrupting

00:48:09.106 --> 00:48:10.390
this event, right.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.280
But how would you
recommend going

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.340
talking to friends and
families where you know,

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.070
they're not on the spectrum
of chanting at a gay pride

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.630
parade about the
evils, but you know

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:22.630
that it's rooted in them
that they have a belief

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.780
that it is wrong.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.370
So how do you approach that?

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.710
NATHAN ALBERT: Yeah.

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.060
I think it needs to
be addressed, right.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:35.260
So you know, it almost
becomes a joke in our culture

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.240
that every Thanksgiving
meal you're

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.940
going to have the crazy uncle
who's homophobic and racist.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.470
And he's going to
say some things.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.636
And you all are going to
like kind of roll your eyes

00:48:43.636 --> 00:48:45.760
and be like, oh, uncle.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.250
But the thing is,
that individual

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:51.770
might have kids and raise
their kids in the same way.

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:54.760
So I don't think we
have the option anymore

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.680
to not speak out.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.840
And I don't mean like
becoming like confrontational.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:06.570
Simply like, oh, you can't say
that racist comment anymore.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.580
And saying it at the table.

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:09.950
Those things have to stop.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:13.710
So you can't joke about
that community anymore

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:16.320
like that, not at this table.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.300
And I think that
it needs to stop.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.770
And I think this is not
just on human sexuality,

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.750
but I think it's
on race, our views

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:29.104
of like all that's
going on in our culture

00:49:29.104 --> 00:49:31.520
right now with immigration
reform or whatever it might be.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.100
Like these are comments that
come up in all sorts of ways.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.940
And there needs
to be the boldness

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.390
of saying no, you just--

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.340
dad, you can't,
you can't say that.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:42.965
You just don't.

00:49:42.965 --> 00:49:43.800
Well, why not?

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.300
You can't.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.710
And you know, I haven't
always done that either.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:56.290
But I think that it takes
a boldness within ourselves

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:01.107
to start those conversations.

00:50:01.107 --> 00:50:01.940
PHILLIP KNOLL: Cool.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.085
So we got two minutes left.

00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:05.210
NATHAN ALBERT: Two minutes.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.350
PHILLIP KNOLL: I'd love to
ask you something really

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:08.933
challenging, which is basically
how do we save the world then?

00:50:08.933 --> 00:50:10.909
Like so I think you--

00:50:10.909 --> 00:50:12.200
yeah, yeah, no big deal, right.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:12.719
No pressure.

00:50:12.719 --> 00:50:14.510
No, but I've been
thinking about it, right.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:17.090
So the kind of
things you're saying

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.300
are about how do you
look at big conflicts

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.890
and big ideological positions
that seem immovable or seem

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:25.940
intractable.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.910
And you've talked on
specter not just beyond you

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:30.937
know religion or
human sexuality,

00:50:30.937 --> 00:50:33.020
but you talked a little
bit about economic justice

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.311
in your book and in your talks.

00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:36.350
You talked about other faiths.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.140
And you know,
racial issues, a lot

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.744
of disparities in the world.

00:50:40.744 --> 00:50:42.410
You know, is there
something that you've

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.509
learned that people
can take from this talk

00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:46.550
and apply in their lives?

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.360
Or how do you approach, you
know, a challenge like that?

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.400
What can we do
that you've learned

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.439
to try to make the world
better with your experiences?

00:50:55.439 --> 00:50:56.230
NATHAN ALBERT: Wow.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:02.839
This answer is probably
going to fail us all.

00:51:02.839 --> 00:51:03.630
PHILLIP KNOLL: Nah.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.120
NATHAN ALBERT: I guess,
I'm in this season where

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:16.740
I am more and more intrigued
by the diversity of humanity

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:22.810
and getting to know people
that are so different than me.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:27.010
So I don't know, like
lately I've actually

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:28.410
been on like a Catholic kick.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.784
Where I've been like reading
all these Catholic authors.

00:51:30.784 --> 00:51:32.200
And they always
talk about the way

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.950
they connect God is
like totally different

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.270
than I've ever thought of.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:37.630
It's like all about
union with the Divine.

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.150
And I'm like, that's cool.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.390
I kind of want that.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:45.820
And my friends in different--

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.310
I'm a part of a clergy
group that we're

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:51.670
like a smattering of like
Unitarian Universalists

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:57.249
and imams, Muslims and
rabbis and Lutherans.

00:51:57.249 --> 00:51:59.290
And we get together every
month and like hang out

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.248
and eat meals and talk.

00:52:00.248 --> 00:52:03.560
And it's like the
coolest thing ever.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.890
So I guess I think
the importance

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:07.420
of diversity of relationship.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.990
Or when we are in a culture that
we de-friend people on social

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:14.230
media because of their views
or whatever, that actually we--

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.510
I think we actually need
some of those people

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:21.290
in our lives to learn about
them and about ourselves.

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:23.230
And so we break down
some of the stereotypes

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:29.260
and we move from like abstract
ideas to the humanity that

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:30.880
unites all people.

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.120
I guess, I don't know if that
would really save the world,

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.030
because some days I really
think the world is--

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:38.350
oh man, it's jacked up.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.240
But, yeah.

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.670
And then that I
think hopefully then

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:52.810
empowers us to pursue justice
and to create changes that

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:56.020
will make the world better.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.670
PHILLIP KNOLL:
Humanity and justice.

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.110
Can we all get behind that?

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:00.400
NATHAN ALBERT: I hope.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:00.790
PHILLIP KNOLL: All right.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:02.800
Well hey, I want to thank
you very much for coming out.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.716
Thank you for all you.

00:53:03.716 --> 00:53:05.484
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.400
And for your attention.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:12.557
So for everyone who's going to
be sticking around afterwards,

00:53:12.557 --> 00:53:14.140
Nathan's got some
books, like we said.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.127
He'll be around for a
little bit after this.

00:53:16.127 --> 00:53:17.710
It is pride week,
so we're going to be

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.930
having a very special
gathering later

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.470
on at [INAUDIBLE] on rooftop.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.550
And also a pride happy
hour up in Lake View.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.190
If anyone interested, come to
me, I'll tell you about it.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:28.820
Nathan, thank you
so much for coming.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:29.486
It's been great.

00:53:29.486 --> 00:53:30.980
NATHAN ALBERT:
Yeah, thanks guys.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.305
Nice job.

00:53:31.305 --> 00:53:32.263
PHILLIP KNOLL: You too.

00:53:32.263 --> 00:53:35.590
[APPLAUSE]
