00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:32.010
- We are the paradoxical ape, bi-pedal,
naked, large brain, long the master of

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:40.170
fire, tools and language, but still trying
to understand ourselves. Aware that death

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:51.142
is inevitable yet filled with optimism. We
grow up slowly. We hand down knowledge. We

00:00:51.142 --> 00:00:59.590
empathize and deceive. We shake the future
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.590
CARTA brings together experts from diverse
disciplines to exchange insights on who we

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.290
are and how we got here. An exploration
made possible by the generosity of humans

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.953
like you.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.860
- [Mark] Before I start you'll notice that
there are actually two speakers here. I'm

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.880
going to speak out of both sides of my
mouth. The other speaker listed here is

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.597
Carol Padden who was summoned to
Sacramento in her deaconal duties.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:48.186
And so, Carol asked me to
present the work.

00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:52.500
Carol and I have
known each other since she was a toddler

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.490
and we've been doing this. This particular
work is joint work of a large number of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.510
people spread around the world and I
happen to be the other member of this

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.190
group present here and so I've been given
this honor. Here are some of the other

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.640
places. There's UCSD here of course, Tufts
University in Boston, and University of

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:24.050
Haifa in Israel. If you look very
carefully, you can see me. Let me see. In

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.290
any case, you could see a head behind the
van. My job for the last 15 years has been

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:41.570
to drive the van because that's a man's
job and that's what I do. Okay. I've

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.800
talked very briefly about sign languages
of the world. First really most important

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.230
thing is that there is no single universal
sign language. There are many sign

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.390
languages and we've actually learned a
little bit about Nicaraguan sign language.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.950
Sign languages in general are young
languages.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.840
They're usually small languages. There are
some very large ones like American sign

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.290
language but American sign language or
Japanese sign language, those are actually

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.920
atypical in terms of their size. What are
these languages used for? Well, they're

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.550
used for social communication like any
other language. Most sign languages are

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.840
actually quite young. The ones we're going
to be talking about are very new and were

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.060
actually created spontaneously in much the
same way as Nicaraguan sign language.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.130
Others, the oldest sign language for which
we have actual records is French sign

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.060
language from which American sign language
comes. But we actually have records from

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.520
classical Greek times indicating that
people were signing back then and there is

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.600
a wonderful picture that I don't have here
of a Greek vase that seems to indicate

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.690
people signing thousands of years ago.
Most sign languages are fairly small

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.860
languages and those are the ones that
we're going to be kind of concentrating on

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.260
here. We're also interested in new sign
languages, sign languages that are

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.330
emerging, and this is very much within the
spirit of what we're talking about here.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.320
You can actually watch languages evolve.
If you can't watch language as a human

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.310
ability evolve but individual languages
you can actually watch. Now, these new

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:41.160
sign languages they're created under a
variety of conditions, villages, schools,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.280
wherever deaf people can find each other
they will pretty much create a sign

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.190
language. And the patterns that how these
sign languages are transmitted, vary quite

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.830
widely among each other. But what really
matters is that sign languages usually

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.560
start off as being iconic.
So we're very much within some of the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.000
stuff that Kenny showed you, where you
start off with some sort of iconic

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.540
patterns. Eventually they become less
iconic and this is something I could show

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.220
you examples of later. It's really quite
wonderful. But they are all built on the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.260
resources of the body, so people have a
body and they use this physical body in

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.550
order to communicate visually with one
another. All right. Sign languages of the

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.500
world, there are many and there are many
different types. Home sign, this is the

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.330
language of the individual who grows up in
a household where everyone else is

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:52.300
hearing. There are family sign languages
a case that's just emerged recently. It's

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.730
something that it's called natural sign
language. It's just a sign language that

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.070
is grown up in Nepal, among a community of
people. It's called natural because it

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:10.240
grew up by itself, not under any kind of
forced circumstances. Village sign

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.460
languages, that's a very recent, I'd
say the last 20 years or so people have

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.610
begun interested in that and that our
work basically is we work with village

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.530
sign languages. And then, of course, the
Nicaraguan sign language which grew up in

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.970
a near urban environment but which is also
very new. The point is there are these

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:42.100
many, many different kinds of sign
languages. So our question is, well, how

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.190
did they get that way? We know what
they're for and we know quite vividly as

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.490
we've seen examples already. These people
can communicate quite well but how did

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:59.230
they get there? And how did they get there
so quickly? Even the youngest sign

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.180
languages have grammatical categories.
They have fairly well defined word orders.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:16.170
They have modifiers, these kind of
trappings of fully evolved sign languages.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:21.140
So how did they get there? Well, the way
they get there is basically as we said by

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:29.520
using the body and originally by using the
body in iconic ways. Now I'm going to be

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:37.150
talking to you about a very, very small
type of organization but I think it is

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:45.720
emblematic of how sign languages can use
iconic patterns to organize themselves.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:52.830
Okay. So we have to make a distinction
between two different types of iconicity.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:59.550
I'll get to you in a second how that
works. So, what we're going to do is we're

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.570
kind of combining I think two of the
source of presentations that you've seen

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:10.520
here. We're going to be looking at
gesturers, non-signing hearing gestures,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:19.896
and we're going to compare what their
gestures look like with the signs of

00:09:19.896 --> 00:09:27.320
signers of new sign languages. In this
particular test, we're going to

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.310
concentrate on a fairly narrow task in
which we ask people, both hearing

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:39.265
gesturers and signers, to identify objects
in a picture task. So we show them a

00:09:39.265 --> 00:09:45.888
picture and then we just ask them to
describe that picture. For the hearing

00:09:45.888 --> 00:09:51.535
people we just say, "Please gesture." Do
not speak. And for the signers we just ask

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:58.163
them to sign the thing for us. Okay, so
that's the test. We showed them pictures

00:09:58.163 --> 00:10:01.821
of tools and you'll see why it's
important.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.210
We vary the number of tools so they don't
worry about whether the task, we kind of

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:12.330
are distracting them in a way. So they
think we care about how many but we don't

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:18.280
really care about how many. We just care
about what it is. All right. Now, very

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.070
important point. We're going to
distinguish two types of iconicity. The

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.690
first we're calling here imagistic
iconicity and that is simply to depict

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:35.050
something. But what we're really
interested in is patterned iconicity and

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.700
this is again within the spirit of what
you've seen so far today. The point is

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:47.480
that when languages emerge, patterns
emerge, right? So we're interested in the

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.520
emergence of patterns. We'll see here that
this is a very surprising pattern that's

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:58.190
going to emerge here and it's very small.
It's not a big pattern, just a small

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:06.130
pattern. But I hope you'll see that it's a
pretty cool pattern. Okay, all right. So,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:13.430
what we're going to show you is we show a
picture of three paintbrushes and we asked

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:22.144
UCSD undergraduates to depict those in
gesture.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.770
Now you could see what they're depicting
is how the hand holds the object, that's

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:49.980
what they're doing, right? So these are
handling. They're not very well dressed

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.229
but we'll have to ignore that.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.929
Your basic UCSD undergraduates.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.340
This guy is quite animated. All right. So
everybody sees what they do. Now what

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:20.210
we're going to do is we're going to show
you the same task except these are young

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:25.390
signers of Al-Sayyid Bedouin sign language
which we have talked about at previous

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:34.300
CARTA meetings. This is a brand new sign
language that was created in an

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.450
isolated Bedouin village by a population
initially of four siblings. This is a

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:48.100
village with a very high rate of recessive
deafness. Okay. And you're going to see a

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.760
big difference. What you're going to see
is that these people just don't depict how

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:59.460
you handle the object but they actually
show what the shape of this tool is,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:06.520
right? All of them. And by the way, we
haven't selected this. This is what they

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:20.350
do. People of different ages. Oh, let me
ask a question. Did anybody notice

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:27.520
the word order difference between the two
populations? Right. So the UCSD

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:33.850
undergraduates do the number first and
then the thing and the Bedouin signers do

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.960
the thing first and then the numbers. So
they actually have a different word order

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.740
which I think is very cool. That's the
sort of thing linguists think is cool,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:52.570
right? Okay. So we have these two terms.
We have this term handling to talk about

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:58.250
what people are doing and then we have
this term instrument to talk about showing

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.870
the actual thing. So what we're going to
show you is there's actually a difference

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.020
between the two groups.
Basically, the gesturers concentrate on

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:13.430
simply the handling, how you use it
whereas the signers will depict this as an

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.160
instrumentin other words they show you how
you use it but they're most interested how

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:27.630
to depict what the thing is. Okay. All
right. And we're looking at this in terms

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:37.110
of a pattern of iconicity that these
things share. Okay. All right. And you can

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:43.430
see this, actually not just across
communities but even within a

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:53.500
community. So what we have here is a
hearing Bedouin gesturer and he will tend

00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:02.000
to use the handling whereas the deaf
member of the same community will also

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:12.970
depict the object as an instrument.
Handling versus instrument. Okay. Now,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:19.930
question is do we get differences across
groups? And that is of course what

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:25.930
happens. So here are hearing Americans.
They are overwhelmingly handling, hearing

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:32.120
Bedouins show almost the same
distribution. Here is the Bedouin signers,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:40.690
right? The opposite. And guess what, we
get the almost the same pattern for

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:49.660
American sign language. So hearing
gesturers concentrate on handling whereas

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.270
the deaf signers concentrate on the
instruments. And again we've given you the

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:01.010
same graph but in a slightly different
format to see how this works.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:09.610
Okay. Now I'm going to show you another
experiment that actually I think gives you

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:18.060
maybe a slightly more subtle insight into
how all of this works. So what we do in

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:26.640
this experiment is we compare responses to
pictures with responses to video clips. By

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.390
the way, just a small autobiographical
point here, we used to use pictures all

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.140
the time when we first went into the
Bedouin village. We would just show people

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.890
pictures and the older Bedouin signers
really had no idea what to do. And we

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.730
thought that, "Well, it's just a picture.
Doesn't everybody know how to name a

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.760
picture? I mean, after all, you do that at
first grade." And then it suddenly

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:55.160
emerged. "Duh, first grade. These people
never got to first grade." It turns out

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.940
that picture naming is a learned kind of
task. There's nothing natural about naming

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.130
pictures. People living out there in the
wild don't have pictures that they could

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:14.990
point at. So this was really a lesson
a cross-cultural lesson to us. We were

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:20.640
interested in whether simply showing
people a static picture versus showing

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:26.230
people a video would have an effect. And
of course it did, otherwise we wouldn't

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:32.850
bother to show it to you, right? Okay. So
this is what we showed people. So here is

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:45.100
simply a brush and here is a video clip of
somebody using the brush. Everybody sees

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:51.510
that? Okay. And we compare people's
responses to those and it is of course

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:58.230
actually what you might expect. So when
you show people a video, even gesturers,

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:08.830
they're much more likely to use handling.
But when you show gesturers a picture then

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:15.770
they are much more likely to use
instruments. Now a little bit of tortured

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:25.080
reasoning here, but the fact that they
were responding so overwhelmingly to the

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.450
handling response, the gesturers were
responding so overwhelmingly to the

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:36.470
handling response even with the pictures
shows you that there is this major

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:44.660
difference between how the gesturers are
organizing their signal and how the

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:52.410
signers are organizing their symbol. So
what we see is that there is this

00:18:52.590 --> 00:19:00.670
difference, right? That it's been somehow
conventionalized and amplified in this one

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:09.360
sign language which is the Bedouin sign
language and even more so in the sign

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.520
language, in American sign language. I'm
not going to talk about it here, but it

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.080
turns out that when you look at other sign
languages, we looked at Israeli sign

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.080
language, it doesn't work that way. So I
think what's going on is that signers pick

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:28.270
up, they pick up on these patterns this is
what we've seen before in earlier

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:33.380
presentations. They're picking up on these
patterns and what matters more is the

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.040
consistency of the abstract underlying
pattern. This is a very abstract notion of

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:47.868
handling versus also depicting the
instrument that they are picking up on.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.910
And by the way, when you show people
pieces of fruit, this doesn't happen

00:19:53.090 --> 00:20:00.740
because of course pieces of fruit they're
not instruments, at least not usually.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:08.870
Okay. All right. I think what's the one
takeaway lesson that is really important

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:14.720
is that people have a drive to
communicate. We've talked about this. They

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.660
have a drive to share which Tecumseh Fitch
coined this wonderful German word which is

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:27.430
mitteilungsbedürfnis which only in German,
right? But it basically means the need to

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:34.090
share. And what we're seeing in all of
these cases is that you can increase the

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:39.620
power of your sharing by organizing your
system and that's what is going on here.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.286
So, thank you, and Carol thanks you as
well.

♪ [music] ♪

00:20:53.170 --> 00:21:05.230
- [David] The basic problem I address here
is one of how did languages come to do

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:13.500
what they do in terms of taking small
meaningless units and combining them to

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:21.550
make meaningful words. So using some
English examples, sat, sit, sad. Each time

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:29.260
I change one of the sounds we get a
different word. Sat, bat, fat, same thing.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:37.480
So what I'm going to argue for is that
this is a commentatorial system and by

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:46.430
looking at sign language evidence, we can
see what things are like in some ways

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:57.890
before such a system evolves and get some
clues about how such a system evolves. I'm

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:03.860
going to be using primarily data from
American Sign Language and a lot of people

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.910
when they see signs they say, "Oh, it's
all iconic." And

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:16.820
a lot of the signs look iconic i.e. that
you could guess the meaning from seeing

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:27.810
the sign. So for example, drink, bird,
house, all of those you can get a pretty

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:35.040
good idea of the meaning from the sign
itself. However, those look like, they

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:41.930
look like gestures. You're gesturing
something about the meaning. But really in

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:50.710
a mature sign language like American Sign
Language, it has the same type of

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:58.780
combinatoriality within the word that I
illustrated with those examples from

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:07.420
English. And the signs consists of smaller
parts combined in different ways to

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.660
produce different signs with different
meanings. To find out what these smaller

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:21.080
parts are, we have to find examples of
signs that differ in only one respect. And

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.970
I'm going to show you some examples now
where we can identify the smaller parts of

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:32.520
the signs by comparing signs that differ
in only one respect. And at the same time

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.130
be illustrating a second point that in
most you cases you cannot guess the

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:44.730
meaning from seeing the sign if you don't
already know the language. So first, I'll

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:55.670
show some signs that differ only in
handshake versus, versus. And unless you

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.930
know the language you probably don't know
that this means change, this means

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:08.330
translate, and this means interpret.
Similarly, bird which I showed you, print

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:18.260
or publish, 20. These show that the place
of articulation, there'll be a lot of that

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.870
later, makes a difference. So bird
articulated the edge of the lip, print or

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:39.360
publish on the other hand. And signs can
differ only in movement, name, short,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:46.620
knife, egg. All of those I don't think you
would guess the meaning from seeing them

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.950
the first time and illustrate how signs
can differ in movement. And we'll

00:24:52.130 --> 00:25:00.920
concentrate on these three things. So each
sign consists of a hand shape, a place of

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.710
articulation, and a movement. There's also
sometimes orientation plays a role. I will

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:14.180
set those cases aside since they won't be
essential to the points that are made

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:21.380
here. Each sign language has an inventory
of hand shapes, places of articulation,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:29.410
and movements, and it's a combinatorial
phonological system that puts them

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:37.430
together yielding different signs with
different meanings. Some signs are fully

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:47.320
iconic. So bird, all of its smaller parts
which I'll call formatives, all of its

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:55.760
formatives contribute to the iconicity.
The hand shape is L, the movement the

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:02.500
index touches the thumb twice, place of
articulation, P.O.A. is at the edge of

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.740
the lip.
And all three of those contribute to the

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.730
iconicity and bird shares hand shape and
movement as I showed you before with

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:20.990
print/publish, or 20. And the place of
articulation is the same as in drink or in

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:31.257
famous also at the edge of the lips. So
bird is fully iconic, all of these

00:26:31.257 --> 00:26:38.861
contribute to the iconicity. Some signs
are partially iconic and then an example

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.838
of that is heart one. I'll be talking all
together about two signs, heart. This is

00:26:42.838 --> 00:26:50.788
an older form, later we'll see a newer
form. So that is this heart, very iconic.

00:26:50.788 --> 00:26:57.357
The movement, a heart shape. Place of
articulation, left side of chest, about

00:26:57.357 --> 00:27:06.689
where the heart is located. But there is
an arbitrary element, the hand shape is

00:27:06.689 --> 00:27:11.553
this open eight hand shape which has
nothing to do with heart. It's completely

00:27:11.553 --> 00:27:19.141
arbitrary. Some signers interpret the
heart shape the way I've been doing it

00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:24.039
more or less the heart shape you see on
Valentines, for some it's an oval, for

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:31.629
some it's a circle. An important
distinction throughout this talk is the

00:27:31.629 --> 00:27:42.527
distinction between gestures and signs.
And so I've coined a notation here to keep

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:48.108
them different. On the left is a gesture.
Trace a heart shape over region of the

00:27:48.108 --> 00:27:54.598
heart which could be done with any finger
or fingers or combination as opposed to

00:27:54.598 --> 00:28:02.522
the sign. So the gesture is in these
double angled brackets, a sign has these

00:28:02.522 --> 00:28:08.990
three formatives and each of those is
enclosed in square brackets.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:16.860
The very important here is the gestural
hypothesis that iconic signs evolved from

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.970
holistic gestures. So that the sign heart
on the right evolved from the gesture on

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:33.920
the left. And a piece of evidence for
that, if that is the case that the sign

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:41.460
heart one evolved from the gesture heart,
this hypothesis makes a prediction that

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.970
early on there would have been variation
in the finger or fingers used to trace the

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:55.210
heart shape since that hand shape plays no
role in the gesture itself which is just

00:28:55.390 --> 00:29:02.500
trace the heart shape. It doesn't say
anything about which finger or fingers.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.430
And in fact there is evidence that that is
correct, that there was variation early

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:16.750
on. I'm indebted to Brandon Scates for
bringing to my attention that an 1884

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:22.070
book, "Deaf mutes describe a small surface
over heart and pointing downwards."

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:28.530
Saying nothing about which finger or
fingers. And Higgins, 1923, "Right index

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:33.990
points to heart or right thumb and index
trace shape of heart in region of heart or

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:40.570
both index tips trace shape of heart."
And notice that none of these are the open

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:47.640
eight hand shape used for heart in ASL. So
this is one kind of evidence for the

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:59.130
gestural origin of the sign heart. Now,
what distinguishes one sign from another?

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:09.910
And I'm going to show you two signs now
that differ only in place of articulation.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:22.010
And this one means Canada, this one means
Yom Kippur. And the only difference is

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:28.280
whether I do it at the place of
articulation on my right side here of the

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:37.720
chest or the left side. Okay. Now, for
those of you who do not know ASL, I'm

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:48.360
going to do a sign and you tell me which
it means. Canada or Yom Kippur? How many

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:56.510
say Canada? How many say Yom Kippur? Okay.
It looks about evenly split to the extent

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:05.190
I can see. Well, actually this means
Canada but before I said this means Canada

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.150
and this means Yom Kippur, why doesn't
this mean Yom Kippur? I'm doing it with my

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:18.920
left hand before I did it with my right
hand. What this shows is that the relevant

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:25.840
distinction is not between right and left
on the chest. And I'll introduce the terms

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:34.960
ipsilateral. This is Latin, ipsi is same,
lateral is side. An ipsilateral sign or

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:43.580
sign's place of articulation is on the
same side as the articulating hand.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:51.860
Contralateral signs are articulated on the
opposite side. So Canada, ipsilateral and

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:57.600
I'm right-handed. This is Canada, this is
Yom Kippur. A left-handed person this is

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:04.580
Canada, this is Yom Kippur.
The crucial thing is whether it's

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:13.910
ipsilateral or contralateral. Now let's go
back to heart and I'm going to show you

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:26.920
the other sign for heart which I'm
right-handed, so this is heart. And that

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:34.900
seems like the place of articulation is
iconically motivated. But how would have a

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:44.760
left hander sign heart? Why? Because it's
contralateral. I'm right-handed I sign it

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:52.300
over here where the heart is located more
or less. But for a left hander, it's also

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.340
contralateral so we sign over here. So
this is an important fact and this

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:06.730
illustrates the major transformation that
has taken place in what I'm talking about

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:17.710
today. Namely that the formal
characterization of place of articulation

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:26.140
as either ipsilateral or contralateral
trumps the iconicity. These things started

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:34.500
out iconic with the movement being iconic,
the place of articulation where the heart

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:44.260
is located. But once they evolve from
gestures to signs, we now have a system

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:51.790
where the formal properties of the signs
take over and trump the original iconic

00:33:51.970 --> 00:34:00.800
motivation of the form coming from the
original iconic gesture.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:10.950
This gives us a way of seeing formal
properties of signs as opposed to the

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:16.220
gestures from which they derive. And right
and left have no place but ipsilateral,

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.720
contralateral are essential. So let me
show you some other signs now where you

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:26.760
can see the same thing. So direction of
movement is either ipsilateral or

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:34.780
contralateral. So I'll show you the signs
for right and left. When I sign right, my

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:41.980
hand moves to the right. When I sign left,
my hand moves to the left. But really,

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.450
when I sign right, my hand is moving in
the ipsilateral direction and when I sign

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:53.560
left my hand is moving in the
contralateral direction. So, when a

00:34:53.740 --> 00:35:00.480
left-handed person signs right, the hand
moves in the ipsilateral direction which

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:08.400
is to the left. And when a left-handed
person signs left, the hand moves in the

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.880
contralateral direction which is to the
right. This shows very clearly that

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:20.740
what's relevant is the formal properties
of the place of articulation, not the

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:26.110
original iconic motivation which you see
in the right-handed signing but the

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:33.660
left-handed signing turns that on its
head. Also, I want to dispel any idea you

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:42.750
might have gotten that the gestural source
of particular signs might only have been

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:50.400
in the distant past and also that there's
any physical difference necessarily

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:57.780
between gestures and signs. So the sign
Yom Kippur that I've been illustrating has

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:05.390
a gestural source which is this which is
physically exactly the same as the sign.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:10.730
It's done in the synagogue service on Yom
Kippur. There's a prayer, it's a communal

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:16.540
confession of various kinds of sins. Each
type of sin as it's mentioned, the

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.935
worshipers go like this.

00:36:17.935 --> 00:36:25.072
What do the left handers do?
This is the gesture that is the source of

00:36:25.072 --> 00:36:30.380
the sign Yom Kippur, physically identical
to it. For left handers in the synagogue

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:39.010
service, it goes to the place where the
heart is located which is here on the left

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:51.994
side. But when they sign the sign Yom
Kippur which is evolved from that gesture,

00:36:51.994 --> 00:36:57.369
it's on the opposite side, the
contralateral side because Yom Kippur is a

00:36:57.369 --> 00:37:09.547
contralateral sign. Okay. So this
difference between gestures and signs is

00:37:09.547 --> 00:37:18.399
the key thing. The signs have certain
formal properties. They evolved from

00:37:18.399 --> 00:37:23.584
gestures but once they have these formal
properties they can turn out quite

00:37:23.584 --> 00:37:32.067
differently. And we can generalize, some
of the other papers have talked about

00:37:32.067 --> 00:37:41.938
this, Mark Aronoff and Carol Padden just
before this. A more general gestural

00:37:41.938 --> 00:37:50.404
hypothesis that sign languages have their
earliest stages in gestural communication

00:37:50.404 --> 00:38:00.813
and have evolved from that to current sign
languages. And a very great

00:38:00.813 --> 00:38:06.425
confirmation of this is the Al-Sayyid
Bedouin sign language that Mark Aronoff

00:38:06.425 --> 00:38:12.933
just mentioned in his presentation where
he and three others have been studying

00:38:12.933 --> 00:38:20.769
this new Bedouin sign language in Southern
Israel which does not have a combinatorial

00:38:20.769 --> 00:38:29.510
system, a combinatorial phonological
system putting parts together as we saw

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:34.070
here.
Okay, one last point. Comparative

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:38.890
cross-species evidence from language
experiments with chimpanzees. These are

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:44.380
chimpanzees that people signed with
for years and years. Rivas did 22 hours of

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:51.790
video tape and eliminated all cases where
they just repeated what the human had

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:57.650
signed within the previous five seconds.
Here's the number of different signs each

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:04.510
of these chimps produced and their four
most frequent signs accounted for 58%,

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:11.680
45%, etc. of their total output. The main
thing is after years of this, why is their

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:19.180
vocabulary so small? The explanation: that
chimps learn no signs at all, only a small

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:29.040
set of holistic gestures. And a deeper
explanation for that is that they don't

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:35.380
have the combinatorial abilities that
humans have to have a combinatorial system

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:42.930
putting meaningful words or signs together
from smaller units. This suggests strongly

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:52.360
that these combinatorial abilities of
humans developed after the split between

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:57.005
the human and chimpanzee lineages.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:15.120
- [Ray] I should first give equal billing
to Eva Wittenberg who did a lot of this

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:24.610
work with me. Can you identify yourself
there? Yeah, right there. One of the big

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:30.380
questions for anthropogeny is how did
language evolve in our species. And even

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.370
this is a big question my almost five year
old granddaughter asked a couple of weeks

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:41.160
ago. She asked, "How did people make up
words when there weren't words before?" So

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:48.840
I mean it's an obvious question. Well,
here's the thing. Languages are learned by

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.710
children and their progress looks like
learning other things like motor skills

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.510
and social skills. So a lot of people
think there's nothing more to it than

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.200
that. Humans just got to be good at
learning stuff. So I want to restate the

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.860
question not how did human language evolve
but how did humans evolve so as to be able

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.280
to learn language as well as those other
things? And in order to answer this you

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.000
have to ask another question, when you
learn a language, what do you end up

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.860
knowing? For starters, learning a language
is being able to map between patterns of

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.100
sounds or gestures on one hand, and
meanings or thoughts or concepts, whatever

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.460
they are. So something like this. So when
you're speaking you're going upwards in

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.390
this picture from meanings to producing
sounds, and when you're understanding

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:41.220
you're going downward. Now let me add a
little bit of the big picture, conceptual

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.760
structures are also linked to perception
and action. So you can talk about what you

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:51.060
see and you can talk about what actions
you plan to carry out and so on. Now, just

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:57.210
for fun, what do you get if you take away
phonetic patterns like this? Well, you get

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:02.250
an organism that can perceive and have
thoughts and act based on those thoughts.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.570
And I think this is a plausable sketch of
ape cognition which is pretty

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:10.760
sophisticated, but it doesn't have
language. So the evolution of language had

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.920
to involve at least a new ability to map
concepts to sounds and gestures and to use

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.060
these communicatively. Well, we've been
hearing this all day. Well, linguists

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.270
actually think there's a good deal more to
that than language. First comes

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:29.070
phonological structure which is the
systematized organization of sounds or

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:35.230
gestures and we just heard about that from
David Perlmutter in ASL. Second one is

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:40.490
morphology, the internal structure of
words such that a word like, say

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:46.230
procedurally can be seen as built form
proceed plus ure to form procedure plus al

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:52.690
to form procedural plus ly to perform
procedurally. And the third one is syntax,

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:58.090
the organization of words into phrases
and sentences. So syntax determines things

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:02.120
like canonical word order. So if you hear
something like the boy kissed the girl you

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.130
know who did the kissing and who got
kissed. It also allows you to elaborate

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:11.510
descriptions of characters and events into
phrases. So something like the boy in the

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:16.290
blue hat and red sneakers tried to kiss
the girl that he loved. And you still know

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:21.250
that the boy did the kissing even though
the word boy is nowhere near kiss, and

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:26.220
you also know that he loved the girl
even though the boy is nowhere near love.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.360
So language in modern humans involves this
part circled in red of the network of

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.760
cognitive organization. And what's evolved
in humans is the ability to learn to do

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.410
this kind of thing, to turn thoughts into
sounds by structuring them into words and

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:47.450
phrases and to be able to pull thoughts
out of the sounds that other people make.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.860
Well, how could this have happened?
Basically there's no direct evidence for

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.640
what our ancestors talked about and when
they started talking. There aren't any

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.170
fossil vowels.
The usual way to test evolutionary

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:08.580
scenarios is comparison to other species.
But here it isn't too helpful as we've

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:13.700
heard already today, modern apes don't
learn very much in the way of human

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.660
languages and they certainly don't invent
language spontaneously as deaf children do

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.990
in the absence of sign language input as
we also have heard about today. So there's

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:29.120
a big cognitive gap between apes and
humans here. Another way to form plausible

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.650
hypothesis about evolution is through
reverse engineering, figuring out what

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:38.170
components could have been useful in the
absence of others. So think about the eye,

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.980
a primitive retina would have been useful
for vision. Without the muscles that move

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.070
the eyeballs although it might be more
limited than our modern vision. On the

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.720
other hand, without a retina, the muscles
wouldn't help you see at all. So it makes

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:55.550
sense that something like the retina
probably evolved before the muscles. I

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.410
want to propose something like that for
language. So a primitive system for

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:04.310
communicating thoughts via sounds and
gestures is useful without phonology,

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:09.340
morphology, or syntax. These components
can improve an existing communication

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.860
system but they're useless on their own.
So if the components of language evolved

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.380
in some order it makes sense that the
connection between phonetics and meaning

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.930
came first and then these further
refinements going from there. So the

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.710
hypothesis is that this is the kind of
system that some ancestors of

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:34.060
modern humans could learn. I can't prove
that this is the way language evolved but

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.880
what I'll try to do today is to show you
the simpler systems of the sort exist in

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.910
the languages of today and show you how
these systems, a little bit, about how

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:48.130
these systems work. And the basic idea
comes from Derek Bickerton. He proposed

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:52.310
that there's a form of language that he
called Protolanguage which surfaces in

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.470
many different circumstances and he
proposed that this form of language is a

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:01.150
relic of early stages in the human or
hominid system.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:06.410
I'm going to suggest that this form of
language is a subset of the full language

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:12.280
system. It emits morphology and syntax and
I'll call it a linear grammar. What is a

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:18.200
linear grammar like? Well, it has words
and the words have to come in some order.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:23.230
They map to meanings but there's no
structure. There aren't syntactic phrases

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:28.840
like the boy in the blue hat and red
sneakers or structure inside words as we

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:33.410
saw with the word procedurally. Now in
this kind of language, word order could

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:38.210
still matter. You could say boy kiss girl
and mean the boy did the kissing and the

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:44.820
girl got kissed, not vice versa. But it
wouldn't be because the subject proceeds

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.900
the verb and the verb proceeds the object,
because a linear grammar can't have

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.330
syntactic things like nouns and verbs and
subjects and objects. What it still has

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:59.910
is semantic notions like the word denoting
an actor, here the boy, proceeds the word

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.880
denoting the action namely kiss. That is
this kind of language would map directly

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:10.490
between linear order and phonology and the
meaning. Now linear grammar doesn't have

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:15.170
morphology so the kind of things like
tenses and agreement on verbs, so you'll

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:20.140
get boy kiss girl, not boy kissed girl or
boy kisses girl. You'll leave it up to the

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:25.370
context to indicate when this kissing took
place. And you might also expect not to

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:30.020
have functional items like definite
articles which perform a syntactic role

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.650
namely marking noun phrases than a
semantic one. And a linear grammar is

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:41.060
linear so it can't have subordinate
clauses like the relative clause and the

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.510
girl that he loved. You might still
express this thought but maybe as two

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:50.700
sentences. You might say something like
boy love girl, kiss girl. Something like

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.930
that. Well, I want to tell you about some
systems that look like this. The first one

00:47:56.110 --> 00:48:00.700
is pidgins. These are the early stages of
contact languages as we also heard about

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.400
earlier today.
This is great, this symposium just set up

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:10.160
my talk perfectly. Pidgins are often
described as having no subordination, no

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:15.790
morphology, no grammatical words like the,
and they have unstable word order that's

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.920
governed by semantic principles like actor
before action. If the context permits you

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.650
can leave out characters and the action.
So if you already knew about the girl you

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:29.400
might just say boy kiss, where English
would make you use a pronoun like the boy

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:34.400
kissed her. So from the perspective of
linear grammar we can ask, "Is there any

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:39.090
evidence that Pidgins have parts of speech
like nouns and verbs?" Is there any

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:44.320
evidence for syntactic phrases? And my
preliminary conclusion is there's very

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:51.130
little evidence for it and I suggest that
Pidgins would be a good example of a

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:56.330
linear grammar. Later on of course,
contact languages add many features of

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:59.640
more complex languages like
conventionalized word order, grammatical

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:04.560
category, syntactic subordination. Again
as we heard today and these kinds of

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:09.570
languages are called Creoles. And Eva and
I see the transition form from a Pidgin to

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:15.660
a Creole as going not from it's not a
language, it's just junk to a language.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.160
Now it's a language, but just adding some
syntactic and morphological principles

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:26.550
that weren't there in the Pidgins, just
goosing it up a little bit. For a second

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:32.540
case, Wolfgang Klein and Clive Perdue did
a multilanguage longitudinal study of

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.850
immigrants all over Europe learning second
languages, and they found that all

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:42.080
speakers achieved a stage of what you
might call semi-proficiency that Klein and

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:46.660
Perdue call the Basic Variety. Many
speakers went on to improve on it but

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:51.290
others just stop there. That's as far as
they got. And in this stage as they

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:55.360
describe it, there's no inflectional
morphology, no tenses, no plurals and so

00:49:55.540 --> 00:50:00.790
on. No sentential subordination. You can
leave out known characters freely.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:06.260
There's simple and semantically based
principles of word order including our

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.200
favorite actor before action. That is from
our standpoint the basic variety also

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:19.850
looks like another kind of linear grammar.
Third case is home sign. As we've heard

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:24.660
already the languages invented by deaf
children who have no exposure to a sign

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:29.190
language. And Susan Goldin-Meadow has
shown that they have at most rudimentary

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:34.670
morphology. They freely omit known
characters and on our analysis, they only

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:40.440
have a semantic distinction of object
versus action, not a syntactic distinction

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:45.890
of noun versus verb. The word order is
kind of probabilistic but if anything it's

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:51.510
based on semantic roles. Home signers do
produce some sentences with multiple verbs

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:55.730
or action words if you don't think they
have verbs. Goldin-Meadow has in the past

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:59.910
described these as embedding. We think
these are rudimentary serial verb

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:08.690
constructions which I can't explain to non
linguists, I'm sorry. So it looks to us

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:15.150
like a linear grammar with possibly a bit
of morphology added and I should add to be

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.980
perfectly honest, Goldin-Meadow doesn't
agree with us altogether, so this is

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.290
controversial. Another case we've looked
at is village sign languages which develop

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:28.310
in isolated communities where there's a
significant occurrence of hereditary

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:32.980
deafness. And the best known of these is
ABSL which we've just heard about from

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:38.700
Mark Aronoff. I'm going to talk about
Central Taurus Sign Language or CTSL which

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:43.210
is spoken in a couple of remote villages
in the mountains of Turkey. This language

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:49.310
came to my attention two years ago through
my student Rabia Ergin who remarkably has

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.910
deaf family members who live in the
village and speak it. You want to raise

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:58.970
your hand Rabia, our newest celebrity,
there she is. Rabia along with Naomi

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:03.370
Kaselli, Irit Meir and some of the people
from Carol Padden's group from about which

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:07.890
we've heard already have been documenting
this language and what they find is that

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:12.120
the language has a fair amount of
morphology but there's very little

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:17.340
evidence for syntactic structure.
In sentences involving one character so

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.860
somebody jumped or somebody fell down or
something, the word order is normally the

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.910
actor preceding the action. If there are
two character sentences with inanimate

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:32.720
patients like the boy rolled the ball,
it's normally, well, maybe you put in the

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.460
actor, maybe you don't, and then you put
in the thing that's acted upon and then

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:42.430
the action. But if there are two animate
characters, so the semantics alone can't

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:46.850
resolve the potential ambiguity. Word
order isn't very stable. It's a bit vague

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.117
whether the boy kissed the girl or vice
versa and there's a lot of reliance.

00:52:51.117 --> 00:52:54.622
People rely a lot on
pragmatics and context.

00:52:54.622 --> 00:52:57.120
In fact, there's a very strong
tendency to mention

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:02.990
only one of the characters in an event no
matter how many there are. So CTSL looks

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:07.580
like a linear grammar augmented by a
substantial amount of morphology and this

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:12.690
isn't too far off what we've seen in ABSL
and the earlier stages of Nicaraguan Sign

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:14.270
Language as we heard from Anny Sanges.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.590
Now what's cool I think is that these less
complex systems aren't confined to

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:24.830
emerging languages. Townsend and Bever
discussed what they call semantically

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:29.950
based interpretive strategies that
influence language comprehension. Hearers

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:34.840
tend to rely in part on semantically based
principles of word order like actor

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.870
precedes action which is why on our story
they have more difficulty with

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:43.830
constructions such as reversible passives
and object relatives again for the

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:48.170
non-linguist it doesn't matter. Where the
actor doesn't precede the action, that's

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:53.670
the crucial thing. Similarly, Fernanda
Ferrera and her colleagues discussed what

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:58.170
they call good enough parsing where people
apparently rely on linear order and

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:02.340
semantic plausibility rather than
syntactic structure. And it's well known

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.350
that we see similar symptoms in language
comprehension by agrammatic aphasics.

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:12.120
And Heather van der Lely has argued that a
particular population of children with

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.470
specific language impairment behave as
though they're processing language through

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:21.310
something like a linear grammar. The
literature describes these so-called

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:25.970
strategies or heuristics has something
separate from language. But they're still

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:30.200
mappings between phonology and meaning.
They're just simpler ones that bypass

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:37.840
syntax. So we can conjecture that the
language processor makes use of both

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.220
syntactic grammar and the simpler linear
grammar and when the two kinds of rules

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.740
produce conflicting analyses, the
interpretation is slower and less stable

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:51.320
even when the syntax wins out. And when
the syntactic rules break down under

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.950
conditions of stress or disability then
the linear grammar is still there doing

00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:01.000
its thing. We've also come across two full
blown languages whose grammar appears to

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.220
be close to a linear grammar and others
have come along that I haven't

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.340
looked at very closely yet. But one of
them is Riau Indonesian. This is a

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:13.600
vernacular with several million speakers
described by David Gil. Gil argues that

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:18.370
this language has no syntactic parts of
speech, no inflection or morphology like

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:22.860
tense or plural or agreement, known
characters in the discourse are freely

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:28.180
omitted, and things that English expresses
with syntactic subordination are expressed

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:34.330
in Riau by simply jamming simple sentences
together, like boy kiss love girl. The

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:39.480
word order is pretty free, but actors tend
to precede actions and actions tend to

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:44.680
precede patients. But here's some
illustration of the freedom of this

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:48.680
language. If you have the expression
chicken eat, this can mean all of these

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:53.090
different things depending on the context.
And the ones at the bottom where you say

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:59.960
chicken eat and you mean someone is eating
with the chicken, they require where

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:04.180
the chicken is eating, they require a lot
of contextual support but people do say

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.770
these things.
So this again looks like a linear grammar

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:13.330
so here's basically a full language that's
syntactically simple in our sense. Another

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:18.430
example is the controversial case of
Piraha, studied extensively by Dan

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:23.860
Everett. This has exuberant morphology, so
it's not simple in this respect. It seems

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.130
to have a syntactic noun-verb distinction
and fairly fixed word order but no

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:32.030
definite or indefinite articles, no
markers of plurality, no agreement, da,

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:39.530
da, da. Now Everett's most famous claim is
that Piraha lacks recursion that is

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:43.750
subordinate clauses. Everything that's
expressed in English with recursive syntax

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:49.210
either just jam simple sentences together
or require some sort of circumlocution. So

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:54.020
this looks like a syntactically relatively
simple language, though not as simple as

00:56:54.200 --> 00:57:01.010
Riau Indonesian. So to sum up, we find
that's remarkably similar grammatical

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:05.310
systems turn up in all of these different
scenarios and this suggests that linear

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:09.920
grammar is quite a robust phenomenon
entrenched in the modern human brain. It

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:15.220
provides a scaffolding on top of which
fully syntactic languages can develop

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.430
either in an individual, as in the case of
the basic variety, or in a community as

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:24.200
we've seen with sign languages and
Creoles, and it provides a sort of

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:28.150
safety net when syntactic grammar is
damaged as we've seen with aphasia and

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:32.370
specific language impairment. And we've
also seen that you can say a lot without

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:37.420
syntax, for example in Riau Indonesian
though having syntax gives you a lot more

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.610
fancy tools for expressing yourself. So
let me go back to the original question

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:47.920
about the evolution of the human ability
to learn language. I suggest that we

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.810
can think about it through reverse
engineering asking what kind of system

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:56.150
there could have been that preceded the
modern human language faculty. And I think

00:57:56.330 --> 00:58:00.090
linear grammar is a good candidate. As I
said at the beginning, I have no idea how

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:07.370
we could prove it nor when the hominid
line achieved either linear grammar or

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:10.050
syntactic grammar.
Maybe someday we'll get better evidence

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:15.490
from genetics but for now I'm happy to see
it as an intriguing hypothesis. So

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:21.230
altogether then, we think this is telling
us a lot of interesting and new things

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:25.150
about the texture of the human faculty and
I'm eager to get on with filling in the

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:27.531
picture further. Thank you.
