00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Archimedes was born about 2,300 years ago,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and he made important contributions in math, physics, engineering, and astronomy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In physics, Archimedes was the first to explain the principle of the lever,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which we will be talking about quite a bit in the third unit.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He invented an ingenious device known as the Archimedes screw,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which can be used to move water from low places to high.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Many of his inventions were actually used to defend Syracuse,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which in his day was frequently attacked.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He created catapults and ballistas, which could fire projectiles huge distances

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when enemy ships attacked.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
He's even rumored to have constructed a heat ray,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which used mirrors on the bluffs of Syracuse to focus the sun's rays on an attacking ship.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In math, Archimedes was able to calculate the area under a parabola.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is a shape that we'll be using extensively in the next unit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
He defined the Archimedes spiral, which you can learn more about

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in one of the challenge homework problems in this unit,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but the discovery that he was most proud of was his proof that a sphere inscribed in a cylinder

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
has exactly 2/3 the volume and the surface area of the cylinder.
