TOBIAS NOKE: Thank you, Sarah.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.060
Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.550
My name is Tobias Noke, and I'm
a BD manager for Google Play,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.370
working with our key
partners in western Europe.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.350
It's great to be here
with you at Playtime,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.650
and to see so many new
and familiar faces.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.120
After we have been
discussing how

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.360
to de-risk your game launch,
let's take the next step.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.060
Let's think about you want
to take your game out there

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.900
to the crowds.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.790
And for doing so,
you want to build

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.070
a strong and engaged community.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.280
Because only with a community,
your game can last for years.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.310
And when it comes
about communities,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.990
YouTube is the place to be.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.690
Because YouTube, well, that's
the biggest video platform

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.520
for games out there.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.940
Today, we will hear two
impressive strategies

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.580
from Paul Gouge, the
CEO of Playdemic,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.300
who will tell us how we can
get our users to keep and share

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.370
their favorite
moments on YouTube.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.605
And from Mickey Elimelech
the CMO of Space

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:57.640
Ape Games, who knows everything
about working with influencers.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.620
But before letting
them on stage,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.900
let me give you some
more background on why

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.599
YouTube matters for your game.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.920
YouTube is essentially
where your users are.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.130
Whether you do a core game,
a casual game, a game where

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.970
they are, a game with VR, you
will find the users on YouTube.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.680
You can acquire
users on YouTube.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.630
And you can speak to
them again and again

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.420
to ensure that they are engaged.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.460
And to put this
into perspective,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.370
last year we had
507 billion views

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.550
of gaming content
on YouTube alone.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.580
And the good news here, for
everyone in this room is,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.330
this growth is driven
by mobile games.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.140
In the last two years, we have
been seeing an increase of 342%

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.140
when it comes to the hours
watched of mobile gaming

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.340
content.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.710
So this will become more
and more relevant in future.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.530
And last but not
least, everything

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.290
moves towards live gaming
and live streaming.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.830
We also see an increase
of 512% year over year

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.530
when it comes to live
gaming on YouTube.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.940
So YouTube is big.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.290
YouTube is relevant.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.760
And it's growing.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.070
But all of these
numbers do not really

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.889
help if we do not know who
is actually on the platform.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.930
We have done some research and
identified three key audiences.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.810
One are the trendsetters.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.870
Those guys are basically
YouTube to just find out

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.930
whether they should
download or pay for a game.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.870
Half of them are actually
waiting for new game videos

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.310
to be released.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.710
So to get these
trendsetters on board,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.050
you need to have a
compelling video strategy,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.200
and release videos again
and again and again.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.210
Second, we have
identified the people who

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.220
love game and video culture.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.040
Those users are mainly
in for great videos.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.640
80% of them just love videos
because of great soundtrack,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.740
great visuals, and great story.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.120
So ensure your videos are good,
have a high production quality,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.820
or at least a very good
story, because this way

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.850
you get the game
culture lovers on board.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.280
And last but not least,
we identified the people

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.340
who love to reconnect
and who love to share.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.520
Those users, basically just
videos because somebody else

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.970
shared it with them.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.130
And if they're in the pub, and
hear about a game, 62% of them

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.980
will directly go to
YouTube to research

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.560
what this game is all about.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.580
So so much for the growth of
YouTube and the size of YouTube

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.140
and also the key
audiences on YouTube.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.230
And you want to get all of them.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.980
But before doing so, you need
to set up your game properly

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.820
for YouTube.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.210
You need to integrate mechanics,
which enable the users to share

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.130
their favorite moments.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.320
So let me get
someone on stage who

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.630
can explain this much
better than I do,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.886
the CEO of Playdemic,
my friend Paul Gouge.

00:03:42.886 --> 00:03:45.260
PAUL GOUGE: Apparently I can
explain it better than Toby.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.010
That is quite a lofty goal
there, but I am going to try.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.640
I am going to talk about a
game called Golf Clash today.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.111
Hands up here if you
have played Golf Clash?

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:54.610
Kids.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.637
Quite a few of you.

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:56.470
That's good to hear.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.354
And hands up if you shared
a video in Golf Clash?

00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:02.020
Oh, some polite people
saying they have.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.950
Well, people do.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.140
So that is what we are
going to talk about today.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.450
So, one of the things we've
just heard there about YouTube

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.840
as a platform and about videos
generally, is obviously,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.260
we now know we exist
in a world where people

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.800
want to share their moments.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.490
Where people want to reach
out in that community

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.639
and express how they
feel about a product,

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.180
and those great
periods of excitement

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.930
they've experienced
within that product.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.650
So when it came to
building Golf Clash,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.150
we really wanted to, for the
first time really in Playdemic,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.290
to embrace that.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.790
And to give players
an opportunity

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.410
to make this really
super easy for them.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.010
We know, you know, the
advocates, the highly engaged

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.080
players, will go out of
their way to share video.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.600
They'll go out of their
way to store and share

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.490
and, actually, overcome
some quite difficult

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.370
technical challenges.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.829
But what we wanted
to do was create

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:46.244
something that
really would appeal

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.900
to the mass market
in that sense.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.800
So in terms of the whys, this
was very much a business goal.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.110
You know, we had just been
talking about de-risking

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.610
our businesses.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.720
A lot of that is focused
around those core metrics

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.090
of commercialization,
of engagement,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.394
monetization of retention.

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:02.810
What we wanted to
do is also build

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.670
in there another crucial
metric, which we didn't really

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.370
talk about this morning, is
redriving your organic reach

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.770
and getting your users
to really empower

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.530
the community by reaching out
and telling about the product.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.160
So very much this was
about stimulating installs,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.650
stimulating the retentive
and engaging quality

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.040
of sharing those moments.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.420
To think about how we can
harness those platforms.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.570
We just heard very much
about the scale of YouTube.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.278
We all know that.

00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:25.695
It's a significant
scale platform.

00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:27.611
And when you think about
what we're doing when

00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:28.820
we are spending money on UA.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.903
We are essentially century
creating those moments.

00:05:30.903 --> 00:05:33.230
We're creating moments on
platforms like Youtube,

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.730
that really sell
our game quality

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.320
and sell those key moments.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.510
What better way to
do that than to have

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.740
a player do that for you?

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.415
We all know the most powerful
form of recommendation

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:44.540
comes from an individual
that you are interested in

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.670
or care about, have some
relationship with, rather

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.190
than necessarily just
thinking about UA.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.160
Also, we wanted to make sure
that those moments in the game

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.819
were the key emotional moments.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.360
We wanted to make sure that we
made that piece easy, as well,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.170
for the player.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.272
So those real flag-bearing
moments for that product.

00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:02.480
The bits that, I think, Jens
referred to this morning

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.530
about those bits that
make the players excited.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.196
We wanted to make
sure the players could

00:06:06.196 --> 00:06:07.630
share those moments as well.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.230
And also, and this is very much
an ancillary benefit, but also

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.530
in customer support and
caring for our users

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.140
long term, is a crucial element
and one of the great side

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.017
effects we found
from our integration,

00:06:17.017 --> 00:06:19.100
is it actually gave us an
opportunity for customer

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.620
support to be able to look
easily at the experiences

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.170
that our players were
having in that moment.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.200
So thinking about
the player goals.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.020
For us, we know as players,
everyone in this room

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.889
is a player of video
games, I'm sure.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.680
And we all love the
industry that we're in.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.850
And we also love the product.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.308
And we want to
share those moments,

00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:38.755
you know, particularly in skill
games, like Golf Clash is.

00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:40.130
We want to share
how good we are.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.210
We want to share
with the community

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.610
that we've done something
special or something funny

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.277
or something different
or something new.

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:47.485
We want to reach out to the
community and share that.

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:49.040
We also want to make
sure that we can

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.240
store those moments as well.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.490
And that we can favorite them.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.270
Now we have a language
now of sharing

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.440
in our global digital economy.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.204
We wanted to make sure
that was in this product.

00:06:58.204 --> 00:06:59.370
So what does that look like?

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.260
I mean, hopefully those
of you who have played it

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.240
will recognize the
UI of Golf Clash.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.120
So what we did is
we created a system

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.670
where every single shot
you ever take in Golf Clash

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.080
is stored for you.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.660
So there was no need
for you to anticipate.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.145
And if you think about the
illogical nature of this,

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:15.770
you know, you can
never anticipate when

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.166
this great moment is coming.

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:19.040
So you can't sort of
get to a place thinking,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.630
I'm going to have an
awesome game today.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.296
I am going to make
sure I'm videoing it.

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:23.420
Now that can't happen.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.400
Even in the live environment,
where you are live streaming,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.360
you can't guarantee that those
moments are going to happen.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.690
So what we wanted to do
is to make it foolproof.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.148
We wanted to make
sure that we were

00:07:31.148 --> 00:07:34.550
going to store every single
shot you ever took in the game.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.830
So we created-- and to
give it some importance--

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.424
we stuck this right on
the main HUD of the game.

00:07:39.424 --> 00:07:41.840
The replay sat there alongside
all the other key functions

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.400
of the game, to say,
this is something

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.358
that's always going be
tracking your movements,

00:07:45.358 --> 00:07:47.420
always going to be
tracking your key shots.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.310
We also, then, gave
you the opportunity

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.550
to automatically store
things that we thought

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.720
were interesting and
automatically favorite them.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.720
So we have some
logic in the game,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.760
that when you do something
that we generally

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.310
think is interesting
from a skill perspective,

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.167
we'll automatically share the
piece of UI you're seeing here

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:05.750
that says, look, you
know you just did

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.370
something that was pretty cool.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.380
We know from the way
the game is played

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.510
and from our data, that
the thing you just did

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.160
requires quite a
lot of the skill.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.630
So we are going to pop
this up straight away,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.046
and say, here's
something that you

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:17.350
might be interested in sharing.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.010
You might certainly be
interested in watching it back

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.726
initially.

00:08:19.726 --> 00:08:21.600
And then you may going
to want to share that.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.740
So we have a UI here
that is, again, as I say,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.069
is accessible from the HUD.

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:28.360
It allows you to go through
all the shots you've taken.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.290
Allows you to replay
them to yourself.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.030
Allows you to rename
them, to give them

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.100
a cool name that might
be interested as a hook

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.110
when you share that
out into YouTube.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.059
And to watch them
back and share them

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.510
at any point in the journey.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.270
So we allow a lot of storage in
the app for players to do this.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.340
So any point in time,
in any future date,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.835
where you are having a sort of
a trade-off with a buddy who

00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:47.840
has shared something
interesting,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.220
you think you got one
better, you can go back

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.380
into your library, you can name
that, you can share that out

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:51.880
again.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.400
So really low friction on
the part of the player.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.280
You will all be familiar with
what the google interface looks

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.290
like for sharing.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.860
But it is, it's a
very simple mechanic.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.170
It's built into the product.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.995
If you're not using
it, please do so.

00:09:04.995 --> 00:09:06.620
We've certainly seen
it to be something

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.630
that's been very easy
for us to integrate with.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.060
Obviously it's both
live and historic.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.962
So in terms of other
considerations,

00:09:13.962 --> 00:09:15.170
this is just a bit of detail.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.430
I'm conscious I've
got eight minutes.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.480
I think my wife said
to me this morning,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.740
you've never spoke eight
minutes by anything.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.689
So I'm going to try to
keep it pretty punchy.

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:24.230
But one of the things
we wanted to do

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.020
is, in recording that
video, we didn't really

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.160
feel that we could just
share the raw data.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.270
So when you look- when
we started to do this,

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.070
we looked back at some of
the feeds we were creating.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.940
And they're quite dull.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.845
There was quite a lot of moments
in the game-- and those of you

00:09:36.845 --> 00:09:38.060
have played it will
recognize this-- where

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.390
you are kind of setting
up a shot, you're aiming,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.680
and then in replay, that
really didn't look good.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.290
So we wanted to bring sort
of an element of pre-edit

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.470
to the experience.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.950
So we cut out quite
a lot of dead space.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.690
And we said, this
isn't interesting.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.190
This isn't something
that people are

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.244
going to want to relate to when
it gets out onto to YouTube.

00:09:55.244 --> 00:09:57.410
What we also did is, and
this goes back to the point

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.480
I was making about
UA, we also integrated

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.424
an intro and an end card.

00:10:01.424 --> 00:10:02.840
So you know, from
the perspective,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.790
this is also a piece
of real estate for us,

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.331
reaching out into
that huge community

00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:08.680
that Toby talked about to
drive installs and engagement.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.100
We wanted to make sure
the brand was there,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.797
and there was a
key call to action.

00:10:11.797 --> 00:10:13.880
So everything we stored
for you also has the intro

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.530
and endcard on it.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.841
We also, as I mentioned already,
allowed favoriting of shots

00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:19.340
yourself.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.819
So in that little library
I showed you in the UI,

00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:23.360
you can favorite a
shot at any point,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.752
which puts it in a separate
part of that storage system.

00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:27.710
So you can go back and
look your favorite shots

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.990
and edit that and
curate that yourself.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.630
And also as I mentioned, that
automatic favoriting of shots

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.130
as well.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.051
To ensure that the
game is telling you

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:36.300
this is something interesting.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.550
This is something that you
should think about sharing,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.380
because you did
something special here.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.370
And you know, finally, the
ability to store replays.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.870
I think when I
created this, we said

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.850
we were storing a hundred shots.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.750
We're actually allowing you to
store a bit more than that now.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.416
So what does this
mean in terms of data?

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.800
Some boring graphs for you.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.720
But quite interesting.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.400
I think what you're
seeing here is

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.690
that these are the share
opportunities per DAU

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.450
So you can see that,
roughly speaking,

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.730
we are right about
one share opportunity

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.530
for every single
DAU in the game.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.940
Now clearly, that's in some
respects, a meaningless mean.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.640
So some players are getting
lots share opportunities.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.697
Some are getting none.

00:11:08.697 --> 00:11:10.280
But ultimately
overall, we're creating

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.977
many, many opportunities to
share that are automated.

00:11:12.977 --> 00:11:14.060
That are using the system.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.590
This is not
somebody, and again I

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.720
stress this, having to
go away, think about

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.410
how they're going to
record their video,

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.159
think about how they're
going to share it.

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:23.600
This is the game you're
saying to them, to one person,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.140
effectively every day, here's
a way you can share a video.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.515
Here is something
interesting you

00:11:27.515 --> 00:11:29.600
can put out into the community.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.770
And what we see
is that around 15%

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.610
of those people who have a share
opportunity go on an share it.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.740
Now which is a pretty
impressive conversion rate.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.870
Now we all think about
conversion rates on lots

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.760
of our metrics in this world.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.470
And to get 15%
from something that

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.770
isn't initiated by you, that
is initiated by the game,

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.810
is a pretty powerful
level of conversion.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.630
And what's interesting to us,
is that stayed very consistent.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.380
So you can see,
obviously, now, the launch

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.610
spike at the beginning.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.980
But this is a game now
with many millions of DAU,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.962
that's keeping a very stable
ability to keep converting

00:12:02.962 --> 00:12:03.920
those videos to shares.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.060
And you can see
what we've also done

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.250
as well, is that has
grown consistently

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.690
as the game has grown.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.180
So many, many numbers
of shares going out

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.530
and keeping that
consistent conversion rate.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.770
Which is, of course,
driving engagement

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.600
amongst our existing user base.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.780
But as importantly, continuing
to drive the organic installs

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.980
of people seeing this for the
first time, with an end card,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.884
in a curated manner,
shared by somebody

00:12:28.884 --> 00:12:30.800
that they're interested
in a community they're

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.642
interested in.

00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:34.100
So overall, what
we've seen so far,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.470
these are the very,
very headline metrics.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.800
Is we've seen a
significant conversion

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.450
of those opportunities en masse.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.510
And as I mentioned before,
that 15% is increasing overall.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.950
So you are seeing a start point
there and an improving outcome.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.000
And I think I'm
doing OK for time.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.190
So the result obviously here,
is these are just replays.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.120
So close to 100,000 replays
if I do the screen shot,

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.550
on YouTube of people
that have shared that out

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.500
into the community.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.150
So that's it for me.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.290
I think I just about
did it in eight minutes.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.581
MICKEY ELIMELECH: Thanks, Toby.

00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:11.060
I don't know about
Masters, but we'll try.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.710
So hi, everyone, I'm Mickey.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.490
I head up the marketing
team at Space Ape Games.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.170
And for those of you
who don't know us,

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.610
we are a London-based
mobile gaming studio.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.420
We have four live games,
Samurai Siege, Rival Kingdoms,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.560
Transformers Earth Wars, and
Fastlane Road to Revenge.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.260
We, as a company, our
mission is to create

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.180
a genre-defining top
game, so we actually

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.670
have additional five teams
working on new titles

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.790
at the moment.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.290
Today, I'm here to talk to you
about a really great campaign

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.470
that we did for the launch
of Fastlane Road to Revenge.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.180
And through that,
hopefully, show you

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.210
how we think about influences
and why we do what we do.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.990
So we think of ourselves as
a community-first developer.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.910
We think that a lot
of our big breaks

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.040
came from genuinely
listening to our players

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.190
and allowing them to inform
how we make our games

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.480
and how we develop our games.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.320
We found that by involving
top players and influencers

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.160
from the very, very, very
early stage of development--

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.350
when I mean early stage,
I mean, very early

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.730
in the the development.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.090
The game is not nearly as
polished or anything like that.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.190
But we find that
by doing that, they

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.020
helped us understand
what would make

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.229
the game interesting
for their communities.

00:14:20.229 --> 00:14:21.770
And then they became
our ambassadors.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.490
So we really kind of realized
that we're on to something--

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.380
some really strong
marketing tool here.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.570
So we ended up going and using
this in every single game

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.070
launch that we've had since.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.190
To give you some example,
for Rival Kingdoms,

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.920
we were working on some big
innovations in build-in battle

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.600
genre.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.280
So we needed a live community
to feedback on everything

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.270
that we were doing.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:49.460
We recruited about 100 top
players and gaming influencers

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.420
to do that for us.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.430
And they helped us
really shape the game.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.320
For Transformers Earth
Wars, for instance, we

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.710
involved some big fan sites
and some gaming influencers,

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.636
and they helped us do
all of the onboarding

00:14:59.636 --> 00:15:01.010
process into the
game, and really

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:05.190
bridge between those fans of the
IP and the built-in battle play

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.410
genre.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.640
But it became harder and harder
to reach those big influencers.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.850
And all the interactions
were becoming

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.710
very much transactional based.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.210
We did a few of these for the
launch of Transformers Earth

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.440
Wars, and actually did
paid content for that.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.667
But what we found is when
someone was making videos

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.750
that they weren't really
passionate about the game

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.090
that they were promoting,
it had two main problems.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.010
One, it didn't
drive any results.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.250
So it didn't really
justify us doing it again.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.860
And two, their community
picked up on the fact

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.300
that they're not being genuine.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.950
And so they were
losing credibility.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.260
So in our opinion, this
isn't a sustainable way

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.330
of doing things.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.210
Rather, we think
that content creation

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.390
should be a product of a
meaningful relationship that

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.950
really offers
something genuinely

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.200
interesting for the
influencer, without asking

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.700
for anything in return.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.410
They have to work
really hard these days

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.530
to keep their channels engaged,
to keep their channels growing,

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.147
to provide their fans
reasons to come back again

00:16:04.147 --> 00:16:04.980
and again and again.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.560
And we have to be a lot
more creative these days,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.310
and think right from
the start of things

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.230
that would create that
inherent interest for them.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.730
Paul was talking
about watchability.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.490
But also things like
integrating them into the game.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.280
Offering them exclusive and
unique content, and things

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.300
like that.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.289
That will actually make
them create content for you,

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:25.830
but not because you
gave them a brief

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.600
and you paid them
pay them some cash,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.790
but because they're
genuinely interested,

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.460
and they genuinely are excited
about their involvement

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.110
in your game.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.820
So how does this
all come together

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.610
for the launch of Fastlane?

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.620
We created a unique
opportunity to get

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.620
be integrated into the
game as a quest giver,

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.000
and give out jobs
that were based

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.970
on real-life interactions and
their Youtube personalities.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.560
By doing that, we ended
up having 21 big YouTubers

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.910
integrated into the game, with
over 50 million subscribers

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.290
in total.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.530
What we did at launch
was a week-long event

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.150
that had all of them featured.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.940
They all kind of
participated in that event.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.089
And then after that, we had
every single weekend an event

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.670
that was either an individual
event or a collaboration

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.990
between some Youtubers.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.079
And what that resulted
in is tons and tons

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:22.869
of videos and social posts all
really promoting passionately

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.240
their involvement in the game.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.480
I've got some examples of the
best executions for you guys

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.260
here.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.220
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.452
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.410
- What's up, everybody?

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.090
Boo Tramp here.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.830
And welcome back to another
video on my channel.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.512
So today we're
playing more Fastlane.

00:17:40.512 --> 00:17:41.970
It's an absolutely
insane game that

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.810
has just come out from
the amazing guys over

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.910
in Space Aid Games.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.220
- All you do is put your
finger, your thumb, your toes,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.110
your nose, anything
on the screen.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.690
- The game carries a
Fastlane, put me in the game.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.105
And it was a good time.

00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:55.230
- And today, we are doing
something really special.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.190
We're going to be
doing some of my event.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.190
- Now every week, there's
going to be a new job.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.700
And it's Youtuber related.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.550
so your favorite Youtuber
is pretty much in this game.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.620
- It's a voodoo doll, and I
will use it now to control you.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.472
- I'm evil now, Jordan.

00:18:09.472 --> 00:18:12.200
You've taken my soul.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.340
- It is evil now.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.450
We need to kill it.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.000
All the voodoo dolls.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.210
- And I'll say the magic
words to undo the voodoo.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.660
Last one, [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.640
OK, we have completed
the next mission.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.840
- The thing you've got to do
here is collecting 200 chests.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.670
Yes, we are-- and there
is the [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:29.750
to collect me some chest.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.380
Oh, yeah, look at that, guys.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.170
I'm collecting all
that good stuff.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.740
- Or if I go for
something else, ah,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.170
that rocket came
out of nowhere, son.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.010
- Oh, yes.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.410
Level 37, I'm almost
level 40, and then I

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.590
can get a new car, which
is called the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.910
- Oh, did you guys see that?

00:18:52.212 --> 00:18:53.622
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:53.622 --> 00:18:54.580
MICKEY ELIMELECH: Cool.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:55.860
Thanks.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.200
So really, in
terms of results, I

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.440
think the most impressive
fact is that at launch week,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.410
this was our second
biggest marketing channel.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.700
It yielded hundreds of
thousands of installs.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.280
And more than that, it created
six months' worth of content

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.670
for us for events in the game.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.040
It drove the most engaged
players, as you can see,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.780
from the D1 retention numbers.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.530
This is a direct product of
that passion that came across

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.600
from the Youtuber
to the community,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.970
really engaging them, getting
them to go in the game.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.650
Check them out as quest givers.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.950
And engage and experience
the game for themselves.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.720
They weren't the
biggest of spenders,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.990
but that's probably
because of the age skew.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.600
I think if I summarize
it all, was it worth it?

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.290
Absolutely.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.100
Definitely, if you've got
volumes in mind for launch.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.650
But if I can leave you
with one thing, it's this.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.360
Please don't take this
specific example as a template.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.580
It's not a template.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.980
It's all about creating
those relationships.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.280
It's all about thinking about
unique and genuine interactions

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.940
with them.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.610
And we believe that we need
to rethink this, and reinvent

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.880
this for every single game.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.380
That's it.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.460
Thank you.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.210
