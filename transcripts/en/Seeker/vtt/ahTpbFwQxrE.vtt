00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.799
What could possibly be more frightening than
climate change, biological warfare, dying,

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.089
and -wait for it- Obamacare?

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.669
What about.... clowns.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:17.610
Hi, jokers, it’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.430
A legitimate phobia of clowns is called coulrophobia.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.220
Although a lot of people are creeped out by
clowns, full-blown coulrophobia is not a common

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.220
phobia.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.840
However, with the rise of creepy clown sightings
across the US and parts of Britain, we wanted

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.740
to know: why are people so afraid of clowns?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.540
Is it an innate fear or a fear born out of
horror films, like “It” and “Killer

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.050
Klowns from Outer Space’?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.360
Well, there is actually some science to back
up why so many people are creeped out by these

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.650
merry pranksters.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.820
A 2008 British survey of approximately 250
children, found that nearly all of them thought

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.239
clowns, regardless if they were intentionally
scary or not, were ‘creepy’.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.180
But how could Bozo the Clown be in the same
category as Pennywise from “It”?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.030
An attribute of many clowns is their unwavering
dedication to sticking with ONE emotion.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.570
A sad clown is always sad.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.880
A happy clown is always smiling.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.759
They wear their emotions like a mask with
painted on makeup and you don’t know what’s

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.189
really going on underneath.

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.380
This creates something called deindividuation,
which is when an individual’s identity is

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.380
obscured.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.490
This applies to everything from burglars wearing
masks to individuals commenting anonymously

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.749
online-- ahem trolls.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.740
Evolutionary Psychologist Glenn Geher says
that people who are in a state of deindividuation

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.270
are more likely to engage in despicable behavior,
like cheating and stealing.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.249
So when we encounter someone like this, we
quote, “expect them to act at their worst.”

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:42.110
Humans don’t do well with uncertainty, including
unpredictable behavior.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.490
In a study released by New Directions in Psychology,
researchers argued that creepiness was a bi-product

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.950
of ambiguity.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.109
People feel fear when they know something
is going to hurt them, but if they are unsure

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.540
of someone’s behavior, the mere threat leaves
them ‘creeped out’.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.139
According to the co-author of the study, psychology
professor Francis T. McAndrew, clowns are,

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:04.130
quote “mischievous, which puts people constantly
on guard.”

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.130
Think about it.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.681
You never know what you’re gonna get with
a clown!

00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:11.049
I mean, jeez, if clown car pulls up you don’t
know if you’re gonna be ambushed by 1, 5,

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.069
or 30 clowns.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.550
Talk about about uncertainty.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.650
For someone with coulrophobia, a clown car
is the ultimate nightmare.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.140
Now, clowns also fall into a psychological
category called “Uncanny Valley”.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.739
Freud came up with the term “uncanny”
to describe the phenomenon that humans experience

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.819
when they see something that is familiar but
is somehow off.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.490
And the term “Uncanny Valley” was first
coined by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.909
and includes almost human-like creatures that
aren’t quite human; they sort of trick our

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.140
brain, which in turn, creeps us out.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.080
Like lifelike animatronic humans or a ventriloquist
dummy.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.530
Clowns are human but they are an exaggerated
version of ourselves.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.700
That makes them fit in the “uncanny valley”
valley.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.560
And a lot of clowns are stuck in a permanent
smile.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.910
When someone smiles at you, your brain often
interprets it as a nice, safe gesture.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.900
But the brain can detect a fake or an unnatural
smile.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.510
According to Harvard professor of Psychiatry
Dr. Steven Schlozman, your brain recognizes

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.750
that when someone smiles ALL the time, there
is something off, as with clowns.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.489
Makes you wonder what their true intention
is- do they want to hug you or murder you

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.310
in your sleep.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.450
So if you have a mild to severe fear of clowns,
you’re not alone.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.260
But remember clowns are people too.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.849
Even the creepy ones.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.739
If you want to know more about the uncanny
valley and its effects, guess what, we have

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.170
a video about that that goes into more depth.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.170
And what about you?

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.660
Do you like clowns, dislike clowns or are
a clown?!

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.160
