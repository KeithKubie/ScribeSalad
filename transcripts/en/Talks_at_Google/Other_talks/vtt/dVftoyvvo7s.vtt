MALE SPEAKER:
Without further ado,

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.939
I am thrilled to introduce
Jean Baptiste Huynh who

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.780
is one of the people
who's out there working

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.750
in the educational game space,
who are building games that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.180
actually look like games.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.260
And we've been talking about
the space with some colleagues

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.090
for quite some time that we need
more games that look like this.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.750
If we're going to push change
and educational achievement,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.930
we need games that
actually feel like games,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.740
and Jean has created some
very graceful games for us

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.440
and he's going to give us an
introduction to them today.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.940
Thank you.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.148
Please welcome Jean Baptiste.

00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:38.946
JEAN BAPTISTE HUYNH: Thank you.

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:39.946
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:43.060
JEAN BAPTISTE HUYNH:
I don't know if it's

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.080
me who found this title.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.800
I guess not.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.970
Maybe it's you.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.000
Redesigning the math experience,
lessons from Dragonbox.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.530
So redesigning the math
experience-- that's the title.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.470
Why do we want to do that?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.980
And I need to start with that
because my son, one of my sons,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.900
14 years old, last time he
came, it was in the kitchen,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.359
and he said, daddy, why
are you doing what you do?

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.400
When you get that kind of
question from your son,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.950
you have to think twice,
maybe three times.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.370
I'm working really hard
to make this happen.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.200
And I said, well, my son,
why do they do that, yeah?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.920
I guess I want all kids to learn
math more rapidly, much faster.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:50.210
And he posed, and he
looked at me and said,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.360
it's a job for nothing.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:01.590
Because if you're successful
and kids can learn faster math,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.280
the game of school
will change anyway

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.720
so that the requirements
for kids-- you see my point?

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.250
They will be higher.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.940
There will always be
inflation about what

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.510
we require for kids went to
enter the best universities.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.570
But then the question
is will the universities

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.510
as we know them today change.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.910
This I don't know.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.380
But I had to think twice really.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.000
But I can not but design the
games and the experiences

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.700
that I'm making.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.740
So I'm going to
keep on doing that,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.640
although my kid is
really skeptical,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190
which is a bit weird.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.490
I guess maybe he wants
me to be home more.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.420
So basically, yeah,
it's a beautiful picture

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.900
I received from a foundation.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.545
They are using one of our
games in South Africa.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.340
I do the games also to
get this, more of this.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.630
I was a teacher for
a couple of years.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.420
Before that, I was
working in finance

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.280
as a stock portfolio manager.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.450
As a teacher, it's very seldom,
especially in high school,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.080
that kind of yes, natural
way to say I mastered that.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.770
It was a little bit
difficult, but I got it.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.600
And then maybe you
experience that kind

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.790
of feeling from time to time
in your work-- a difficult task

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.450
and then, yes!

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.470
And basically that's
what I want kids

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.930
to get as a feeling every
day, basically, when

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.295
they start learning something.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:37.230
It should be yes,
I can manage that.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.570
And they are empowered
by what they've learned.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.840
This is the big motivation.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.630
So I have spent the
last eight years

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.950
of my life trying to increase
the productivity of math

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.130
teaching.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.080
And from teaching, I'm
more into learning now

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.940
because the role
of the teacher is

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.610
changing in my head at least.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.450
So let's say we want to
redesign the way we teach math

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.780
or learn math.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.110
So what do we need to change?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.610
So these are the
usual challenges

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:19.240
in a classroom-- problems of
motivation, difficult subjects,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.079
meaning here we're
talking about pedagogy.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.820
Even if you have a
kid really engaged

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.070
and you have a kid who really
wants to learn something,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.490
sometimes it's really
hard to learn it.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.390
And it's not because the
subject is really hard, I think.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.840
On here it's very normative.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.950
That's my view on the subject.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.520
I think it's
because we have used

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.350
too little time to design a
way to communicate the subject

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.430
property.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.986
So it's about pedagogy.

00:04:50.986 --> 00:04:52.110
It's about representations.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.770
And we'll come
back later to that.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.980
The communication
barrier-- as a teacher,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.460
like what I'm doing now,
I'm talking talking.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.880
We talk too much in school,
and kids are not active enough.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.277
And sometimes, you want
to communicate a big idea

00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:15.860
and you don't have
the tools to do it.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.130
And the language we use,
especially the oral language,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.430
is pretty bad actually
because of the short memory

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.890
and other stuff that I know,
but I have the intuition

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.790
that it's not effective at all.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.300
The more you talk,
the less people

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.690
understand usually,
in a classroom.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.800
You have time constraints
in a classroom,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.140
and you have one teacher
usually and 30 kids.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.670
And you're a big loser.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.090
You want to
communicate something,

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.385
it's really not good at
all, especially in math.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.370
Maybe I did not mention
something very important.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.190
It's the fact that usually when
we learn, we need feedback.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.050
In the classroom there's
very little feedback.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.100
You can make the calculation
that if you spend two minutes

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.580
to give feedback to
a student, you're

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.350
going to spend your
time doing feedback

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.060
and never teach
anything actually.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.880
If we want to change
things as well,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.680
I think it's important
to understand

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.170
the difference between learning,
practice, and assessment.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.940
Especially in my work, people
don't know the difference.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.030
When they buy an education
app or a solution,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.620
they are served with a
quiz, an adaptive quiz

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.370
maybe, but still a quiz.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.750
You can learn from a
quiz maybe a little bit.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.310
You might be motivated by it.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.700
But there is no real
learning component in it.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.050
So the assessment industry
is a billion dollar industry,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.190
the practice
industry maybe less,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.810
and learning industry
really per se, today,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.180
that's teachers,
books, and tutoring.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.592
We don't have any tools
really to learn or teach

00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:15.810
better, that are really
designed from a very

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.930
sound pedagogical viewpoint.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.160
So I wanted really
to make a point here.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.320
Learning is not done
by anyone almost.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.480
It might be provoking.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.610
You might consider I'm crazy.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.800
But my experience
is that nobody's

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.830
doing research and
development in this field,

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.510
and it's a pity in
a knowledge society.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.830
It's a little bit weird,
actually-- very weird.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.220
So how can we change that?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.410
So we know the challenges.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.590
And the only way
we can change that

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.390
is really to understand
how kids get motivated

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.920
and how they learn.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.840
How do we do that?

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.710
And I guess there's
only one way to do it.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.310
You have to put yourself
at the same level as kids.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.210
You have to listen
to your customers.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:15.490
And already there are many
teachers who understand this.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.270
Usually, teachers don't
have the time to observe.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.419
They don't have the
time to reflect.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.960
And they don't have the means
to act upon the reflection they

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.060
might have.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.970
OK?

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.770
So the process to change things,
it takes time and energy.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.679
But that's the only
solution if you

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.820
want to change this
educational landscape

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.220
and get really good tools.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.800
So when I was a teacher,
I tried many things.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.970
I had actually a partner
and we designed a couple

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.180
of solutions, IT solutions.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.430
I tested many, many solutions.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.750
At the beginning, it was
pretty teacher-centered.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.800
I needed tools, administrative
tools, to gain time.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.010
But at the end of
the day, really,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.960
it was very clear that a
big part of the solutions

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.910
are video games, or they
were video games at the time.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:18.520
It was really very
simple, very clear.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.650
So why?

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.470
I don't say it's
the only solution.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.150
It's just part of the solution
and we have not invested enough

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.630
in this solution.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.850
So why it might
work and why I do

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.810
believe we can
change dramatically

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.510
the effectiveness of teaching
and learning mathematics?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.750
Well, through games
you can create

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.190
a context that motivates kids.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.590
It's about the context.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.100
Some kids are motivated by
the context of school, grades.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.650
And it works.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.490
It's OK.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.380
Social context might work.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.820
There are many ways to get
motivated to do well in school

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.681
and to learn.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.180
The beauty with video games is
that you can create something

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.460
really out of the
blue almost that

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.700
is going to motivate
the majority of kids.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.390
What I do love with video
games-- and I have to say,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.100
I'm not a gamer myself.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.680
It's just I'm a game
designer by accident.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.550
It's because I want to
teach more effectively.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.260
And therefore I need to
do what it takes to do it.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.050
So I have to design
games, right?

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.320
In video games, you can
create digital manipulatives.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.620
So what are manipulatives?

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.550
That's objects,
physical, generally,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:38.110
that you can use in school
to manipulate stuff and get

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:43.080
an intuition, a
bodily intuition,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.590
of what the concepts are.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.780
In a video game, you can do
that in a digital version,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.690
and you can add all
the feedbacks you want.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:59.000
So if I would recommend
or give advice

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.567
to people who want to
get into this industry,

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:05.150
the first thing I
think you have to do

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.120
is create these
digital manipulatives.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.110
And it's not only in
mathematics, actually.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.502
I think it's for everything.

00:11:12.502 --> 00:11:13.710
You want to manipulate stuff.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.230
It's the most intuitive
way to learn stuff.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.100
So it's very normative again.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.775
I think we learned by metaphors.

00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:21.900
At the beginning, it's
physical metaphors, and then

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.858
metaphors on metaphors.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.500
But for the basic
learning stuff,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.965
physical metaphors are
good, or digital metaphors.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.410
Autonomy, you get that, of
course, in a video game.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.120
You can advance
at your own pace.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.060
Time on task high if you have
the subject in the game play.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.790
And that's the reason why
it was very important to me

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.350
to create an experience
where whatever you do

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.990
is manipulating these digital
manipulatives, actually

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.360
math concepts.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.750
So whatever you do,
as soon as you play,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.960
you're actually playing
with math concepts.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.700
So your time on task
is super, super high.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.860
And in school, it's
super, super low.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.040
And that is a reason
why I say we can really

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.668
change the efficacy of
teaching and learning.

00:12:12.668 --> 00:12:14.520
And it's an
individual experience.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:22.290
So much more effective when you
can experience stuff yourself

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.620
and create your
own understanding.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.240
So when I realized that
video games were part

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.080
of the solution-- so it was
purely theoretical there,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.880
right?-- I gathered a couple
of people I thought would be

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.080
interested in this mission
to create video games,

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.850
learning video games.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.270
And we had a
brainstorming session.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.090
And here are the
constraints I used.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:55.560
So I've been a very influenced
by two people, Betty Edwards

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.700
and Tim Galloway.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.220
Betty Edwards has
written this book.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.350
She wrote this
book about drawing

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.680
on the right side of the brain.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.030
And she divides the methodology
to learn to draw things

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.130
in, I think, a week.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.220
And Tim Galloway
devised a solution

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.970
to teach anyone to play
tennis in 20 minutes.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.310
So I discovered these two guys
on the page of the Research

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.200
Viewpoint Institute that
was created by Alan Kay.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.270
And it resonated a
lot, what I've read.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.400
They wrote two books, Betty
Edwards and Tim Galloway.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.980
"The Inner Game
of Tennis," that's

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.790
the name of the book, the title
of the book of Tim Galloway.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:46.060
And they had the same
problem as I had, actually.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.520
Or I had the same
problem as they had.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.750
The more they talked,
the less people

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.520
understood what they
wear meant to learn.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.380
So they had to really
to question their roles.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.550
And to some extent,
they understood

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:07.070
that they were a kind of barrier
between the subject they wanted

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.880
to teach and the
player or the learner.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.540
And it felt exactly the same
with me with mathematics.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:22.650
So the first very
important design principle

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.790
in all the games we're
making-- no words.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.480
Eventually, it might
be a few words,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.060
but at the very beginning, I
don't want to have any words.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.255
I want to have a very
intuitive experience.

00:14:36.255 --> 00:14:37.380
You can manipulation stuff.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.300
You're going to
discover yourself

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.280
how it works, the
characteristics of the math

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.280
concepts.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.570
And it's a very
difficult constraint.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:54.730
but at the same time, it's a
constraint that when it works,

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.770
it works so beautifully.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.310
No prerequisite--
that means that anyone

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.820
can play the game
you're going to design.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.550
And something very,
very important,

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.080
the big ideas of mathematics.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.460
I'm not interested in
teaching a small chunk

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.490
or bit of the curriculum.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.160
I don't care about
the curriculum

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.930
when I design the games.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.200
And it makes people crazy.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.475
They say, ugh, you
cannot sell that.

00:15:20.475 --> 00:15:21.870
And we don't sell that much.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.160
That's true.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:29.290
But I think that eventually
we will win this battle.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.070
The more games that we
create, the more likely people

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:38.820
are to understand the power
of the tools we create, right?

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.700
So I used to give as an
example functions in math.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.940
You start with a linear
function and then

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.740
second order functions, and
then polynomial function.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.170
One year later, maybe a bit
of logarithmic function.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.940
One year later, a little
bit of exponential function.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.950
A little bit later, maybe a
combination of all of them

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.250
and so on.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.450
It takes-- I don't
know-- five, six years

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.580
to see the different occurrences
of the type of functions,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.750
the regular functions
that we use.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.580
And functions, you know there's
an infinity of functions.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.370
So how can you learn what a
function is with one occurrence

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.670
of a function?

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.160
It's impossible.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.760
And still, we teach
it this way, right?

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.140
If I present a dog, you have
never seen a dog, and I say,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.490
this is a dog.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.340
Well, I don't know what a
dog is with one occurrence.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.950
Maybe I see a cat and
I think it's a dog.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.904
No, it's a cat.

00:16:37.904 --> 00:16:38.820
What's the difference?

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.870
So I insist in my
team that I want

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.590
to teach the big ideas
so that kids can really

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.435
see the patterns.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.800
And it does have an effect.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.530
The power of teaching the big
ideas is extremely powerful.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.760
It's really, really powerful.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.550
Now we're designing a new game,
and we cover maybe five years

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.770
in just one game.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.790
In two months-- I don't
know how much time

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.150
it will take to play it.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.200
But it's really big differences.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:24.990
And mathematics is really,
actually, not always,

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.440
but it's pretty consistent.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.595
What's not consistent is the
language we use to teach it.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.770
Now we have four
years experience

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.640
designing those kinds of games.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:43.200
I'm amazed by the
lack of consistency

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.060
in the way we teach it
and the language we use.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:52.352
Not only do we not use the
same symbols across the globe,

00:17:52.352 --> 00:17:54.060
like the minus sign
might be the division

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.220
sign in some countries, a
minus sign in other countries.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.270
And you think what?

00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.770
Right?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:10.390
The minus is both an
operation and it's also

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.620
the sign for negative numbers.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.130
How do you distinguish the two?

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.785
So you have many problems of
design or in representation.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.520
I'm French, and with numbers
we say quatre-vingt for 80.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.579
Quatre-vingt is four by twenty.

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:31.620
And in English, the same.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.850
You say eleven
instead of ten-one.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.830
And it's small
details like that.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:43.015
It makes the work to learn stuff
very complicated, unnecessarily

00:18:43.015 --> 00:18:43.515
complicated.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.620
Two hours.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.550
Why two hours?

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.150
I don't know I just say we have
to go very quickly to the goal.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.250
So two hours.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.480
That's what we have.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.860
That's a constraint.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.230
One game, not many, many
activities and so on.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.810
I want really an experience
with the digital manipulative,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.830
the concept, and you're going to
learn through this experience.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.230
So it should be one game
with math in the game play.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.790
And it's very natural because
the only thing you do actually

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.500
in our games is to
manipulate math concepts

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.350
with another
representation, but still

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.240
math concepts with the
characteristics that are math.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.830
So math should be
in the game play.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.590
So we designed these
digital manipulatives,

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:34.860
and after a while, we see what's
the game with this concept?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.230
Actually, with numbers for
example, what's the game there?

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.420
And actually, we discovered
a game with kids.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.050
It's to create the
highest number.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.950
This is a fantastic
game for kids.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.860
They want to go forever,
towards eternity maybe,

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.030
or infinity at least.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.890
It's beautiful.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.040
So I'm going to go through
the three games we have made,

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:04.870
or are making, and
highlight some learnings.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.110
So the first thing
is representations.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.550
I mentioned that
problem of language.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.750
This is the prototype on paper.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.810
All the games are prototyped
paper and tested on paper.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.550
It goes much, much, much, much
faster-- really, really fast.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.850
Some people say, well, no.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.342
It takes me no
time to develop it.

00:20:25.342 --> 00:20:26.050
I can program it.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:26.780
No, no.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.630
Forget about it.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.490
You cannot iterate on that.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.680
I take a piece of paper.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.590
I cut and so on.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.860
I test.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.135
In three hours, I'm done.

00:20:34.135 --> 00:20:36.250
I have a first iteration, right?

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.920
So this problem
of representation

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.370
is really, really key.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.570
If you want to learn
something faster,

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.130
I think you have to work
with the representations.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.400
Not only in mathematics.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.105
It can be other subjects.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.260
A key challenge-- now I'm
thinking of marketing.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.330
Not only marketing, but
actually disseminating

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.710
the value of your work.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.950
It's that if you change
the representation of math,

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.430
the majority of
people will never

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.310
understand what you're doing.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.280
And when I to say the
majority, it's 99.999%.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.660
So it's a challenge.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.270
It's bit too innovative maybe.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.960
For kids, it doesn't
play any role.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:28.810
Because they learn math
with this representation,

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.640
and it's math.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.140
Once you have understood the
concept the underlying concept,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.830
then to change
the representation

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.888
doesn't cause any
problem for kids.

00:21:40.888 --> 00:21:45.310
On the contrary, adults, if
you show a new representation

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.160
for something they know,
they are really disturbed.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:04.760
So some people ask me how did
you get the idea for this game?

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.010
Well, it started with
a simple challenge.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:15.030
It was to get my son to
understand negative numbers.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.510
That's negative numbers, the
kind of symmetry you have.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:23.210
And I wanted to show it to
him in a very elegant way.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.550
And certainly it exists.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.160
I don't know.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.870
I put it a card, and I
put a number on one face,

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.720
and on the other face
I put minus 1, so 1

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.380
minus 1, 2 minus
2-- very simple.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.740
It's really logic, actually.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.620
And little by little, I
cannot explain what happened,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.350
something happened in my brain.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.120
And I was thinking, wow, we
could do that with everything,

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.110
and maybe with algebra.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.121
We could design this
game with cards.

00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:53.620
Oh yeah.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.980
Well, let's do it.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:23:00.170
And then I cut a lot of
paper and tested the game.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.200
I had no experience
really with testing games.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.380
I am not a game designer, right?

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.320
But I saw my kids, they were
getting the rules very quickly.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.070
So I was thinking,
wow, it's working?

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.622
And I was thinking, wow,
it's working really fast!

00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:15.080
So then I was
thinking, well, let's

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.907
make a game about that, right?

00:23:16.907 --> 00:23:18.490
It was after the
brainstorming session

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.285
I had with my now colleagues.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:30.130
What does it take to go from
this prototype to do this?

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:37.745
Well, a year, 10 hours a day.

00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:41.580
The last month, 20 hours a day.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.610
Doesn't seem too complicated,
but it was really challenging.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.550
So we started with
this representation.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:53.100
So I wanted really kids to
get a very intuitive way

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.290
to perceive what equations
are with a simple rule

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.490
or simple game goal.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:06.200
Isolate the unknown, right,
for linear equations.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.910
And I don't pay attention
to the curriculum, right?

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.710
But I don't pay attention to
the formalism of mathematics

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.580
either.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.340
So I can really
innovate as I want.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.170
So I said, well, one
line's so boring.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.720
Let's put that in
two dimensions.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.720
And then a colleague of
mine said, oh, we should

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.990
do that in three dimensions.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.860
So we could do that too.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.480
I put the cards, and it was OK.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.160
It worked pretty well.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:39.310
And then we were thinking,
yeah, but this is equation

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.530
solving in two dimensions.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.660
We've no operators,
no signs as usual.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.710
We were pretty satisfied by
that because it was a real game.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.950
When we playtested it,
it was working really

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:57.900
fantastic-- extremely powerful.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.510
So powerful that at
the birthday of my son,

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:07.570
he was nine at the time, I
put a tablet on the table.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.510
Kids were playing poker.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.902
So I said can you please
playtest this for me?

00:25:12.902 --> 00:25:13.860
And they said, well OK.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.080
And at the end of the birthday,
they were not playing poker.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.740
They were around the table
playing this game in this form

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.950
together, social process.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.894
But it was a fantastic
experience for me.

00:25:25.894 --> 00:25:26.810
But it was not enough.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:32.051
Because if I show that either to
teachers or parents or whoever,

00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:33.050
they don't see anything.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.345
They don't see it's equations.

00:25:36.345 --> 00:25:39.440
They think well, nice
game, Jean Baptiste.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.150
It's not math.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.375
I was thinking deep down
inside, but this is not math.

00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.750
It's just another
representation,

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.830
but it's equation solving.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.090
So we had to scratch
our heads many times

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:55.440
and go, well, shall we go
to the normal formalism?

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.230
We didn't know we could do
that, actually, at the time.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.110
So it took us really
a lot not of energy

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:08.070
but a lot of-- what would
be the word for that?

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.820
It's counter intuitive for
me to go in that direction.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.780
I was pretty satisfied
with this one.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.101
And a lot of effort, mental
efforts, to say well,

00:26:17.101 --> 00:26:17.850
we're going there.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.270
And I was thinking, it's
going to get boring.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:25.495
So we introduced equal and plus.

00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:28.370
And it didn't make any
difference to kids.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.880
So it was just a
lot of learning.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.650
Wow, really?

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.150
The representation
doesn't matter to kids

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.597
once they have
understood the concept.

00:26:36.597 --> 00:26:38.180
And then we were
thinking, well, shall

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:44.900
we dare put some letters
just to see what's going on?

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.580
And to kids, it
just doesn't matter.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.480
It's the same game.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.070
And the beauty-- I don't
know if you see here.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.320
In the equation,
you see a box there.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.670
The box at the top left,
that's the unknown.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:08.950
And there are some glow
or some stars around it.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.550
It's kind of a
meta-concept, right?

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.070
That's the unknown.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.690
We changed that to the x.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.610
And many parents came to us.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.060
They had playtested that
themselves as adults.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.330
And they were complaining.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.800
They thought that our design
was really, really bad,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.990
that we were doing a bad job.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.420
It's never going to work.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.060
Kids would never understand
that the box there and the x,

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.860
it's the same object.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.580
Many, many-- and they
were furious at us,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.630
angry, pretty red
reaction sometimes.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.480
It's never going to work.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.510
I would never use that.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.650
It's never going to-- And
kids, how long does it

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.630
take for them to understand
that the box and the x

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.210
is the same thing?

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.560
I can tell you-- a millisecond.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.910
A question, where is the box?

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.650
Oh, it's there.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:05.160
Case closed.

00:28:08.335 --> 00:28:11.140
So we had a first
version of the game.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.090
It took a year to do with
very simple linear equation.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:19.430
And it took us a year
again to do a new game

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.310
with much more learning.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.880
And then we put parentheses.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.950
So we found a
metaphor of bubbles.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.490
We added negative numbers,
so you can flip everything.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.160
Fractions.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.290
And you can create your
own variable or parameter

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.570
with this box there.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.000
It's extremely powerful.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.770
You will need that for
integrals and so on.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.100
And it worked pretty well.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.930
But it's a little
bit too much maybe.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:50.190
It takes six hours
to perform the game.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.630
So not all kids are
motivated to go to the end.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.170
And it's not a problem.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.030
I mean, you cannot get all
the kids, all the time.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:04.660
Even a normal game
would not achieve that.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.780
So for us, it's a tool.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.320
We are making tools, right?

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.430
So I guess with this
first game, we really

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.340
understood the power
of representations,

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.615
intermediate representations,
and how powerful the brain is.

00:29:20.615 --> 00:29:24.120
As soon as you
understand patterns,

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.960
you can change a few
things, but you will still

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.400
recognize the patterns.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.140
Maybe something else
I should add on that.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:43.020
As a teacher, I used to spend
some time preparing my lessons.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.200
And one day-- it's more
than a day actually--

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.190
I spent during a week,
20, 28 hours to prepare

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.270
a lesson of two hours.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.520
28 hours for two hours.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.576
No teacher is doing that, right?

00:29:57.576 --> 00:30:01.000
I was doing that just
as an experiment.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.835
And I got marginal better
results, only marginal.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:14.560
That kind of game is made
by a multidisciplinary team

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.690
with game designers, art
directors, really experts,

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.460
28 years of experience.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.970
So basically it's
four, five people

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.125
during a year
preparing this lesson.

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:29.000
It's not just a short
lesson, because there's

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.920
so much learning, right?

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.936
So what's going on there?

00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:34.810
Yeah, that's the right
way to do it, I think.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.730
New industry, new
tools, new productivity.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.120
So after algebra.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.300
We were wondering which
game we should make.

00:30:54.792 --> 00:30:56.250
It was kind of
difficult, actually.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.846
And at the end of the
day, we picked geometry,

00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:04.720
and there were a lot of
fights within our team.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.700
Because we had different goals.

00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:16.580
If you don't know this book,
that's "Euclid's Elements."

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.840
It's a version by Oliver Byrne.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:25.280
I had never actually
read "Euclid's Elements."

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.614
This is beautiful.

00:31:26.614 --> 00:31:27.530
It's a beautiful book.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.570
It's a piece of art.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.670
Oliver Byrne, in the
late 19th century,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:37.440
he was thinking, well, students
struggle to read this book.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.530
Only written language,
small shapes and so on.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.780
No colors-- nothing.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.110
Really, really dry.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.210
So he decided to create
a new representation

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.560
for angles and so on.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.010
And it's beautiful.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.670
And actually you can read
that, you can read proof,

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:05.890
prepositions, theorems, and so
on just like a novel almost.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.650
And it's very satisfying
because it's very consistent.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:14.800
There are flaws in "Euclid's
Elements," as you might know.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.320
But still you perceive
the consistency

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.810
on the logic behind
mathematics, I

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.780
mean, with that kind
of geometry, right?

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:31.810
And the fight was
the beauty of this

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.190
and what I meant was very
important to kids, my kids,

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:37.440
in particular.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.830
When you study
mathematics later on,

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:47.070
you really have to never
forget how you prove stuff.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.595
That's the key element.

00:32:49.595 --> 00:32:53.320
And I've been to elitist
schools in France and so on.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.190
I mean, they do nothing to
teach you these basic elements--

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.180
nothing, zero.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.310
On the contrary, I
wanted really to design

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:07.960
a game that teaches kids proof.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:13.840
Not only proof, I wanted to
train the brains of our kids

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.830
to understand that you
can also use creativity

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.130
when you do proofs.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.330
And if you are familiar
with "Euclid's Elements,"

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:28.590
the beauty is that you have
both a construction and proof.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.680
Why is that?

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.470
Of course, if you
just draw stuff,

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.750
you never know if the
technique you used is correct.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.630
Might be just random chance.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.220
So you need to prove all the
construction methodologies

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.084
that you build.

00:33:44.084 --> 00:33:44.750
And this is key.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.270
We're running out of time
and money at this time.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.920
And we had started with
the construction game.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:00.610
And part of my team was saying,
well, let's release this game.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.990
I say I will never
release this game.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.060
Why?

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.680
Because we had some
levels that you

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.179
could, because of
the approximations,

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:15.159
reach a goal, that
you wanted build,

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:20.530
but it was not really the
truth, if truth exists.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:26.179
And it was very obvious that
you wanted to get the proof,

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.030
to prove that what
you drew is correct

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.280
and you have really
reached this point.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.449
And they were stressed.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:35.920
We had a lot of back and forth.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.400
And it's really demanding
to create a game.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.350
And they say, well,
let's release the game.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.070
And I say, no, we
don't release the game.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.600
We don't have any
money, but still I

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.533
want to go towards proof.

00:34:45.533 --> 00:34:46.199
So we met again.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:50.409
We got proof but without
the creativity component.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.770
If you remember
geometry, sometimes you

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.449
can draw a segment and
it appears a shape,

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:58.300
like a triangle or
something like that.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.050
And then you can use that
to prove other stuff, based

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.360
on the properties of the
new shape you have drawn.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.545
So we made this game.

00:35:10.545 --> 00:35:12.320
And if you're
interested in marketing,

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.260
we call that "Dragonbox
Elements," because it was

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.960
about proof and not geometry.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.320
And the majority of people
have never heard of elements,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.880
so they didn't catch it
was about geometry proof.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.100
But still called
"Dragonbox Elements."

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.385
I like it, but apparently people
are a bit confused by that.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:44.730
We changed the representations
of, for example, a trapezoid.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.000
That's the figure, the
shape, you see there,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.220
this guy with two wings.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.710
We had to find a
representation--

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.670
I will show you that on the
iPad-- of parallel lines.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.650
Because remember, the
constraint is no language.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.450
So we had to find a
new representation,

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.610
graphical representation,
for all the properties

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.590
of the shapes.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.310
And it worked pretty
well, and kids love it.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:13.490
And they see really the
consistency and the beauty

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.460
in proving stuff.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.270
This is by far one of the
most important, I think,

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.470
games for mathematics that
you can give to your kid.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:26.370
And you need to ask your
kids after playing this

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.780
what are you doing there?

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.620
Well, I want to
find this monster

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.969
but I'm missing some
information and evidence.

00:36:33.969 --> 00:36:36.510
And you need to train that, not
only for mathematics but also

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.035
for writing.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.840
It's a process.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.690
You need to argue.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.080
You need to build
your argumentation,

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.350
and you need to be trained.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:51.280
And again, here, the
time on task is 100%.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.930
Everything you do is proof.

00:36:57.746 --> 00:36:59.370
So different
representations and so on.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.950
Yeah.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.560
So after we worked with
this geometry proof game,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.000
we still had a bit of
money, and actually we

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.440
made some money on that energy.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.820
And we were thinking,
what do we do now?

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.600
And we perceived that, where is
the limit between entertainment

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.100
and learning?

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.820
And I do know that some people
think that you shouldn't

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.080
create specific learning games.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.700
And I agree.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.810
I don't like the
expression learning games.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:32.910
And I don't like the fact
that we target specifically

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:33.550
learning.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.480
But at the same
time, mathematics

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.431
is, to me, at
least, just a game.

00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:39.430
I'm not a game designer.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.120
I just take the game of math,
and I reveal it in a game.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.560
So I just work with the
representations, right?

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.080
But still I was
wondering is there really

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.550
a limit between entertainment
and that kind of learning?

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:59.730
And not only my intuition
but the playtests

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:04.080
tend to prove that
actually there is no limit.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.560
There is no limit,
especially for younger ages.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.490
Everything is just
play and games.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.580
And if you take math,
it's just another game,

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.230
and it's very
consistent-- therefore,

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.850
it's an even better game.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:26.600
So these days we're
working with numbers.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.780
We have a very ambitious goal
to cover the full primary school

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:37.760
mathematics curriculum
with three games.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:43.290
Other ways we test
things with prototypes

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.980
on paper and
different mechanisms

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.360
and to get a sense
of what the game is.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.396
And after a while, we end
up with new representations

00:38:51.396 --> 00:38:54.250
and new environments.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.460
This is number one, number
two, number three, number four.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.640
All of them are characters.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.730
They have their
own personalities.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.880
And they have properties that
are math properties, actually.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.560
And kids just enjoy it.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:13.750
Maybe what I want to mention
there to get the entertainment

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.331
value, it's not only
because of the graphics.

00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:18.580
Of course, the game mechanics
are extremely important.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.800
And the social
components are important.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.800
But still, the fact that you
can get this graphic value

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.110
due to the fact that it's
appealing, it's important

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.220
and it has a huge
value, I think, to kids.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:40.302
And then I say that there
are extremely no boundaries

00:39:40.302 --> 00:39:41.760
between entertainment
and learning.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.384
It's the same for kids, really.

00:39:44.384 --> 00:39:46.800
And in the playtest, kids can
play that forever-- forever.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.625
I've talked mainly about
games, but games are nothing.

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.860
It's just a resource, right?

00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:03.240
And as a teacher and educator,
you cannot stop there.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.580
What you're interested in is the
learning experience, not only

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.480
the design of games.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.170
You're interested in
the full ecosystem.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.000
What's going on?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.560
How can your resources be used?

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.010
What kind of use
cases do you have?

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:24.830
And actually, what we are doing
now is putting a lot of energy

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:29.050
on how can we design the
learning experience, not only

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.460
the game?

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:34.110
So the social context
is extremely important.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.650
This is a picture
from Norway, where

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.165
we organized a big competition.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:48.090
Some 40 or 50,000
kids were registered.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:54.560
Maybe 40,000 played during
a week, class against class,

00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:00.020
highest number of equations
solved per student.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.720
You would win an iPad
if your class wins.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.370
Kids were playing at night.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.490
40% of the time was
played outside the school

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:15.390
time, a beautiful experience.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:18.020
Bigger scale, right?

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:23.160
A little anecdote--
so the competition

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.720
was be opened by the
prime minister in Norway,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.760
where I'm based.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:35.800
And at 8:15, I received
a call from a colleague.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.490
Hello, Jean Baptiste.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.860
I think we have a problem.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.060
Many teachers are complaining.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.540
The servers crashed.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.740
I mean, you work at Google.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.820
So you know what it means.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.790
Something that we
had not foreseen

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.290
is the fact that
many teachers wanted

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.780
to participate in that
because the normal school

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.210
days are so boring.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:05.970
And all of them had planned
to start playing at 8:00.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.410
Beautiful anecdote.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:15.120
I guess I lost two years
of my life stressing

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.460
like hell because the prime
minister would come and open

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.650
the ceremony.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.020
We were in a classroom,
and kids were there.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:22.920
I cannot connect.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.920
I cannot connect.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.780
And there was just journalists,
TV, press-- everyone was there

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.890
and that it was
really a nightmare.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.650
And we did this project with
the University of Washington

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.060
with Zoran Popovitch,
Center for Game Science.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.442
Nine hours difference, so
for them during the tonight.

00:42:42.442 --> 00:42:43.650
So it was really a nightmare.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.640
But they did a fantastic job.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:48.940
We just lost 15,000 kids.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.500
And I guess the
confidence and interest

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.062
from thousands of teachers.

00:42:55.062 --> 00:42:56.770
They will never come
back to us, I guess.

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:58.100
I don't know.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.830
And why do I say that?

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.130
Innovation is about
experimenting.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.600
It's about failures as well.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.960
And that's the learning process.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.160
You cannot avoid it.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.200
You can think a lot-- hard.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.420
You're going to fail sometimes.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.460
And what I perceive as very
difficult in the school system,

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.620
generally speaking, is
that you're not allowed

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.880
to fail many times, right?

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:33.920
So how to create a culture for
testing new stuff at a larger

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.190
scale?

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.680
Because sometimes a pilot is OK.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.654
Usually pilots work.

00:43:39.654 --> 00:43:41.070
Its when you have
the bigger scale

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:43.070
that things are really
getting exciting

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.944
and where you
discover new things.

00:43:45.944 --> 00:43:47.360
So that was the
Algebra Challenge.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.740
That's the name of the event.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.970
We've run that in a couple
of states in the US.

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.050
We had that in Norway.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.740
We're going to have
that in Uruguay soon.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.210
Data, yeah.

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:02.770
So imagine you're a teacher.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.484
You are teaching as usual.

00:44:05.484 --> 00:44:07.150
You have prepared for
you lesson for one

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:13.350
to two hours, maybe
less, giving your lesson.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.840
And when it's finished,
it's finished.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.370
You don't know what happened.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:21.296
You don't know how
kids have learned.

00:44:21.296 --> 00:44:22.670
You don't know
what they learned.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.230
You're going to know that when
you're going to give a test.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.760
And the kids will know if
they have learned two weeks

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.110
after the test has been given.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.840
So you have cycles of
something like a month

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:38.300
or a month and a half before
we know what's going on.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.160
Usually with the
game of school we

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.910
know already what's going on.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:44.410
Actually, it's not
necessary to play this game.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.260
The good students are
still the good students.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.180
Some accidents sometimes.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:54.340
And the students who have lost
their self confidence, maybe

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.340
self esteem, they are losers.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.340
They accept that.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.090
And every month and a half,
they have a confirmation

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:04.355
that they are losers.

00:45:04.355 --> 00:45:07.680
It's a beautiful game.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.760
Not much data.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.660
We know everything already.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:17.640
But with the kind of tools we
have with these video games,

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.720
we have the opportunity
to collect data

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.410
about what kids are doing.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:27.880
We can improve the algorithm to
serve adaptive levels to them.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.300
So it's a big data
trend in education,

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.670
not based on quizzes
and assessment

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.010
but based on the
learning process.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:36.700
Where are they?

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.320
What are they struggling with?

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.760
Which concept is difficult?

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.390
Which strategy are they using
to solve that type of equation

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.610
or that type of
geometry proof problem?

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.510
It's completing your work,
and it's not accessible

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.680
unless you have very good
game mechanics and good games.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.360
And there's not
that many of them.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.935
So I put that here because
creativity is not only

00:46:02.935 --> 00:46:03.720
in mathematics.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.740
It's also in editorial teams.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.910
It only takes about 42
minutes to learn algebra

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:11.010
with video games.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.590
What a beautiful title.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:17.162
You can't imagine the
amount of hate it generated.

00:46:17.162 --> 00:46:19.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.570
What?

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.620
This game is boo.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.880
I didn't write this articles.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.910
I'm sorry.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.390
The only thing I'm doing is,
I'm doing a pretty good job

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.070
at designing games and
learning experiences,

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:31.470
and we're collecting data.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:34.890
And I'm sorry if the
guy found this title.

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:41.280
Well, it generated a fair
amount of hate, really.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.382
We had many people
who got awareness

00:46:43.382 --> 00:46:44.340
about what we're doing.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.320
And some people were thinking,
well, that's a good thing.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.280
I want to try that.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.120
Which is good.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.090
But of course, we have
to take some perspective

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:55.400
and some distance with
the data we're getting.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:04.722
Really, after one and half
hours, 95% of the kids,

00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:06.430
after having played
one and a half hours,

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.740
are mastering the rules
of algebra in the game.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.320
There is some help in
the game, but it's really

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.950
mathematical gameplay,
as I would call it.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:18.410
So that means that they
are really learning.

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.320
So it's very efficient.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.450
And the data we're collecting
are really, really,

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.140
really interesting for
understanding the learning

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.420
process.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.590
And it's real learning.

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:29.930
Although it's not transferred
to pencil and paper,

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:30.950
we can do that later.

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:35.090
And we have made many stuff to
be able to ease this process.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.490
Yeah, so I want to
say we are humble

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.910
and we are really into learning.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.829
We are not interested in those
kinds of titles or headlines

00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:49.203
although it gives
some publicity.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.800
These are some of
statistics we got

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.720
from the different
challenges we have performed.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.550
And I want to attract your
attention to the two lines

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.865
here-- 10 times faster
and 7 more content.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.410
10 times faster, that's the
difference between the slowest

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:19.800
learners and the fastest
learners in this [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.360
10 times.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.490
So as a teacher, you
know that there are

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:26.320
big differences between kids.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.490
But now we can measure
that with adaptive levels,

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:34.220
with math in the game mechanics,
time on task, and so on.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.590
10 times.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.930
If you think of
that, you say why

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.180
are these kids in
the same classroom?

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.760
It doesn't work like that.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.220
I mean, there is a problem,
fundamental problem, there.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.390
And not only that, we know
the number of exercises

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:52.680
we have to give to kids.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.570
And between the slowest
and the fastest,

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.530
seven more content,
seven more content

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:01.700
we have to deliver
to the slowest kids.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.430
So we can put a number on this.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.480
And it's not one.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.070
It's not 0.5.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.160
It's 7 and 10 times.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.555
It's really big numbers.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.620
What do we do with that?

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:21.450
How can you engage a motivate
a kid to work 10 times

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.260
more than another one?

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.860
How can you do that?

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.490
How can a school do that?

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:29.070
How can a teacher do that?

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:33.280
It's impossible--
mission Impossible.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.240
But we still keep on doing that.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.070
Teachers all over the
planet are doing that.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:42.640
30 kids, and they're
trying to say, well, no.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.090
We're going to learn that
all together-- a nice day.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.300
So what's next for us?

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:54.200
So we're experimenting with
these learning experiences.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:00.470
We are working on new
game play or new games.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.490
And there are many, many,
many things we can explore.

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:08.120
We are a very tiny team--
I don't know-- 13 people?

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:13.420
But we see many research areas.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.090
For example, now in many
countries in South America,

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.470
they have a one to one
with the same tablets.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:25.700
What can you do if in a whole
country each kid has a tablet?

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.610
What kind of interaction
can you make?

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:32.240
What kind of learning experience
can you generate there?

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.840
It's fascinating, the number
of facilities we have there.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:40.570
I think we're going to
spend time exploring this.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.950
How can we create a
game experience there

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:43.825
with this hardware?

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:49.240
Much more to do
with higher math.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.405
There are many areas
of exploration.

00:50:52.405 --> 00:50:53.780
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.040
It was really excellent.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.860
I have a question,
which is do you

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.550
feel that the game is
sufficient in itself

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:01.570
for learning to happen?

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.050
Or do you think it's
best used as a tool

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.220
in the hands of teachers
to map the concepts,

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.220
the mathematical concepts, to
other real world or whatnot?

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.640
JEAN BAPTISTE HUYNH:
So if you are parents,

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.990
I would play this
game with your kids.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:19.700
I wouldn't let them
play, actually.

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.050
I would play it with them.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:24.550
Just like you help
them learn to bike,

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:26.820
and you're very
glad when they bike,

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:31.110
I would play this game
[INAUDIBLE] for algebra,

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:35.140
and explain more how
to transfer that.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.085
In the algebra game, it's
really about the manipulation,

00:51:38.085 --> 00:51:39.450
the algebraic manipulation.

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:40.120
It's not enough.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.860
We don't say why
it works like that.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.340
So there is no link
today to arithmetic.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:50.883
So it must be complemented by
either a teacher or a parent.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.027
At the moment, it's like that.

00:51:55.027 --> 00:51:57.110
AUDIENCE: You said you
were working on some things

00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:59.990
to help with the transfer from
the game to pencil and paper.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.780
Can you describe what those are?

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.863
JEAN BAPTISTE HUYNH: Yeah.

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.800
In the game, you
manipulate cards, right?

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.410
And there is a help mode.

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:15.470
We really help kids really
get fluidity in doing things.

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:19.010
So we are helping them a lot
in the interaction design.

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:23.360
But there is one step where
we don't help them at all.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.630
So there is no help.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:28.620
And then there is the
handwriting recognition.

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.860
So we can go towards
the full stuff there.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:36.010
And just what I've
mentioned, not a new game,

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.530
but a kind of
experience where they

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:43.340
can link the algebraic rules
with what it means with numbers

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.030
so that they connect the two.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:46.160
So that's very important.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.680
Connect arithmetic and
algebra, and then you

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.590
have the full package.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.679
Yeah, so it's possible to do it.

00:52:53.679 --> 00:52:55.220
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, thank you.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.280
I love these games.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.160
My daughter does too.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.220
One thing I noticed is
that my wife loved math

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:06.490
until she got to trigonometry
and then gave up on it.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:10.280
And I got her playing the game,
and she couldn't put it down

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.590
until she stayed up till like
1:00 AM to finish the game.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:16.236
JEAN BAPTISTE HUYNH: I'm sorry.

00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:17.610
AUDIENCE: No, it's
a great thing.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:20.840
And so I'm wondering if you guys
are looking at adult education.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.680
I mean, that seems to be a
huge growing market as well.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.220
And I totally
understand your point

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.844
too about how you
show this to adults,

00:53:27.844 --> 00:53:29.260
and they say, oh,
this isn't math.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.360
I don't know what this is.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.660
Because algebra,
which she loves,

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.640
when I showed her that
one, she had that reaction.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.700
But trigonometry
and geometry, which

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.780
she doesn't love or understand,
she could play it like a game.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.340
So I'm wondering.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:50.260
Are you guys thinking about
approaching the adult education

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.780
market and breaking
through those barriers

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.360
and things like that?

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:57.970
JEAN BAPTISTE HUYNH:
Yeah, definitely.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:01.300
We're going to do that.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.990
But when we designed
the game, actually,

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:06.990
the first game about algebra,
it was meant for kids around 12.

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.780
And because of the constraints
we had made-- no language,

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.910
and it must be like a
game, and unfortunately

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:15.300
or fortunately, I don't
know, one of the "Wired"

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:22.070
Geek Dad journalists wrote an
article saying it's incredible!

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:25.740
My five and seven year old
girls are playing algebra.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:29.050
And since then who
are our customers?

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:30.070
What do you think?

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.070
Parents with a head
start in their head

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.590
and they're thinking
yes, algebra for my kids.

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:41.840
My point is that we're
going to target higher math,

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.800
but always with the
same constraints.

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.660
And in math, the
beauty is that it

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.760
can be very visual if
you have the right design

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.780
of the interface.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.450
But definitely
statistics, functions,

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.140
calculus, or
trigonometry can be made.

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.990
I mean, I'm pretty
confident we can do that.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:02.430
But we have limited resources.

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:05.120
So maybe there are other
people who can do that too.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.410
I promised my son to be finished
with the high school curriculum

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:10.110
before he leaves
school, and it will not

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.490
happen unless other people
are joining in the mission.

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:16.250
So I encourage you to do that.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.850
Yeah.

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:19.600
[APPLAUSE]
