00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:06.646
 Establish a bicycle-like company in San Francisco 

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:08.996
 As if you were climbing a hill and looking up to the top 

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:11.840
 Then reach them and feel happy to reach your goal 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.120
 But moments later you catch your breath 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.140
 Then look forward to see another slope you have to overcome 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.990
 I would like to say that I founded the company in the fifth grade 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.740
 But that is not true 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.520
 The reason for establishing the company is to diagnose my condition at that age 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.710
 I learned that I had learning difficulties 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.574
 I spent many years struggling to learn at school 

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:34.230
 At high school in Chicago I met a teacher 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.390
 Miss Whitefield was patient with me and wanted to help me 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.880
 She was willing to spend time with me if she needed it 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.677
 My mother talked to her weekly 

00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:43.550
 Remind was not there at the time 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.610
 Hi 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.330
 how are you? 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.350
 I was very happy to see you 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.371
 Me too 

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:49.540
 I have not met you in a long time 

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:54.050
 I came up with the idea of ​​strengthening the abilities of teachers similar to Miss "Whitefield" 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.290
 To become more effective 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 They make a difference in the education system 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.580
 Remind is a much easier application 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.866
 Continue teachers with students and parents 

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.240
 Using any device 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.510
 So I was spending my time talking to 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.100
 Hundreds of teachers throughout the country 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 While David was busy studying programming 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.480
 Learning programming is one of the hardest 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.960
 Things I've done in my life 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.473
 We were two little brothers from Chicago 

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:18.370
 We did not know how to set up a company 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.750
 But we started working until we founded Remind 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.580
 We received financial support from our parents and some 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.520
 Our close friends 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.250
 I was pleased that the two brothers 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.290
 They were working together on a project that excited him 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.111
 We were talking to all the teachers 

00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:36.751
 And when I felt their enthusiasm 

00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.331
 I felt we were on the right track 

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.211
 We decided to move to Silicon Valley 

00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.581
 A short time later, well-known investors began 

00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.071
 In investing their money in our company 

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.491
 Investments were supporting us because people 

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:52.121
 Feel the value of what we offer 

00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:53.671
 Children forget everything 

00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:55.671
 So the application helps me on 

00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:57.754
 Communicate with my students 

00:01:57.754 --> 00:01:59.561
 And their families and make sure everyone 

00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:01.051
 They understand my observations 

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:03.001
 We translated this part yesterday. 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.920
 A fascinating story is an encouraging story 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.739
 About one of my students, a "Jason" 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.810
 He was unable to accomplish the tasks on time 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.550
 One day, he came to tell me something 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.780
 Then I promised her that I was 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.020
 I will do all the homework and pass the test successfully 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020
 Provided you give us a party 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.915
 When other children learned about it 

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:22.710
 They were communicating using the Remind application 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.050
 I was constantly receiving messages from Miss "Limer" 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.685
 It is my other classmates 

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:27.570
 For my encouragement and support 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.880
 After Jason fulfilled his promise, the condition was fulfilled and the students had an ice cream party 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.310
 Remind helped me motivate students like "Jason" 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.760
 My bikes were similar to some students 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.050
 Distinguished guests at Miss "Limer" 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.260
 This proves that you can do what you want 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.850
 If appropriate effort is made 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.690
 The highest goal when establishing and developing a company 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.861
 Is to provide what is useful and important to individuals. 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.630
 Of the wonderful features in technology 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.030
 The possibility of creating an application and continuing to develop it 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.810
 Google Play gives us access to millions 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 Users we could not reach 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.800
 If this application platform is not present 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.580
 The application currently employs more than 23 million teachers and students 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.490
 And a partner in more than 90% of primary and secondary schools 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.570
 We believe that the best way to improve the educational system 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.910
 Is to help build relationships between teachers and students 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.100
 And parents. 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.247
 And because we are a company that makes it easier 

00:03:19.247 --> 00:03:20.520
 We are thrilled.
