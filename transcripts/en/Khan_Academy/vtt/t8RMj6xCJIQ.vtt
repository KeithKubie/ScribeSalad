00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.581
- [David] Hello, Grammarians,
today we're going to talk

00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:05.389
about two sets of
frequently confused words.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:09.221
Hear and here, and accept versus except.

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:11.757
These words are pronounced
very similarly to one another,

00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:13.702
but they have very different meanings.

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:16.418
And so what I'm going to try
and do is define those words

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:19.222
for you and then come up
with mnemonic devices,

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:22.680
memory aids to help
you keep them straight.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.446
So the word, hear, H-E-A-R,

00:00:25.446 --> 00:00:26.279
is a verb,

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:31.744
and it means, to listen, to
sense something with your ears.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.526
The word H-E-R-E, here, is an adverb.

00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:41.021
And it signals that something is close by.

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.688
So an example for the
verb, hear, is to say,

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.329
I hear, I don't know, birdsong.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.949
I hear birdsong, oh so lovely.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.233
There's our beautiful bird,
there's it's beautiful song,

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:00.123
and we're hearing it.

00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:04.636
Now in order to remember that
H-E-A-R involves listening,

00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:07.573
I like to point out that it
actually contains the word ear,

00:01:07.573 --> 00:01:11.718
the very device to we use to
hear things in the first place.

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.192
That's a human ear, alright,

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.942
there's your earlobe, the tragus,

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:19.345
your scaphoid fossa,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.797
and parts of the ear.

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:25.078
So, just remember, that
hear contains the word ear.

00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:28.849
Here the adverb, however,
let's use this in an example,

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.436
the secret treasure should be right here.

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:33.892
And in order to keep this one straight,

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:37.809
I like to remember that
here, rhymes with near,

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.294
which is what it means, right?

00:01:41.294 --> 00:01:44.382
When something is here,
it's directly next to you

00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:46.091
or near you.

00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:48.899
So for here with an A,
there's an ear in it too.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.980
But with here with an
E, it's nearness to you.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.987
Next, the words accept and except.

00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:58.268
These are pronounced very
slightly, differently.

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:01.232
So accept here, is a verb and it means

00:02:01.232 --> 00:02:03.899
to go along with, or to receive.

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:10.192
As in, I accept this gift
in the name of Spain.

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.136
And except, on the other hand,

00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:15.222
is a conjunction and a preposition.

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:19.389
Which can kind of be used the
same way that but is used.

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.588
Sort of an everything but, way.

00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:29.545
So, for example, I like every
vegetable except zucchini,

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.455
which isn't true, I like
zucchini a great deal,

00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:35.110
but you can see how it's
being used like but.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.364
It's kind of exclusionary.

00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:39.580
Which is how we're going
to tell the difference

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.160
between these two words,
this gives us the basis for

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.974
our mnemonic so remember
that except is spelled,

00:02:44.974 --> 00:02:49.502
E-X-C-E-P-T which is also
the first three letters

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:53.669
of a similar word, exclude,
so except excludes stuff.

00:02:55.525 --> 00:03:00.341
And accept is spelled A-C-C-E-P-T,

00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.536
so we're going to say that's
very similar to access.

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:07.307
So accept with an A, brings something in,

00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:10.987
and except with an E, keeps something out.

00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:13.395
You can learn anything, David out.
