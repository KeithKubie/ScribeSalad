00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.059
Some APIs will also require
you to set up credentials and

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.570
access using
the Google Developers Console.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.290
For example,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.560
in the maps course, you'll need to
enable your map to use the maps API.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.710
And if you look here on the left,
there's APIs &amp; auth.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.220
When I select that,
and I select APIs, and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.750
then I select enabled APIs,
you can see the APIs that I've enabled.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.500
And one of the map apps that I build,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.117
I'm using here
the Google Maps Android API version 2.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.090
You'll also need credentials for
some of your apps.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.300
So for sign in maps, and some of the
others, the system needs to know which

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.100
apps are using which resources, and as
a result credentials need to be enabled.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.590
And here you can see I've
selected credentials.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.400
And here you can see I've
generated an API key for

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.240
the apps that I've built
that are using Maps.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.320
As you need them, you'll be stepped
through everything that you need to

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.040
do on the Google Developer's Console
in the lessons, but

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.330
it's good to have a look at it.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.110
Go to console.developers.google.com and
have a play around.
