Hi I'm Ryan Beck and welcome
to IKEA furniture prescription

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.472
drug or Thai politician.
I'm going to say a word.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:06.874
I know you're going
to let me know.

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.643
Is it a ikea furniture
a prescription drug

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:10.911
or a Thai politician.

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:13.213
Only I know and they're not
going to get it right.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:16.450
Matt how do you even play this.
Are you ready. We're ready.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.052
Wonderful. I've been preparing
for this my whole life.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.354
Are you ready to go.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.955
I feel like
you're showing me your cards

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.690
I didn't.
I'm going to shuffle it.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.028
OK. Your first word
is your Jakafi, Jakafi.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.265
That coffee and feel very ikea.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.600
Like table-y.
Oh that's Ikea.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.536
It's a prescription
drug my friend.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.137
Yes it's a prescription
drug

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.273
it is indicated
for treatment of patients

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.743
with intermediate
or high risk milo fibrosis

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:45.579
oh me low fibrosis of course.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.281
What's that. Google it.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.750
Jakafi sounds
like something

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.586
I usually walk on walk in
on my boyfriend doing.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.959
They just got it.
cuz they're dudes. Next word
Tarva.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.628
Sounds like it could be
like a bookshelf.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:02.829
Now this is the one
that sounds

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.332
the most like Ikea furniture.
But I feel like

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:08.568
I keep getting burnt with
these prescription medications.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.438
I thought that was part
of a vagina.. that's a vulva

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:14.608
that's a vulva.. easily
confused. Tarva

00:01:14.608 --> 00:01:16.310
Also the prime minister
of Thailand.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.445
I'm worried that this game
is making me

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.048
seem racially insensitive
to South Asian peoples.

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:22.816
You're not the only one.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.385
I think I've shattered a Tarva
that's an IKEA furniture.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.388
That's correct.
Thats a six drawer chest.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.656
it's as beautiful as it is
functional

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.492
I cut off the paper so
I can't read the rest of it.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:35.729
I know for a fact is IKEA
furniture because I own one.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.000
You own this wall lamp.
Yes. Retail's in $19.99.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.503
So make sure to watch
his special $19.99 something

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.572
that everyone
who works here can afford.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.207
When you make money
and you can afford it

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.744
then you should shop at Ikea
because it's a real trip.

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:52.379
I'm truly only sitting like this

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:55.916
because I want my shoe
in the shot Watana Watana.

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:58.218
Forever is a phrase
that just came to mind.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.822
Going to see a politician.
You got it.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.958
Politician Watana forever.
I love that guy voted

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.727
for him
a Minister of Social Development

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:10.530
and Human Security I'm a
Minister of human insecurity.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.733
Did you know that
Thai Panther again

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.601
insensitive people
have been complaining

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.603
that this game is maybe
like culturally insensitive.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.838
Yeah it might be.

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:21.041
Well you know at least they got
a straight host what a stupid
game

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.843
because you lost. Some would say

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:25.746
it's an expertly crafted game
thanks for playing.

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:29.316
That was IKEA furniture
prescription drug

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.184
or Thai politician.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.953
Thanks for having me.
I was forced.
