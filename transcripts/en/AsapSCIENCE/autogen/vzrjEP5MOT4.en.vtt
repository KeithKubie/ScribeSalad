00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
 In a busy world, with endless work and responsibilities that accumulate, 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.700
 Stress can affect us better. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.000
 But how bad is it for us, really? Can stress kill you? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 From a biological perspective, stress seems quite logical. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 If you are about to bite off a bear, it is best for stress hormones to let you go for alertness. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 But it turns out that your mortgage, unemployment, exam is looming 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 All of them move the same response to stress in your body. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Unlike most animals, 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Which eventually faced a significant reduction in these hormones, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
 Human beings do not seem to be able to find a stop button! 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
 Although it is not life or death challenges, 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.800
 We have psychological problems that constantly lead to the dumping of our bodies with these hormones, 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.200
 Which leads to heart palpitations and tight muscles tense and upset stomach. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.100
 In Japan, they have the term Karoshi, which literally translates to "death from exhaustion". 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.800
 In what is now considered an epidemic of fatigue, 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.000
 These people who are apparently healthy and young, suddenly die. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 This situation was officially recognized and documented in Japan, 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 These sudden heart attacks and strokes were quickly linked to stress. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 But how can this stress cause? 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.800
 Cortisol is one of the main stress hormones, and it helps to convert energy to where you need it 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.300
 Away from the non-essential functions of the body. 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.200
 But with exposure to chronic stress, problems arise. 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.300
 The immune system stops functioning, turns into inflammation, and white blood cells drop 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.600
 The susceptibility to the disease increases. 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.800
 Some evidence also suggests that prolonged stress can be involved in the development of cancer. 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.600
 When looking at the arteries of macaque monkeys, which are under great pressure, they have more clogged arteries 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 This prevents blood from reaching the heart quickly during stress, 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.600
 It can eventually lead to heart attacks. 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.200
 The brain is also exposed to losses. When looking at rat-prone stress, we see it 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 Brain cells are significantly smaller, with fewer branches than normal mice. and this is 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 Particularly in areas associated with memory and learning. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 Which may raise some memories for you for all those evening sessions. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 Stress and severe sleep deprivation can make it difficult for us to remember the things you want to remember more and more. 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.500
 Perhaps the most telling story is in DNA. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.100
 We own the so-called telomere at the end of our chromosomes, 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.000
 Which decreases in size with age. Our video on "Aging", here, explains the process. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.300
 Eventually, the telomeres break down, and at this point the cell stops repeating and dies 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.100
 Thus telomeres are directly related to aging and longevity. 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.600
 Stress has been shown to accelerate the shortening of these telomeres. 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.300
 But do not lose your hopes for chronic stress. 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.500
 Another hormone, oxytocin, is found to limit response to stress. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.400
 It also helps blood vessels relax, and even renews the heart from stress-related damage. 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.500
 So how do we get more oxytocin? Sometimes called "Hormone Hormone", 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.600
 Because it spurs through positive social interactions and attention to others. 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.200
 People who spend more time with others create a buffer or ability to adapt to stress. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.500
 So when life bothers you, just remember, you do not have to face it alone. 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.600
 Spend some time with someone you love - you may save your life! 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.300
