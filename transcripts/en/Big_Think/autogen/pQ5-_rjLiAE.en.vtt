that have spilled over to other places
 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.470
that have spilled over to other places
and Iraq is a perfect example of that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
and Iraq is a perfect example of that
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.930

Pandora's box by our regime change
 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.840
Pandora's box by our regime change
efforts and that obviously spilled over

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850
efforts and that obviously spilled over
 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.150
efforts and that obviously spilled over
to places like Syria you'd also have

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160
to places like Syria you'd also have
 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.100
to places like Syria you'd also have
some of these problems with our allies

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110
some of these problems with our allies
 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.289
some of these problems with our allies
like Turkey related to some of the

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299
like Turkey related to some of the
 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.999
like Turkey related to some of the
issues dealing with the Kurds the

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009
issues dealing with the Kurds the
 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.010
issues dealing with the Kurds the
problem is that these war aims expanded

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020
problem is that these war aims expanded
 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.139
problem is that these war aims expanded
well beyond what was possible and again

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149
well beyond what was possible and again
 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.800
well beyond what was possible and again
really thought through what the ideal

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810
really thought through what the ideal
 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.480
really thought through what the ideal
would be without thinking about the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490
would be without thinking about the
 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.219
would be without thinking about the
constraints that meant reality would

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229
constraints that meant reality would
 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.889
constraints that meant reality would
look a lot different than that ideal it

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899
look a lot different than that ideal it
 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.419
look a lot different than that ideal it
would be great if Afghanistan were a

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429
would be great if Afghanistan were a
 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.090
would be great if Afghanistan were a
liberal democracy thriving economically

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100
liberal democracy thriving economically
 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.969
liberal democracy thriving economically
and not a place where folks like Al

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979
and not a place where folks like Al
 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.029
and not a place where folks like Al
Qaeda could operate out of the problem

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039
Qaeda could operate out of the problem
 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.410
Qaeda could operate out of the problem
is that that wasn't really in the cards

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420
is that that wasn't really in the cards
 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.690
is that that wasn't really in the cards
and so you had situations for example

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700
and so you had situations for example
 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.749
and so you had situations for example
like in Helmand where general McChrystal

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759
like in Helmand where general McChrystal
 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.349
like in Helmand where general McChrystal
sent government in a box and what ended

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359
sent government in a box and what ended
 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.969
sent government in a box and what ended
up happening as general McChrystal later

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979
up happening as general McChrystal later
 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.499
up happening as general McChrystal later
said is that you've got a bleeding ulcer

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509
said is that you've got a bleeding ulcer
 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.109
said is that you've got a bleeding ulcer
in that country so these efforts at

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119
in that country so these efforts at
 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.910
in that country so these efforts at
trying to nation-build are often

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920
trying to nation-build are often
 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.039
trying to nation-build are often
unnecessary for America's core security

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049
unnecessary for America's core security
 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.289
unnecessary for America's core security
interests and really impossible to

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299
interests and really impossible to
 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.629
interests and really impossible to
realize in any kind of short run and at

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639
realize in any kind of short run and at
 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.929
realize in any kind of short run and at
a cost that we really think is is

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
a cost that we really think is is
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.129
a cost that we really think is is
appropriate given what we need to

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139
appropriate given what we need to
 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.629
appropriate given what we need to
achieve as opposed to what might be

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:00.639
achieve as opposed to what might be
 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.940
achieve as opposed to what might be
ideal and so we've really opened up all

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
ideal and so we've really opened up all
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.760
ideal and so we've really opened up all
kinds of challenges in this attempt to

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770
kinds of challenges in this attempt to
 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.949
kinds of challenges in this attempt to
create an exemplar for the Middle East

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959
create an exemplar for the Middle East
 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.650
create an exemplar for the Middle East
we actually have created an exemplar an

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660
we actually have created an exemplar an
 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.380
we actually have created an exemplar an
exemplar of what could go wrong if you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390
exemplar of what could go wrong if you
 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.090
exemplar of what could go wrong if you
engage in the world without first

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100
engage in the world without first
 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.200
engage in the world without first
thinking carefully

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210
thinking carefully
 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.970
thinking carefully
about what is necessary for American

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980
about what is necessary for American
 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.680
about what is necessary for American
safety and what those unintended

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690
safety and what those unintended
 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.570
safety and what those unintended
consequences of our behavior could be

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
consequences of our behavior could be
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.180
consequences of our behavior could be
and how that spills back over into the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190
and how that spills back over into the
 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.160
and how that spills back over into the
United States in terms of the effects on

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
United States in terms of the effects on
 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.560
United States in terms of the effects on
Americans the effects on our system of

government and our civil liberties and

government and our civil liberties and
really thinking about those human costs

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
really thinking about those human costs
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.130
really thinking about those human costs
because often times we forget that there

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
because often times we forget that there
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.380
because often times we forget that there
is a real price to be paid so for

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390
is a real price to be paid so for
 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.820
is a real price to be paid so for
example when the United States has

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830
example when the United States has
 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.740
example when the United States has
intervened in places like Iraq and Libya

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
intervened in places like Iraq and Libya
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.780
intervened in places like Iraq and Libya
there has been a huge human cost with

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
there has been a huge human cost with
 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.360
there has been a huge human cost with
thousands of American lives lost tens of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
thousands of American lives lost tens of
 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.280
thousands of American lives lost tens of
thousands of Americans harmed by that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290
thousands of Americans harmed by that
 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.800
thousands of Americans harmed by that
conflict and a real human cost at home

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810
conflict and a real human cost at home
 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.810
conflict and a real human cost at home
on families and communities not to

on families and communities not to
 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.010
on families and communities not to
mention the cost to those were

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020
mention the cost to those were

ostensibly trying to help in places like
 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.060
ostensibly trying to help in places like
Libya and Iraq and so there are lots of

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070
Libya and Iraq and so there are lots of
 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.700
Libya and Iraq and so there are lots of
unintended consequences of not following

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710
unintended consequences of not following
 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.910
unintended consequences of not following

a more Prudential or realistic approach
 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.490
a more Prudential or realistic approach
to the world and what restraint tries to

to the world and what restraint tries to
 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.310
to the world and what restraint tries to
do or realism is to really be cautious

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320
do or realism is to really be cautious
 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.350
do or realism is to really be cautious
about that to think about second-order

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360
about that to think about second-order
 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.930
about that to think about second-order
consequences to think about the human

consequences to think about the human
 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.180
consequences to think about the human
and financial costs and to put that in

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190
and financial costs and to put that in
 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.520
and financial costs and to put that in
the calculus before you reach for the

American foreign policy goals so Libya
 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.380
American foreign policy goals so Libya
is a classic case of a well-intentioned

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390
is a classic case of a well-intentioned
 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.530
is a classic case of a well-intentioned
policy gone awry so the argument was

that the United States needed to get
