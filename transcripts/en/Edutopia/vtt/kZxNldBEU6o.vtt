&gt;&gt;Chris: Oftentimes we have private
think time before we share our visual

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:11.966
models in math, Matthew.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Chris Opitz
is a master teacher

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:16.216
at Bowman Elementary
School in Anchorage, Alaska.

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:20.736
He views math as a social
activity, and believes taking time

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:24.406
to impart the skills required
for cooperative learning can lead

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:26.976
to calmer classrooms and
more rigorous studies.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.296
&gt;&gt;Chris: Why is private think
time important before we have

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.066
our discussions?

00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:32.726
Sadie, what are you thinking?

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This fifth grade math
class was recorded during the first

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.556
month of the school year.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:43.226
&gt;&gt;Chris: At the beginning of
the year, we establish a set

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:47.046
of working agreements that I provide
four categories, I provided speaking,

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:50.526
listening, thinking and
behavior, and that's really,

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:51.716
social emotional learning.

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:54.846
Then we did an exercise
where the kids thought about,

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:58.636
and kind of imagined a great
classroom, like, the best place

00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:02.176
where they could possibly be
learning, and what would that look

00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:03.766
like in each of those categories?

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.126
And so we took all of those ideas

00:01:06.126 --> 00:01:07.986
and we developed what's
called our working agreement.

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:12.526
And then kids look at that
consistently and set goals from that,

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:14.346
and then they rate themselves.

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:17.346
You know, today I did a great job,
and they provide an explanation

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:20.376
and evidence of their rating
in terms of those goals.

00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:23.946
Also we do a lot of discussion,
and that's another area.

00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:26.326
Kids did the same thing,
they worked together,

00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:28.756
and thought of what a
great discussion is.

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:31.016
It wasn't kids raising their hands,

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.966
it was kids bouncing
ideas off each other.

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:38.856
I personally believe, when kids
have some say in making those rules

00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:41.146
and those routines, and
those working agreements,

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.646
they're going to own them more.

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.366
&gt;&gt;So I'm going to give
you your first model.

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.356
We're probably going to go around
and do a fish bowl, where we stand

00:01:51.356 --> 00:01:54.606
around the outside, and we're
going to watch and really think

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:59.196
about what a good discussion looks
like, how we talk and how we listen,

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:01.216
how we ask questions,
all of those good things

00:02:01.216 --> 00:02:02.526
that you guys do very, very well.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.096
So here's your first model.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.816
Please honor the private think time.

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.776
Want me to read it with you?

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:12.946
Mike has eight dollars, Kelly
has twice as much as Mike.

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:14.976
Do you know what that
word twice as much means?

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:26.506
Hey, Riley, could you and Laura
work together as a team on this one?

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:27.526
Would that be okay with you?

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:27.996
&gt;&gt;Riley: Sure.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:28.376
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:31.306
&gt;&gt;Riley: So Mike has eight
dollars, is this Mike?

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:31.556
&gt;&gt;Laura: Yeah.

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:35.936
&gt;&gt;Chris: In any classroom,
anywhere you go,

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:39.766
you're going to have an incredibly
broad range of kids, socially,

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:42.206
academically, all across
the spectrum,

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:47.366
and so how does a single person,
as a teacher, as a manager, teach,

00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:50.106
you know, 20 to 30 kids
in a single classroom,

00:02:50.296 --> 00:02:51.966
when that ability range is so wide?

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:58.106
I personally believe that the
social skills and more importantly,

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:01.156
students building social skills
to help them work together,

00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:04.476
to talk about math, to
explain their thinking,

00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:09.956
to offer help when another student is
struggling, and just as importantly,

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.556
for that child to be
able to accept help.

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:13.926
That's a really difficult
part of that equation.

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:17.416
All of those skills are part of the
social arena that we're working in,

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:20.596
and without them, I don't know
how you could teach a classroom

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:22.136
with such a broad range of abilities.

00:03:22.346 --> 00:03:23.726
&gt;&gt;Riley: How do you
want to make this model?

00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:28.586
&gt;&gt;Chris: Kids' ideas matter.

00:03:29.346 --> 00:03:30.816
&gt;&gt;Thank you for sharing your idea.

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:34.096
&gt;&gt;When we pay attention to their
ideas, not necessarily saying,

00:03:34.096 --> 00:03:35.766
that's a good idea,
or that's a bad idea,

00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:37.376
but we say, thank you for your idea.

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:41.556
They're more willing to share it,
they probably care a little bit more,

00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:44.626
it probably feels a little
bit safer to share that idea,

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:49.386
because no matter what I say or
try to push, unless kids own it,

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:50.926
it's not going to matter.

00:03:51.996 --> 00:03:55.946
&gt;&gt;I took your ideas
about discussions,

00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:57.636
what makes a really great discussion,

00:03:57.706 --> 00:03:59.176
and I wrote them on
the board for today.

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:02.626
And so when we go to fish bowl, we're
going to choose a team like we do.

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:04.976
We're going to go around and we're
going to make these observations,

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:09.456
and your job as an audience, is
to listen very closely to see

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:11.416
if every voice is heard
at that table.

00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:14.486
I want you to listen for
thoughtful questions,

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:16.286
and look for this evidence.

00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:17.086
You ready?

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:19.416
Okay, remember, give them space.

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:22.246
Give them space, and
if you're in front,

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.206
what can you do to let everybody see?

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:28.616
Audience, our voices are off, we're
just going to look for evidence

00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:30.266
of a really great discussion,
and then we're going

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:31.546
to talk about that afterwards.

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:33.236
&gt;&gt;I began using the fish bowl,

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:38.236
having kids really closely
observe other kids in discussion,

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:42.396
identifying particular types of
language, ways to ask questions,

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:47.366
how to use manners when
disagreeing, how to choose--

00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:49.456
as simply as how to
choose who speaks first.

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:50.296
&gt;&gt;Student: I'll start.

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:53.836
&gt;&gt;Chris: In a fifth and sixth grade
classroom, we wouldn't expect that,

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:57.296
but boy, it can derail
a classroom instantly,

00:04:57.566 --> 00:05:01.036
if they don't have those basic skills
and once that foundation is built,

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:05.636
then the academics can be
so much more thoughtful,

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:09.736
so much more intense, and
that's what we're shooting for.

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:13.536
&gt;&gt;Student: So Mike started with
eight, Kelly had twice as much

00:05:13.566 --> 00:05:17.276
as Mike, and Joe had
half as much as Kelly.

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:20.016
&gt;&gt;Chris: Every teacher out there has
probably said, at some point in time,

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:21.626
turn to your neighbor
and talk about this idea.

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:23.876
Look at your teammates
and talk about this idea.

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:30.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Actually, I'm not quite
getting, why did you do those shapes?

00:05:30.836 --> 00:05:31.756
&gt;&gt;Student: Because it looked cool.

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:35.586
&gt;&gt;Chris: And really watch, and if
they are talking about the topic

00:05:35.686 --> 00:05:38.586
that you've asked them to talk
about, if they're actually listening

00:05:38.586 --> 00:05:41.496
to each other, and using that
language and those social skills,

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:43.476
then all of a sudden,
you have an environment

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.326
where 30 kids are all
learning at the same time.

00:05:46.486 --> 00:05:47.836
&gt;&gt;Student: And how
would you get three,

00:05:47.836 --> 00:05:51.756
even if you did the half of eight?

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:52.556
That's four.

00:05:52.556 --> 00:05:53.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Is that right?

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:55.616
&gt;&gt;Student: I don't
know how I got three.

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:58.306
&gt;&gt;Chris: It's not going to happen
at the beginning of the year,

00:05:58.716 --> 00:06:02.616
but in my opinion, the
efficiencies that you'll gain later,

00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:07.806
by far outweigh the time you spend at
the beginning, teaching those basics.

00:06:10.176 --> 00:06:13.156
&gt;&gt;Caleigh, I was standing behind
you, and I kept hearing a lot

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:14.346
of questions coming your way.

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:15.666
How did that make you feel?

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:17.756
&gt;&gt;Caleigh: I don't know.

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:20.506
&gt;&gt;Chris: I mean, sometimes when
people ask me a lot of questions fast

00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:22.456
in a row, I get kind of nervous.

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:24.686
Do you know what I
mean, and I can't--

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:26.566
my thoughts, I kind of
lose my own thinking.

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:29.386
Does that happen to anybody else,
when somebody says, Hey, Riley, hey,

00:06:29.386 --> 00:06:31.026
Riley, did you-- what's the answer?

00:06:31.026 --> 00:06:33.116
But do you know what I mean?

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:33.606
&gt;&gt;Riley: Yeah.

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:34.426
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:06:34.616 --> 00:06:36.526
And you get a little
nervous but that's all right,

00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:38.536
that's part of our learning.

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:41.596
And so I want you to feel
comfortable with that.

00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:42.876
That's okay to feel that way.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:45.906
&gt;&gt;Right now, we're going to have--

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.906
the observers are going to discuss
a little bit and make some comments.

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:52.076
Audience, what are some
things that you noticed, okay?

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:57.476
&gt;&gt;Riley: I kind of have a comment,
but I think next time, Braden,

00:06:57.546 --> 00:07:01.346
because maybe you should spread it
out, because when you first had,

00:07:01.346 --> 00:07:04.296
like the red right there, and
then the green right there,

00:07:04.296 --> 00:07:06.076
it kind of looked like
it was just 32.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:09.496
&gt;&gt;Braden: Well, I was thinking
of it, from, like, a side view,

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:12.516
so if you're like down--
but I mean, if--

00:07:12.686 --> 00:07:15.426
still, you can kind of
somewhat see from my angle.

00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:17.246
&gt;&gt;Chris: Say we provide
a math problem.

00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:19.796
Many students can find
the answer very quickly,

00:07:20.326 --> 00:07:23.106
but can they explain the process
that was happening in their mind?

00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:25.936
Can they explain it to somebody
that doesn't understand it?

00:07:26.626 --> 00:07:29.806
You take a really gifted kid, for
example, and you have them try

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:32.276
to explain a multiplication
problem, a very basic one.

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:33.726
They know the answer like that.

00:07:34.196 --> 00:07:35.876
And try having them
explain it to somebody

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:37.426
that it doesn't come so quickly to.

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:43.536
It's an amazing activity to watch, to
see them think through the process,

00:07:43.776 --> 00:07:47.036
oh, well I know that three times
four is three groups of four,

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:49.446
or four groups of three,
and here's how I see it,

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:50.796
and here's what it
looks like visually,

00:07:50.986 --> 00:07:52.556
and that's how I get to this answer.

00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:57.006
It's an entirely different skill to
be in tune with your own thinking,

00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.606
and so, in order to do
that in the classroom,

00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:01.836
those social skills
need to be in place.

00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:07.256
&gt;&gt;Okay, for closing today, you're
going to go to your math journals,

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:08.346
and you're going to write--

00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:10.346
&gt;&gt;By spending some time
developing these routines,

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:13.716
and helping kids learn
social and emotional skills,

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:17.486
where they can manage themselves
and their interactions with others,

00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:19.626
the classroom will be
a better place to be,

00:08:20.056 --> 00:08:23.416
and the academics will also be--

00:08:23.716 --> 00:08:26.456
have the opportunity to be
more rigorous, and thoughtful.

00:08:28.056 --> 00:08:29.876
And I've seen it work
in my classroom,

00:08:30.506 --> 00:08:31.976
and I believe it can
work in other classrooms.

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.096
