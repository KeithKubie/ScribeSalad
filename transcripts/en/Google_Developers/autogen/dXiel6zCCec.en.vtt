00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.289
 Hello everyone in this short series 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.360
 video we will try to identify some 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 solutions to improve to improve 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.910
 the user experience of yours 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.950
 android applications 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.970
 the goal of the videos and provide one 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.460
 overview of the main ones 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.070
 problems and report some 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.350
 practical advice not clearly of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.780
 exhaustively investigate i 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.719
 user experience concepts is more ai 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 We will mainly focus on design 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.460
 on some patterns recommended by 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.090
 official android guide to solve 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.130
 the classic problems in dealing with it 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.670
 development in designing the experience on 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.520
 mobile devices here in this slide vi 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 mark it with the useful links you will find many 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 information clearly on the website of 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.370
 android developer the official guide of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.450
 of google for android for 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.700
 android developers 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.369
 specifically for the topics that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.689
 we will discuss excellent insights there 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 are in the sections design is a pattern 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.409
 let's start now with a brief overview on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.189
 some basic user concepts 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.979
 experience 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.859
 starting from the mental model that in good order 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.840
 substance is the mental model that 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.600
 the user creates completely 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.179
 automatic thinking about the use it will make 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.240
 your application imagines them 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.959
 functionality and flow to achieve 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.959
 certain goals 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.310
 the inter 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.260
 the graphics are the user experience yours 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.710
 app should get as close as possible 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.570
 to what is the mental model he has 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.890
 created the user in his head 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.040
 this thing starts since when 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.900
 looked at the icon in the play store 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.540
 in practice the management and the way 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.940
 defines a scheme of actions from 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.450
 which user expects feedback and 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.770
 to achieve certain goals 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.300
 here it becomes of absolute importance 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.340
 determine precisely what they are 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.320
 user goals in use 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.140
 in using your app 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.940
 an application that does very well the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.790
 own operations for which it was 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.240
 designed works better than an app that does 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.160
 more or less enough 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.170
 operations often in drawing 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.990
 the experience for my applications me 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.700
 I entrust to those who are called the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.600
 people cruisers or profiles 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.330
 fictitious real people who could 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.170
 use the application surname name 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.750
 age what it does in life and habits e 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.290
 passions at this point will be much more 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.030
 easy to focus on 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.830
 the goal that these people have 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.020
 in using ours clearly 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.950
 limit yourself to only one profile help in 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.010
 initial phase 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.830
 if the scec julius kaiser of ours 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.209
 app increases increases the complexity yes 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.570
 prefers to use three four 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:24.880
 profiles to monitor better is for 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.070
 see the different ones better I scales this 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.620
 it is a practical advice when starting a 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.810
 design an android application 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.150
 probably one of the hardest things to 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.850
 digest for a programmer we would like 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.600
 all immediately throw ourselves headlong into the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.760
 the programming perceive the results 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.750
 real of our code efforts 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.300
 in the device however with increasing 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.160
 of the complexity of the aps and the phase of 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.140
 design was not addressed in 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.130
 appropriate way we will meet big 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.740
 problems 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.350
 the advice I give is to use gods 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.990
 warfare and demo cup often this thing 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.080
 it is underestimated but has a pattern 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.060
 clear and highly faithful to the result 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.580
 that you want to get will help you 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.450
 write the best code and avoid 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.470
 a factually expensive factoring in 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.840
 some cases then play all the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.090
 views of your app experiences i 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.410
 various flows of operations 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.570
 maybe this whole project 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.000
 reproducing the user experience 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.060
 ok once it's your wireframe not 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.530
 it's over here if you're thinking that you 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.260
 you can write the first one 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.920
 activity for your app actually can 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:46.240
 do one more thing about user tests 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:50.350
 real with real users is done 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.650
 attest the trouble frame the flow that you 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.890
 it is meant for real users if you are 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.760
 asking why in this operation 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:02.740
 necessary well basically a good one 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.500
 reason could be to avoid 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.420
 to upset the logic of ours 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.150
 application because maybe users 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.490
 don't grab some components well for 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.730
 how we thought of them 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.640
 at the beginning so quite 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.310
 the various views are simple 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.290
 users and make themselves determined 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.450
 operations without guiding the user into 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.120
 in the flow flow without correcting it 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.550
 continually it is usually five tests 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.460
 they are more than enough to identify 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.680
 of the criticalities for the tests and then 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.920
 use one of the reported tools 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 in the article in the article recreate yours 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.650
 flows using simple sheets of 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.860
 post it all card to create one 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.510
 simple beauty of your application 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.960
 we give very fast or even use the 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.590
 classic rounds of prototyping like 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.590
