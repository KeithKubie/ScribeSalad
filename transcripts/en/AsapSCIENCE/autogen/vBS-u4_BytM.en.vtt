00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.860
 This show is sponsored by Bill aand Melinda Gates 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.640
 I have some bad news to tell you, we will all die. 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.840
 In fact, an average of 1.8 people per second will die. 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.560
 The most important thing you will die is your age. 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.360
 Next, there will be statistics that will tell you about your possible cause of death. 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.640
 Let us start from the opposite of those over 70 years old. 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 In the world, this stage is the age at which nearly half of the people will die. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.400
 The overwhelming cause of death of people over the age of 70 is a disease of the heart. 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.360
 If you are an American between the ages of 45 and 64, cancer is the leading cause of death. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.500
 In 2016, 8.9 million people worldwide died of cancer, more than 5.7 million more than in 1990. 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.340
 Wait, why do people who get cancer suddenly increase so much? 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.860
 Because our population is increasing and our life expectancy is extended, so many people get cancer. 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.840
 If you are dead between 25 and 44 years old 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.240
 In the United States, the main cause of death is misuse of poisoning. 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.780
 Maybe this sounds weird 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 In fact, the term "mistaken poisoning" also includes drug abuse. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.320
 From 1999 to 2016, the number of people killed in drug abuse in the United States has tripled. 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 The main reason is because of the opioid crisis. 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.440
 The latest data from 2017 shows that that year was the worst year for drug abuse deaths in American history. 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:34.280
 In fact, the number of people killed by drugs in 2017 is more than the number of casualties of the US military in the Iraq war plus the Vietnam War. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.160
 However, this is not the main cause of death in the world. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.240
 In South Africa, the leading cause of death at this stage is AIDS. 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.260
 In Brazil, the first cause of death is homicide. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.120
 In the United States between the ages of 15 and 24, the main cause of death is a car accident. 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.840
 Especially in the months after I got my driver’s license, I was more likely to have a car accident. 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.600
 Moreover, 53% of accidents occur on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.700
 Compared to female driving, the probability of death in a male driving car accident is doubled. 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.920
 And the number of teenagers wearing seat belts is the least 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.420
 They are more likely to speed 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.000
 And they are closer to other cars than normal people. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.980
 At 5 to 14 years old, the main cause of death is malaria. 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.900
 Plasmodium is a single-celled parasitic microorganism called Plasmodium 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960
 It is transmitted through mosquitoes 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.200
 The complexity of malaria parasites makes vaccines very difficult to make 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.840
 But recent problems have shown promising results 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.940
 In 2017, 5.4 million children under the age of 5 died 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.900
 The main cause of death is a wide range of neonatal disorders 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.759
 After the tragedy, the child’s mortality rate has dropped sharply. 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.460
 In 1990, every 11 children under the age of five had one unfortunate death. 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.180
 But in 2017, it changed from every 11 to every 26 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.400
 So you will "how" death will depend on when you "dead" 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.600
 If you are in old age, heart disease can happen to you. 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.500
 Having said that, the main cause of death 100 years ago was the flu. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.600
 So, how do we know how we will die in the future? 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.960
 But we can do better with the help of science 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.240
 Examined more than 40,000 voluntary DNA samples 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.560
 Geneticists have discovered premature babies and the minerals they produce - selenium 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.940
 The study found that mothers with this gene in pregnancy are more likely to have premature birth 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.940
 15 million babies are born prematurely each year 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.600
 And understand the reasons for these premature births is a very important factor 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.900
 These babies have a higher risk of death in low-income countries 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.379
 This and temporary solution is one of the most fascinating and amazing issues. 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.080
 You can read the information from the Annual Letter of Bill and Melinda Gates' at GatesLetter.com. 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.860
 In this year, they shared what they encountered at work. 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.240
 The toilet included has not changed in this century. 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.720
 And textbooks become obsolete 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.900
 The surprising reason for these is that the information on these two things is actually very important. 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.360
 You find these unexpected moments will help them help the world and make it better. 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.640
