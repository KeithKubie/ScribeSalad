00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:01.700
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that you're on some type

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.069
of a game show and you've
been doing quite well.

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:05.605
And you're now at the
round where you get to

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:08.469
pick your fantabulous vacation.

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.339
And so there are three possible
places that you could go.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.833
You could go on an island beach vacation.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.005
Island beach vacation.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.910
You could go skiing on a ski vacation.

00:00:25.413 --> 00:00:28.105
Or, you could go camping.

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.872
Now those aren't the only possibilities

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:32.775
because for each of those vacations

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.601
there's different amount of
time that you could go on them.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.514
So you could go for one day.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.479
You could go for two days.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.301
Two days.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.844
Or you could go for three days.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.771
Three. Put that in a different color.

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:52.603
You could go for three days.

00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:55.205
You could go for three days.

00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:59.446
So the first question I'd wanna
know is, well what is the--

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:02.245
They're gonna randomly pick either a

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:05.440
one day ski vacation or a
two day island vacation.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.573
The first question I wanna know is,

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:09.013
what are all of the
possible outcomes here?

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:10.405
What is the sample space?

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:12.669
What is the space from
which we are going to pick

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:15.546
your particular vacation package?

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:19.374
Well for the sample space,
we can construct a grid.

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:21.939
Which you can see that I've
essentially been constructing

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.810
while I wrote down all
of the possibilities.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.436
So let me draw out the sample space

00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.352
with these uneven looking grid lines.

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:35.102
All right, I think you get the picture.

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:38.466
And I'll just abbreviate it.

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.366
You can go on a one day,

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:45.337
a one day island trip.

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:48.776
This one I, this is one day island trip.

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:52.834
You can go on a two day, two day--

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:54.375
Actually, let me just write it this way.

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:55.976
All of these are going to be one day.

00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:58.414
Right? Because of the one day column.

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:01.334
All of these are going to be two days.

00:02:01.334 --> 00:02:03.312
Two days. Two days.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:05.898
And all of these are
going to be three days

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:07.772
because it's on the three day column.

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:10.811
And all of the ones in this row

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:12.435
are going to be island trips.

00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:14.044
So it's one day island trip,

00:02:14.044 --> 00:02:16.737
two day island trip,
three day island trip.

00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:19.171
This second row, it's all ski trips.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:23.736
One day ski trip, two day
ski trip, three day ski trip.

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:25.807
And then finally everything
in this third row,

00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:27.610
they're campng trips.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.368
One day camping trip,
two day camping trip,

00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:32.308
three day camping trip.

00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:34.081
So just like that, we have constructed

00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:35.938
the sample space right over here.

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:38.077
You see that there's one,
two, three, four, five,

00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:40.482
six, seven, eight, nine outcomes.

00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:42.146
And let's say that each of these outcomes

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:43.100
are on a little piece of paper

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.969
and they put it in a
barrel and they roll it up.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:46.702
And for our purposes we can assume

00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:49.808
that they are all equally likely outcomes.

00:02:49.808 --> 00:02:53.036
So we're gonna assume
equally likely outcomes.

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:55.375
So if we do assume
equally likely outcomes,

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.579
we can figure out a probability.

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.410
Maybe you live in someplace that's cold

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.974
and you're really not in
the mood to go skiing.

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:03.542
In fact, you'd like to spend several days

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:05.543
away from the snow.

00:03:05.543 --> 00:03:07.046
So let's ask ourselves a question.

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:11.004
What is the probability

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:12.939
that you're going to win something

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.170
at least two days

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.713
on a vacation without snow.

00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:24.109
Two days on vacation

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.744
without snow.

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:31.379
You're gonna randomly pick
one of these nine outcomes.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.642
What's the probability that
it's going to be at least--

00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:35.836
It's gonna give you a
vacation that gives you

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:38.739
at least two days without snow.

00:03:39.644 --> 00:03:41.500
Well, let's just think
a little bit about it.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.802
We know the sample space

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:44.903
and we know each of the
outcomes are equally likely.

00:03:44.903 --> 00:03:47.943
There are nine equal outcomes here.

00:03:47.943 --> 00:03:49.172
So let's write that down.

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:51.367
We got nine equal outcomes.

00:03:52.268 --> 00:03:56.075
Now how many of the outcomes satisfy this?

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:58.637
This event, this constraint.

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:01.438
At least 2 days of vacation--

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:03.233
Let me write this.

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:05.307
Two days.

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:07.572
Without snow.

00:04:07.572 --> 00:04:09.301
Whether it falls or
touching it or whatever.

00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:11.007
So you're essentially avoiding skiing.

00:04:11.007 --> 00:04:13.701
You want at least two days on
something other than skiing.

00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:14.707
And we're assuming you're
not gonna go camping

00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:16.267
in some type of alpine.

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:18.179
You're camping in some place that's warm.

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:20.113
Well, let's think about these outcomes.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:23.247
So this one is no snow
but it's only one day.

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:28.435
This is two days without snow
so we can circle that one.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:32.071
This is three days without
snow so we can circle that one.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.737
All of these have snow.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:36.847
This is one day without snow
so we're not gonna do this one.

00:04:36.847 --> 00:04:38.811
This is two days without snow

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:41.333
and this is three days without snow.

00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:43.713
And so four of the equally

00:04:43.713 --> 00:04:46.346
likely outcomes satisfy this constraint.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.880
So you have a 4/9 probability

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.568
of getting a vacation

00:04:52.568 --> 00:04:56.876
that keeps you away from
snow for at least two days.

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:59.043
Hopefully you found that fun
and useful for the next time

00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:01.413
that you are some type
of strange game show.
