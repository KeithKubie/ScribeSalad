00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.232
Most people recognize his name

00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:15.693
and know that he is famous 
for having said something,

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:19.832
but considering the long-lasting impact
his teachings have had on the world,

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:24.043
very few people know 
who Confucius really was,

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:25.720
what he really said,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.612
and why.

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:31.248
Amid the chaos of 6th Century BCE China,

00:00:31.248 --> 00:00:35.574
where warring states fought 
endlessly among themselves for supremacy,

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:38.175
and rulers were frequently assassinated,

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:40.491
sometimes by their own relatives,

00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:44.245
Confucius exemplified benevolence
and integrity,

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:45.563
and through his teaching,

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:48.902
became one of China's 
greatest philosophers.

00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:52.857
Born to a nobleman but raised in poverty
from a very young age

00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:55.520
following the untimely 
death of his father,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.348
Confucius developed what would become

00:00:57.348 --> 00:01:01.557
a lifelong sympathy
for the suffering of the common people.

00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:04.377
Barely supporting his mother
and disabled brother

00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:07.204
as a herder 
and account keeper at a granary,

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:08.875
and with other odd jobs,

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.446
it was only with 
the help of a wealthy friend

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:15.302
that Confucius was able 
to study at the Royal Archives,

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:18.122
where his world view would be formed.

00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:20.913
Though the ancient texts there
were regarded by some

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.362
as irrelevant relics of the past,

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:25.859
Confucius was inspired by them.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.334
Through study and reflection,

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:31.829
Confucius came to believe that 
human character is formed in the family

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.458
and by education in ritual, 
literature, and history.

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:39.831
A person cultivated in this way
works to help others,

00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:43.946
guiding them by moral inspiration
rather than brute force.

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:46.442
To put his philosophy into practice,

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:51.496
Confucius became an advisor to the ruler
of his home state of Lu.

00:01:51.496 --> 00:01:56.018
But after another state sent Lu's ruler
a troop of dancing girls as a present

00:01:56.018 --> 00:02:00.664
and the ruler ignored his duties
while enjoying the girls in private,

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.533
Confucius resigned in disgust.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.650
He then spent the next few years
traveling from state to state,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.334
trying to find a worthy ruler to serve,
while holding fast to his principles.

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:14.066
It wasn't easy.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.947
In accordance with his philosophy,
and contrary to the practice of the time,

00:02:17.947 --> 00:02:23.465
Confucius dissuaded rulers from relying
on harsh punishments and military power

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.228
to govern their lands

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.996
because he believed that a good ruler

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:30.075
inspires others 
to spontaneously follow him

00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:33.124
by virtue of his ethical charisma.

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:34.445
Confucius also believed

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:37.557
that because the love and respect
we learn in the family

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.131
are fundamental to all other virtues,

00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:45.263
personal duties to family sometimes
supersede obligations to the state.

00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:48.834
So when one duke bragged 
that his subjects were so upright

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.889
that a son testified 
against his own father

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.719
when his father stole a sheep,

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.617
Confucius informed the duke

00:02:55.617 --> 00:03:00.460
that genuinely upright fathers 
and sons protected one another.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.127
During his travels, 
Confucius almost starved,

00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:04.794
he was briefly imprisoned,

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:07.979
and his life was threatened 
at several points.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.548
But he was not bitter.

00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:13.082
Confucius had faith that heaven
had a plan for the world,

00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:14.881
and he taught that a virtuous person

00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:18.763
could always find joy 
in learning and music.

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:21.080
Failing to find the ruler he sought,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.137
Confucius returned to Lu

00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:26.319
and became a teacher and philosopher
so influential,

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.008
that he helped shaped Chinese culture

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:32.991
and we recognize his name worldwide, 
even today.

00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:34.567
For the disciples of Confucius,

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:39.680
he was the living embodiment of a sage
who leads others through his virtue,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.499
and they recorded his sayings,

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:46.986
which eventually were edited into a book
we know in English as "The Analects."

00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:51.547
Today, millions of people worldwide adhere
to the principles of Confucianism,

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:55.584
and though the precise meaning of 
his words has been debated for millennia,

00:03:55.584 --> 00:03:59.018
when asked to summarize 
his teachings in a single phrase,

00:03:59.018 --> 00:04:00.886
Confucius himself said,

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:06.720
"Do not inflict upon others 
that which you yourself would not want."

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.866
2,500 years later, it's still sage advice.
