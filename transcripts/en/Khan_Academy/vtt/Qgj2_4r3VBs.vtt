00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:02.540
- [Instructor] So I have two
different expressions here

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.607
that I wanna take the derivative of.

00:00:04.607 --> 00:00:07.091
And what I want you to
do is pause the video

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.715
and think about how you
would first approach

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:11.874
taking the derivative of this expression

00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:14.011
and how that might be
the same or different

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.938
as your approach in taking the derivative

00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:17.563
of this expression.

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:20.350
The goal here isn't to compute
the derivatives all the way,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.345
but really to just think
about how we identify

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:25.262
what strategies to use.

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.057
Okay so let's first tackle this one.

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:32.053
And the key when looking
at a complex expression

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:35.025
like either of these is
to look at the big picture

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:37.300
structure of the expression.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.065
So one way to think about it is,

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:43.477
let's look at the outside
rather than the inside details.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.149
So if we look at the outside here,

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.482
we have the sine

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:49.784
of something.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.926
So there's a sine of
something going on here

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:56.689
that I'm going to circle in red

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.477
or in this pink color.

00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:00.358
So that's how my brain thinks about it.

00:01:00.358 --> 00:01:02.006
From the outside I'm like okay,

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.026
big picture I'm taking the sine

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:05.745
of some stuff.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:07.881
I might be taking some
stuff to some exponent.

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:10.783
In this case, I'm inputting
in a trigonometric expression.

00:01:10.783 --> 00:01:12.804
But if you have a situation like that,

00:01:12.804 --> 00:01:14.777
it's a good sign that

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:17.633
the chain rule is in order.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.375
So let me write that down.

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.766
So we would wanna use in this case

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.622
the chain rule, C.R. for chain rule.

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:26.201
And how would we apply it?

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:29.568
Well we would take the
derivative of the outside

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:32.424
with respect to this inside

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:34.491
times the derivative of this inside

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.047
with respect to x.

00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:37.556
And I'm gonna write it
the way that my brain

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:39.506
sometimes thinks about it.

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:41.689
So we can write this as

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.268
the derivative

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:45.010
with respect to

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.472
that something,

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.307
and I'm just gonna make that pink circle

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:51.604
for the something rather
than writing it all again,

00:01:51.604 --> 00:01:53.771
of sine of that something,

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.290
sine of that something,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.891
not even thinking about what
that something is just yet,

00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:04.141
times, times the derivative

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:07.278
with respect to x

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:08.778
of that something.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.202
This is just an application

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:13.036
of the chain rule.

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:15.288
No matter what was here in this

00:02:15.288 --> 00:02:16.589
pink colored circle,

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.191
it might have been
something with square roots

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:20.234
and logarithms and whatever else,

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:22.928
as long as it's being
contained within the sine,

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:24.669
I would move to this step.

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.782
The derivative with
respect to that something

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:28.129
of sine of that something

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.380
times the derivative with
respect to x of the something.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.398
Now what would that be
tangibly in this case?

00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:36.148
Well this first part,

00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:39.251
I will do it in orange,

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:42.595
this first part would just be cosine

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.678
of x squared plus five

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.159
times cosine of x.

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:52.417
So that's that circle right over there.

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:55.947
Let me close the cosine right over there.

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:58.988
And then times the
derivative with respect to x,

00:02:58.988 --> 00:03:02.170
times the derivative with respect to x,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.515
of all of this again,

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:07.255
of x squared plus five

00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:08.755
times cosine of x.

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:13.385
And then I would close my brackets.

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:14.894
And of course I wouldn't be done yet,

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:17.541
I have more derivative taking to do.

00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:20.629
Here now I would look at the big structure

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.139
of what's going on,

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.461
and I have two expressions
being multiplied.

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:26.597
I don't have just one

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:29.592
big expression that's being an input

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:31.775
into like a sine function
or cosine function

00:03:31.775 --> 00:03:34.770
or one big expression that's
taken to some exponent.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.487
I have two expressions being multiplied.

00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:38.404
I have this

00:03:39.693 --> 00:03:41.776
being multiplied by this.

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:45.893
And so if I'm just
multiplying two expressions,

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.958
that's a pretty good clue
that to compute this part,

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.418
I would then use the product rule.

00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:54.368
And I could keep doing
that and compute it,

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:55.738
and I encourage you to do so,

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:57.479
but this is more about the strategies

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.267
and how do you recognize them.

00:03:59.267 --> 00:04:01.148
But now let's go to the other example.

00:04:01.148 --> 00:04:04.376
Well this looks a lot more like this step

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:06.349
of the first problem than the beginning

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.161
of the original problem.

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:12.038
Here I don't have a
sine of a bunch of stuff

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:14.918
or a bunch of stuff being
raised to one exponent.

00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:18.145
Here I have the product of two expressions

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:20.072
just like we saw over here.

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:21.989
We have this expression

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:26.899
being multiplied by this expression.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.734
So my brain just says okay
I have two expressions,

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:30.730
then I'm going to use the product rule.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.333
Two expressions being multiplied,

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:33.703
I'm going to use the product rule.

00:04:33.703 --> 00:04:35.491
If it was one expression being divided

00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:37.813
by another expression, then I
would use the quotient rule.

00:04:37.813 --> 00:04:39.600
But in this case it's going
to be the product rule.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.110
And so that tells me

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.152
that this is going to be the
derivative with respect to x

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:46.152
of the first expression,

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:49.260
just gonna do that with the orange circle,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.628
times the second expression,

00:04:51.628 --> 00:04:53.323
I'm gonna do that with the blue circle,

00:04:53.323 --> 00:04:56.156
plus the first expression,
not taking its derivative,

00:04:56.156 --> 00:04:58.406
the first expression, times

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.470
the derivative with respect to x of,

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.342
of the second expression.

00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:11.946
Once again here,

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:13.757
this is just the product rule.

00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:16.125
You can substitute sine
of x squared plus five

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:17.635
where you see this orange circle,

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:19.121
and you can substitute cosine of x

00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:20.282
where you see this blue circle.

00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:22.673
But the whole point here
isn't to actually solve this

00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:23.974
or compute this,

00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:25.599
but really to just show

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.177
how you identify the
structures in these expressions

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:30.406
to think about well do I
use the chain rule first

00:05:30.406 --> 00:05:32.333
and then use the product rule here?

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:34.423
Or in this case do I use
the product rule first?

00:05:34.423 --> 00:05:35.607
And even once you do this,

00:05:35.607 --> 00:05:36.791
you're not going to be done.

00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:38.811
Then to compute this derivative,

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:40.622
you're going to have
to use the chain rule,

00:05:40.622 --> 00:05:43.084
and you'll keep going until
you don't have any more

00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:44.751
derivatives to take.
