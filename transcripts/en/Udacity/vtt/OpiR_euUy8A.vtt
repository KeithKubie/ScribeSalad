00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.810
There's a pattern here, isn't there?

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.160
Almost every website follows some type of grid structure.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.900
But where's the grid structure coming from?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.260
As it turns out, CSS allows us to control how wide our elements are and

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.790
how they're arranged on the page.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.760
But this should be a pretty easy task, right?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.580
Once we know what kind of grid we want, we should pretty easily be able to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.420
just snap elements to the right points in the grid.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.530
Looking back at the Udacity courses page,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.990
we've got all of these classes listed on the right side of the screen.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.003
We've got options for

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.780
making sure that they all fit within this column on the right.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.435
Either, we could go into each class here and style its HTML and

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:38.670
CSS individually to make sure that they all fit on the right side of the screen.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.660
Or we could create some kind of general CSS classes that define the styles that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.300
we need to keep all the courses in the right column.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.270
In fact, creating CSS classes that control layout is considered the best

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.550
practice today.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.990
And we call these sets of classes Frameworks.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.930
Let's dive deeper into what Frameworks need to do.
