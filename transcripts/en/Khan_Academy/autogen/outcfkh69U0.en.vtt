00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 . 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.730
 I think it's commonplace 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.790
 The idea of ​​square root, but I would like to clarify some 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.250
 The terms at least, I always find 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.000
 At first vague, I want to make it 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.100
 Very clear in your mind 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.680
 If you type 9 inside the root code of the square, I think you know 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.940
 Read it as the square root of 9 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.880
 But I want to explain 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.990
 When you see the number inside the root code like this 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:38.650
 This means the basic square root of 9 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.420
 When I say the basic square root, I really say 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.300
 The positive square root of 9 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.770
 If this phrase equals 3 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.350
 I will be clear here because you probably know 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 9 has two square roots 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.000
 By definition, the square root is a spring root 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.190
 For 9 is a number, if you squared, the output will be 9 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.830
 3 is a square root, plus -3 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.260
 3. Also a square root 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 But if you just type the root code, you do 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.990
 Means the positive square root, or 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.650
 Basic square root 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.710
 If you want things to return to the negative square root 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 You place a negative signal in front of the root symbol 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.170
 This equals -3 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.970
 Or if you want to take both the positive and 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.520
 Negative, both the root root and the negative square root 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
 You will write a positive or negative signal in front of 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.220
 Root code 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.650
 Of course, this is equal to positive or negative 3 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.450
 So now what I want to talk about is 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.280
 Representation of conjugation, y = 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.520
 Square root of x 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.765
 See how it is associated with the conjunction y = x - call me 

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:04.740
 Write this here because I will do it 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.960
 See how y = x ^ 2 is associated 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.090
 Hence, if you have some time, we will focus on them 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.940
 A little bit we get a better understanding of what makes 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.400
 These associations move up and down or to the left and right 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.590
 So let's do the value of the table before getting 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.490
 Account Representation 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.180
 If we have y = x ^ 2 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.720
 We have x and y values 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.870
 This is y = the square root of x 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.780
 Again, we have x and y values ​​here 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.790
 So let me choose random values ​​for x here 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.380
 I will remain in the positive field of x 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.300
 Suppose that x = 0, 1 - Let me 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.900
 I color it 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.590
 When x = 0, how much is y? 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.090
 Well y = x ^ 2 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 0 ^ 2 = 0 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.750
 When x = 1, y would be 1 ^ 2, i 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.710
 When x = 2, y would be 2 ^ 2, ie 4 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.510
 When x = 3, y would be 3 ^ 2, ie 9 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.240
 We have seen this before 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.100
 I can continue 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.340
 Let me add 4 here 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.640
 When x = 4, y would be 4 ^ 2, ie 16 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.430
 We have seen all this 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.000
 We have represented the equivalent plots 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.680
 This was all a review 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.800
 Now let's see what happens when y = 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.300
 Square root of x 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.650
 Let's see what happens 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.360
 I will choose some X values ​​to make them 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.200
 it's interesting 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.790
 When x = 0, how much would y? 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.220
 How much is the square root of 0? 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.550
 Well it's 0 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.410
 0 ^ 2 = 0 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.280
 When x = 1, the square root of x is any 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.110
 L 1 equals positive 1 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.050
 It has another square root which is -1, but 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.000
 We have no positive or negative references written here 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 We have only a square root 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.500
 When x = 4, how much y? 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.340
 Well, the square root of 4 is positive 2 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.430
 When x = 9, how much y? 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.630
 When x = 9, the square root 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.980
 For 9 equals 3 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.950
 Finally, when x = 16, square root 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.960
 For 16 is 4 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.720
 If you think you have already seen how they are related to each other 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.920
 We only switched x and y 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.250
 Well, they are the same x and y, but we have here 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.510
 x = 2, y = 4 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.020
 Here x = 4, y = 2 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.480
 3.9, 9.3 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.730
 4.16, 16.4 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.960
 This is logical 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.430
 If you cross both ends of the equation 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.150
 You will get y ^ 2 = x 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.530
 Of course, the range of y values ​​will be limited to 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.480
 Values ​​y are positive because only meal values ​​can be taken 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.020
 Because this is a basic square root 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.090
 But the general idea is that we have switched x and y 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.580
 Between this pairing and this pairing, if 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.620
 Suppose that the field x and y are positive 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.550
 Now, let's see how the graphic representation will look 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.730
 I guess you probably have guessed - call me 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.960
 I represent them here 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.450
 Let me do them manually because I think this is my tutorial 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.160
 At times before extracting the graph calculator 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.180
 If I stay in the positive quarter, ie in the first 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.260
 A quarter here 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.800
 Let me do this first 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.740
 If we have point 0,0, point 1.1, and point 2 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.550
 , 2, which I have to draw 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.590
 Just a little smaller than these 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.280
 Let me define this 1, 2, 3 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.870
 Let me do this 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.890
 I'll go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.010
 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.070
 This is the distance I have to move 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:02.340
 Then I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.610
 14, 15, 16 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.000
 This is the distance I will move in this direction 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.060
 Now let us represent it 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.580
 If we have 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.590
 2.4 Here 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.720
 3.9 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.410
 3, 5,6,7,8,9 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.060
 3,9 are located here 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.450
 And then we have 4,16 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.660
 4.16 will be here 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.770
 If y = x ^ 2, and 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.200
 We've seen this before 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.180
 It will look like this 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.740
 We represented it in the positive quarter, so we got it 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.010
 The shape of the u that looks like this 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.100
 So 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.870
 Now let's represent y = 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.210
 Square root of x 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.750
 If here, again, we have 0,0 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.490
 We have 1,1 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.900
 We have 4.2 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.580
 1, 2, 3, 4, 2 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.140
 We have 9,3 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.750
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3 here 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.690
 Then we have 16.4 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.390
 16.4 are located here 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.620
 So the representation will look like this 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.480
 Notice, they seem like 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.230
 Turning around the axes 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.370
 This is open along the y axis, and this is open along 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.230
 X axis 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.110
 Again, this is quite logical because we did 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.680
 By switching x and y 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.090
 Especially if the first quarter is taken into consideration 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.460
 Indeed, they are symmetric around the line, y 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.523
 = x 

00:07:39.523 --> 00:07:42.350
 We will talk about these things in the future 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.850
 Parity around the line, y = x 

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.580
 We can better represent it 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.720
 Graph Calculator 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.960
 I found this on the website 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.425
 You did a quick search on the website 

00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:55.800
 I want to give a good credit to people who 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.360
 Use their source 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.370
 This is my.hrw.com/math06 website 

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.350
 You can turn this off 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.580
 I hope you can read this 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.490
 Especially if viewed by HD 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.850
 But let us represent all these things 

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.270
 Let us represent them more clearly than 

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.600
 What I can do manually 

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.030
 In fact, let me bring what you have written here 

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.360
 If this 

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.590
 He must give you - well 

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:24.390
 Let's first represent y = x ^ 2 

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.770
 And then in green, let me paint y = 

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.720
 Square root of x 

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.070
 There are many buttons here on the right, you know 

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.650
 what I do 

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.000
 I have several buttons here: square code and 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.030
 Root icon and all this 

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.110
 Let me focus on this 

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.900
 If they let me represent them 

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.250
 I first represented x ^ 2 and then painted 

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.050
 The spring root of x 

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.500
 See, if you concentrate on the first quarter here 

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.680
 You'll see that you got the same output that you got 

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.120
 There, although what I got was more messy 

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.150
 Now, for fun and, as you know, I did not do this 

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.590
 After using familiar quarters 

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.730
 Let's see what happens 

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.770
 What we need to do is to move the different representations 

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.250
 If with x ^ 2, I will do two things 

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.990
 I will scale the drawings and move them 

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.800
 If this is x ^ 2 

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.190
 Let's focus only on x ^ 2 and see what happens 

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.030
 When we are graduating 

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.610
 Then I'll do it with the root code too 

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.930
 This will work for anything 

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:24.480
 Let's see what happens when we get 2 x - no, not 2 ^ 2 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.050
 - 2 x x ^ 2 

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:36.070
 Let's do one other solution, which is 1.5 × 0 - I can 

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.470
 Make a 0.4 solution already 

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.290
 0.5 × x ^ 2 

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.350
 Let us represent them 

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.190
 If x ^ 2 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.290
 Note that x ^ 2 is not red 

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.610
 If we scale it by 2, the shape will remain parabola 

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.970
 Head in the same place, but we move up both 

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:55.790
 Two directions 

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.780
 If we have 0.5 × x ^ 2, we will still have 

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.680
 Parabola, but we move up a little slower 

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.230
 We have u wide open but staging factor 

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.570
 Less than 1 

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.530
 If so, decide how much expansion or contraction 

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.660
 Parabola slot 

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.990
 And then if you want to move it to the left or to the right 

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.410
 I want you to think about why this is 

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.030
 If this is x ^ 2 

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.690
 Let me assume that I want you to take the representation of x ^ 2 and 

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.040
 I want to move it by 4 units to the right 

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.396
 What I do is say x - 4 

00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.820
 x-4) ^ 2) 

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.640
 If you want to move it by 2 to - let us assume that I am 

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.980
 I'll move it 2 to the left. x 2) ^ 2) 

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.350
 What will we get? 

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.570
 They noticed it as I said. x - 4) ^ 2) may 

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.960
 Move 4 units to the right 

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.750
 x 2) ^ 2), moved two units to the left 

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.740
 Guy may seem intuitive at first, this is the stirring that you are 

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.530
 I'm talking about him 

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.420
 But think about what is happening 

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.320
 Here, the head falls on point x = 0 

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.320
 When you get here at 0 ^ 2 

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.810
 Now here, the head falls on x = 4 

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.430
 But when x = 4, you will put 4 here 

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.260
 And you get 4, -4 

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.230
 If it stays zero 

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.410
 4, -4 = 0 and this is what you are squaring 

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.050
 Here, when x = -2 - minus 2 + 2 

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.360
 - You are squaring zero 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.370
 So in other words, whatever the value you are squaring, the 0 will be 

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.900
 Equal to 4 here 

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.660
 And 4 = 0 

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.790
 And -2 = 0 there 

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.990
 If I want you to think about this a bit 

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.000
 Another way you can think about this is when x = 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.490
 1, we are on the point of red parabola 

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.070
 But when x = 5 on the green pieces 

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.010
 We will have a 5 - 4 

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.060
 Inside our brackets 1, such as x = 

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.250
 1 here, at the top 

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.550
 If we are on the same point in the parabola 

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.910
 I want you to think about this a bit 

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.840
 Perhaps it is not self-evident to say 

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.560
 4. Move it to the right and press 2 to 

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.380
 the left 

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.650
 But this is already logical 

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.820
 Now, the other interesting thing is moving 

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.950
 Stuff up and down 

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.760
 This is actually direct 

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.200
 You want to move this curve up 

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.400
 Let's assume we want to move the red curve slightly up 

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.930
 We represent x ^ 2 + 1 

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.130
 Note that it has been moved up 

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.090
 If you want this green curve to move down by 5 units, place it 

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.850
 5. Here 

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.350
 Then represent it and move 5 units down 

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.620
 If you want to be open a little wider than this, then maybe you should 

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.320
 Step down slightly 

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.110
 Run it down and assume 0.5 × this 

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.440
 If now the green curve will be listed down and will open 

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.570
 Slightly wider 

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.510
 The same idea can be applied to 

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.020
 Sqrt 

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.510
 Let me do this 

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.180
 Let me apply the same idea 

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.340
 The same idea can be applied to any coupling 

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.260
 Let's then represent the square root of x 

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.570
 Using the green color, let's represent the square root of x 

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.140
 Let me say -5 

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.540
 If we move it to the top on the right by 5 units 

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.355
 And then assume that we have a square root of x + 4 

00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:07.650
 Move it to the left by 4 units 

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.860
 Let's move it down by 3 units 

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.060
 Let us represent all this 

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.110
 Square root of x 

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.730
 Then we have a square root of x-5 

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.470
 Note that it is the same square root of x 

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.760
 But I moved it to the right by 5 units 

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.730
 When x = 5, I have 0 inside the root code 

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.400
 Same square root of 0 

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.070
 If this point is equal to that 

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.030
 Now when I have the square root of x + 4, move it 

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.630
 To the left by 4 units 

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.000
 When x = -4, I have 0 inside the root code 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.030
 If this point is equal to that 

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.140
 Then you subtract 3, also you move it down by 3 units 

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.810
 This is the starting point 

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:51.660
 If you want to open this square blue root for a little bit 

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.070
 It will be a little tight 

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.740
 I will list it down 

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.900
 If here, when you put a few staging down and makes 

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.770
 It is more narrow because it is open to the length of the x axis 

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.430
 So let me do this 

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.250
 Let me begin with this in green - let me expand it 

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.460
 Let me assume that it is 3 × square root for x - 5 

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.780
 So let's draw all this 

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.660
 They noted, this decree in blue is now open to the top and more narrow 

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.640
 The green sign is open up a bit now, I guess you are 

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.470
 She says, a little faster 

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.480
 It has been taught 

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.410
 Then you can move this up slightly by 4 units 

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.000
 Then we represent him so 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.240
 Note that when we represent this, it is not a deviation 

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.120
 The parabola we talked about 

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.540
 Basic square root 

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.450
 If you represent a positive or negative square root, in fact 

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.020
 It will not be a logical association because it is 

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.720
 You will have two values ​​for y for each x value 

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.780
 Therefore, use the base square root 

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.940
 Anyway, I hope you have found this explanation 

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.900
 On the relations between the equivalence segments, and / or between x ^ 2 

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.550
 Basic square roots, useful 

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.340
 And how to move them 

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.210
 This will be very useful in the future 

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.840
 When we talk about inverse and moving conjugates 

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.133
 .
