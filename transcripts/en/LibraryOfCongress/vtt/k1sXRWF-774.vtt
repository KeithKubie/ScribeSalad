&gt;&gt; speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.510
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Well,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.810
do the panelists have any
questions for each other?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.110
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: I totally do.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.410
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Yeah?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.710
Okay.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: I was really, so,
I have to change in my whole posture

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.470
because I was on the hot seat
and scared, but now I'm like,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.990
oh, I'm asking questions.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.620
But, I was really compelled,
Trevor, by this notion,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.170
the community of practice
is something

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.760
that just can't be spontaneous,
and something that takes work.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.520
And, I was just wondering,
with the kind of work you do,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.400
can you say a little
bit more about, sort of,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.700
what those challenges look like?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.280
You said this thing, and it,
I mean, and from the talk,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.690
because your talk was, like, the
bomb, but if I were to step back,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.710
I would say that it was a
little bit out of place,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.950
in the sense that you said this
thing where I was like, you know,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.680
some people might come
to work that day

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.520
and not be feeling all
the weight of the world,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.820
of the things happening outside.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.520
And, I thought it was very
telling, an amazing way of, like,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.410
when you're doing the work,
and you're doing the good work,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.480
and you're doing the
work that matters, right?

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.780
And then, you're working
with a team,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.450
and everyone doesn't have the
same relation to the work.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.080
Can you say more about that?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.380
&gt;&gt; Trevor Muñoz: Right.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.060
Well, I mean, I think it's, so
one thing I didn't get to say was

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.500
that part of sort of trying
to imagine this structure,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.820 position:56%
and sort of keeping our community
sort of before our eyes is, I think,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.720
to grapple with, you know, the ways

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.780
in which our different experiences
are producing the new knowledge

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.070
right there as we're having
our different experiences.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.790
And, not to say that that
stuff is outside of the work

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.170
that we're doing, but to try
to understand how that comes

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.560
into the work we're doing.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.960 position:56%
And, whether it's my experience that
day, or someone else's experience,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.630
or all of our experiences, to
find out how those different ways

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.380
of coming to the work then shape
the work, rather than trying

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.900
to draw the boundary, and say, "Oh,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.630
if we only keep all
those things outside,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.830
then we can get on with it."

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.100
So, I guess that was
partly what was on my mind.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.330
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: Mm-hmm.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.730
Thank you for that.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.150
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: You have
a question back here?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.450
&gt;&gt; speaker 2: [inaudible]

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.750
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: If you
could yell, I'll repeat it.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.370
&gt;&gt; speaker 2: [inaudible]
My question is,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.900
[inaudible] as it applies

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.170
to African-American [inaudible]
study African-American [inaudible]

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.570 position:56%
I'm assuming that some of the
limitations may be both quantitative

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.310
and qualitative [inaudible]
material not,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.520
that were not even considered
[inaudible] print [inaudible]

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.820
collections, and now they're
part of digital collections.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:03.350
But, there are certain aspects
of information that's missing,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.180
and not included and it
makes it even more difficult

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.920
to [inaudible] digital realm.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.070
Can you speak a little bit more
about some of the, I guess,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.830
some of the particular challenges
and nuances that you're facing,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.210
in terms of doing digital
[inaudible] with that type of,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.520
you know, kind of challenged
data sets?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.820
&gt;&gt; Trevor Muñoz: Sure.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.040
I'm, it was actually something
that resonated very much with me

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.230
from Marisa's talk, actually, about
thinking about these questions

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.540
of deletion in the archive,
and our sort of, our interfaces

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.820
to what's deleted or missing,
or what we ourselves need

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.180
to protect in the archive.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.840
And so, actually, I wonder if you
have some reflections on this,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.720
as well, but I mean, just as a sort
of general way of saying, I mean,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.340
certainly, you know,
being attuned to looking

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.560
for what's not in the records.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.050
You know, that's not a new thought.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.680
But also, sort of trying,
again, to sort of return

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.000
to the conversation we were
just having about, you know,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.650
what do I see from my perspective?

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.150
What does someone else see
from their perspective?

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.930
And, can we sort of piece that data
together, though now I'm trying

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.510
to put it together with
this idea of data and datum.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.420
I'm not going to be able
to do it on the fly.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.720
So, certainly there's that.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.430
I mean, thinking about
being conscious of the ways

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.680
in which the people who might be
in this archive are in the archive

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.320
because they are being represented
there, you know, from, you know,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.730
like, by the state, or
from some other body,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.790
and not in their own control.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.410
And that, you know, maybe we
want to recover their story,

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.350
but maybe we also, you know, sort
of don't want to expose, you know,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.400
populations that, you
know, have been sort

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.910
of mistreated in certain ways.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.990
And so, there's a lot
of it that goes into it.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.910
I mean, we're really at the
beginning of our process,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.270
and I'm learning from
a lot of my colleagues

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.520
about what they're bringing to
this, what they want to look for.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.070
And so, I think we'll have a better
answer for you, you know, in year

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.860
or in six months, and we're
really kind of at the beginning.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.100
But, I wonder if you had
any reflections on that.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.730
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: Yeah,
I really don't know.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.790
There's so much in that question.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.020
It's the question of translation,
right, between media and thinking

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.730
about what happens when
one thing becomes another.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.200
I do think the question
of exclusion, right?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.050
You have exclusion that's sort
of personal agency and choice,

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.790
as I was trying to talk about it.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.930
But then, there's also
exclusion as protection,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.440
which I'm really compelled by the
social media stuff I just find,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.040
thinking back to Burgess'
[assumed spelling] talk.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.650
It's just terrifying
to think about, right?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.440
And so, there's a way
in which imagining,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.440
to think about what should
be excluded has to take

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.720 position:56%
into account one, the imagination
the future this archive can produce,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.540
but at the same time,
understand the ways

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.370
in which it's always an
artifact of the present.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.670
That's what we're talking about.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.800
We're talking about the problem
of the present, in a way,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.380
when we're talking about exclusion.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.100
It's the person who's
standing there,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.840
who remains, who says
no more, right?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.700
And, I'm sort of babbling around
this, but it's like I'm trying to,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.110 position:56%
I can sort of see it where we're
trying to, like, I think both of us,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.210
you more so, this is
something you're thinking

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.710
about on the ground right now.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.390
So, I guess I am with the Zine
Scenes project, sort of thinking

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.530
about what it means to
have to, every moment,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.740
also understand yourself
as a steward, right?

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.150
What constitutes good stewardship.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.760 position:56%
And, at the same time, understanding

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.640
that that stewardship
was never necessarily.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.940
Not never.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.840
In many cases, was not
necessarily given to us.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.840
No one handed us stuff and said,
"Please, take these things,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.460
and do this stuff with it," right?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.760
&gt;&gt; Trevor Muñoz: Right.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.350
Yeah, to have humility about
that, about the stewardship.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.650
&gt;&gt; Harriett Green: Right.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.950
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: Right.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.250
&gt;&gt; Trevor Muñoz: That was a
theme we heard earlier, as well.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.780
&gt;&gt; speaker 3: When you talked
about the train the trainer

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.680
for making libraries more digitally
sufficient, how will you get

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.830
in contact with the programs
that are in your local area?

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.310
&gt;&gt; Harriett Green: So,
we are reaching out, so,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.700 position:56%
in terms of our pilot workshops, or?

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.770
So yeah, we are, you know, we
have natural contacts already

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.790
with librarians who are interested.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.460
We're promoting at least
the pilot workshops.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.420
So, each partner institution
does have plans to not only work

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.310
with their own librarians in
the pilots, but also reach

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.760
out to their programs,
other programs in the area,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.350
other librarians, and
start bringing them in.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.730
And then, we have started reaching
out to programs and librarians

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:40.140
in the area, so in Atlanta, and
then thinking at major conferences,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.830
and how we partner with libraries.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.420
And so, reaching out both to
digital humanities librarians

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.090
in digital scholarship
centers, but also anybody

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.540
who has natural inclinations
to be interested in this work.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.840
And, there's a number of outlets

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.790
that we'll also reach
out to, as well.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.640
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Any
other questions?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.040
Right here.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.410
&gt;&gt; speaker 4: Also for Professor
Green, and the whole panel.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.570
In your training, there's a lot
of talk about collaboration today.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.580
Have you thought about
training librarians

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.460
and the researchers together?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.550
&gt;&gt; Trevor Muñoz: I mean,
certainly that's something

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.690
that we're explicitly doing,
and thinking about, you know,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.740
these ideas of mutually informing
expertise and ignorance, going back

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.810
and forth among actually the many
different positions of people

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.840
in the trainings, rather than, you
know, thinking of it as, you know,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.030 position:56%
one set of experts clearly
delineated at the front of the room,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.730
communicating to other groups.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.530
So, yeah, we're explicitly
trying to do that.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:46.410
&gt;&gt; Harriett Green: And, I mean, in
past, like, actually, in general,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.390 position:56%
HTRC workshops, we do do that
already in our different iterations.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.220
We, you know, teach both librarians
and researchers in our workshops.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.480
And, the idea with the grant, it's
specifically focused and targeted

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.600
and mandated for librarians, but
we're definitely anticipating

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.900
and trying to develop
the curriculum,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.890
so that librarians are able to
teach researchers and students

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.980
across all disciplines, and
from all research questions.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.990
So, it's a actually kind
of interesting challenge

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.140 position:56%
with the curriculum, both addressing
what librarians need to know,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.130
and kind of addressing their
needs, but also thinking through,

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.680
how do we enable them to then
train all sort of audiences?

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.980
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: Yeah.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.810
And, at Five College Digital
Humanities, we have a sort

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:33.910
of very explicit setup where
we very actively encourage,

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.170
so we do most of our
training around projects.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.110
So, we develop the training
as projects go along,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.420
so we can develop a sense
of what people need.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.980
Then, we offer just a little bit of
workshop around the edges to get,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.710
you know, whet the appetite so
that people want to learn more,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.480
in terms of bringing their
own sort of subject areas.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.660
But, we have a very explicit rule
about sort of flattening out some

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.110
of those relations whenever
possible, so faculty, staff,

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.040
and students are equally eligible
to be PIs together on projects.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: And, we
encourage projects that have to work

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.960
across campuses and also across
those categories as a way of sort

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.480
of emphasizing not only just
collaboration, like, yay, team,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.590
but emphasizing collaboration
of understanding

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.100
that those subject positions also
bring different kinds of expertise,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.150
even if they share common
interests, in that that sharing

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.250
of expertise is somewhat mandatory.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.550
I hate using that word.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.850
&gt;&gt; speaker 5: [inaudible]

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.150
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Okay.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.450
What are they?

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.940
Can we have the microphone
down here?

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.600
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Thanks.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.900
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: [inaudible]
possible [inaudible].

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Just pass it, yeah.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.200
Thank you.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.490
&gt;&gt; speaker 5: Okay, so we just
got, about seven minutes ago,

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.900
a tweet came in from Dr.
Hazard [assumed spelling],

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:09.880 position:56%
and the question is, it's not to
anyone specifically, but in general,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.630
diasporic community as a
practice aren't represented

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.580
in cataloging schemes,
tech and digital,

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.840
so how do you manage
the levels of those?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.950
Oh, that was a great question.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.800
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: Yeah, I mean,
that question's, I'll respond,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.930
because I feel like I was trying
to talk a little bit about that.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.230
It's a challenge.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.140
I think that's the thing
that's sort of why I sort

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.320
of said it very quickly
towards the end, but for me,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.310
that's one thing Nbimbe [assumed
spelling], who doesn't really,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.110
is not a digital scholar, but I
think it's incredibly important,

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.590
because what Nbimbe is trying to
get us to think about are the ways

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.120
in which inclusion is nothing
without a transformation

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.430
of the actual structure, right?

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.900
So, I think that's absolutely
true, that in many ways,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.830
the practices of various diasporic
indigenous communities are not, or,

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.600
even of frankly white, or
what we think of as sort

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.200
of mainstream communities, aren't
represented in the interfaces

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.250
and ways we use these archives.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.000
But, I do think that when
we're thinking about, you know,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.540
this is the inclusion narrative,
where you just imagine it like,

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.940 position:56%
you know, life is just this big pot,

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.810
and if you just get more
different kinds of people in it,

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.140
we'll all be okay, right?

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.440
And, you know, I can't lie.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.740
It makes me happy.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.270
I want to be in the pot,
like, ooh, the pot, right?

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.950
But, at the same time, there's a
way in which, when you're talking

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.610
about transformation, by default,
we're thinking about the digital.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.950
It has to be a technical,
structural transformation, right?

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.370
So, I'm not trying to dodge
the question, but I do think,

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.940
so we have groups that are looking,
for instance, at using Twine,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.950
using different ways of using other
kinds of programs that enable you

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.060
to produce interactive interfaces.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.510
Because, I do think
interactivity doesn't sort of solve

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.980
or fix everything, but it does get
us a little bit closer to thinking

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.250 position:56%
about sort of the call and
response, and the give and the take,

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.090
and whatever it might be from
various communities, right,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.960
that could really be useful
for thinking about the work

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.260
of archives in the digital.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.840
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Another
question from Twitter?

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.140
&gt;&gt; speaker 5: Yeah.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.440
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Okay.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.010
&gt;&gt; speaker 6: To what degree
are people represented

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.640
in archives there voluntarily
or by the will of others,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.120
and how would they
themselves want to be seen?

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.200 position:56%
That's a question from Elise Ingdall
[assumed spelling] on Twitter.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.500
&gt;&gt; Trevor Muñoz: Wow.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.480
[inaudible] the global
answer to that question.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:36.870
I mean, I think it's certainly true
that we have more, you know, state,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.930
like, collections of state
records, or organization records,

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.120
and that the idea of a
sort of community archive,

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.530
which is in the control
of those people

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:51.040 position:56%
who are maybe themselves represented
in it is relatively newer.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.970
That's not a very satisfying
answer to that question.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.350
So, I mean, I think it's a dynamic

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.780
that we all need to
be aware of, right?

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.630
And, that it shouldn't come as a
surprise, but, for instance, or,

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.520
like, some of the work that Jarrett
Drake is doing about thinking

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.710
about the differences between
those two types of records,

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.360
or those two types of archives,
you know, is informing, I think,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.730 position:56%
a lot of the conversation right now.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.240
But, I couldn't give a
global answer to that.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.540
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: Yeah.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.840
I think, unfortunately,
the answer is just,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.160
very often, they're not, right?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.560
And, I think that goes
to the state thing.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.080
The stuff we have, the
materials that we have the most

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.990
of are the things that
were probably collected

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.020
in the least desirable ways, right,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.800
which is another thing
to reckon with.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.200
I do think, and not to be
Pollyanna, but I think a lot

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.500
of the talks today reflect it.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.910
That's why the work you're
doing is so important,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.560
of just empowering more people to
actually create those collections,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.530
and that would [inaudible]
also technically,

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.610
not even just technically
or even collaboratively,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.740 position:56%
more people to create experiences of
those archives digitally, as well.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.920
Those are two things that both have
to happen, and so, not to just sort

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.690
of deflect this question
onto, like, this future,

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.410
but I do think it's something
we have to think about,

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.050
because at the end of the day, most
of these answers are never going

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:07.930
to sound very good, because
it's not actually a happy past.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.990
&gt;&gt; Abbey Potter: Alright,
so we'll have to end there.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.150
Thank you for sharing your
work and your thoughts with us,

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.510
and let's give them
a round of applause.
