technology doesn't mean that they have
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.120
technology doesn't mean that they have
to be consumer facing but the technology

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
to be consumer facing but the technology
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.769
to be consumer facing but the technology
has to be based on the same technology

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
has to be based on the same technology
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.820
has to be based on the same technology
that we all used day-to-day and so we're

centers so obviously in New York is

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
centers so obviously in New York is
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.050
centers so obviously in New York is
well-positioned for that the difference

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
well-positioned for that the difference
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.850
well-positioned for that the difference
between New York and Silicon Valley is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
between New York and Silicon Valley is
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.109
between New York and Silicon Valley is
in the kind of technology that people

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
in the kind of technology that people
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.600
in the kind of technology that people
that we develop here as opposed to in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
that we develop here as opposed to in
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030
that we develop here as opposed to in
Silicon Valley first I think we should

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
Silicon Valley first I think we should
 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.980
Silicon Valley first I think we should
point out where the similarities are and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
point out where the similarities are and
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080
point out where the similarities are and
the similarities are that because

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
the similarities are that because
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.350
the similarities are that because
technology today is transportable and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
technology today is transportable and
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.050
technology today is transportable and
rentable and relatively cheap to to use

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060
rentable and relatively cheap to to use
 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.429
rentable and relatively cheap to to use
we in New York but it could be anywhere

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
we in New York but it could be anywhere
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.460
we in New York but it could be anywhere
it could be Bombay could be Austin have

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
it could be Bombay could be Austin have
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.920
it could be Bombay could be Austin have
access to the same technology to develop

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
access to the same technology to develop
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.950
access to the same technology to develop
new applications new services then

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
new applications new services then
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.590
new applications new services then
anybody in Silicon Valley so everyone

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
anybody in Silicon Valley so everyone
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.539
anybody in Silicon Valley so everyone
starts with the same level playing field

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
starts with the same level playing field
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880
starts with the same level playing field
the technology is accessible through the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
the technology is accessible through the
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.120
the technology is accessible through the
cloud it's rentable through the cloud

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130
cloud it's rentable through the cloud
 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.889
cloud it's rentable through the cloud
anybody can start a company with you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
anybody can start a company with you
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.670
anybody can start a company with you
know a couple of laptops and two or

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
know a couple of laptops and two or
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350
know a couple of laptops and two or
three people and you have in a few

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
three people and you have in a few
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.179
three people and you have in a few
thousand dollars literally and you can

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
thousand dollars literally and you can
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.530
thousand dollars literally and you can
start a company and you can start a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
start a company and you can start a
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.270
start a company and you can start a
business so it's very different today

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
business so it's very different today
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.469
business so it's very different today
than it was just a few years ago where a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479
than it was just a few years ago where a
 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.720
than it was just a few years ago where a
large part of the money that you raised

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
large part of the money that you raised
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.580
large part of the money that you raised
actually went to the equity

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
actually went to the equity
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.710
actually went to the equity
the technology you had to buy servers

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
the technology you had to buy servers
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.780
the technology you had to buy servers
and yet by hardware you had to buy

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790
and yet by hardware you had to buy
 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.780
and yet by hardware you had to buy
expensive software licenses and today

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
expensive software licenses and today
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.460
expensive software licenses and today
you don't have to do any of that so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
you don't have to do any of that so
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.460
you don't have to do any of that so
that's a big difference but we we have

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
that's a big difference but we we have
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.270
that's a big difference but we we have
in New York as as anywhere else access

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
in New York as as anywhere else access
 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.610
in New York as as anywhere else access
to the same latest developments in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
to the same latest developments in
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.860
to the same latest developments in
technology than anybody in Silicon

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
technology than anybody in Silicon
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.589
technology than anybody in Silicon
Valley the the big difference is that

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599
Valley the the big difference is that
 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.220
Valley the the big difference is that
New York focuses more on the software

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
New York focuses more on the software
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.900
New York focuses more on the software
layer on the application and the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
layer on the application and the
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.960
layer on the application and the
services layer so that we're really good

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
services layer so that we're really good
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.210
services layer so that we're really good

what New York is probably not going to
 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.129
what New York is probably not going to
do is develop the next plumbing for the

there's going to be a Cornell University

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
there's going to be a Cornell University
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.759
there's going to be a Cornell University
and in conjunction with the big

are building a campus and which will be
 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.720
are building a campus and which will be
ready in two or three years but the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
ready in two or three years but the
 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.909
