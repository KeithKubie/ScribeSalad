&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.020
&gt;&gt; Tom Sherwood: Good afternoon
all you Book Festival folks.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.340
I'm Tom Sherwood from
NBC4 here in Washington

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.300
and the public radio WAMU
Kojo Nnamdi Show on Fridays.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.130
Thank you for being here.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.930
You're welcome, your
cellphones are not.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.380
But I always say, don't turn it
off, if it rings, we just want you

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.350
to put it on speaker phone so
we'll know who's calling you.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.170
And by the way, this
is your legal warning.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.280
Your presence here is your
permission to be videotaped

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.020
and quoted and misrepresented
on social media.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.120
Now, finding your way around
this huge convention center,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.840 position:56%
it opened in 2003, can be daunting
going up and down floors in one room

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.560
and then another, finding
food, finding the bathrooms,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.810
lining up for autographs.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.760
You might say being here today
is "enjoyably exhaustive".

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.850
Enjoyably exhaustive, well,
that's the high praise

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.910
that New York Times' review gave to
Douglas Brinkley, his latest book

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.740
on American politics and
culture, "Rightful Heritage:

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.790
Franklin D. Roosevelt
and the Land of America".

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.960
I incidentally will
not be exhaustive.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.850
In his nearly two dozen books
over 25 years, historian Brinkley,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.230
not related to that other
guy, has rewalked and retraced

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.660
so many elements of America, our
wars, our politics, our industry,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.720 position:56%
our natural disaster called Katrina.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.810
The light-- The Rice professor
especially has been honored

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.050
for his attention to Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.180
So, it's fitting in this
year the 100th anniversary

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.830
of the National Park Service,
and not far from the FDR Memorial

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.200
and the Potomac River island
named in Teddy Roosevelt's honor.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.990
Douglas Brinkley can help
us understand America.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.360 position:56%
In here, the nation's capital today,
as we celebrate this book festival,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.500
as we open the new African-American
museum on the National Mall.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.920
And yes, as we steal ourselves
for Monday night's, not football,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.920
but presidential debate in
this difficult campaign year,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.140
in these next few minutes, maybe
Douglas Brinkley can offer insight

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.770
and hope in this still
forming sweet land of liberty.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.510
Please, everyone, welcome
Douglas Brinkley.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:54.820
[ Applause ]

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.630
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: It is
wonderful to be introduced by Tom

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.210
who has an extraordinary
voice and so--

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.580
And I'm trying to-- I
try to modulate mine.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.660
I'm used to talking loud because
I'm a Rice University professor.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.980
You have to project
without microphones.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.770 position:56%
But I'm here to talk about Franklin
D. Roosevelt and the national parks.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.100
FDR, we all know, is he was
called the squire of Hyde Park.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.930
He was born in 1882 in
the Hudson River Valley.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.640
And his whole life, the Hudson
became his sanctified landscape,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.410
it's the place that he most loved.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.870
He was born on Hyde Park on the
Hudson, he lived in the same home

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.820
where he was born all of his life
and he's buried at Hyde Park,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.920
it's our nation's first
presidential library.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.430
And he would always find strength
from that river 315 miles going

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.570
from the high Adirondack Mountains
coming in to New York City.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.180
It is a spectacular river.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.290
And when he was born in
1882, his family was part

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.080
of keeping the Hudson
beautiful movement.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.430
Today, we call it the
Scenic Hudson movement.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.140
But everybody was starting to look

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.930
at resources being
destroyed in the East Coast.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.070
This is pre-- When he's born,
the idea that the [inaudible]

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.550
where you save national
forests in the east,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.270
and everybody was clear-cutting
and the river was getting polluted

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.240
and fish stocks were dying.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.470
And so, Franklin Roosevelt's
father became very popular

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.570 position:56%
in local conservation on the Hudson.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.160
And they're also the
number one book writer.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.460
I'm at a book festival.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.760
If you were alive in
1880s, 1890s, 1900,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.060
the big writer was John
Burroughs, the great naturalist

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.400
who sanctified the Catskills.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.850
And so, FDR grew up
conservation as we call today,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.680 position:56%
it was part of his life script, most
famously because Theodore Roosevelt,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.970
his fifth cousin who he
nevertheless called uncle Teddy

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.980
or Uncle Theodore, he as
you know is synonymous

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.890
with the conservation
movement, Theodore Roosevelt.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.380
And TR always enjoyed looking at,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.010
from New York City,
but looking west.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.720
FDR was more about the
oceans and the rivers.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.420
But by the time Franklin Roosevelt
goes to college, to Harvard,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.920
and you need to know if you want
to understand anything at all

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.720
about Franklin Roosevelt, you
have to study Theodore Roosevelt.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.320 position:56%
They-- He took as a model, you know,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.620
Uncle Theodore's life
as sort of a script.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.090
So, Theodore Roosevelt had
been the head of the Forest,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.010
Fish and Game Commission
in New York State.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.880
FDR becomes the head of it.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.200
Theodore Roosevelt was the
assistant secretary of the navy.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.400
FDR was the assistant
secretary of the navy.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.820
Theodore Roosevelt was
governor of New York.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.510
FDR was a governor of New York.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.970
Theodore Roosevelt loved big navy.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.360
FDR loved big navy.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.480
Theodore Roosevelt
loved conservation

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.240
and the natural resources
and heirlooms of America.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.230
FDR loved all of those.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.480
Theodore Roosevelt had a
niece named Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.150
and FDR married her.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.770
You cannot deal with all-- the
revolution of the New Deal years

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.560
in conservation and the Civilian
Conservation Corps and the like,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.390
which I'm going to talk about in a
minute without thinking about TR.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:39.000 position:56%
But Theodore Roosevelt created two
mechanisms as president, guys, that,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.120 position:56%
you know, all national parks, we're
here celebrating the system was born

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.870
under the Organic Act in
1916 by Woodrow Wilson.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.660 position:56%
But that Organic Act for a national
park, it has to go through Congress.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.280
So, Theodore Roosevelt as
president would do that.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.550
From 1901 to 1909, he pushed
through Crater Lake in Oregon,

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.170
Mesa Verde in Colorado, Wind
Cave in South Dakota and others.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.490
But Theodore Roosevelt as
president created two mechanisms

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.050
which all presidents
followed, have used,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.100
and one is called national
monuments.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.820
And the idea is built on
the Antiquities Act of 1906.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.030
The Antiquities Act was an
elastic piece of legislation,

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:30.050
but instead for scientific reasons,
mainly meant for archeological digs

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:36.730
of prehistoric dinosaur bones
and for Native American relics

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.170
that a president could
declare, ward off an area,

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.770
think about like a murder site
with the yellow piece of plastic,

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.320
you know, going around, a
hunk of land that could be,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.350
by executive order, saved.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.580
And the reason this
Antiquities Act of 1906 went

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.690
into play is the Europeans
were robbing our western sites.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.390
They recognized the importance
of the Navajo and the Apache

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.320
and the Plain Indians, and
they were stealing things.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.620
And they were stealing
our dinosaur bones.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.860
So, this gets passed on Congress.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.430
Well, Theodore Roosevelt
ends up going to Yellowstone

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.580
with John Burroughs,
the great naturalist,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.740
then he goes to the Grand Canyon.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:22.590
And TR stands at that canyon, looks
out over the divine abyss and says,

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.530
do not touch it, God has made
it, you will only mar it,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.190
leave the Grand Canyon alone.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.600
And Congress and Senate starts
moving to perhaps mine it for zinc,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.160
asbestos and copper, and Theodore
Roosevelt then uses the executive

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.280
order meant for smaller
parcels for over 600,000 acres.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.950
And now, it's over a
million acres today

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.870
or else the Grand Canyon
would have been lost.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.660
And TR would do that to save
the redwoods at Muir Woods.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.050
He would do that, you know,
to save Devils Tower, Wyoming.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.870
So, that lives on after--
due to Theodore Roosevelt.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.180
Barack Obama is now the president

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.940
that assigned more national
monuments than any other.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.720
I just wrote a piece about a week
ago in the New York Times about it.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.890
Secondly, hundred years ago, women
here would have worn a bonnet

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.560
with ornamental feathers
to hear me speak.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.230
You may not think you would have,
you may have-- but you would have.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.040
And these would have been
feathers of an egret or a heron.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.060
Nothing calls for federal action
more than bird protection.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.010
You could not have a liberal
Connecticut Audubon Society that's

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.820
protecting the birds to
have them fly to Florida

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.090
and be slaughtered willy-nilly.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.550
Birds know no boundaries.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.180
So, it demanded federal
attention if we are going

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.620
to save species for extinction.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.210
And Theodore Roosevelt goes
to Pelican Island, Florida,

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.180
a bird rookery where these
guys were coming with guns

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.990
and gunning all the birds
and plucking the feathers

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.180
and then stealing the eggs.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.760
And he says, I so declare it
a federal bird reservation.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.540
And he does that 51 times,
saving the albatross of Hawaii,

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.790
saving parts of Alaska
the size of West Virginia

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.450
and giving these areas to wildlife.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:30.290
Those 51 are later expanded by
dozens to over 100 to 200 by FDR.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.290
And it's Franklin Roosevelt
building on TR's bird reservations

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.550
that creates the 1940
today's US Fish and Wildlife.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:45.310
You all, here in the audience, own
over 550 national wildlife refuges

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:50.200
because of TR starting
it and FDR moving on it.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.350
And for those national monuments I
just mentioned, when you can't get

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.620
up a piece of land
saved through Congress,

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.180
you do the executive
order, so many places

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.710
that we all celebrate
in this country.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:07.200
Capitol Reef in Utah, a great
national park, FDR creates it

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.760
as a monument, today, it's a park.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.370 position:56%
Channel Islands off of Santa
Barbara area in Ventura, California,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.860
gorgeous islands, the
Galapagos of America,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.730
FDR saves it as a national
monument, today, it's a park.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.380
The Olympics National Forest
up there, beautiful rainforest

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.200
in Washington State, FDR went there

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.160
and saw how people were
recklessly clear-cutting the land.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.790
And Franklin Roosevelt
said, whoever did that,

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.480
I hope they're roasting in hell.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.090
And he pushes through the creation
of our Olympic National Park.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.000 position:56%
So-- But keep in mind, the monuments

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.690
and wildlife refuges
are both Roosevelt's.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.320
But FDR takes it to a new level.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.000
Now, the turning point for
Franklin Roosevelt I think

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.120
as a true conservationist to match

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:10.280
and perhaps supersede Theodore
is-- it occurs in 1921.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.130
FDR is-- goes and he loses, we're
dealing in election right now.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:22.160
In 1920, it was Warren
Harding beat Cox and Roosevelt.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.010
FDR was the VP in 1920,
the Democrats lose.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.980
FDR had no job.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.080
He had been assistant
secretary of the navy.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.210
He was just now the
losing VP candidate.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.570
And he asked himself, what would
Theodore Roosevelt have done?

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:43.430
And the answer was, he worked for
the boy scouts of Greater New York.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.710
TR was the great pusher of the
boy scouts, the godfather of it.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.950
And now, Franklin Roosevelt
organizes the boy scouts

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.060
of Greater New York to go
to Bear Mountain State Park,

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.720
on the Hudson River, in
his backyard up there,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.830
and bring all these inner city
kids to do horseshoes and archery

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:08.420
and fishing and enjoy the
bounties of nature in the Hudson.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.890
And unfortunately, he went
swimming with these boy scouts

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:17.340
and we think there
contracted the poliovirus.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.630 position:56%
And he didn't manifest itself till
he got to Campobello, New Brunswick.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.470
And while he was there, he
went to bed, he had sweats,

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.450
he didn't feel well and
he woke up with no feeling

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.290
in the lower half of his body.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.670
The man you all know for
saying, "We have nothing to fear

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:43.200
but fear itself," you know, was
another fear and panic and terror.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.750
Eleanor Roosevelt became
his Florence Nightingale.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.770
It was very generous of her
because she had found love letters

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.920
from Lucy Mercer that
FDR was having an affair.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.940
She put all that aside.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:04.370 position:56%
And he goes back to Hyde Park on
the Hudson to heal, and nobody wants

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.580
to see him because to hug somebody
with polio would have been a fear

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.630
if you would have contracted it.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.170
So, all these friends,
Mr. good-looking,

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.420 position:56%
Mr. assistant secretary of the navy,

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.180
Mr. I was just the VP
nominee is now a pariah.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:25.130
And he found soulless on the Hudson
among the squirrels and the birds.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.100
FDR was a lifelong ornithologist.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.670 position:56%
And then he says, what did
Theodore Roosevelt do in his crisis?

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.630
Theodore Roosevelt's
big crisis, guys,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:40.590 position:56%
was not when he was the Rough Rider
in 1898 in the Spanish-American War.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:46.260
Theodore Roosevelt's big crisis
was when he got shot in 1912

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.530
in Milwaukee when he was delivering
a speech for the Bull Moose Party.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.370
Theodore Roosevelt's huge crisis
came when he was a young man,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.640
and on the same day,
Valentine's Day, he--

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.840
TR lost his mother
on the same house,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.030
his mother with Bright's
disease, collapsed kidneys

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.110 position:56%
and his wife died giving childbirth.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.100
He lost his mom and his wife on
the same day, Theodore Roosevelt.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.590
We, as scholars, read
people's mail for a living,

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:20.310 position:56%
and there's nothing more moving
than seeing the giant X that TR puts

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.490
in his diary and says, the light
has gone out of my life forever.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.870
What does he do when he's
depressed losing a mother and wife?

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.970
He got lost in the wild.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.780
He went to North Dakota, the Dakota
Territory, Medora, the badlands,

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.230
went looking for grizzly
and buffalo.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.050
In fact, he starts the modern
endangered species movement,

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:45.120
protection of North
American animal life.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.430
When he kills a buffalo,
Theodore Roosevelt up there,

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.020
and then realizes they're all
disappearing and he creates Boone

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.340
and Crockett Club to save them.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.800 position:56%
So, FDR gets lost in the wilderness.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.200
But he goes to the Everglades.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.520
And Everglades is a national park
that Franklin Roosevelt creates.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.710
But he goes in the Everglades
and the whole Florida Keys

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.870 position:56%
and goes boating, and he thinks that
water will help him with the polio.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.970
And he write-- He's down there
with an ornithologist friend

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:21.320
in the 1920s writing down all of
the different species he sees.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.130
He's birdwatching and
trying to heal in nature,

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.510 position:56%
the way TR had done in the badlands.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:32.070
He comes back from these Florida
trips and buys Warm Springs,

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:38.170 position:56%
Georgia, a resort of natural thermal
pools in Georgia, Meriwether County.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.890 position:56%
You can go there now, and he creates
a resort for people with polio,

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.870
living in nature among
the trees and the rest.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.170
And that's his business, FDR.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.480
And he becomes the leader
of the state park movement.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.020
Do you guys realize that FDR in
the '20s is pushing state parks?

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.480
But by the time he's president,
the New Deal will create

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.920
over 800 state parks
in the United States.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.680 position:56%
States didn't even have state parks
until FDR's New Deal workforces came

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.370
and built them, including Texas
where I live and Austin and I teach

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.800
at Rice in Houston right now.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.890
And he then decides, well, I'll
try to get back into politics, FDR,

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.820 position:56%
and he trains to give a speech at
Madison Square Gardens for Al Smith,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.990
the big shot in New York.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:38.070
And his training isn't practicing
his verbiage, it's learning how

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.300 position:56%
to lean on one son and move his hips

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.660
in a very painful motion
to get to the podium.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.930
And everybody at Madison Square
Garden, when FDR came out,

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.490
held their breath, first off,
everybody thought he was done

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.490
with politics, he was too sick.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.680
Here, you're just praying
he doesn't fall.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.900
Then he got to the podium
and gave an amazing speech

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.620
and got a thunderous standing
ovation, off the charts.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.210
It went on almost an hour.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.900
Next days, New York Times says,
move over Al Smith, FDR is the man.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.640
He's the hot guy in politics now.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.390 position:56%
And from that resurrection, FDR runs
for governor in 1928 of New York

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.810
and then governor in
1930, and he wins both.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:31.330
And his big program is planting
trees, soil conservation,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:36.880
reforestation because he was a
rural Upstate New York politician,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.060
FDR, not a New York City guy.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.730
I've read letters Franklin
Roosevelt would write, please,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.430
do not say I'm from new York City.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:51.680
His constituents were apple
growers and people growing orchids

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.980
and lumberers in the
Catskills and fishermen.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:19:00.530
And he was a rural politician and
he worked as governor to pay men

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.890 position:56%
with no jobs, unemployed,
homeless, essentially a dollar a day

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.500
to start tree planting
and building state parks

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.010
and restocking lakes and ponds.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:16.450
Franklin Roosevelt's whole calling
card was conservation as governor.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:21.050
So when you cut to 1932, when
he gives the New Deal speech

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.730
and you cut to Franklin Roosevelt
saying we're going to put people

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.800
to work, he, in his own mind,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.250
creates the Civilian
Conservation Corps.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.800
And not that only does
he beat Herbert Hoover,

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.230
but at his famous inaugural
weeks later,

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.770
he announces his pet New
Deal program, the CCC.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:49.500
The CCC from 1933 to 1942,
plants around three billion trees

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.210
across the United States.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.160
Because these-- These are
done by unemployed men.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.270
Somebody from New York, New
Jersey suddenly finds himself

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.800
in Zion National Park in
Utah or somebody, you know,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.650
from a poor neighborhood
of Philadelphia suddenly

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.540
on New Mexico-Arizona border.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.130
It was remarkable and it worked.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.260
And because the big
mistake we make is thinking

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.180
about the Great Depression
being Wall Street collapsed

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.570
and the financial markets
and bank foreclosures,

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.530
we had destroyed the
land of America.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.810 position:56%
We had done the great plow up in the
Midwest and chopped all the trees.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:34.540
We had soils erosion, man-made
problems, environmental disaster

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.830
of the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.030
We had drained wetlands,
we had drained swamps.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:46.880 position:56%
And so, it became absolute-- a
landscape of America that was dying.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.510
And he takes it over and he
is able to, as president,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.410 position:56%
take TR conservation to a new level.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.760
Do you want to know how
committed Franklin Roosevelt is

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.660 position:56%
to our parks in the love of America?

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.550
Franklin Roosevelt at the
time of Pearl Harbor, Pearl--

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.440
this is a big moment of Pearl
Harbor, he gets a letter

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.920
from Rosalie Edge with
this great Harold Ickes,

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.050
the best interior secretary
in American history.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.260
And Edge is a conservation
environmental activist

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.560
from New York.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.250
And she says, dear Mr. President,
the trumpeter swan is going

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:29.040
to go extinct because you had
built a 10th mountain division,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.410
a training facility for ski
troopers at Henrys Lake, Idaho.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.810
And it happens to be that area
that the water doesn't freeze over,

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.380
so the trumpeters spend their
winters there instead of migrating.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.620
And if you don't do something,
trumpeters can go extinct.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.380
Well, the 10th mountain division
facility costs like $24 million.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.280
It was training our
soldiers to go fight in Italy

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.760
and Germany and in Europe.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.110
And FDR writes a moving
letter to his Secretary

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.670
of Defense Henry K. Stimson.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.820
Dear Henry, I've now
found out about the flop

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.100
between the US army
and the trumpeters.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.780
I've looked into it
and the verdict is in.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.370
I side with the trumpeters.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.010
The 10th mountain division
must re-nest.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.590
Sincerely, Franklin D. Roosevelt.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.820
Why at the time of Pearl
Harbor would he do that?

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.780
Well, who here doesn't want to
save trumpeter swans species, OK,

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.350
but this is the big crucible,

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.840 position:56%
because he is telling the war
department, he need to write letters

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.840 position:56%
like that to agriculture department
and to every division in government,

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.800
our public lands are
our inheritance.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.610
We are not going to destroy
our national forests and parks

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:47.480
and monuments and state parks
by going in for win the war.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.490
These are what we're fighting for.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.220 position:56%
Our public land system is what
America is about, it's our heritage,

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.060
hence why I call my
book Rightful Heritage,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.710
that's what he would call all
of these recreation places

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.360
and special places we have.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.560
He did something similar to save
the whooping crane from extinction

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.890
by signing an executive order
creating Aransas National Wildlife

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:19.960
Refuge in Texas, a national
park, guys, June 6, 1944, D-Day.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.040
Do you realize on D-Day here in
Washington, Franklin Roosevelt,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.080
when all the news was coming,
wouldn't cancel a meeting

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.150
about Big Bend National Park?

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:34.030 position:56%
And he creates-- takes the land deed
for it on D-Day with Amon Carter

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.330
and people from Fort Worth.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.170
Pictures on D-Day with maps that
he's picking out where the roads

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.880
and how one could bring
visitors to Big Bend.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.970
He goes to Glacier National Park.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:50.150 position:56%
He makes them set up radio shop
there so he could stand with the CCC

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.410
and say, there is nothing more
American than our national parks.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:24:01.530
In 1937, he traveled and
created Cape Hatteras,

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.970
our nation's first
national seashore,

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.110
creating a whole new designation.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.020
John F. Kennedy was
very keen on that.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.410
That's why Kennedy saved
Cape Cod National Seashore,

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:16.030
South Padre Island in Texas,
Point Reyes in California.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.500
But little known is Roosevelt
would go all over on his yachts

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:25.470
and on navy ships, and he
disappeared on the eve really

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.750
of World War II in the
late 1930s to go disappear

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.620
into the Galapagos Islands.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.140
FDR went for weeks doing
floral and fauna collections

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.690
for the Smithsonian Institute,
looking for new species

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:46.730
of burrowing shrimp and fish,
because this love of biology

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.280
and conservation is in the
Roosevelt's bloodstream.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.490
I will end by telling you
two quick things, he's--

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:59.380
whenever Franklin Roosevelt
put on a form occupation,

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.730
he would write tree farmer.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.070
He ran tree plantations at Warm
Springs, Georgia and on the Hudson.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.160
If you go to his home, you will
see the forest, he planted it all.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.670
That was-- When he would
bring Churchill to Hyde Park,

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.400
he was showing off the
forest that he planted

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.430
and how he was a scientific
forester.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.290
It meant everything to him.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.170
He had learned inside out
about soil conservation.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.130
FDR thought that deforestation,

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.800
the killing of trees,
meant utter poverty.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.620
So much so that the time of
Tehran Conference, he went over,

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.840
and of course was in the
Middle East, and he comes home

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.730
and writes a personal letter to
the shah of Iran and to the king

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.610
of Saudi Arabia saying, well, I've
been to your part of the world now,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.920
and I've got to tell you,
you've got a forestry problem.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.130 position:56%
And I'm personally willing to loan
my time pro bono to help you fix it.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.260
Do not feel bad, we have this
problem out of-- we have, you know,

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:04.170
the Dust Bowl, we know some of
that by figuring out ways to help.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:09.840
Do you realize that in 1945, right
before his death, April 12, '45,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.600
Franklin D. Roosevelt was
working with Gifford Pinchot,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.000
the chief forester for Theodore
Roosevelt who's now in his 80s,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.850
had a couple of heart attacks,
was going to be dead soon

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:27.220
and they conspired together to make
the founding of the United Nations,

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.190
a key principle was
going to be conservation

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.420
as a basis of permanent peace.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:37.090
And FDR was moving to have
sharing of natural resources,

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.470
to have global pollution laws,

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.950
to have ways that we will
have international forestry

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.360
and wildlife protection laws.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.250
Everybody at war and state
department went running,

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.550
they would ignore him.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:53.410 position:56%
And one of the few times I ever saw
FDR was angry when he wrote a letter

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.110 position:56%
and was telling the state
department, I am serious about this,

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.270
conservation is going to
be a big part of the UN,

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:04.070
we're going to do global
conservation right off the bat.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.250
When he died, a lot of this
energy of conservation died

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.800
with the Truman administration,
the Truman crowd had no interest.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.270
But in the end, our heritage in
the United States of national parks

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.050
like the Smokies, the Everglades,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:24.320
great roads like the Blue
Ridge Parkway and Natchez Trace

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.410
and magical parks like
Mammoth Cave in Kentucky,

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:32.080
Isle Royale in Michigan,
I can go on and on and on.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.650
We owe it to Franklin D.
Roosevelt for their time of crisis

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:40.850
in the Great Depression of World
War I reminded us that stewardship

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.000
of our national resources was one

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.540
of if not the most important
thing that we can do.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.940
Great countries take
care of their landscapes.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.100
And Franklin Roosevelt in my
mind along with TR was one

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.760
of the two great conservation
presidents.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.560
Thank you.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:06.500
[ Applause ]

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.300
Thank you.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.950
[ Applause ]

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.480
&gt;&gt; Doug, I have a comment
before I ask my question.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.610 position:56%
We just came back from Hyde Park
and you know that across the Hudson,

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:25.180
there is this walking bridge
called the FDR Bridge.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.050
And I thought it was
because, you know,

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.870
he and Eleanor came from that area.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:35.200
But now you're saying maybe
it was in tribute to the fact

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.840
that this is only bridge you can--
people can walk, no cars and--

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.140
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: Yes.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.000
Yes, that's part of
why they've done that.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.320 position:56%
But across the river from Hyde Park,
his home, John Burroughs, this--

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.430 position:56%
he's like John Muir, John Burroughs,
he's-- if-- we're a book crowd here.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.740
Look up and read about John
Burroughs, he's very undersung.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.550
He lived directly across
the street on the Hudson.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.200
Then FDR would always have to go
on the other side of the Hudson.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.080
And that bridge is a way to
kind of connect that region.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.380
&gt;&gt; Right. All right.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.790
Now, let me ask you
a technical question.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.820
Going back to the relationship
between Teddy and Franklin, OK,

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.360
you know when Teddy was
police chief whatever,

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.800
he would walk in the streets
with newspaper people.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:25.190
And he knew to use the newspapers
as a vehicle to communicate.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:29.760
And you know many years later,
this guy, Franklin Roosevelt,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.490
enhanced that to the radio.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:36.570
So that was a big, big change.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:37.870
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: Yeah.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.220
Well, you're absolutely right.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:43.250
TR was a genius at
manipulating cartoonist.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.740
I mean, the teddy bear
toy grew out of his--

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.540 position:56%
going on a bear hunt and he wouldn't
shoot the bear in Mississippi

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.020
and it became a symbol
for Fair Chase hunting

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.710
in conservation of
Theodore Roosevelt.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.220
FDR used radio so effectively
to bring that voice

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.340
because he was incapacitated,
unable to walk.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.870
But what's not known about Franklin
is he trained his upper body,

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.840
it was amazingly strong.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.840
And he would go fishing all over.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.710
He became a big buff
on marine conservation.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.200
So, he would pull in Silver
Kings, giant tarpon and go

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.950
on these marine expeditions
because that was a way for him

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.780
to get outdoor recreation.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.920
And it was also a way not to
have the press come with him

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.010
because his health was
deeply precarious at times.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.630 position:56%
So if he could get out at sea and go
to the Dry Tortugas which he saved

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.760
in Florida, FDR, and spend time
there, whenever he see a place

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.960
that he liked, he'd sign in an
executive order and save it.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.030
It's really quite remarkable.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.330
Thank you.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Now let me
get to the point.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.920
The-- Today with the press, you
see Trump, you see others saying,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.440
as a president, I would
do this, I will do this,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.410
a key point that when
Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.010
came in the office, he used the
term, let's try it, try it, try it.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.220
Did he inherit that from Teddy?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.780
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: I'll tell you,
I never quote Stalin in public,

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.400
but I'm going to do it,
for-- just for you guys.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.460
Stalin used to say after
negotiating with Churchill and FDR,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.760
Churchill will work with you
and then try to sneak his hand

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.880
in your pocket to steal a coin.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.250
FDR smiles and greets you,
jams both hands in and pulls

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.900
out everything all at once.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.150
It's very true, FDR
love-- so all of these.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:31.190
You know, people-- when he try to
pack the Supreme Court for example,

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.360
people were all saying, oh, he-- in
1937, people were turning in FDR,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.960
he was signing executive orders
left and right saving wild places

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.250
because nobody knew
what was going on.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.030
Then he got revenge on that
by picking William O. Douglas,

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:49.550
the most environmental
conservation-driven person

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.890
of the '60s and '70s who saved
the C&amp;O Canal incidentally here.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.130
And it's-- And he put
him to the Supreme Court.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.640
Also, to tell you, the mall
here that we're honoring

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.390
at the National Book
Festival, that's FDR.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.940
Months after, he becomes president,
he grabs all of the monuments,

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.700
the mall, the White House and
puts it in to interior department.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.130
They used to be run by
other war department.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.720
Agriculture, he made it.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.180
He built today's interior
department,

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.050 position:56%
Franklin Roosevelt and Harold Ickes.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.460
And now, our National Park
Service keeps growing,

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.170
and that's what FDR wanted,
like history to be part of it,

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.120
not just Yellowstone's
and Yosemite's.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.210
So Barack Obama has just
signed an executive order

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:38.250
to do stonewall for LGBT history.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:44.060 position:56%
He just did-- Obama did Cesar Chavez
in California for Latino history.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.320
He just did Harriet Tubman in
Maryland for Underground Railroad.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.100
He's opening up the narrative as
they're saying of American history.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.490
Obama has been great at that.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:59.350
FDR is the one who started that
ability to save labor strike places

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.940
or something that wasn't-- you
know, might be controversial

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.840
and save those as part
of our national heritage.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.230
Thank you.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.740
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: Yes, sir.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.870
&gt;&gt; I've had a chance
to read both your books

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.960
on Theodore Roosevelt
and Franklin Roosevelt.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.210
Thank you, they are
absolute magnificent.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.740
In reading them and in
listening to you today, you know,

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.650
I observed that we've got one
great Republican president

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.200
and one great Democratic president.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.400
And for a long period
of time, conservation

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.030
and the environmental movement
wasn't really a partisan issue.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.600
Now, it's a very deeply
partisan issue.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.920
What happened?

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.490
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley:
Amazing question.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:49.470
And it used to be Republican Party
got into conservation all the time.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:53.200
Many of the heroes, including
the Rockefeller family who--

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.280
incidentally who did Laurance
Rockefeller and John D. Jr. and the

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.130
like who did so much for it.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:02.030
Ronald Reagan created
over 50 wilderness areas,

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.600
that's roadless areas of pristine
wilderness, Reagan did that.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.870
Today, you have a Republican Party
that is running on oil, gas, oil,

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.110
gas, drill baby drill,
open, open, open.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.640
And they-- There's a backlash
against the federal government,

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.120
particularly in the
Western Alaska that--

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.810
so it puts things at loggerheads.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:28.020
So if you're a Republican
in the Senate today,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.950
being a conservationist
is very, very hard.

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:32.640
The turning point in my mind was

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.620
when the word conservation
was replaced by environmental.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.530 position:56%
George McGovern told before he died,

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:41.240
I wish we would have just kept
the word conservation because I--

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.490
it sounds like conservative.

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:46.610
And I could push things
through in the Senate.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.270 position:56%
But once that word environment came,

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:53.570
it was tied up to the '60s cultural
wars of hippies and tree-huggers

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.250
and marijuana and, you
know, and it became seen

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.790
as like a left issue
in-- out of the '60s.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.310
And we haven't fully
recovered with that.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:07.130 position:56%
However, there are Republican
congressmen like Congressman Simpson

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:12.080
from Idaho who recently just
saved Boulder-White Clouds

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.650
as a wilderness area.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:18.370
And there are a few very-- Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee has gotten

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.700
and do the conservation
story quite a bit.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.290
But unfortunately, like so much in
our culture, it's become partisan.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.850
And I'm hoping that eventually,
it'll come back because if I go

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.800
to a group of conservatives,
Republicans somewhere and talk

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.910
about saving the local
lake or river,

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:40.130
they love me because I'm praising
local sites and we want it clean,

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:41.870
we want our kids to fish and hunt.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:46.520
We-- But if I started dropping
the e-bomb environmental,

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.670
you'll lose half your
audience right now.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.370
So, we've got to kind
of-- a lot of it might be

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:55.270
with the way we repackage
how we speak about it.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:59.010
So, I'm-- But I-- It's
a frustration.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.290
Barry Goldwater was a pretty
good conservationist actually.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:07.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mr. Brinkley, I've read your book
on Teddy Roosevelt, looking forward

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.410
to read the book on FDR, huge fan.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:10.710
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: Thank you.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.100
&gt;&gt; Really appreciated
your lecture today.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.770
I wanted to ask a question or
maybe get your thoughts on an issue

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.110
that is related to
the last question.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.060
In the course of your
lecture and in your books,

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.580 position:56%
you described the way the presidents
used their authority to create

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.700
and conserve these natural areas.

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.900
But it seems that overwhelmingly,
they relied upon the power

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:35.370
of executive orders or unilateral
executive branch authority

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.690
and particularly relying, I think,
it was on the Antiquities Act

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:42.160
which authorizes the president
to apply that authority

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.960
without consulting or getting
the approval of Congress.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.880
And it's my amateur observation
that over the decades,

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:54.320
the fact that these
conservation efforts took place

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.790
through presidential authority

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.460
and many instances bypassing
local congressional delegations

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.070
without seeking the
support of Congress,

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.940
without needing the support of
Congress, created a situation

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.100
that has presented
challenges in the modern era.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.540 position:56%
And I recognized that the presidents
needed to do what they needed to do.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.860
And I certainly approve
of what they did.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.580
I love the result.

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.590
But we have, in your
view, created something

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.010
of a federalist problem
in terms of--

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: Well, there is.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.210
&gt;&gt; -- this backlash of this
assertion of federal authority.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.510
&gt;&gt; Douglas Brinkley: OK.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.540
I went to the national monuments
to keep in on FDR a little.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.250
FDR, for example, in the
middle of World War II was--

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.320
gifted Jackson Hole,
Wyoming and wrote--

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.640
The Rockefellers bought
all these land up.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.940
Now, they're giving it to him.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.050 position:56%
FDR signs an executive order saying,
we're going to create the Grand--

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.770
save the Grand Teton, Jackson Hole.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.860
You should read what
happened to FDR.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.430
You're a Hitler, you're land
grabbing, the federal government--

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:54.740
There's nobody today that doesn't
want Jackson Hole protected

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.040
like FDR did.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:02.310
They were in California, in
Joshua Tree, that's FDR's.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.100
A woman named Minerva Hamilton
Hoyt was trying to get it

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.600
as a park through--
Congress said it's desert.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.270
Deserts are wasteland,
nobody wants it.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.820
And she was a botanist and saying,
no, these Joshua Trees are amazing.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:19.550
Meanwhile, the kids that go
out to Burning Man used to go

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:23.090
out on the desert and pour
gasoline and burn the Joshuas

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:25.690
because they shoot up
like a torch to the night.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.910
And they would look for the
biggest and they burn them all.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.480
So, she eventually gets to
FDR and says, can you save it?

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.230
And he looks at her plan and
says, [inaudible] a million acres.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.820
And she said, well, the
railroads have interest there

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.190
and the local miners.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.980
He said, lawyers will
figure it out later.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.280
We're going to do it.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.400
She was stunned, she got
what she wanted from him.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.870
In Kings Canyon, another national
park of FDR's in California,

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:56.350
it took-- a young unknown
photographer named Ansel Adams took

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:57.650
these photos.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.590
And Eleanor Roosevelt said,
if you want my husband

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.580 position:56%
to save something, bring the photos.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.160
He's a sucker for,
well, Adams' photos.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:11.750
So, he ended up seeing these
and pushed to save Kings Canyon.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:15.520
But FDR didn't like that it was
going to be roadless, no roads,

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.190
and he said, I'm never going to
be able to go see it, that area.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:23.260
Because if there are no roads and
visitor lookouts, I won't be able

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:29.410
to go because of my thing, but he
did it anyway because you just have

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.600
to have a strong president
to do it or else--

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.850
or, you know, I've been
for example to Haiti.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.000
You want to fly over Hispaniola,
look at Dominican Republic

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.320
with forest and Haiti deforested.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.960
I need you all to believe that
in the 1930s and early '40s,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:52.470
our country was in genuinely awful
shape, in swamps, arctic tundra,

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:56.030
deserts were not considered
ecosystems worth saving.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.480
To now, these places are
the big economic engines.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.720
Joshua Tree doesn't know
what to do with visitors.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.410
It's so overcrowded.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:09.520
So, the Antiquities Act
gives presidents a mechanism.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.390
And George W. Bush
signed a giant one

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:14.790 position:56%
out in the Hawaii for a marine area.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.520
Calvin Coolidge used to
sign them all the time.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.900
I'm just suggesting, it's--
that has become bipartisan,

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.440
monuments, presidents will do them.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.200
But Obama just did the Maine
woods, Katahdi, a couple weeks ago,

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.670
and they're angry in Maine about
it, even though the land was gifted

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:35.810
by Roxanne Quimby who founded
Burt's Bees, the women's product.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.410
She became the biggest
land owner in Maine, said,

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.640
I'll not only give you the land to
the federal government as a park,

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.410
but I'll also endow
it with $20 million.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.190
And the conservatives
in Maine don't want it.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:53.170
They see it as federal government
intrusion into their lives.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.170
So, the good news here, and
I'll-- I think I better end,

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:00.270
the national parks on
their centennial right now

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.080
are spectacular.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.630
We need to love them
more, visit them.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.650
They really are this great
gift and we owe both Theodore

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:13.550
and Franklin Roosevelt a huge bit
of credit for being visionaries,

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.980
of making our country
something special.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.740
Without it, we would be strip
malls and superhighways.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.880 position:56%
But by saving all these wild places,
it's kept the essential spirit

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.710
of America in my mind alive.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.290
Thank you.
