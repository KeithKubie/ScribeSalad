00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
 Push zoom lens (Dolly Zoom) 

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.360
 Is the most often confusing 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.580
 And one of the exaggerated shooting techniques 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.620
 In a few popular movies in the history of film 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.820
 There have been some tips 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.280
 It is famous for its peculiar visual effects. 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.380
 But the shooting method of this lens 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.920
 Also teach us a lot of ideas about filmmaking. 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 It shows different types of lenses and how to use them 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.760
 It strengthens the emotions in the scene 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.700
 And it is also used in some subtleties that you might not notice. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.800
 Let us take a look 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.120
 The zoom zoom lens is sometimes treated as 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.320
 An effect that can express the vertical direction 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.980
 This lens first appeared in Hitchcock's 1958 movie "Ecstasy" 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.900
 You need a smooth track and a steady zoom to get it done 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.400
 Therefore, the use of this lens has not developed rapidly. 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.940
 This is actually a kind of zooming in or out through the lens zoom. 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.760
 And the track is pushed closer or farther away 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 Optical illusion 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.240
 The result will result in a change in the foreground position 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.640
 But the background is squeezed or stretched depending on the direction in which the camera moves. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340
 This lens actually teaches us an important principle about filming. 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.640
 If you want to see the difference between the wide-angle lens and the telescope head 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 The simplest example is to observe the zoom zoom lens. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020
 To compare how it starts and how to end it 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.800
 The zoom zoom lens can be like a telescope head 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.720
 Start from where the camera is far enough and the focal length is large enough 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.200
 Because the lens is shot in a small part 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.220
 Resulting in a smaller field of view that the background can accommodate 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.300
 But when you change the focus by zooming in and zooming in on the camera 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 You will find that the foreground has not changed but the background can accommodate a wider range of views. 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.420
 The result will be the same as the subject 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.440
 But expanded the scope of the background to accommodate other things 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.980
 So when you change from the telescope head to the wide-angle lens 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.500
 Can accommodate a wider space through the changed focal length 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.280
 You usually use a telescope head to take close-ups. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.040
 In order to keep the audience focused on the prospects 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.220
 When you shoot with a telescope head 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.520
 Because less background can be captured 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.720
 Will cause the background to change quickly after the foreground 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.800
 This lens has taken a lot of cool perspectives. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.820
 People will look good under the telescope 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.160
 Because their faces are not deformed by wide-angle lenses. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.220
 Wide-angle lenses are more often used in shooting backgrounds 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.280
 So it's more suitable for outdoor shooting when you want to capture the scenery. 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.760
 So using either lens is a trade-off 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.460
 Push track scene can be used as a lens 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 Transition screen to another lens 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.760
 And this also has a different emotional response to the audience. 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.020
 The zoom zoom lens in "Ecstasy" brings a sense of height 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.240
 This increase in height sense 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.480
 Perfectly shows how the telescope head shows a narrower perspective in the background 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.520
 So the background image we shot is more or less 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.140
 The result is an optical illusion that makes people feel dizzy 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.660
 This lens will be disturbing 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.800
 Even let some people feel like vomiting 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.540
 Because this is a sensory experience that is impossible to perceive through physical means. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.160
 Unless it is using some different types of lens transformations 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 The dining scene of "The Good Guys" is the most confusing part 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.940
 Quickly transform through the landscape around them in an impossible way 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.900
 Because Henry’s world is breaking down 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.180
 And his stubborn temper exacerbates this impossible lens movement. 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 He was deeply puzzled by the results of this meal. 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.120
 This zoom makes us really close to Henry 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.440
 Just as he was caught is inevitable 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.600
 As I said before, the wide-angle lens will make people look a bit strange. 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.020
 The most famous zoom zoom lens in Jaws 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.660
 Is to quickly switch to wide-angle lens 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.300
 Make his face look a bit elongated and unnatural 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.020
 And let the rest of the store look strange 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.560
 Three examples of "Ecstasy", "Great White Shark" and "Four Seas Good Guys" 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.640
 They are all typical examples when it comes to pushing zoom lenses. 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.420
 But the problem is when teaching this shot 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 But because people feel like they are trying to be classics 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.100
 Make the display of this lens only in the example 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.580
 But in fact, it is more often able to show your talents. 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.400
 This is the visual effect of the sensory experience. 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.960
 Often used in the state of mind after revealing supernatural phenomena or taking drugs 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.520
 I especially enjoy the effect of using the zoom zoom lens in The Lord of the Rings. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.880
 Because of the caves that are gradually expanding in the woods 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.480
 It looks like the door to the fourth wall is being opened to meet the enemy. 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.360
 This lens is also often used in the climax of making movies. 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.560
 In the unlikely event that your hero fails, you can add a little bit of beauty. 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.600
 This lens is also useful in animations. 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.880
 Brad Bod used this technique extensively in his films. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.320
 The food critic’s memory is to enhance the effect with a zoom zoom lens. 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.200
 Thus simulating the process of transferring from one world to another 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.840
 Especially in computer animation 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.680
 There is often an exclusive opportunity to make some interesting attempts on photos. 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.160
 Because the computer animation completely controls the position of the target 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.500
 Like the relationship between the mouse Remy and the chef Gust. 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.080
 The zoom zoom lens is no longer a lost viewer 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.600
 Instead, explain their germinated emotional relationship 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.480
 As close to each other as you can see 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.720
 There is also a similar zoom zoom lens in Superman Special Forces. 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.660
 Just as the lady is closer to her ambition 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.580
 These two examples did not cause damage to the picture. 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.360
 But it also attracted us to notice the sign squeeze effect of this lens. 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.640
 For film creators 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.720
 The zoom zoom lens is indeed a novel shooting lens 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.740
 But remember that this is more important than the rough shooting trick. 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.380
 Hitchcock uses this lens to express depth 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.940
 Martin Scorsese uses this lens to express stubbornness 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.940
 Bradbold uses this lens to express visual clues 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.460
 So always pay attention to the zoom zoom lens 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.580
 thanks for watching
