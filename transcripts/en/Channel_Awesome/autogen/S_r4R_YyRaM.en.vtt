and<00:05:27.800><c> my</c><00:05:28.310><c> concern</c><00:05:28.820><c> is</c><00:05:28.850><c> then</c><00:05:29.450><c> that</c><00:05:29.660><c> they</c><00:05:29.810><c> have</c>

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
and my concern is then that they have
 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.290 align:start position:0%
and my concern is then that they have
someone<00:05:30.500><c> who</c><00:05:30.770><c> is</c><00:05:30.800><c> specifically</c><00:05:31.340><c> comedic</c><00:05:31.880><c> so</c>

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 align:start position:0%
someone who is specifically comedic so
 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.570 align:start position:0%
someone who is specifically comedic so
then<00:05:32.480><c> they</c><00:05:32.570><c> can</c><00:05:32.780><c> turn</c><00:05:33.020><c> Wonder</c><00:05:33.500><c> Woman</c><00:05:33.770><c> to</c><00:05:34.010><c> into</c>

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 align:start position:0%
then they can turn Wonder Woman to into
 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.340 align:start position:0%
then they can turn Wonder Woman to into
more<00:05:34.760><c> of</c><00:05:34.790><c> like</c><00:05:35.030><c> a</c><00:05:35.060><c> guardians</c><00:05:35.600><c> of</c><00:05:35.720><c> the</c><00:05:35.810><c> galaxy</c>
