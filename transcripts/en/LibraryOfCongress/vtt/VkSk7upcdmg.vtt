00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.190
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.190
On behalf of all my colleagues and
in particular Dr. Mary Jane Dy,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.650
chief of the African and
Middle East division,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.720
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everybody.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.170
I'm Joan Weeks, head of the Near
East Section, today's sponsor

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.900
of the program, The Double Life of
the First Syrian Immigrant Family.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.000
This sounds very intriguing and our
speaker today is Dr. Linda Jacobs.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.370
Before I start today's
program however

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.650 position:56%
and Muhannad introduces our speaker,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.080
I'd like to give you a brief
overview of our division

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.840
and its resources in the
hopes that you'll come back

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.760
and use our collections and this
reading room for your research.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.230
This is a custodial division
comprised of three sections

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.310 position:56%
that build and serve the collections

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.710
to researchers from
around the world.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.770
We cover 75 countries and
over two dozen languages.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.050
The Africa section includes all
of Sub-Sahara Africa, the Judaic

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.010
or Hebraic sections
covers Judaica worldwide

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.350 position:56%

China, Russia and the Balkans

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.490
and the peoples of the Caucasus.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.090
After today's program I'd
like to invite you to fill

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.990
in the little public events survey
that we've left in your chairs.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.330
It helps us plan programs
for the future.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.960 position:56%
In addition, I'd like to promote and
talk about our new four corners blog

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.900
that has some wonderful specials -
blog post by our specialists here

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.550
and also in the Hispanic,
European and Asian divisions

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.040
and the URL is at the top.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.140
So without further ado, though,
I'd like to call Dr. Muhannad Salhi

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.610
to the podium to introduce
our speaker for today.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.410
Thanks you.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.390
[ Clapping ]

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.940
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.930
Thank you all for joining us.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.040
Our speaker today, Linda Jacobs has
a Ph D in Near Eastern archaeology

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.820
and anthropology from
the University of Oregon.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.730
Her dissertation was on the second
millennium settlement patterns

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.030
of Iran.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.060
She has spent much of her
professional life working

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.650
in economic development
projects in the MENA,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.670 position:56%
Middle East and North Africa region.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.650
Jacobs has worked with the Near
East foundation for ten years

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.660 position:56%
and continues to serve on its board,
as well as serving on the board

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.970 position:56%
of the American University of
Beirut for three years and the board

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.410
of the Polytechnic, now
the Tandon school at NYU.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.560 position:56%
Today she will be speaking about her
second book "Strangers in the West."

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.310
And after the lecture there
will be a book signing event

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.180
for anyone who's interested
in purchasing the book.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.220
Just a word to the audience,
this event is being videotaped

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.440

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.760
and raise questions during the
formal question and answer period,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.700
but please be advised that your

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.250 position:56%
By participating in the question
and answer period you are consenting

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.760
to the library's possible
reproduction

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.690
and transmission of your remarks.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.510
Now, without further
ado Dr. Linda Jacobs.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.790
[ Clapping ]

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.530
&gt;&gt; Linda Jacobs: Thank you so much.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.120
Thank you to the division and
the library for having me.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.170
It's really marvelous,
really wonderful.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.720
As Muhannad said, I
have written a book

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.160
about the 19th century Syrian
colony in New York City,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.780
which is in the back there.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.150
And since that book was
published last fall I've been kind

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.210
of going off in many different
directions exploring some

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.450 position:56%
of the people that I didn't have a
chance to do justice to in the book.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:40.940
And the Arbeely family are one of
the most important of those groups.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.940
They are indeed the first
Syrian immigrant family

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.950
to come to the United States.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.120
They called themselves the
first Syrian immigrant family,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.470
but people always try to
say that they are maybe not,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.440
maybe there were other Syrians
before them, but indeed they were,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.930
in fact, the first Syrian family
to come to the United States.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.580 position:56%
And the story of the Joseph Arbeely
family tells us how they constructed

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.450
an Arab-American identity, in fact,
the first Arab-American identity

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.870
of course in the United States,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.740
since they were the
first Syrian family.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.600
They constructed a double
identity and that looked both east

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.390
and west [inaudible]
like and keeping both

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.870
of those identities separate, but
- and mesmerizing their audiences,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.070
both in life and on the stage.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.510
They were both Oriental and
American at the same time.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.400
I want to say.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.970
first before I begin, that these
photographs have never been seen

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.770
by anyone in the world before, so
you'll all have a special treat.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.490
The performance photographs are

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.590
from the National Anthropological
Archives

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.510
of the Smithsonian Institution
hidden deep away in the archives

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.140
and the family photographs are
from a collateral descendant

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.570
of the Arbeelys' who found me on
Facebook and who live in Texas now.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.860
Habeeb Arbeely and his
daughter Dania Arbeely.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:26.460
Okay. Yosef Aweth Hannah Alcolush
[sp] was born in the village

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:36.370 position:56%
of Erbil about five miles outside of
Damascus in 1828 and he was educated

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.350
at the Damascus Orthodox College
and became a teacher there,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.430
married in Damascus, had his
first three children in Damascus.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:52.420 position:56%
In 1860 he moved his family of three
children and his wife to Beirut.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.650
Some say it was because of the
sectarian violence that was going

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.060
on in Syria, in Greater
Syria at that time.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.230
Some say it was because he
saw opportunities in Beirut

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.880
that he had not had in Damascus.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.070
In any case he took his children
to Beirut in 1860, set up a school

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.690
for the exiles of Orthodox
Damascenes there,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.710
and was said to have collaborated
with Cornelius Van Dyck,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.090
one of the founders of the Syrian
Protestant College in Beirut

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.480
to translate the Bible into Arabic.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.810
So he had contact very early
on with American missionaries

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.110
and the Syrian Protestant College.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.320
His oldest son Abraham, who's on
the left standing up in the left

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.520
of the picture took a medical
degree at Syrian Protestant College

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.590
in 1872, and then went on to
get a second medical degree

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.950
in Constantinople.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:59.420
Later his third son, Felala,
also in the picture standing

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:06.640
up on the second from the
right, took a BA at SPC in 1872

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.280
and then a medical degree in 1876.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.420
In 1878 Yosef decided that his
family was coming to America.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.430
No one from Syria that he knew
or anyone knew had ever been

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.690
to America before,
no Syrian that is.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.680
But he must have become enamored
of the country or learned

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.610
about the opportunities or thought
he saw an opportunity in America.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.720
They set sail from
Beirut in July of 1878,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.500
stopped off at the Universal
Exposition in Paris on the way,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.880
and they became great
goers to fairs.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.300
They went to every fair that
they could possibly go to.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.890
They loved these world fairs.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.810 position:56%
World's Fairs the first one they
went to was in Paris and they landed

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.680
in New York on August 21st in 1878.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.710
This is a photograph of them in
Beirut just before they set sail.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.950
It's the only known photograph of
Mary, the wife, who's sitting next

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.520
to Yosef the father
obviously in the front.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.840
And you will notice that the two
young boys are holding books.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.730
This was a trope that was used
in the Middle East often to show

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.280 position:56%
that they were literate, and the
whole family of course was literate,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.940
even the young boys at that time.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:32.230
The back of the photograph has
Najeeb's handwriting on the back.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.710
The Smithsonian is not entirely
sure where this came from,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.560
but I think it was actually given
to, probably not the president

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.300 position:56%
of the United States himself, but
one of his staff members when Najeeb

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.640
and his father visited
the White House in 1881.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.530
But the picture was taken
earlier before they'd -

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.610
before they left Beirut.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.280
When the day they landed,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.040 position:56%
the Arbeelys' impressed the New
York newspaper reporters like crazy.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.490
They were literate.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.430
They were fluent in English,
at least some of them were.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.750
They clearly understood what they
were about and the newspapers wrote

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.770
about them as the first
Syrian immigrant family,

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.820
which is what the family
said about themselves.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.890
"We are the first and
we're here to pave the way

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.270
for other Syrians to come."

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.020
He came without a job, apparently.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.370
And so after a few days the
newspapers started to think

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.720
"Oh maybe he's - they're
going to all become a burden

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.380
on the city of New York."

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.960
Because they're indigent,
they have no money.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.480
A few days after that they decided
that they were secretly rich

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.200
and that they had a bank
account in New Jersey.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.320
How they could have set up
a bank account in New Jersey

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.490
when they had arrived three
days before is a little bit odd,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.600
but they thought he had a
bank account in New Jersey

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.440
and that he was pretending
to be poor in order

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.540
to get the American government

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.140
or the New York government
to help them.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.290
In fact, it shows to me
the kind of schizophrenia

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.220
of Americans toward Syrians,
which began that first week,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.360
because they didn't know
whether they were wonderful,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.760
ready to be assimilated
entrepreneurs

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.010
or whether they were
liars, cheats and beggars.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.320
And both the Arbeelys'
were subjected to both.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.280
In any case, he was offered a job
at the Presbyterian College in,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:39.570
wait for this, Maryville Tennessee,
which he accepted may have been

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.440
through his contacts in Beirut.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.890
They all got on the train
and went to Tennessee.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.970
They were a family of nine,
because they arrived in New York

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:55.250
with the six sons, the
parents, and a niece, Jimelee.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:12:00.080
And they arrived in Maryville,
Tennessee, nine of them

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.530
and the Maryville, Tennessee
had a population of 1100.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.950
So you can imagine
how they stood out,

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.750
particularly if they were dressed
as they were in the Beirut picture,

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.810
but by the time they got

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.300
to Maryville they were
already - they settled in.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.510 position:56%
The newspapers treated them as if
they were normal Maryville residents

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.750
and the two sons opened
their medical practices,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.880
Felala and Abraham.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.470
They were immediately
accepted as doctors

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.040
by the Tennessee population,
as just regular doctors.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:41.570
Clearly the Syrian Protestant
College diploma was all they needed

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.820 position:56%
to set up shop and Felala, in
particular who practice in Maryville

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.610
for quite a few years would be
mentioned along with other doctors

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.070
as if he were just one
of the Tennessee doctors.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.660
Nothing. They talked about
their comings and goings,

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.640
but only in the context of other
people's comings and goings.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.040
They went to Knoxville and spent
the night at such and such a hotel.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.790
Every once in a while they
would say something like

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.430
"They're an industrious family."

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.820
Or "Very sober."

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.440
Or "Very, very good workers."

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.180
And they would never say
that about a Tennesseean.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.480
It goes without saying.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.170
So of course they were
seen as different,

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.870
but in mainly a positive way.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:28.720
Joseph's wife, Mary, whom you
see in this picture sitting next

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.080
to him died in 1880,
only two years -

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.840
less than two years
after they arrived.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.780
She's buried in Maryville,
in the Maryville cemetery.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.280
And she's the only one of
the family, oddly enough,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.820
who has a stone erected to her.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.760 position:56%
Her children carved a stone for her.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.360
And soon after her death the family
started their peripatetic life.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.980
First, Yosef and his oldest son,
Abraham, went to Texas looking

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.950
for a place to establish a
Syrian colony, which they did all

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.490
of their lives and they
never found the place -

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.000
a place that suited them.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.460
Abraham hung up his medical
shingle in San Antonio, Texas.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.840
Yosef came back to Maryville.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.360
His three youngest sons went
to Maryville High School,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.080
which was part of the
College and then went

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.880
to a Quaker School 300
miles from home for college.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:33.600 position:56%
And Najeeb, the third youngest went
to law school at Marysville College.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.620
At the same time that
they were doing all

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.130
of this educational stuff
they started to travel

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.610
around first Eastern
Tennessee, then the east coast

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.400
and then the whole
country doing shows.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:54.160 position:56%
This is them again in Tennessee
taken right after the death of Mary.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.030 position:56%
This is what the empty chair is for.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.070
It's a memorial to her.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.170
And Jimelee, the niece
is on the left.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.850
And I just want to show you
this comparative picture,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.470
because the picture on the right
is the only picture that's ever

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:14.230
circulated of the family and it's
been reproduced in many things,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.740
including a [inaudible] book on
this - on Syrian immigration.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:25.070
And this sign says "I and my
family are enjoying freedom here."

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.270 position:56%
So it was clearly meant as a
photograph to be sent home to Syria.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.880
They wanted the Syrians to
follow them and they wanted

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.620
to be the founders of a colony.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:40.840
So they began to travel
around giving shows, lectures,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.370
and entertainments
about the Holy Land.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.350
Oh I - sorry this is just
the - to show that Najeeb -

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.060
the children were in
American schools.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.600
So they went - they began to go

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.750
around giving programs
on the Holy Land.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.040
First Yosef went with
one or two of his sons.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.830
They would give a lecture
about the Holy Land.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.690
And the fact that they
were called people

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.740
from the Holy Land made it
acceptable and probably uplifting

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.370
for people to come to this event.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:20.330
They charge 25 cents for adults,
15 cents for children under 12,

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.410
and according to many of the review

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.940
that were done afterwards
every place was packed.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.970
They performed and
you'll see that this one

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.270
in particular is interesting.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.060
I'm not sure if you can read it,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.360
because the resolution is not too
great, but it was clearly written

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.250
by the Arbeelys' themselves,
and this was a performance

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.270
in Wheeling, West Virginia in 1883.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.020
They didn't just lecture
though, and particularly

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.240
when the boys were involved and
by this time the boys were already

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.580
at least looking like men, even
though they were in their teens.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:03.910
They dressed up and they
performed as Muslim-whatevers.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:10.270
So this Najeeb Arbeely on the left
dressed like a Mohammedan Sheikh

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.350 position:56%
and I have it in quotes because this
is what's written in the caption

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.580
of the photograph at
the Smithsonian.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:21.520
On the right probably Najeeb
and Habeeb dressed as women

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.100
and you'll see with the
[inaudible] and the [inaudible].

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:32.000
And, you know, wearing those
shoes, smoking a nargile [sp]

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.660
or a, you know, and shisha.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.420
This is all in Washington
DC by the way,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.910
which is why the Smithsonian
has it, has these.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:51.590
Dancing. Playing instruments
with the nargile in the front.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:57.180
Sword play and again doing
her daily activities.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.940
This is Habeeb dressed up as
a woman and this is Najeeb

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.300
and his Sheikh outfit showing
that he's literate again,

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.830
writing in a book and with the, you
know, the rugs which they carried

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:15.730
around with them and the cushions.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.100
I'm going to just talk a little
bit now about the family,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.760
because the family had a
very poignant life history,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.330
all of them did.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.830
And it shows you, I think a
little bit about the stress

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:34.490
and sometimes tragedy
that might be inherent

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.390
in being the first of anything.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.140
And I'm going to talk to you about
them in the order and I'm sorry

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.760
to say this, but in the
order in which they died,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.450
because they all died
young and it was a -

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.590
it tells quite a bit
about the family.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:58.540
So this is the last one
doing the Muslim prayers.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.670
This is an article from
The New York Tribune,

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.150
where they use the photographs of
the Arbeelys' to talk about life

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.840 position:56%
in the east and the photographs were
obviously from their performances,

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.560
but they took sketches from
them and reproduce them

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.080
as if they came directly
from the east.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.890
So the first one I want to talk
about, because he was the first

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.950
to die is Felala, who got his
medical degree in 1876 at SPC

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.440
and hung up his shingle
and Maryville, Tennessee,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:38.760
married his cousin Jimelee, in
1885 and moved to Atlanta, Georgia.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:45.690
He was always looking for a
place for his health and I think

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.990
that he had tuberculosis.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.130
They never said what
was wrong with him,

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.110
but I think he had tuberculosis.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:55.420
So he and Jimelee moved to Atlanta
and every summer he would go

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.240
to a spa to try and become
the medical doctor there,

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.600
but to try to cure his health.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:09.980
They had two children in
Atlanta and in 1890 he went

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.610
to his brother's home in
Los Angeles and died there.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.260
His brother Abraham,
reported this that he would -

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.950
"Even when he was dying he was
interested from a standpoint

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:29.930
of reason in the very feelings
and alterations which were wrought

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.490
by the dissolution of his body."

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.990
He was buried under the
auspices of the Royal Arcanum,

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.220
which is a fraternal - secret
fraternal organization,

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:45.950
which paid death duties to widows
and families of people who died

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.920
who were members of the
Arcanum and he was buried

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.400 position:56%
in an unmarked grave in Los Angeles.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.310
And then when his father died a
few years later they were buried

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.730
together in the unmarked grave
in Los Angeles and then moved

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.470
to an unmarked grave in
Monrovia, California.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:09.130
And why they were unmarked you
can speculate as well as I can

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.670
about why they were unmarked.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.940
This is Yosef with
Abraham, the oldest son.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.970
Yosef is clearly on the right.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.790
Even after settling in Monrovia,
California, which he did in 1886,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.640
he traveled all over California
giving lectures on the Holy Land.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.520 position:56%
You see his name in Oakland
newspapers, San Francisco newspapers

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.310
in Riverside, in Redlands, in Los
Angeles County, in Redondo Beach.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:41.650
He was everywhere giving lectures
pretty much until the day he died.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.740
He died in 1890, as I said in
Monrovia, was buried with his son

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.130
and then they were
moved to Monrovia.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:56.460
His will is accent and he had
a rather - he was 66 years old.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.360
He had a rather substantial estate
including Romalian railroad bonds.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.760
Does anyone here know
where Romalia was?

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.550
I did not.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.080
It's what's - it's part of
what's now Southern Bulgaria,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.720
but it was part of
the Ottoman Empire.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.990
He had Romalian railroad bonds, a
stock in the New Jersey Railroad

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:23.620
and Canal Company, two vineyards
in Amioun, Lebanon an olive orchard

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:30.630
in Erbil, his natal village, a
library of 30 books valued at $20

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:34.710 position:56%
by the appraiser, a gold bracelet
which he left his only granddaughter

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.680
and $6,000 in cash was quite an
estate in 1890, quite an estate.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.920
But he was buried in an
unmarked grave, strangely.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.630
After Joseph's death all
of the surviving brothers,

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.990
this is him with his
three grandchildren

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.290
that existed at that time.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.740
And it was taken in
San Francisco, 1891.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.570
After Joseph's death all

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:07.860
of the surviving brothers
met briefly in New York.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.050
Three of them made
their will at that time.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.800
I don't know why.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:21.390
Two of them, Naceem and Habeeb, the
two youngest moved to Cairo, Egypt.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:27.320
Habeeb died six months
after they arrived.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.750 position:56%
He had an estate worth $2,000,
which was substantial and he left it

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:37.580
in sole, as sole legatee
his brother Naceem.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.020
He was mourned even in the obituary

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.620
on the right is a New
Orleans newspaper.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.540
He was mourned in the New
Orleans newspaper by a friend

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.590
who lived there, Baton Rouge,
but also in New Orleans.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:59.010
But he was - and he was buried in
the Orthodox cemetery in Cairo.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.070
Kaleel, who is the second
son who never went to SPC.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.370
We don't know.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.670
I don't think he ever
went to college anywhere.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.340
He may not have finished
secondary school.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:15.200
I think he was the only one of the
sons who was not fluent in English

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.250
and may have been illiterate.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.010
His will was written
by someone else.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:25.760
He set up briefly in Los Angeles
in the 1880s as a pharmacist.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.510 position:56%
We don't know if he had a
pharmaceutical degree from anywhere,

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.650
because there's no record
of it that I could find.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.190
And then he moved east to New York.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:40.180
He lived in a tenement in Brooklyn
by himself a few blocks away

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.490
from his brother but
not with his brother

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.100
and he died alone of tuberculosis.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.680
He had an estate worth
less than $800.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.430
He left it to his brothers,
leaving Najeeb,

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.570
his near neighbor out of the will.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.460
And you have to ask why?

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.170
And he did it deliberately.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.940
He wrote in his will, "I'm leaving
nothing to my brother Najeeb."

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.180
And we don't know why.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:11.040
There must have been
bad blood between them.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.370 position:56%
Naceem, who's the youngest, I'm
doing this a little bit out of order

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.960
because his death came
a little later,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.860
but I want to get him
out of the way.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.750
Who went to Cairo with his brother
set up a dental practice there.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:29.510
He had gotten the dental degree,
but hadn't practiced before.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.570 position:56%
He had been in the import, export
business in New York for many years.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:38.470 position:56%
He lived there, apparently without
marrying and without having a family

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.810
by himself until his death in 1919

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.060
about two weeks before
his eldest brother.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.700
He died in Cairo.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.080
He had an estate worth $900,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.540
which was completely
consumed by creditors.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.070
So he had nothing to
leave when he died.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.830
And on the right of
this picture is Najeeb.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:03.080 position:56%
It's the only picture except for
those group pictures we have of him.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.120
He must have been camera shy.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.520
We don't know why there
were no pictures of him.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.700
Najeeb had an incredible
beginning to his career.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.490
He was named Consul
General to Jerusalem

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.170
by President Cleveland in 1885.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:23.040
For a new immigrant and for
someone who was only 25 years old,

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.670
he had just turned
25 when he was named.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.470
It was quite incredible.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:34.050 position:56%
And we don't know how Cleveland knew
of him, found him, recognized him.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:39.180
We have no idea, unless he saw him
in a performance in Washington DC

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.700
at some point and Najeeb was in
the White House a couple of times,

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.980
but whether he ever met
the president I don't know.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.370
So he went to Jerusalem.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.830
He bought his uniform
and he went to Jerusalem.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.430
But he was - they were - the
Ottoman Government refused

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:59.250
to accept his credentials and
the reason they refused was

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.940
because the Ottoman government
considered every Ottoman citizen an

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.640
Ottoman citizen.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.460
And you could not, not
be an Ottoman citizen.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.610
And so how could an Ottoman
citizen represent the United States

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.660
and the consulate in Jerusalem.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.660
So he was sent home after
seven months, but always went

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.010
by the honorific X Consul General.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.310
[ Laughs ]

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.610
&gt;&gt; Always.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:24.910
They always called him that.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:27.990
He called himself that and
people called him that.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:36.770
After his return in 1886 he and his
brother Naceem were in the import,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.330
export business and in 1892 he

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:46.410
and his older brother Abraham
did the most groundbreaking thing

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.670
in the world, they founded the
first Arabic language newspaper

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:51.180
in the United States.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.930
And as far as I know, maybe
someone from the Library

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.910
of Congress can tell
me that I'm wrong.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:01.650
This is the only extant issue
of the newspaper that exists.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:09.730
There are four years on microfilm
Library of Congress has it.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.020
[inaudible] University in Beirut
has a copy of the four years

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.630
on microfilm, but this is
the only actual paper copy

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.930
that exists as far as I know.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:25.430
The microfilm came from the
Universe of Kansas Public Library

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.980
and they got rid of all of
their original newspapers many,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.280
many years ago.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.520
So and this came from the
Arbeely family in Texas.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.510
It's incredible to have it.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.620
It was published in Arabic with
one page of English for one year.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.590
I find this hysterical because who
- what English speaker would want

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.340
to read about the little
Syrian colony.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.780
I can't imagine who their audience,

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.060
who they thought their audience
would be, but if you read all

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.590
of the English language
part for the year

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.680
that it was published they
were preaching to the Americans

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.500
about what great people they were

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.760
and about what peace
loving people they were.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.060
But clearly.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.570
no American was reading this.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:09.140
So after a year it
became exclusively Arabic.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:15.040
They set up shop at 45 Pearl
Street in Lower Manhattan about six

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.810
or eight blocks from
the Syrian colony.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.760
They had - the two brothers
lived there, when Abraham was

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.470 position:56%
in town Najeeb, who lived in New
York in the loft at 45 Pearl Street,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.090
the third brother Naceem,
when he was in town.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:36.200
They had three employees, the
compositor and two Arabic editors.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.340
And all six of them lived in this
three room loft in Pearl Street.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.640
They all slept there.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.240
There was a little kitchen that
they cooked for each other and then

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.460
in the daytime they covered all
the beds with oriental carpets.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.400
They hung daggers on the wall.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.400
They had a parrot because they
thought that was very Oriental

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.340
to have a parrot and lots of palm
tree plants and that kind of thing.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.750
And so when people would come to
see the office they would espouse,

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.400
talk about how Oriental
the place was

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.070
and how they were living
this fantasy Oriental life

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.010
when in fact they knew exactly,

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.790
the Arbeelys' knew exactly
what they were doing.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:22.560
The paper had a dual audience,
at least a dual Arabic audience.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:27.380 position:56%
The Syrians in the Diaspora, because
it was founded in 1892 by that time,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.780
there were probably 900 Syrians in
New York and there were Syrians all

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.800
over the United States
in almost every state

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.830
and territory by that time.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.370
They have - so the Syrian
Diaspora was their audience,

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.500
but also Syrians at home.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.410
And there was a story and
I don't know if it was true

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.230
and I'm sure Najeeb told the
story to the American newspapers

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:57.540
that the Sultan himself received a
copy of the newspaper on parchment

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.070
with gold, with gilt
ornaments on it.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.320 position:56%
We don't know if that's true or not.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.510
They claimed a circulation
of 50,000,

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.010
which was an exaggeration
by about 49,000 I think.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.310
[ Laughs ]

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:17.540
But they had readers, they did have
readers all over the United States

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.940
and they had readers and agents in
South America, in the Middle East

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.920
and many cities in the Middle
East and even in Europe as well.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.880
So it was read by the
Syrian Diaspora

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.860
in many places and Syrians at home.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:36.460
And it was - it kind of
embodied the dilemma that Syrians

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.090
in the Diaspora were feeling.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:43.040
On the one hand it was
very assimilationist.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.380
They talked about how
to become successful

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.670
as an American businessman.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:54.200
They talked about how to adjust
to American ways of doing things.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.280
They advocated for a school
for their children to go

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.570
to that was part of the New
York Public School system rather

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.200
than having to set
up their own schools.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.410
At the same time they
cautioned people

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:12.440
and at the same time they
cautioned Syrians to act well

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:18.290
so that the Americans had nothing
to criticize the Syrian colony for.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:22.020
But at the same token
they complained like crazy

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.430
about the bad morals of Americans,

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:29.240
about how they didn't want their
women's honor sullied by the way

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.150
that women acted in
the United States,

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.030
that American business men
were so tricky and dishonest

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.720
and they didn't want to
ever become like that.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:45.130
So Najeeb and Abraham would write
editorials giving advice to people

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:48.710
in the United States saying
"Your honor is worth everything

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.930
and you must maintain your honor."

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:55.690
And "The almighty dollar is not
what you should be going after."

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.770
Najeeb did many other things
besides run the newspaper.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.990
He was an interpreter
at Ellis Island,

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.150
a full time interpreter
at Ellis Island.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:07.540
He made a $1,000 year doing
that, which was a good salary.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.850
He also continued to buy
and sell Syrian goods.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.850
He took out concessions at
every single World's Fair

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:19.200
and then would rent out
booths to other Syrians.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.230
He continued to perform.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:27.590
There's a marvelous article
in 1894 that he wrote himself

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:31.690
where he assembled a troop
of 100 Syrians to perform

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.160
for the Shriners in Madison Square.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.620
You know who the Shriners
are, right?

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.810
Those guys who wear those fezzes.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.610
And here's what Najeeb said.

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:44.510
He wrote that "Red
fezzes were as perplexing

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.540
to the Orientals on the platform."

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.430
That is the Syrians, "As the
costumes of these were interesting

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.460 position:56%
and novel to those whom they faced."

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.390
And you can imagine the Syrian
troop looking at these 15,000 men

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.700
with their fezzes applauding
them and they performed

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.040
as howling Dervishes, the Syrians,
you can imagine howling Dervishes.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.790
Yeah, it's quite marvelous.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.550
And Najeeb was ubiquitous.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.790
He was always giving interviews.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.960
He was friends with the
editors of The Herald Tribune.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.060
He was friends with the
New York World editors

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.610
and he was always being interviewed
anytime anyone had a question

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.700
about the New York Syrian
colony he was the one they asked

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.000
for an opinion.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.240
He was ready to opine about
anything, but that picture

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.060
that I show you is the only one.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.880
That was his memorial card.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.450
It's the only one that
I've ever seen of him.

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:41.510
He suffered a stroke in 1900.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:47.370 position:56%
He had to give up both the newspaper
and his job at Ellis Island.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:51.180
And he decided to go back
to his original career,

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.470
which was being a lawyer, which
he had studied in Maryville.

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:58.460
And so he passed the New York
bar with no problem whatsoever.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.920
And on his way to the office,
they say the first day on his way

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.840
to the office he suffered a second
stroke and he died in Manhattan.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.900
He was 43 years old.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.460
The newspaper already under new
management folded a few years

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.370
after that out.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.890
He died without a will
and his widow claimed

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:24.290
that his estate was
worth less than $200.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:28.770
He left a widow and six
children under the age of eleven.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.630
One of whom was born seven
months after he died.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.800
So. And his widow went to work
as a matron in Ellis Island,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.420
essentially took his
place at Ellis Island,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.720
but not really as an interpreter.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.560
She only could deal with the women

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.800
and raised her six
children by herself.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:55.030
Abraham, although the
eldest, lived the longest.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:59.800
He was the most restless
of the Arbeelys'.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.660
He lived in practice in Austin,
Texas, Hot Springs, Arkansas,

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.330
Washington DC, Los
Angeles, New York,

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:12.070
Cairo and ended his days
in Washington DC again.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.740
He bought and sold real
estate in Los Angeles.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.990
He was really early pioneer real
estate speculator in Los Angeles

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:24.630
because his wife's family were
pioneer Los Angeles families

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.730
and they were big and
wealthy ranchers

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.960
in Los Angeles in the
1860s and 1870s.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.240
He and his wife came in the 1880s
who set up a medical practice

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.770
and he did real estate
speculation, did extremely well.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.560
He wrote a gigantic
Arabic English primer,

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.970
which when put together
was 850 pages.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:48.780 position:56%
He sold it and [inaudible] through
subscription, through the newspaper,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.080
through Calcutta of America.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.410 position:56%
And it went through three printings.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.910
And you can still buy it.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:57.320
You can buy it on A Books.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.970
There are a couple of
copies available on A Books.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:04.950
He sold antiquities to
the Smithsonian Museum.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:10.420
He continued to write
albeit articles

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.710
for various Arabic newspapers
until his death in 1919.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:19.100
He was the only member of the
family to live his full threescore

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:23.420
and ten years and he had
outlived all of his brothers,

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.070
and of course his parents.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:31.580
The dilemmas that beset other
immigrants about assimilation,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:37.140
success, honor, culture and raising
children in a Strange Land seemed

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.740
to have skipped the Arbeelys'.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.610
For one thing they had always
planned to stay in America

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:46.530
and they did their utmost
to take advantage of all

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.830
that America had to offer.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.610
On the first day that Yosef and the
family arrived in New York he said

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.710
"I want my children educated here
and I want them to marry here."

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.580
Three of the sons were educated in
the United States and three married

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.060
and had families in America,
just as their father had wished.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.370
Two of them married to what
the Syrians call Americans,

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:08.670
although they weren't really.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.970
They were just non-Syrians

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:13.890 position:56%
and the third one Felala married his
cousin Jimelee who came with them.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:19.130
But all of their children, so the
six of Najeeb, the five of Abraham

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.280
and the two of Felala
all married Americans.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.560
Not one of them married another
Syrian or another Arab of any kind.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.850
More importantly from my
point of view as, you know,

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.890
as a 19th ethnography,
they paved the way

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.130
for what became a very respectable
way of making a living for all

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:44.330
of the Syrians, which was
entertaining on the stage

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:49.430
and in church halls and in YMCAs,
all over the United States,

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.980
giving lectures, dressing
up as Muslims,

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.550
doing reenactment of
Muslim weddings.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.980
And they made it respectable.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:03.730
Vaudeville for other peoples had
a kind of unsavory reputation,

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:07.150
but for the Syrians it was no
different than running a store

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.750
or being a paddler or having a
warehouse or a wholesale business

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:17.020
and the Arbeelys' constructed
this life of entertaining

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.280
and re-enacting Middle
Eastern rites and rituals

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.200
and made it okay for everyone else.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.830
They seem to have constructed
and deftly manage the two halves

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.250
of their identity, the
American and the other,

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:36.490
succeeding in both worlds while
keeping them completely separate.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:41.870
If one can detect cracks in their
smooth presentation of self,

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.590
they're perhaps to be found in
their restlessness and effort

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:49.230
to find a place where they
might really fit, perhaps,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.520
in the return of two of the
brothers to the Middle East but not

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.140 position:56%
to Damascus or Beirut, but to Cairo.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:59.240
And in the illnesses
which plague the family

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.050
and cause the premature death
of five of the six brothers.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:06.370
And that they ended up
living and dying so far

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:12.540
from each other may
indicate family strife.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.350
So being first was a
double edged sword.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:20.630 position:56%
They were able to forge their own
identity with few to criticize them,

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.820
no role models and they
were truly on their own.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.270
And they made it up
as they went along.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.130
Not just because in the first years

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.740
of their sojourn there were no
other Syrians in the United States

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:38.490
for them to be with, but the
fact that they, as a family,

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:43.900
seemed to live far away from other
Syrians even when Syrians came.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.700
The - you can see that Najeeb set

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.080
up the business six blocks
from the Syrian colony.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.340
It doesn't sound a lot today
but in those days it was a lot.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.760
It meant that they were separated
and then you had people in DC,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.290
you had people in Los Angeles,
you had people in Atlanta, Georgia

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.930 position:56%
and two men who went back to Cairo,
two brothers who went back to Cairo.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:06.710
So they really didn't
seem to be much part

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:10.050
of the Syrian colony even
though they published the Syrian

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.360
Colony Newspaper.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.550
Whatever their difficulties
may have been the Arbeelys',

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.880
it must be said succeeded.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:22.340
Not financially because none
was ever rich, but in figuring

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:27.240
out how an Arab might successfully
assimilate while keeping hold

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.890
of his albeit Orientalized culture.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.570
We owe them a great deal.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.370
Thank you.

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:39.110
[ Clapping ]

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:46.380 position:56%
So if there are questions I probably
have to have Muhannad translate

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.730
for me because I'm hard of hearing
but I'm happy to answer anything

00:41:49.730 --> 00:42:00.040
and that I'm happy to sign books.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.960
&gt;&gt; Woman: I'm curious
figure how the [inaudible]?

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.770
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: The
question is, she would like to,

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.830
you'd like to know
how the family fit

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.460
into racial categories,
especially in the South.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.760
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Okay.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.040
So they were considered white.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.790
They were always considered white,
all Syrians were considered white

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:25.780
until the '20s when people
began to worry about that

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.530
for citizenship purposes
and there were some - well,

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:35.600
the first citizenship trial with
the Syrians was in 1909 actually,

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.910
but that hinged on
whether they were white.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.910
However you define -
however they defined white,

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.410
but in the nineteenth century, no.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.620
And in every census form
they're always white,

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.420
always considered to be white.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.980
So there was no problem and really
it's kind of astonishing to me.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:59.880
They had really good friends
in Tennessee called the McTeers

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.140
and there was once a critical
article written about one

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.870
of their performances and Mr.
McTeer wrote an angry letter

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.380
to the newspaper defending them

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.790
and saying not only was
the performance authentic,

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.920
but the family was a fantastic
family and that people should get

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.950
to know them because
they were wonderful.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:21.060
So they were really, to me,

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:25.550
amazingly quickly accepted
in Tennessee.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.910
Further questions?

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:35.240
&gt;&gt; Man: I'm curious
about two things.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:40.100
I'm assuming that this first wave
[inaudible] Christian, and...

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.810
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: I heard that
one but I'll repeat it.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.110
Yeah.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:50.560
&gt;&gt; Man: And the other thing that
is curious is this is the time

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.860
when the nation [inaudible]

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:58.830
and therefore I assume your
[inaudible] the word Oriental,

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:03.190
that is what in Arabic
[inaudible] Eastern as well

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:08.140
because I don't think
[inaudible] necessary identifying

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:13.520
as Syrian specifically or
Lebanese or et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:19.170
At this period I think the
identity was basically what?

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:20.470
I'm curious.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:21.770
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: How did that...

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.070
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Okay,
you're going to have

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:24.370
to say it again because
I didn't hear.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.670
I'm sorry.

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:28.270
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: Basically how
did the identify as Orientals,

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:33.150
as Syrians, as - generally speaking
how would they have identified?

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.220
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: So they
identified as Ottoman.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.120 position:56%
Well, let me answer your first
question first about the Christians.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:45.850
Yes, 95% of the 19th century
immigrants were Christians.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.390
There were some Muslims.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.590
They didn't go to New York ever.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.550
They went and homesteaded
in the West.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:59.510
So you find early Muslims in
Texas, in North Dakota, in Ohio,

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:06.050
which was the west then a
bit, in Idaho, in Montana,

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.860
but there were Muslims in New
York, but they weren't Syrians,

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.730
they were students at Columbia
and they were Turks mainly.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:17.470 position:56%
And by 1910 that was beginning to
change, because there were beginning

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.590
to be Syrian Muslims coming.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.660
So, yes, but they were
Syrians, but of all four sects.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.580
These guys were Orthodox, but
the Maronites, the Melkites,

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.730
Presbyterians and Orthodox
were all well represented

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:34.090 position:56%
in the very first influx of Syrians.

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:35.640 position:56%
So how did they identify themselves?

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.640
Well they - if you're talking about
the Arbeelys' themselves I think,

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.850
in fact, that they
joined Quaker meeting.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:47.350
I think they became
Quakers when they came.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:52.340
I know that Habeeb and Naceem
were Quakers or considered

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.220 position:56%
to be Quakers by the Quaker meeting.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:46:00.270
And only had their name struck
off long after they died.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:05.500
Yosef performed, gave lectures
at Quaker meetings in Maine

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.400
and in Tennessee and when
they went to the White House

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.180
in 1881 they were accompanied
by a Quaker minister.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.520
So I actually think
that they were Quakers

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.280
and I thought maybe
the whole family was.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.550
But I don't have any
other evidence for that.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.330
But they were Orthodox,
Orthodox, Orthodox,

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:30.370
and they consider themselves
to be Ottoman, everyone did.

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.970
And they would call each
other sons of Ottoman.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.780
&gt;&gt; Man: In other words,
was Syria ever used?

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.080
Syrians?

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.380
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Syrians were used.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:44.880 position:56%
Yes. So for example at the 1893 fair
the [inaudible] published a list

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.310
of Syrian merchants who
were selling at the fair

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:50.070
and they were called
Syrian merchants.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:54.650
They wanted to distinguish them
from the Ottoman concession,

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:58.530
which was separate even though
it was also run by Syrians.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.630
&gt;&gt; Man: And at this time did
Syria also include [inaudible]?

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:01.930
&gt;&gt;

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:03.230
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: Yes,
it was Greater Syria.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:04.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: It was Greater Syria.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:05.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.130
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.430
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Yes.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.270
And they call [inaudible] who was
one of the two Syrian Jews who were

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:17.540
in New York at that time was in
that list of Syrians who were

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:21.840
at the fair, because he was
considered to be the same category

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.830
as the Syrian Christians.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.220
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:30.160
Any other questions?

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.750
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: I
actually have a question.

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.050
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Yeah, please.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.350
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: You
mentioned that these are the -

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.040
this is the first Syrian family
in the United States and -

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.310
but at one point there
were more Syrians

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:41.610 position:56%
or more Arabs coming to [inaudible].

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:49.600
Do we have any documents about this
steady influx of Syrians or Arabs?

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.900
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Oh yeah.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.580
Oh yes. I mean that's
really what my book is

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.410
about for the first 20 years.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.910
I mean, yes there's all
sorts of documentation.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:00.950
As you all probably know the
1890 census does not exist.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:02.250
It burned in a fire.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:06.140
The federal census, and
so that is the - for us,

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.880
for the Syrians it would
have been a crucial census,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.030
because that would have
been the biggest influx.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:15.690
1880 census has a few people on it,

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:21.110
but the 1890 census would have
been the key census for us.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:22.710
And it does not exist.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:28.180
So it's a big lack in our
knowledge of the influx of Syrians,

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.110
but there are summary
reports of the 1890 census.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.740
So you can get a sense of
the, at least the numbers.

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:39.020 position:56%
They came in the 1880s in a trickle.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:44.630 position:56%
In the 1890s, especially with the
Chicago fair caused this huge influx

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:51.390
and HH Jessup, who's a Presbyterian
minister in Lebanon from the 1860s

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:58.230
on laments the fact that the
town of Saali lost 300 young men

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:03.580
in one week, all of whom were
coming to the Chicago fair.

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.160
And that was probably a third

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.990
of the male population
of Saali at that time.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:14.750
So it was a huge attraction for
people to come to the Chicago Fair

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:18.120
in 1893 and a lot of
those people stayed.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.420
They stayed.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:23.040
So that was the biggest
pull to come.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.340
Yeah.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:30.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Man: You use the word Syrian
Diaspora, can you elaborate on that?

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.980
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: You use
the word Syrian Diaspora.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.880
Can you elaborate on that?

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.180
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Yeah.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.470
So the Syrians didn't just
come to the United States.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:41.820
Of course they went everywhere.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.360
There are many, many, many Syrians
in South America, in Brazil,

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.090
as you know because
some of the presidents

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.400
of these countries have
Syrian names, right?

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.680
They came to South America.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.440
There was lots of business going
on in Mexico, in Mexico City

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.040
and in the Yucatan and [inaudible].

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.740 position:56%
In the Caribbean, there was a big
Syrian colony in Cuba, one in Haiti,

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:11.760
one in Jamaica, one in the
Dominican Republic and of course

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.810
in all the states of the
Union, all the territories.

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:22.500 position:56%
I have evidence of Syrians in Hawaii
in 1905 buying and selling property.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.340
And then, you know, of course
there were Syrians in Manchester,

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.620
England starting in the 1860s.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.190
In France, the Maronites were going

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.270
to France early this
year and West Africa.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:36.570
They were everywhere.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:37.870
&gt;&gt; Man: Why did they leave?

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.310
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi:
Why did they leave?

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:41.610
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Good question.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:43.760
So everyone debates this

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.150
and the Syrians have their
own story about why they left.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.030
The Syrians always told the
same story, which I just love

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:53.710
because it's the same story
that Yosef Arbeely told

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.090
on the first day he got there.

00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:00.380
"Oh. we were oppressed by the
Muslim overlords and we came

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.590
to bask in American freedom."

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.970
Well, maybe, but probably not.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.700
Probably they came because
there was an opportunity

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.000
and that's what Yosef saw.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.580
He saw - he called it gold fever
and people came, the silk industry

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.700
in Mount Lebanon collapsed
in the 1880s.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:26.120
That had - and they had converted
all of their farms to silkworms,

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.610
so they were no longer
growing food for themselves.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:33.050
So they had silkworms, the
silk industry collapsed

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.290
and they had no income.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.320 position:56%
So it got really, really hard for
them and there was - there were lots

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:44.880
of famines going on in Mount
Lebanon in the 1880s and 1890s.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.100
And there was this
country beckoning.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.400
There were no visas.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.700
So people came.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.840
&gt;&gt; Man: Did a lot of them leave
because of the Ottoman draft?

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: Did a lot of them
leave because of the Ottoman draft?

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.580
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: That was later.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.970
Yeah, that was in 1909.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:01.270
It was later.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.420
Yeah. Some certainly did.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.870
Some certainly did.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:11.600
But the big influx was
really from 1890 to 1910.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.430
And the people stayed
until the First World War.

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:19.050 position:56%
So there were, you know, by about
1911 there were 9,000 Syrians coming

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.410
every year to New York.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.160
So - to the United
States I should say,

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.360
most of the landing in New York.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.210
And some of that has
to do with the draft.

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:31.290
My grandfather - my grandmother
and grandfather went back to Syria

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:36.380
to visit in 1914 and my
grandfather made a run

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:42.010
for the American consulate in
Beirut to prove, to get a letter

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.320
from the American consul that
he was an American citizen,

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.750
so he would not be drafted.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:50.450
Because the Ottoman still
considered him an ottoman citizen

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:53.790
and he wanted the consul to
say, essentially will fight

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:56.220
for you if you get drafted.

00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:03.650
Yeah. So. Okay well thank you.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:04.950
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi:
Thank you very much.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:06.750
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Thank
you so much for coming.
