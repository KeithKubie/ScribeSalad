Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello freak bitches, got back in with Alex and spent a little bit time hanging around with him and Roger Stone and so on and got really interested in the kind of dynamics of how Alex and Trevor communicate to each other. But I'm wondering if you've seen Alex more recently than I have now. Alex has been my friend since 1998 yeah, I was at his custody trial not long ago. And you were brought up, you were smoking pot on my show. He was smoking pot. Just chesting it. How she, George Soros makes the weeds stronger. That's what he said. He said that in this custody trial. That's exactly what he said. He said he tests it once a year just to, cause he's, he's weird because he's always there when that happens.

Speaker 1:          00:46          I mean D I mean, come on man. What's really funny is we drank whiskey on the show too and no one gives a shit about that. It's way more destructive. It's the pot, whatever it is. The self reflective. Yeah. Paranoia, inducing marijuana. It's a real problem. But I now wonder, so he says that Trump called and just after the election thank him. And I'm inclined to believe that's true cause I don't think that's the kind of thing that Alex would lie about. But have you got any, if you come to any conclusion about whether there is a connection between Alex and Trump now? Cause I'm beginning to think maybe there just isn't any more that may be, but I could be wrong. That's a good question. I don't know. I mean first of all, I don't see how Trump can have a connection with that many people.

Speaker 1:          01:31          I feel like the job of being the president has got to be so insanely demanding. The idea that he likes, he's taken a few moments out of his day. He's got his feet up on the chair with a laptop and he's on info wars.com it's like God damn, I've got to call Alex and find out what the fuck's going on with this child. A slavery thing on Mars. You know, where are these slaves? Tell me where we're on Mars. I think it benefits everyone to think that it's cause it makes an X Trump look bad. So it benefits people on the left to say that Alex is a, is connected to Trump. It kind of benefits Alex, I think for people to think it too, cause they aggrandized his him. Well it helps him in a way. I mean it's like the people that, there's a bunch of people that enjoy Alex, right?

Speaker 1:          02:17          So some of them enjoy it for the theater. There's a theater element of it all. You know, I mean, and it's all doom and gloom and yeah. And then some of it, some people enjoy because like Bohemian Grove occasionally he's correct. Like Bohemian Grove was a real mind fuck when you see all these super rich people were in robes, right? In effigy. Yeah. I was in the crowd with all the old men of wealth in Dallas. Don't freak you out and you see those people. One thing freaked me out. I'm like, Alex came out of out Bohemian Grove night with uh, with, with a varying interpretation of, of what, what was your interpretation? My interpretation is basically with, with one caveat I'm about to caveat there. Okay. Um, my interpretation was that it's just like fucking, you know, skull and bones or [inaudible], you know, those are all creepy, right?

Speaker 1:          03:10          Yeah. And they want to Nevis that does seem to be amongst the American ruling elites. That does seem to be a proclivity for ritual. Um, maybe a, maybe amongst the British elites as well. I'm not sure about, but that's in itself psychologically interesting. I think secrets too, right? So it's like why? So that is interesting. Why, even if the ritual at Bohemian Grove, I, I, you know, and I would contend that contrary to what Alex implied, they weren't actually sacrificing a child. You didn't say they were sacrificing your child. Then you said at some point and then this video. Yeah. It couldn't be real copy be ladies and gentleman. It couldn't be real. He probably was so jazzed up that they were actually dressed up like monks, people, the hoods and they have the Moloch the owl guy when he was actually there, I mean that probably ramped up his love of conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Oh solid three or 400%. It was hilarious cause you know we went in separately to to um, cause Alex got it into his head that maybe I was part of the Bohemian Grove deep, deep inside. Yeah. Like the wicked man that I was like learning. And then some, he would be the ones who were first in the Valley at the hour. So he went in separately to be, he went in far the undergrowth and I went up the street, I just went in the driveway, gave the security guard or kind of viral the world wave and then we went in there. That's all you had to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy so often the case. Yeah. So white house. And then we saw Alex and Mike Hanson, who was his producer at the time, walking like towards us. And I was with this local lawyer who had, who would we talked up with?

Speaker 1:          04:47          And I was like, um, Hey, you know Alex, Mike, how you doing? And they were like, keep walking. There's cameras in the trees, there's hours everywhere. And then there's no walls. Yes, because we felt like the owls were cameras. They got it into their heads that the hours at Bohemian Grove, the hour motifs that Bohemian Grove, uh, was indicative of the fact that it was like molec the owl guard. And it was like some sort of satanic. But actually I would say that the reason why there's all those hours, cause I saw like stuffed hours in display cabinets and so on. But I think it's like, I think it's an owl sanctuary. So anyway, they stuffed on that. I'll say for me, I presume it died of natural causes. [inaudible] shit. He fucking sanctuary. If they kill it then stuff it. So it's sorta like a Norman Bates mom and psycho stuff. But what was odd that night was one thing that the artist moment, and this is where I will, this is where my memory of the night does tally with Alex says, is that for whatever reason the people in the crowd were really into this, this ceremony land.

Speaker 1:          06:02          There was a sort of, they were really fired up diet. Let some, I remember this old guy walked up to me before it started and said, are you a first timer? And I went, yeah, I do. Oh, you've got to love it. You've got to love. It's like burn and burn him or something. Something along those lines. Uh, and, and it did make me think, and then I looked behind and there was Alex and Mike why died looking like they would ruin, you know, the belly of the beast. And then there's all these old preppy men like wide-eyed. They were really into it too. I felt like the only sane person in the entire Redwood forest, I was like, the only person who's thinking this is just fucking ridiculous. It is ridiculous. But, but they were into it. It was that moment. It was that moment of revelation actually that then led me to write the book that I wrote after that book, which was the metastatic goats, which is about, you know, um, soldiers tried to kill goats just by staring.

Speaker 1:          06:52          And then, cause I did, cause I remember lie, um, I remember thinking I was actually, I was in Belfast. I was giving a talk about my book them, which is where I talk about all of that stuff. And somebody said, okay, so I know what you think of it. This woman in the audience said, I know what you think. I know you think this is like ridiculous. And I know that Alex Jones thinks is evil, but what about the people in the crowd? What were they thinking about it? And I thought that's a really good question. So that's what led me to write a book about like a rational thoughts in powerful places, which is what led me to rap MedStar guts. When you, when you're there and you see that there really is this giant stone owl and they really do have this bundle of sticks that they're burning and everyone really is wearing these robes.

Speaker 1:          07:36          Like, I mean you had a big part of you how to be like, how many of these fucking things are going on that we haven't infiltrated? And that's true that there's a, there's a photo of it there. This is real. I mean, they really do have a giant owl and they really do burn some sort of a sacrifice in front of this owl. And there's a speakers that are, uh, there's a, there's a one point this is a lesser, um, documented part of the ritual. At one point there's a guy in leaf covet later Hosan appears in like a stage cut out at the Redwood tree and starts singing this cat of allergy to nature. Like, Oh, trees. So leaves. So that's how it starts. That's before of the men in robes turn up. So it's like some weird pagan nature. Literal covered later hose and Joe, how much would you give to be in one of those skull and bones meetings?

Speaker 1:          08:30          See if they actually like film each other's suck index or something. There's just something that goes on where they have like something over those guys supposedly. Yeah, the conspiracy theory. That's the means to engage in gay sex. I do believe these things happen for a reason. Like, you know, skin and bones accessory reason being they have something over you. It could be that, or it could be just this weird sense, this weird of psychological need that people like Ivy league people feel they need to like have a sense of superiority. And one way to do that is to kind of create the secret rituals to get them a sense of like, you know, grangeiro for the people that's possible. Now a guy like Alex Jones stumbles upon something like that or infiltrates it and finds out it is real. I mean, that is justifying to such a, an enormous, enormous level.

Speaker 1:          09:19          Yeah. But I'll expect, here's my, my truck with Alex and all of this is that it wasn't like the Alex, all the fucking crazy shit that we saw that night wasn't enough lucky hat to like turn it up to 11 of course. Yeah. I need apply that we had possibly witnessed an actual human sacrifice and said, of course. But that standard, that standard Alex Jones one-on-one, but it shouldn't be styled. It shouldn't be. But I mean, I mean, think about all of the exaggerations exaggerations that take place in the media, whether it's on the left or the right. There's this rampant exaggeration. Well, it's funny you should say that. So did you watch Alex being interviewed by Megan Kelly? Yes I did. Yeah. Well that may be enough. You know, they phoned me a couple of days before the broadcast back in Kelly's people cause they were panicking. I remember there was like a lot of criticism.

Speaker 1:          10:06          They look at Ang food for having them on in the first place. Yeah. So they called me up and they basically wanted me to give them as much evidence as I could. The proof that Alex and Trump were, you know, aligned and they would talk to each other and so on. Called you. Why? Because you'd went to Bohemian grow with them. I went to pay him and go, but then I also put out this little Kindle single last summer called the elephant in the room in which I'm trying to trace like the relationship between Alex and Trump did via, and it's kind of in this interesting stuff. But, um, so I answered the questions as best as I could, but I don't know that much about exactly how often Trump and Alex told to each other. I don't know either. I'm not even really that interested in it.

Speaker 1:          10:46          It was as odd as it is. Like I have a very fucked up relationship with Alex in, in that, and he's actually my friend. And so when I see him, it's like, what's up man? What are you doing? I give him a hug and people go, Oh, he's a monster or hockey, be friends with them and this and that. And like, I don't know. Yeah, I just base it on my interactions with them. And yet, does he say fucked up things? Yeah. It was the most disturbing thing that I didn't even know when he did the podcast. I didn't know that he was a Sandy hook denier. Right. So apparently he's backed off that since, uh, being confronted by the facts. And, and there was a horrible article that I read about a father who was actually a conspiracy theorist until his son was killed in Sandy hook.

Speaker 1:          11:30          And then he got death threats for lying and presumably for, from info Wars. And that was so, so just so sad. Yeah. That's just so hard. People look for fucking conspiracies and everything and I don't know what it is. I have friends that have this issue. I don't understand it. Things that can be easily explained. They look for a conspiracy. Anything that happens in the news, there's gotta be a different story. Like sometimes shit just happens and when that shit happens, the news has a story. It doesn't always have to be some sort of nefarious plot. But these people also think that the government is filled with idiots. Well, I'm sorry, but you can't have it both ways. You can't have a bunch of incompetent fuck heads who pull off the perfect fake world where everything you see is some sort of an elaborate played out scheme in order to manipulate you into either buying this or voting for that.

Speaker 1:          12:26          Like there's a weird inclination that people have to uh, not just, not just some conspiracy theories but almost everything to think everything is some part of some crazy plot. I'm not sure I understand it. What you said about like, you know, biases and untruths and like across the media on the left and underwrite remind to be if the mechan Kelly thing. So, um, you know, so they phoned me up obviously in a bit of a panic cause they were getting like so much grace I said, and then they reedited the show like frantically, just before weaponry edited it. How did they change? Well, I don't know, but what I do know is like, yo, I saw the final product and the final product was basically Meghan Kelly, like looking incredibly poised, saying, um, you know, you're wrong Alex, you're wrong about this. And then it would cut to all it's go up.

Speaker 1:          13:13          But, but I haven't cut back to Megan. So all they did was lie, edit Alex at his most sweaty and stuttery and then Meghan Kelly at her most poised to perfect. What did you see? Did you hear the Alex Jones a audio, the leaked audio that he released? Yes. Or they were sort of buttering him up and conning him? Yeah, she was saying, uh, personally I was saying, I don't, I'm not here to make a hit piece. I just want to know the real you. And although they did rent it, so I, I wonder what the original program would have been like cause they felt forced to basically by him. Yeah. Well they felt forced by like the people pushing back against them, doing it all by him, uh, to then put out this shitty, you know, 10 minutes. I basically was in Megan Kelly's corner. I would have told her, first of all, don't ever go to NBC.

Speaker 1:          14:04          Listen, here's the deal. Like you, you made your bones as an ice princess on this conservative network and do you think they're just gonna accept you at NBC? Right. People are going to resent you. They're going to hate you. Like you're the lady that chastise people for saying that Santa Claus potentially wasn't white. I remember that. I don't remember that. Oh my God, it was something where they were saying they were, there was people talking about Santa Claus being black and I'll never forget it cause she was on TV going, you know, listen, Santa Claus is white. Like then I'm like, what the fuck the fuck are you talking about? Santa Claus isn't real. You crazy bitch. You can't say Santa Claus is white more than you could say cat in the hat is red. They're not real things. You know you can decide that. You know like the cat in the hat in the book is always white.

Speaker 1:          14:53          Okay. Yeah, you're right. Good point. But is he black? Is he white? What does the cat in the hat? He's got a hat is red and white. What color is he though? Hmm, I think he's black, right? Is he? Okay. All right. It's not porn, but what's important is that like her whole thing was being this spokesperson, this ultra hot spokesperson for the conservative movement, but also being someone who's ruthlessly smart and articulate and capable of shutting down these stammering liberals that day or go and question her, her narrative, and then all of a sudden she's on NBC. Like you can't do that. That's a terrible move. I, they're not going to accept you. This is not going to work. And the ratings have been horrendous and now she's free. And now they pulled the show. They pulled the show early, but it just goes to show like, you know, we rightly attack people like info Wars for spreading, you know, outright lies.

Speaker 1:          15:48          Yes. But we on the left, like Megan Kelly editing that segment to make it look like she was poised and perfect. Perfected all Alex does this stammer and sweat. What's very hard, very hard sell saying that Megan Kelly's on the left, she's on the left now what? I mean, the mainstream, the main season that NBC, so the main stream has its own tricks. It's like, it's not an outright lie. Like Alex would do, but that, you know, panicky, selective editing is its own. Well I would, I would have imagined that that Joel, in the interview between Alex and Megan Kelly, Alex would have said some things that were, you know, eloquent or all or sentence without Istomin in a swag. I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure. Well here's also the problem and having any sort of a conversation about Hey, sort of difficult subject and stuffing it into seven minutes or whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          16:41          It's ridiculous. Yeah. It's an ancient way of communicating and now that we have the internet and Alex has shown with his own show, you know, that he can go and rant about something and you know, for 15 minutes or whatever it is like, and with no limitations or restrictions like it's, it's a better way to communicate. And one of the things that I wanted to do when I had Alex on the podcast is I wanted people to see the Alex that I know because there's no other way to see him like that. I wanted to get them drunk. I wanted to get them high and I wanted to have them talk. And my friend Eddie, who's just so in a conspiracy, he kind of fucked some of it because he's just so when a chem trails and proving the chem trails are real, but it was good overall because it's like he was, Alex is so crazy that even Eddie was like, what?

Speaker 1:          17:28          It was a couple of wallets where Eddie turned to look at Alex. He goes, what the fuck? Like when he's talking about interdimensional child molesters and it's, I wanted people to see him the way I see him. He's a fun guy that I like hanging out with. Do I think that he has a lot of influence? Yeah. Do I think he says things that he definitely shouldn't say? Of course. Especially the Sandy hook stuff. I mean, I think this inclination to always look towards conspiracy is, is, is, is dangerous. It's harmful. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's dangerous in that people are easily led. And if you get people thinking that everything's a conspiracy, the real problem is they don't know what the fuck a conspiracy actually is when it's in front of them and it's real, and there's a ton of them that are real. So when you call, you're crying Wolf around every corner, and then all of a sudden you turn a corner. Like, Holy shit, that's a real Wolf. No one is listening. So I agree that that's my frustration with Alex too, is that he has a conspiracy template and whatever real world event happens, you can shoe horns into this kind of simplistic template. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          18:40          [inaudible].
