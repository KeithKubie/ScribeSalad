00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's do this again, using once again our election example.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This time with four parties--A, B, C, and D.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here are the election outcomes--party A received 175,000 votes,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
party B 50,000, party C 25,000, party D 50,000.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In most democratic parties, you don't find such a distribution 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that one party takes the vast majority, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but say that's the case for our country.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If I now draw a pie chart, let us assume that we try to graph party A first,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
then B, C, and D--as indicated over here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Please check exactly those boxes that define the separator from one party to the next.
