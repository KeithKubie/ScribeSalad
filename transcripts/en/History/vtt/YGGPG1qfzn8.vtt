00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.711
- Hi, my name's Drew Hash.

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.170
We're here filming at my shop

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.005
in San Francisco.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.507
Let's do a little tour.
I can show you

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.842
all the stuff
that I've built for it.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.678
My very small two-car garage.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.388
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.181
So this is my main
forging area.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.100
At night, I'll pull my car in.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.435
Everything that I have
is on wheels

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.019
so that it can be pushed
to the side.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.647
I built pretty much everything
myself.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:27.277
This is my big, 256 JHM
made-in-Texas anvil.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.528
It's my baby.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.363
This is my forge right here.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.991
Forced air,
runs super, super hot.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.076
- I'm John Stokes.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.286
This is my shop.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.246
Uh, this is where
the magic happens.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:39.622
Piece-of-junk anvil.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.040
It come from shopping online.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.333
I got free shipping on it.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.002
This is my piece-of-junk press.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.212
I've bent the frame on it
twice now.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.464
Bench grinder.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.965
Just a regular bench grinder;

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.216
ain't nothing special about it.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.634
Most of my tools
are pretty cheap.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.511
Well, I've been running
this coal forge

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.472
for about five years now,

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:57.849
but I just got
this propane forge,

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:01.144
and one of my burners
don't work already.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.022
And, uh, 900 pounds
of frickin' coal

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.483
before I decided to get
a propane forge.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.778
- This is more my finish area
over here.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.405
My lathe for turning
small parts.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.867
And, uh, this is kind of
my clean bench.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.535
It's pushed over here
in the corner.

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:20.914
I'll do all my handle
and woodwork over here.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.083
This is my 24-ton
hydraulic press.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.835
I use it a lot for Damascus.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.463
Tool area.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.173
This is my main grinder area.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:34.093
I've got two 2x72 grinders.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:37.430
Rockwell tester
and...drill press.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.098
Assortment of hand tools.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.725
This is my welding bench,

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.936
and this is where I do
a lot of work.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.439
Everything I could possibly
need for knife-making in here.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.441
- Most of what I do in here

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.944
is just very final
finish work.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.071
Don't have the best tools
in the world.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.573
I have a decent welder.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.617
I have a really crappy
band saw.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.910
This here's my belt sander.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.120
It's, uh,
it's a piece of junk.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.373
Uh, 4x36 sander.
Both of 'em.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.916
It's got
a 4-horsepower motor.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.335
And this one here
is older than I am.

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.296
It's still strong,
but aggravating.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.006
Drill press.
Again, older than I am.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.300
But it works better
than every tool in the shop,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.593
including me.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.971
Really, it's just,
I buy by deals.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.264
Garage sales,

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.641
different stores
that sell cheap tools.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.476
This one actually come from

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.812
my mother-in-law's father,

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.188
along with that belt sander.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.107
I don't go spend full price
on a tool

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.776
because I--I don't have
the money to do so.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.611
But this is what I do
every day.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.196
I go to work,
and then I come home,

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.157
and I make knives,
and I use what I can.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.034
Thank you for coming
and seeing my shop.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:43.413
I'm hoping to make some killer
blades in here right shortly.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:46.541
