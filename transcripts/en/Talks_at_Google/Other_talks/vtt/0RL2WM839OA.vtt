00:00:02.634 --> 00:00:04.050
FEMALE SPEAKER:
For over 20 years,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.810
Duggan McDonnell has been making
his mark on the West Coast

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.020
beverage scene, distinguishing
himself at such San Francisco

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.720
gems as the Redwood
Room and Absinthe.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.010
He is the founder
and owner of Cantina

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.480
and has designed cocktails
for the Sundance Film

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.190
Festival, Aspen Food
and Wine, the Omni

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.700
Hotel, and many others.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.800
He is also a winemaker
and distiller

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.030
and lectures at the Culinary
Institute of America.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.520
Passionate about writing,
as well as mixology,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.160
he has authored
articles and recently

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.930
published his first book.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.780
"Drinking the Devil's
Acre-- a Love Letter

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.010
from San Francisco
and Her Cocktails"

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.610
is at once a bold primer
on modern mixology,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.660
a barman's memoir, and a
dive into San Francisco's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.580
rich cocktail history.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.096
Please join me in
welcoming Duggan McDonnell.

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:49.376
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.330
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Thank you,
[? Marin. ?] [? Marin ?] told

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.880
me that she was a really
great Google stalker.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.260
And wonderful bio, thank you.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.250
What's that?

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.170
I'm looking off.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.640
Where are you?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.740
How many folks in this
room like to drink?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.910
Cocktails, yeah?

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.710
Show of two hands,
perhaps, that.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.170
How many of you in this room
think that you, perhaps,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.569
have a good pallet or at
least an inquisitive one?

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:20.360
You like to go out.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.000
You like to learn.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.208
You like to taste new things.

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.500
OK.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.580
I'm that guy, as well.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.132
I found at a very
early age-- and I

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:30.520
was sharing with [? Marin ?]
earlier-- that two decades ago,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.750
during my first summer abroad,
which was when I was 18,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740
I spent it between high
school and summer in Europe.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.160
You can drink legally there.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.860
And I learned a lot
about myself that summer.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.100
And one of the
things that I learned

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.560
is that I was most concerned
about flavor and texture

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.860
and not just the buzz
that I was getting

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.400
from that pint of Guinness.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.050
And it led me down
a path, or shall

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.420
we say a rabbit hole, which
I'm in these two decades later.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.870
This book that's right here,
"Drinking the Devil's Acre,"

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.270
is many things.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.540
In addition to narrative,
memoir, and history,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.880
it's also part
cultural anthropology.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.730
And one of the things that
I was most interested in

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.320
is studying this
community, thinking

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.370
about San Francisco as the
epicenter of the Bay Area,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.140
of the culture of
Northern California,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.940
and how the culture
of California

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.590
has historically been
connected to cocktails.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.490
And what I learned was that
it was also historically

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.080
connected to how we taste, OK?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.730
In this book, I
make an assertion

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.740
that we actually
learn to taste first.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.350
And our palates became developed
first via the cocktail,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.760
all right?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.810
So again, I'm Duggan McDonnell.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.870
And a few months ago, this book,
"Drinking the Devil's Acre,"

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.820
was published.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.690
It's history.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.250
It's memoir.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.790
And it tells all of these
years of my time shaking,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.070
and then drinking, behind
the stick, as well.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.050
What I'm most passionate
about, as I said,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.320
is how San Franciscans drank
and came to understand flavor.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.700
And what I'd love to
hear from you today

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.390
is whether you agree with
me and whether you've also

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.890
experienced this.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.370
The title of this talk is
Bright, Bitter, and Boozy.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.040
Perhaps some of you in this
room can relate to at least one

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040
of those three adjectives.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.870
Whether you're native to the
Bay Area or a recent emigre who

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.060
happens to chug
many a cocktail, I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.650
believe that's what we all are.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.160
So here in Northern
California, I'm

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.980
here to tell you that your
culture-- our culture--

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.510
first experienced
flavor via cocktails.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.540
Our palates found enlightenment
by sipping, not chewing.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.880
Again, the culture
of the Bay Area

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.990
first acquired its understanding
and its passion for flavor

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.830
through the cocktail glass,
not via fork and plate.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.350
I'm going to read just a
few lines from this book

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.290
so that you understand.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.510
"San Francisco began
as a city of drink.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.260
And from its infancy, discerning
and decisive San Franciscans

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.990
tippled by calling out
the name of their drink.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.360
The city did not begin with
that ribald Barbary Coast,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.959
nor was it the Arizona or the
Colorado of the Wild West,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.340
where thirsty pioneers
dumbly hollered 'whisky.'

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.390
No, no, no.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.540
This was the San Francisco of
the Gold Rush, the Comstock

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.512
Lode, a city shaped by the 'Big
Four' and other robber barons.

00:04:33.512 --> 00:04:37.540
The prevailing culture spoke
civilly to, rather than shouted

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.580
at, the barkeep, 'whisky smash,
if you please, cherry cobbler,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.110
if you don't mind,
claret and lemonade,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.590
if it's no trouble.' It
wasn't a culture that barked

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.590
for straight hooch.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.980
Instead, the tune
sung throughout

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.900
was of freshly squeezed
citrus, sprigs of peppermint,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.510
dashes of bitters
here and there."

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.520
So come along with me and think.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.450
Cocktails offer an
explosion of flavor.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.750
They're liquid combinations
of wine and spirit,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.660
liqueur, fresh produce,
dashes of bitters, tinctures.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.760
And most of these
ingredients are shelf stable.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.680
They can travel across the
world in the hull of a ship,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.200
ready to be blended by
the ounce behind the bar

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.420
when they are finally chosen
by their destined barkeep.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.515
Let's remember this old
cocktail called the Martinez.

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:41.830
An Abrahamic cocktail, the
forerunner to the martini,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.360
it tastes of clove, juniper,
cinnamon, orange peel,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.910
tart cherry, vanilla, sassafras,
bitter orange, cardamom.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.170
Rare is that rare
steak that could offer

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.200
such an abundance of flavor.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.910
But this cocktail can.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.480
San Francisco, because it has
been bright, bitter, and boozy

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.130
from its first week as a city
known round the world in 1849,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.910
has had at the core of its
identity this burst of flavor.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.350
The fastest-growing,
richest city

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.360
in the history of the
world got to drink

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.220
what it wanted to drink.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.180
And then, San
Francisco got spoiled.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.040
We got used to good drink.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.000
Does that sound familiar, folks?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.730
The richest city in the
history of the world?

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.070
What is this Bay Area now?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.797
We have a few bucks
going around, don't we?

00:06:39.797 --> 00:06:41.380
And isn't there a
cocktail Renaissance

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.130
that's been happening,
as well, simultaneously?

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.730
It's an interesting
phenomenon, isn't it?

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.490
150ish years ago, San
Francisco had a lot of options,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.670
principally, a large
menu from which to drink.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.510
Then, as now, the
city was a port city.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.110
And it was the port that
fed the city in ideas,

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.110
in human populations,
and in drink.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.690
Into this port came the
largest, most diverse stream

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.780
of champagne, port, Jamaican
rum, Scotch whisky, Dutch gin,

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.470
Bourdeaux, Pisco from
Peru, just to name a few.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.010
Never before had such a
collection of wine and spirits

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.920
ever been on offer.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.240
Never before had a city sprung
up, seemingly overnight,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.680
from mountains of
harvested gold.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.730
And again, it was because
of all that gold--

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.040
that great disposable income--
that San Francisco commanded

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.631
the world's finest drink.

00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:43.380
Does that sound like
some of the back bars

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.540
that you go and see
in the city today,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.240
where there's 400 bottles
lining the shelves,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.875
and the bar keep
gets to play with all

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.830
of these different flavors?

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.536
That was happening in the 1850s.

00:07:57.536 --> 00:08:00.580
And so imagine
that old bar keep.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.530
Let's think, huh?

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.360
Mustache, oil cloth, OK?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.200
You're just here.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.730
Perhaps it's your first job.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.320
And you're standing in front
of all of the splendor.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.203
And you think, what am I going
to do with all this stuff?

00:08:13.203 --> 00:08:13.970
Huh?

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.220
What would you do?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.760
You'd start mixing,
wouldn't you?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.770
I think I'd feel at home.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.340
And I would've started mixing,
just as I have done recently.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.310
You see, from its birth,
again, San Francisco

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.756
has been a city of innovation.

00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:30.380
And "Drinking the
Devil's Acre" reveals

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.289
that much of that
early innovation

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.580
actually happened in the saloon.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.280
The great spirits of the world
captivated the imagination

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.419
of the first generation
of mixologists.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.549
And to work they went.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.120
And for that, I'm
quite thankful.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.330
By the time 1881 arrived and
California's first cookbook

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.290
was finally published, no less
than the world's first four

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.780
cocktail books had come from
the city's finest bar keeps.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.460
Newspapers were full of
advertisements for apothecaries

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.160
for homemade bitters.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.840
And I should share with you,
the first piece of fiction

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.040
ever published in
California was called "Punch

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.780
Drinking and Its Effects."

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.710
First piece of fiction
published in our state

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.210
was about a cocktail.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.840
The local landscape was
lousy with breweries,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.530
lousy with local distilleries.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.700
Then came the wineries.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.550
And then finally
into full bloom came

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.500
the drinking culture of Northern
California, the most prolific

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.320
and the greatest contributor
of intellectual property

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.480
to drink the world
will ever know.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.760
This is something
that I'm proud of.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.740
This is something,
frankly, that makes

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.095
our lives a lot more delicious.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.430
Close your eyes with me.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.850
The Gold Rush, the Comstock
Lode, the whaling years,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.510
railroad barons.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.690
The Martinez, the whisky
smash, the gin fizz, punches,

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.940
sours, and flips.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.550
IBM, Apple, YouTube.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.570
The Mai Tai, the lemon
drop, Pisco punch.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.840
Friendster, Facebook.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.580
The chartreuse swizzle,
the basil gimlet, Google,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:24.010
and the Irish coffee-- all
of these, local innovations,

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:26.250
the greatest diversity of
liquid decadence the world

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.560
has ever known.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.570
And together, money and
cocktails shall ever flow.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.450
Now let's return to why San
Francisco learned specifically

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.440
about flavor from drink.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.640
Produce is perishable, yes?

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.250
Requiring preservation
for travel.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.660
Not so, a barrel of rum
or a bottle of sherry.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.330
Meats and vegetables today
benefit from refrigerated box

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.050
cars, trucks perfectly
chilled, much of it

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.500
frozen, right, while
traveling America's highways.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.090
Now California cuisine could not
and did not develop to anything

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.490
like it is today until long
after electric generators were

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.220
developed, mass produced,
until highways were chock full

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.080
with trucks traveling from
farm to city every single day.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.930
It's a very recent phenomenon.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.240
Our palates were first
informed by drink.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.280
And in California, it is a
bright, bitter, and boozy

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.210
pallet we have.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.560
So what do I mean by bright?

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.868
Does it have an IQ?

00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:35.272
[LAUGHS]

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.940
Is it merely something, say,
citric-- a little fresh lemon

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.940
in your water or
in your martini?

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.760
It can be, as citrus
was first cultivated

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.910
in the United States
by the Spanish fathers

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.300
here, in early California.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.930
But without balance-- a
little sugar-- citric really

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.740
just means acidic, which can
be too tart, which can be,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.590
frankly, yuck, all right?

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.210
So I mean that cocktails
in Northern California

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.100
are abundant with citrus,
whether for its juice

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.750
to be squeezed or for
essential oils found

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.640
in the skins of
lemons and oranges

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.680
to be expressed over, into
Negronis, Old Fashioneds.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.600
And I do not mean citrus
come from Florida.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.870
What do I mean?

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.630
Local satsumas,
local Meyer lemons

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.530
because that is
what prevails here.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.740
Because when produce is fresh,
the height of its flavor

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.385
experience is, in fact, higher.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.030
By bright, I also
mean herbaceous.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.440
What was the name of
the little Spanish town

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.330
at the end of the
mythic peninsula

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.440
before it became known
as San Francisco?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.900
Does anybody know?

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.190
AUDIENCE: Yerba Buena?

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.310
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Yerba Buena,
says the gentleman in row two.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.810
Right.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:04.190
And that means "good herb," as
it was called by the Spanish,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.610
for all the plentiful
wild mint that

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.850
was grown all over the land.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.730
Trader Vic, that
native San Franciscan,

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.250
who created the Mai
Tai, the Scorpion Bowl,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.990
amongst many other wildly
imaginative offerings--

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.640
his favorite garnish of
choice was a mint sprig--

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.980
smacking it-- something bright,
something to sort of heighten

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.210
that aromatic
experience of cocktails.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:37.630
And in the mid '90s, long
before the mojito craze

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.640
swept the country,
that lovely high ball,

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.947
bright with fresh mint,
was alive and well

00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:44.655
in San Francisco.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.420
Let's talk about bitterness.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.380
Has anyone ever
experienced bitterness?

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.220
In a cocktail, hmm?

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.760
Sure, sure, sure.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.000
Well, San Francisco
has long been bitter.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.457
But it's actually been
a preference of ours.

00:14:02.457 --> 00:14:04.040
I mentioned that in
the Gold Rush era,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.250
dozens of brands of local
bitters were being produced.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.810
They were consumed for health--
folk medicine, if you will.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.390
And the ingredients used
were this amazing combination

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.250
of local produce, along
with exotic roots and spices

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:26.830
freshly imported from the
Andes or from Canton China.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.280
And as bitters
became ubiquitous,

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.200
so too did these San
Francentric combinations

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.360
of bitter global flavor.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.280
Fast forward to World War I, OK?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.700
Northern Italy becomes a
front in a vicious fight.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.360
Trench warfare ensues, and the
entire region is destabilized.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.540
Within the next decade,
tens of thousands

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.150
of immigrants from
Northern California

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.710
came to San Francisco and
settled in the North Beach

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.550
region.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:06.890
With them, they brought their
two local preferred hamaros.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.820
What are the names
of those brands?

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.230
Campari, Fernet-Branca, OK?

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.160
If you've ever wondered how San
Francisco acquired its passion

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.811
for the Negroni cocktail or
for chugging shots of Fernet,

00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:25.490
not only does it go
back to North Beach

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.540
and that northern
Italian migration

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.480
during the '20s,
which was prohibition,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.440
remember, but also before that.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.420
This region has
preferred something

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.720
bitter on the pallet
for nearly 150 years.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.580
Let's talk about
being boozy, shall we?

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.610
Many of you asked if I'd brought
my samples with me today.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.619
I'm sorry, I did not.

00:15:48.619 --> 00:15:50.410
In the old days, the
port of San Francisco,

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:56.250
and today, the Port of Oakland,
receives more coffee beans

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.880
than any other
port in the world.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.410
Does anyone know that?

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.480
Why am I talking about coffee?

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.630
Stay tuned.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.340
Long ago, it was
Hills Brothers, which

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.620
was located on the
waterfront, that dominated

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.020
the national coffee landscape.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.980
Today, a few different
companies, but locally, we

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.060
have artisanal brands--
Blue Bottle, Equator.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.420
But now, let's remember the
most widely known coffee

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:26.220
drink all over the world,
which comes from San Francisco,

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.330
has what in it?

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.250
A slug of whisky-- the
Irish coffee, folks.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.862
One of the drinks that San
Francisco is most famed for,

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:39.530
its most famous coffee drink,
actually has booze in it,

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.720
and quite a bit of it.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.920
Has anyone here been
to the Buena Vista?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.180
Full house, perfect. [LAUGHS]
I'm a local, and I go often.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.050
Northern California,
with its breweries,

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.340
wineries, and distilleries
produces the largest amount

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.590
of alcohol in the country.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.150
That should come as no surprise.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.900
California as a state
also imports and consumes

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.780
the largest amount of
alcohol in the nation.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.948
It is boozy to its core.

00:17:10.948 --> 00:17:16.839
And so I wonder, folks, with all
this alcohol, these experiences

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:24.210
of bright, of bitter, and boozy,
I wonder if we think better.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.180
I wonder if we perform better.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.650
I wonder if we
work harder because

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.360
of that delicious, abundant
reward of great drink

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.820
all around us.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.860
I think that there's
a connection.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:41.190
I wonder how intrinsically
linked cocktails just

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.390
might be to the world's
great culinary region,

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.240
to the center of innovation.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.660
I'll leave you with a quote
from Doris Muscatine's epic

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.300
book, "Old San Francisco,"
which I quote in my book.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.540
And it's one of my favorites.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.240
And I think it describes
San Francisco, then and now,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.090
perfectly.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:09.080
She says, "Drinking was
such a fact of city life

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.360
that it was certainly
considered no disgrace

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.630
to frequent a saloon, which
the entire populace did

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.630
without embarrassment.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.230
Since everybody acknowledged
that everybody drank,

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.665
large-scale social drinking
became taken for granted.

00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:25.880
And there was consequently
little stigma attached.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:34.930
San Francisco has never lost
its enthusiasm for alcohol."

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.114
Thank you for your time.

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:39.130
And now I'd like to hear from
you what your thoughts are

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.080
on being bright,
bitter, and boozy,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.640
some of your favorite
watering holes,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.875
cocktails to make or shake.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.410
Go ahead.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.192
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to boozy and bitter.

00:18:51.192 --> 00:18:52.150
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Yeah.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.770
AUDIENCE: Isn't it true
that Anchor Brewery sort of

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.551
invented the modern IPA?

00:18:58.551 --> 00:19:01.050
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: I would say
that would be our fine friends

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.050
up in Chico.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.130
AUDIENCE: In Chico.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.010
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Sierra Nevada.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.335
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:04.335 --> 00:19:06.626
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: But one of
the things that Anchor did

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:11.700
was revive the rye
whisky revolution.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.290
I have the year in the book.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.620
But I think it was,
perhaps, it was '97 or '99.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.050
And Anchor became the first and
only distillery in the United

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.520
States to make 100% rye whisky.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.350
And that wasn't
happening anywhere.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.250
Well, here we are,
again, San Francisco

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.861
long ahead of the curve.

00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:33.360
And we're in the midst of not
only a whisky revolution right

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.550
now but a rye revolution.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.600
The old fashioned is one of
the most popular cocktails

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.340
in the country.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.950
Whisky has outpaced
vodka in recent sales.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.540
And it all goes back, I
think, to the late '90s,

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.850
when Fritz Maytag,
the previous owner,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.150
said I'm going to do this.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.990
It's time that America
sort of take back

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.440
it's rye whisky heritage.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.780
And in fact, long before,
say, there were vines

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.405
planted throughout
Northern California,

00:19:59.405 --> 00:20:00.670
it was actually fields of rye.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.837
So it was a local thing.

00:20:01.837 --> 00:20:03.670
So the distilleries
that were happening here

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:08.899
in the 1860s and '70s produce a
ton of specifically rye whisky.

00:20:08.899 --> 00:20:09.940
That was his inheritance.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.770
That's our inheritance.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.770
So I'm glad he did it.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.853
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
touching on the connection

00:20:13.853 --> 00:20:15.710
between wealth and drinking.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.760
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Mm-hm.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.290
AUDIENCE: What is
the best cocktail

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.330
for coping with gentrification?

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.584
DUGGAN MCDONNELL:
Ah, that is the best

00:20:22.584 --> 00:20:25.000
question that I've been asked
this fall on this book tour.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.760
Thank you for asking that.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.640
Something expensive, I
think, is the right answer.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.100
Did everybody hear the question?

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.400
The best cocktail to drink while
coping with gentrification.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.450
I'm going to steal that.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.440
Yes, something
expensive and something

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.114
on someone else's tab, I think,
is the right way to do it.

00:20:44.114 --> 00:20:45.155
Do you have a preference?

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.490
AUDIENCE: I had something, I
think, last week or the week

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.040
before.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.610
And it was over by Civic Center.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:03.500
And it was whisky in a stout,
along with nutmeg and cinnamon.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.960
And I just loved it.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.790
I had another.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.750
DUGGAN MCDONNELL:
Hits you right there.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.375
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:08.750
DUGGAN MCDONNELL:
So you had two.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:09.540
That's great.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.420
Did you pay for them?

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.090
What a good man.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:13.590
Well--

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.076
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:17.090
You put it on a
credit card, though.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.520
You'll deal with it at
the end of the month.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.080
All right.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.580
Sure.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.400
The question is, can I name
a few local rye whiskys.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.750
So in addition to
Anchor, the folks

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.210
over at St. George Spirits
are getting into the whisky

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.140
business, not just rye yet,
but they're working on that.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.120
But there is a
distillery up in Sonoma

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.750
by the name of--
folks, what is it?

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.400
Spirit Works?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.358
AUDIENCE: Spirit Works.

00:21:48.358 --> 00:21:50.540
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Yeah,
they also make the sloe gin.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.100
They are just about to
launch a straight rye whisky.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.270
And I tasted it last week.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.530
It's very nice.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.130
AUDIENCE: So are they local?

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.844
Are they actual
local distilleries?

00:21:59.844 --> 00:22:01.510
They are distillering
their own alcohol?

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:02.968
DUGGAN MCDONNELL:
So yeah, they are

00:22:02.968 --> 00:22:06.745
what you would call part of
the grain-to-glass movement.

00:22:06.745 --> 00:22:08.120
Where the question
is coming from

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.780
is that the great majority
of whisky in this country

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.300
is actually made
by very few people.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.330
There's a couple distilleries
in the middle of the country

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.881
that everyone just buys
from and then re-distills

00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:20.880
or does their own thing.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.930
Or they say, hey,
this is our recipe.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.340
You guys make it,
and give it to us.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.756
And then we'll finish it, or
we'll barrel it or something.

00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:27.860
Some part of that
process is largely

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.280
what's happening in the country.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.340
There are certain folks, like
Buffalo Trace, Wild Turkey,

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.690
they do everything on their own.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.010
But for instance,
there are brands

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.780
that are largely outsourced.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.020
The local guys now
are trying to be

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.350
more a part of this
California ethos, which

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.807
is the grain-to-glass movement.

00:22:45.807 --> 00:22:47.640
And I think we're going
to see more of that,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.960
not just here but
throughout the country.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.020
AUDIENCE: More of the--

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.530
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: More of
the grain-to-glass movement--

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.170
basically, controlling the
ingredients and all the steps

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.524
to ensure quality and
also to be able to connect

00:22:59.524 --> 00:23:01.440
with your consumer to
say, look, we made this.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.064
And here's why.

00:23:02.064 --> 00:23:04.110
And you can answer
every single question

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.970
because your steps are
vertically integrated.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.040
You know exactly how
everything's been made.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.500
AUDIENCE: You also
mentioned some

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.081
herbs coming from the Andes?

00:23:13.081 --> 00:23:14.080
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Mm-hm.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.390
AUDIENCE: For instance what?

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.140
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Sure, well,
coca leaves used to be legal.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.430
But quinine, [INAUDIBLE]
cinchona bark,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:27.140
is the main one that did and
does still come from Peru.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.290
Quinine is the principal
ingredient in what?

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:30.844
Anyone know?

00:23:30.844 --> 00:23:31.510
AUDIENCE: Tonic.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.557
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Tonic, mm-hm.

00:23:34.557 --> 00:23:36.390
So not just in tonic
water, but before that,

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.820
it was in many different
formulas for bitters.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.850
And there's other things coming
from down there, as well.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.990
So and of course, San Francisco
being on the Pacific, stuff

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.690
would stop off in
those ports down here.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.440
They'd load it on.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.670
They'd do some commerce.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.527
Come up here to the
Port of San Francisco--

00:23:52.527 --> 00:23:53.610
another layer of commerce.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.020
And then folks would take
them to their "pharmacies"

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.440
and have at it.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.250
AUDIENCE: So what are some of
your favorite San Francisco

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.990
establishments for new and
inventive cocktails these days?

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.300
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: OK.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.770
So this book, "Drinking
the Devil's Acre,"

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.650
was organized according
to 25 chapters, OK?

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:18.870
25 cocktails that are
iconic and celebrated

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.060
in San Francisco, whether
created there or sacred to.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.360
Within those 25 chapters,
I provide some spots.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.290
One of them is, of
course, the Irish coffee

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.480
in the Buena Vista.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.650
So that's one.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.582
Comstock Saloon is another.

00:24:32.582 --> 00:24:34.790
You've probably heard about
Trick Dog in The Mission.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.873
It's getting a lot of ink.

00:24:35.873 --> 00:24:37.480
That's a great one.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.720
I was just recommending
Benjamin Cooper,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.930
which is a lovely
little hidden gem

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:48.650
on a mid-level mezzanine in a
hotel right off Union Square.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.820
No signage, no nothing.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.370
Really great.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.010
Just opened up.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:57.250
Whitechapel is this stunning
new gin bar in the Tenderloin.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.380
You walk right in,
and you feel like you

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.980
are in, like, a Terry Gilliam
film-- "Brazil," "12 Monkeys."

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.580
It's this wild
pseudo-London interior.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.813
Whitechapel-- I
recommend it, yeah.

00:25:08.813 --> 00:25:09.354
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:09.354 --> 00:25:10.440
Hmm, I'll try that.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.084
Yeah, I also just recently
discovered Alembic.

00:25:13.084 --> 00:25:14.250
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Of course.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.820
Yeah, that's a staple.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.790
That's a staple.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.570
I think that opened up in 2006,
same time as my bar, Cantina,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:22.280
opened.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.530
They opened just a few
months before my place.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.740
AUDIENCE: So from the food
side, I think generally,

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.290
people have talked about
how American pallets have

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.327
become much sweeter, saltier.

00:25:35.327 --> 00:25:36.910
How do you think
that our palates have

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.510
evolved on the alcohol side?

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.990
And are there any flavors
you think that we've

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.497
lost that we should rediscover?

00:25:44.497 --> 00:25:46.080
DUGGAN MCDONNELL:
Hmm, great question.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.955
Thank you for asking.

00:25:46.955 --> 00:25:49.170
So I think that here
in California, we

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:53.510
began with a bright, bitter, and
boozy palate, and we lost it.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.240
And I think that we're actually
in the process of gaining it

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.740
back.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.562
I think that the middle
20th century screwed us up.

00:26:00.562 --> 00:26:04.820
On the food side, everything
was available in a can, right?

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.200
Or it was frozen or
something like that.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.320
And that became true,
not just in food,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.860
by having cans of beans
and meats and vegetables,

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.820
but also with cocktails, right?

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.630
All of a sudden,
everything came in a mix.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.104
And it was some funny color
so, like, the guys in space

00:26:19.104 --> 00:26:20.520
could just grab a
bunch of bottles

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.829
and go have a cocktail party.

00:26:22.829 --> 00:26:24.620
They didn't know there
was a farm anywhere.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.470
And that went on for decades.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.730
And recently, call it
the whole-foods movement

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.110
or some sort of farmers
market, farm-to-glass movement,

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:38.040
if you will-- we're
starting to get this back.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.780
Anytime you put
anything fresh in there,

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.480
it's going to be brighter.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.050
But it's also going to sway.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.090
So because that flavor
is alive, right,

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.750
and it's changing in your glass.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.010
So we're starting to
see cocktails that

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.530
have to be made with precision.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.770
So we're getting better
in our recipes, all right.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.470
Because we have better
access to ingredients, now

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.400
and also, thankfully
to the internet,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.340
we have this access
to information

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.630
like we've never had before.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.470
It used to be you had
to publish a book.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.750
And people had to buy a
book to get great stories

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.500
and great recipes.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.950
That's not true anymore.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.180
You can find a lot of
information on the internet.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.020
And so now, if you
go to your BevMo!

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.490
and your Whole Foods and
you have a smartphone,

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.925
you can make amazing cocktails.

00:27:22.925 --> 00:27:24.300
And that's the
era that we're in.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.290
And so I think we're
regaining that.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.940
I think it's so wild that
kale and arugula is popular.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.350
But then you might think
that it's also wild

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.970
that homemade bitters
and tinctures from bell

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.960
peppers and many other things
are also just as popular.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.430
And I think all of that is
informing our palate, so

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.127
on the plate and in the glass.

00:27:46.127 --> 00:27:47.460
That's where we're at right now.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.859
And I think it's only going to
continue because of this access

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:51.400
that we have.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.430
And I can't imagine going
back into the dark ages

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.350
of a couple decades ago.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:04.170
I grew up thinking that most
green beans came from a can.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.110
How about you?

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.239
AUDIENCE: I grew up in
California, so not so much.

00:28:08.239 --> 00:28:10.030
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: I
grew up in Santa Clara,

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.030
OK, the next county down.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.490
And we had a garden, but a
garden yields, what, couple

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.907
of meals worth?

00:28:18.907 --> 00:28:21.240
Most of the green beans had
a Jolly Green Giant on them.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.820
And there was
commercials about him.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.730
He was my friend.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.050
And that was my
experience with food.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.130
And I think we're never
going to go back there.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.550
I hope, at least.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.530
AUDIENCE: How do
you start creating?

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.170
And what's your approach
to creating a new cocktail?

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.200
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Hmm.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.060
So how do I create
new cocktails?

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.730
Quite honestly, because I've
been thinking about alcohol

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.280
and flavor for
over two decades, I

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.830
have a big bank between
the small space in my ears.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.340
It's all taken up with
boozy flavors and ideas.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.430
And so even if I taste something
new for the first time,

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.430
I can then associate it with
hundreds of other things.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.040
And the ideas
mostly come quickly.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.930
And I don't even
need to make them.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.580
I know what it's going to taste
like ahead of time because I

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.371
do all of the balance
in my head and I know

00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:13.050
the structures and all that.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.760
I'm constantly doing
development like that.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.760
And it's sort of like composing.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.792
I can create the theory
in my head first.

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.750
And then I can make it.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.995
Yeah, that kind of stacks
up to exactly how I thought.

00:29:24.995 --> 00:29:27.840
And I might adjust it by a
quarter or a half ounce, one

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.730
thing or the other,
and it's done.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.570
But again, that's only come
from decades of drinking

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.644
and thinking about drink.

00:29:35.644 --> 00:29:37.935
One of the things that I do,
though, when I'm training.

00:29:37.935 --> 00:29:40.350
And one of the things that
I make all of my staff

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.540
do, and it's the second or third
to last chapter in this book,

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.446
is I talk about the most
important tool behind any bar.

00:29:47.446 --> 00:29:49.760
Can anyone think
about what that is?

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.770
Is it a shaker?

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.670
Is it a muddler?

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.170
Anyone know?

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.380
It's a straw, OK?

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.355
It's the tasting straw.

00:29:56.355 --> 00:29:57.360
And I grab it like this.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.151
And I go like this.

00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:00.380
And I pop it in, and I taste.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.420
And every single time I'm making
a cocktail-- you're my guests,

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.200
you're at my bar, you order
a margarita or a manhattan.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.960
It's the same recipe
I've made 10,000 times.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.290
But I dip and I taste
just to make sure.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.990
I'm not looking to get drunk.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.370
That 16th of an ounce is not
going to hurt me in any way.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.250
But what I'm doing
is always affirming.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.730
But I'm also-- it's
quality control there.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.080
I'm making sure that
something isn't off,

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.960
that the vermouth
hasn't gone bad

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.290
or that perhaps the lime
was too sour, too acidic,

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.699
and I need to adjust.

00:30:31.699 --> 00:30:33.240
Or perhaps I didn't
shake it as long,

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.175
so there's not enough dilution.

00:30:35.175 --> 00:30:36.550
Or enough air
didn't get in there

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.910
to open up the flavors--
all of those things.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.900
So not only have I just
tasted all the bottles

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.480
and tasted a lime
or a pineapple,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.540
but I've tasted these
combinations hundreds

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.830
of thousands of times.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.230
And so I understand
the relationships.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.820
And that's what I would
advocate is to always

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.500
be tasting and thinking.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.734
Have that cognizance.

00:30:54.734 --> 00:30:56.650
AUDIENCE: I have one
more if nobody-- [LAUGHS]

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.500
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Hit me.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.250
AUDIENCE: So on the,
again, going back to,

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.980
like, the food movements,
away from sugar in general,

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.490
but particularly
refined sugar, do

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.480
you see a trend going
that same direction?

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.250
Because sugar's a very
essential component

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.910
of cocktails and balance.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.010
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Hmm.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.800
So talking about
sweeteners, I think

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.310
that we've almost lost corn
syrup in the bar world.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.630
There are certainly-- there's
mixers that still use it.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.440
But those mixers have just
been downgraded so much

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.380
that no one's interested.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.260
We also know how to
make syrups on our own

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.760
now-- it's easy-- with
fruit and sugar and water.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.790
So there's that.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:38.930
There's also 100% cane
movement that's going on.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.780
And then there's many different
types of cane out there

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.240
and processed cane, whether
you're talking about Turbinado

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.680
or finding molasses
or using unbleached.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.410
There's many different
things out there.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.390
And then you have alternate
sugar sources, right.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.430
Within the last
dozen years, we've

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.950
seen an explosion
of agave nectar,

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.920
right, as a sweetener,
which does not give you

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.100
much of a glycemic hit, sort
of more of a steady drip

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.380
into your system, which also
provides a nice sweetening

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.450
viscosity in cocktails.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.890
Specifically, it's
popular now in margaritas,

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:15.966
almost changing that
classic margarita recipe

00:32:15.966 --> 00:32:17.340
from tequila,
lime, and Cointreau

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.109
to tequila, lime,
and agave nectar.

00:32:20.109 --> 00:32:22.650
And that's pretty much the San
Francisco margarita now-- very

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.530
healthy and a lighter style.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.250
And then, of course,
we've got honey.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.240
Folks are-- cocktail bars
now across the country

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.660
are lousy with honey.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.370
And I think that's
a great thing.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.410
You make a honey syrup, and
then you employ that in.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.669
And again, different
sweeteners are coming about.

00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:39.960
Does that answer your question?

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.940
I think that's both
healthier, and it's also

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.950
expanding flavor
possibilities, both of which

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.160
I think are important.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.881
AUDIENCE: So I guess
about a year ago I,

00:32:48.881 --> 00:32:50.880
for the first time, moved
into an apartment that

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.290
actually has room for a bar.

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:54.060
So I've--

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:54.820
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Good for you.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.540
AUDIENCE: --been developing a--

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.220
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: You've
got your priorities right.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.260
AUDIENCE: I got my
priorities right, yeah.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.590
So for the first time,
now I have sort of a bar.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.080
And I've got 20 to 30
bottles or something.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.160
But I'm wondering,
how do you look

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.670
about developing a home bar?

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.240
What are the things that
you look for to expand it

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.970
or the tools that you want or--

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:10.830
DUGGAN MCDONNELL:
Great question--

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.788
expanding the home bar.

00:33:11.788 --> 00:33:14.230
What an important thing, right?

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.230
There's books out there.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.200
I think there's one
that just came out

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.910
called "The 12 Bottle Bar."

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.530
So perhaps buy that one.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.389
There's a lot of blogs
out there on that.

00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:22.930
But essentially, I
think you probably

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.860
need to have one of each of
the major spirit categories

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.450
out there.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:33.950
But finding that bottle can
be a difficult thing, OK.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.930
And, say, when you're
judging your vodka,

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.340
don't judge it by cracking
it, pouring it neat,

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.549
lukewarm in the glass, and
then drinking it like that

00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:43.090
because that's never
how you're going

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.350
to drink your vodka, right?

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.002
So you want to
basically road test it.

00:33:47.002 --> 00:33:48.460
And that's one of
the things that I

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:54.100
share in the book is that
there wasn't one gin or whisky

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.540
or vodka or even
tequila, et cetera,

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.660
that I was always
entirely satisfied.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.540
You would reach for
one gin for a Negroni.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.150
And then you'd reach for another
one for, say, an Aviation.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.500
What I started doing
is creating blends.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.900
So as I have all of these
different opportunities

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.760
in-- because that's
what I call the bottles.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.260
I call them
opportunities behind me.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.440
I said, OK, I'm going
to bring them together.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.280
So then I would create
these master blends

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.240
that I would keep
in the speed well

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.940
at the bar that would have four
different types of gin in it.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.320
And then I would have this
master cocktail spirit

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.929
based upon these blends
and my years of experience

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:27.739
of blending.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:32.300
And then, aha, every gin drink
that I ever made was awesome.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.449
So if you want to do that,
like, if you're a gin nerd,

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:38.870
then buy the four
bottle that I prescribe.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.500
And make the blends, and see
if all of your gin cocktails

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.900
turn out perfect.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.400
AUDIENCE: How would
you characterize

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.170
the art of bartending
in this country today?

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.699
DUGGAN MCDONNELL: Wow, the
art of bartending today.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:58.810
I'm going to actually say that
the art has started to slip.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.405
And it's actually
going into a realm

00:35:00.405 --> 00:35:02.220
where it's just
craft and discipline.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.560
And I think that that's OK.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.830
I think that we got
overwhelmed with art.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.670
And now there's so many
options-- so many bottles,

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.420
as I've been talking
about, so many things

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.100
that my concern, Mike, in how
I'm answering this question

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.370
is that I hope that
mixologists are not

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.300
staring into their
navels, more concerned

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.480
by the three different
types of bitters that

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.570
are going into the
cocktails and the hand

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.440
carving of an ice
for an old fashioned

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.520
or where their local
Meyer lemons are

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.230
sourced because that's
really not what it's about.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.590
I think that cocktails
should be artfully made.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:44.960
But ultimately, I still
hope that people go to bars

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.780
to get laid and to
have a great time

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.468
and to forget and to
cope with gentrification

00:35:51.468 --> 00:35:55.760
and to wake up with a hangover
in the morning and be proud.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.510
And I hope that this
cocktail Renaissance does not

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.740
screw all that up for us because
cocktails should, frankly,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.570
still equal a great time.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.660
And so in spite of
all my pontificating

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:12.110
and my seriousness about
where our palates come

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.340
from in this community in
this part of the world,

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.290
I still believe that,
frankly, a cocktail

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.240
needs to be a great time.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.790
And hopefully, it'll
be a balanced one.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.870
Thank you.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.125
