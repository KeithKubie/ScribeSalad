Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, but the celebrity aspect of basketball is so huge. And like in baseball, not baseball. I can't, yeah, you're a rod and it's still theirs. But five, 10 min, Max, 10 guys on the court. And if you do anything cameras right on your face. Yeah. Versus you. Here's the thing about baseball. This was pointed out to me, the website deadspin did this thing where they were like pointing out the problem with baseball today. They went around, they ask people, Hey, can you name what's the most famous baseball player that you could name? And people were like, Derek Jeter, a rod, big Papi, Manny, Manny Ramirez, retired guys. And if you ask people they could match. If they're a baseball fan, they'd say, someone from my team, or maybe they'd say Mike Trout or they'd say one of the guys on the Yankees. Right. But there is no a rod [inaudible] like level celebrity right now.

Speaker 1:          00:44          What happened? I don't know exactly. I can't. I'm steroids given back the steroids. No one's getting hurt. What the fuck is the problem? We're not talking about fighting, we're talking about baseball. Give him the steroids. The best part about that stupid games with someone hits the ball. Does the steroids make them hit the ball better? Yes. Okay. We'll give it to him. Yeah. The fuck are you guys doing testing for that? Performance enhancing drugs, man are the craziest the debate about that. We've never done this on the show because I, so I'm not like, um, you shouldn't fully boned up. I would like to, I've thought about it in the past cause cause the, the divisions, it's like the rest of the drug war, right? The divisions we make between the things that are acceptable and not acceptable are so arbitrary. Right? So the example I always use is like, okay, why don't, why don't we like it?

Speaker 1:          01:29          Performance enhancing drugs. Not everyone has access to them. So they're unfair. Right. There are bad for your health and we think they're on natural. Right. Okay. So yeah, they're, yeah, they're cheating. Yeah. Well those are the reasons why we think they're cheating. Right? Well it's also, but there's some drugs you can take that aren't cheating. Right? Like you could take advantage is the reason why it's cheating. That's the primary reason. So here's, so let me give you a counter example. Um, uh, for runners, right? Uh, for endurance athletes, like I like running, I'm a shitty runner, but I like it. I think it's a fun sport. Um, so I follow it a little bit. Uh, so runners, endurance, you know, the big thing is like how much you're, how much oxygen your blood can hold, right? If you train at a high altitude, then you can increase that.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Right? So there are these runners, the American runners, right? They live at a high altitude, they live super high up, you know, in Colorado or whatever. Right? And then when they're not there, they train. They're all year round. They buy a place there. And then when they're not there, when they're competing somewhere else, they sleep in a chamber that simulates low altitude. Right. How is that not the same thing as taking a performance enhancing drug? Like they, they, you know, that's not a, it's not illegal to do that. Right? Right. It's unnatural, right? It is an unfair advantage because not everybody can afford one of those chambers. And I'm not gonna say it's bad for your health. I don't know. But it's certainly as weird for your body is taking a drug I would think. Right. So why it's not. Why do we draw the line? Cause it's only like living it out to two. It's really just simulates low out. So it's not like taking the CEO EPO, which would be the drug that would simulate that which I've got recent experience with. Not Personally, but

Speaker 2:          03:00          because of the UFC just had one of its champions stripped because of testing positive for EPO and then we're just finding out now they don't test for EPO and everybody that it's very expensive and so they do it based on the athlete's biological passport and what they think are changing variables that you know, for whatever reason it triggers their, their interest and they start testing. Additionally, it's a big deal to, it's a, it's a serious drug. I mean it's a serious endurance drug but also has like some serious health complications. People have died from taking it. A young guys in their twenties in cycling have gotten strokes and died from EPO, but there's no health negative effects of sleeping at altitude. It's just, couldn't you afford to live there? Can you uproot your life? No. If you can't, yeah, it's an advantage for that person over you.

Speaker 2:          03:49          So I'm just saying we, we have, uh, we have sort of an are like, yeah, it's sort of an arbitrary w where we're drawing the lines is not consistent and it's kind of one that is a big one. Does that in terms of uh, the impact on endurance, it is a big one. They actually saying now that they think the best, um, best course of strategy is to train at low altitude and then sleep at high altitude. They think that when you train at low altitude, you have more output. So you're putting in more repetitions because you get more oxygen so you have more work and then you get the same effect by living at [inaudible]. So you get, you'd get up there and sleep and you don't have to train up there. And if you train up there, it's actually slightly less valuable than training at low altitude and staying up there damn cause whatever.

Speaker 2:          04:33          I'm whenever, whenever I'm stands in more high alto like I just did a weekend in Denver and I was like going on a run up there and it was like obviously torture compared to like being here in la but I was like oh I'm getting strong cause I'm running at high altitude. That's not true. That really fucks with me. Well you just really simple for me. Thank you. It's work. It will help you but it's if you are a net like athletes or we're literally working for one or 2% of an advantage occasionally on many occasions when you are living at high altitude and training at sea level, they think that that gives you a slight advantage because you can put more work in, especially for fighters. They think that skill work and repetitions and drilling is one of the most important aspects of it and you can just simply get in more repetitions.

Speaker 2:          05:21          You get in more drills. Yeah. But they, you know, again though, you're right, cause this is sort of a performance enhancing thing. You're not just living and just being yourself and then showing up and competing. You are engaging in this activity that re significantly raises your red blood cells, significantly raises your oxygen capacity, Changes Your Cardio, your vo two Max changes. No. Here's, here's the weird thing is just this, there's this weird idea in sports and look, you know shit love more about athlete athletics. Cause then I do, it's not my, it's not my real forte but I do, I do enjoy. And the thing that's always weird to me is that

Speaker 1:          05:58          we have this idea that like there's some kind of level playing field that the, there's this like baseline human that we can just say, well you've got to be at the baseline. Right? Yeah. And humans are so variable. You're always going to find these weird cases. And when you try to adjudicate it gets really weird. Like, do you know about, you know, Castro's Romania? Do you know who she is? No. Uh, no. I do know this story, this story pisses me off so much. So she's a, she's not a marathoner. She's a middle distance runner. I believe she's south, South African. Um, she's like the best in the world at the 200 meters. You know, I actually got to see her because, uh, my, uh, uh, I went to the Prefontaine classic in Eugene, Oregon with my dad to like watch the big track meet, you know, best in the world.

Speaker 1:          06:37          People, this is like a Olympics, you know, not qualifier, but it's like the Olympic caliber athletes saw her. She's incredible. Just like one of the best in the world. She's got, um, a, uh, uh, she, her whole life has faced accusations that she, uh, that her, that she's a man basically, um, because she has like an elevated level of testosterone and this is their natural body. Right? And so she's had to deal with people saying, oh, we gotta, we gotta do a, do a sex check on you, which is humiliating and like, also completely unscientific, you know, like, what, what are they going to do? Um, and, uh, like a sex check. We want to look at her genitals. Well, here's the weird thing, man, is that, yeah, they want to look at her genitals, first of all, which is humiliating to have that happen.

Speaker 1:          07:18          If you're an athlete, you're like, people have to be in the room. This is, this is the problem, right? How do you judicate that? Right? Right. And also, there's such a thing, I don't know anything about her personal situation, right. There's such a thing as Intersex people, right? Where when you look at their genitals, you can't tell. It's not like, hey, just look at their junk. And you can tell, right. This is a real phenomenon. Like 1% of people are Intersex, right? [inaudible] hi. Uh, I, I was speaking off the top of my head, but it's higher than you think. You know, it's definitely hard. It's a non zero number of people, right? Intersex people are a real thing. Um, and so, uh, so, but so she got past that, right? They stopped challenging whether she was like a man or a woman. They did it, but it was on toast center.

Speaker 1:          07:56          Uh, I think you might be right. Yeah. Um, but so she's, she's had to deal with that. That's not fair, right? She's a physical outlet. She's a physical outlier. And now the IAF, which is the organization that runs all, it's like FIFA for track, right? They run all track. They have tried to put forward a rule. I don't know what the status is right now because it's being challenged, but, um, they've tried to put forward a rule that says if you have a testosterone level over a certain amount, you have to take a hormone changing clothes to change your hormones and she's going to fall under that. And so they literally want to change the body that she was born with because they're saying your body is unfair to her. How fucked up is that? Right? It's crazy. It's really, really fucked up. And, and so the thing is, when we make those decisions about what's fair and what's not fair, there's no baseline. Human is always a value judgment. And when we're excluding some people, that's almost all, we always need to look at that and say, are we discriminating? They're definitely discriminating against Castro, Romania. And is this the IOC? That's what does doing this. I A F, which is the IOC is the Olympics. IAV Olympics aren't doing this, so they don't have an issue with her. I don't know what the Olympic policy is. The Olympics is fucked up. We do a whole episode on the Olympics. The Olympics is fucked up in a lot of ways too.
