JONATHAN BERI: This session
we're going to talk about the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.135
Hangouts API and how far the
Hangouts platform has come

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:12.170
over the year.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.800
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.510
My name is Jonathan
Beri, and I'm a

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.032
developer advocate on Google+.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:22.410
If you have questions about
Hangouts, Hangout apps, or any

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.630
other of the Google+ platform
features, please add me to

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.570
your circles.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.530
That's the best way to ask
me questions and start a

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.930
conversation.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.290
Today's agenda, we're going to
talk about several things,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.520
starting with what is
the Hangouts API.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.640
For those of you who've never
seen the Hangouts API, I'll

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.020
give you an overview of the
features, why should you as

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.280
developers build Hangout apps on
top of the API; go through

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.170
a bit of history to show where
we've come and where we're

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.760
going; talk about the API
itself, how you can use it;

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.710
and then finish off with
the future, where

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.849
we're going as a platform.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.670
Just a quick poll, how
many people have

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.920
never been in a Hangout?

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.650
All right, so we have some
people who are making jokes in

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.200
the front, Alan.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.060
How many people have used
a Hangout App before?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.010
The mustache, most of you.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.070
Great.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.720
So what's the Hangouts API?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.460
Well, this is the effects app
that we ship with Google+, and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.660
it's a Hangout app.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.966
And fundamentally a Hangout app
is an application that you

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:40.400
as a developer can build that is
integrated into the Hangout

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.700
experience.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.790
It's something you
can control.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.910
It's something that you can
create new experiences around.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.350
And we as Google integrate that
for users, and they can

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.780
quickly and easily add that
to their conversation.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.990
The pieces are very simple.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.010
There's two major parts.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.890
It's JavaScript and HTML.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.690
It's regular code that we build
for the web, that you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.960
can either have Google host
or you can host yourself.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.734
And it's the APIs that we extend
on top of the Hangout

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:12.000
app to allow you to more deeply
integrate with the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.495
overall video experience.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.860
At the lowest level, a Hangout
app is just an iFramed app

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.330
that we shove into a Hangout.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.080
So this is a mantra we like to
use around the platform team,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.800
anything you can do
it in an iFrame

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.070
you can do in a Hangout.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.140
So that opens up the
possibilities of the types of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.710
applications you can build.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.870
Because it's an iFrame
you can also host

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.860
it on your own servers.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.710
So you can use whatever back-end
services you want,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.520
whether it be Node or Python,
App Engine, Go.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.770
You can use any database
you'd like, MySQL,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.100
NoSQL, your SQL, whatever.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.900
You can use the existing
technologies that you're

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.180
comfortable with to build
Hangout applications.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.220
So why would you want to
build Hangout apps?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.170
If you're building apps today
for the web, you can bring

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.950
those applications into a
multi-user video experience

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.910
that's real-time with
high engagement.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.840
So if you have a standard
application that's really

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.270
useful, let's say in a
collaborative sense, that it's

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.910
valuable to have a shared
activity, bringing that to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.510
Hangout lets you build on top of
that platform and add video

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.240
and real-timeness for free.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.130
And it's built on top of
Google+, so you have that

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.100
social network that can connect
users in a seamless,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.060
integrated way.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.540
There's also another type of app
that's really exciting for

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.640
you as developers, and that is
to enhance the conversation.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.150
Typically video chat platforms
may allow you to customize

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.510
some things, but with Hangout
apps you can actually tailor

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.760
the experience for the
type of conversations

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.810
users want to have.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.280
Here's a screenshot of an
application called Hangout

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.150
Toolbox that allows you to see
who's talking and control

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.660
volumes of all the speakers
and configure how the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.310
conversation can flow.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.090
And you can use this for
broadcast scenarios or just

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.350
one-on-one with your
colleagues.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.810
Let's talk a little bit about
history, especially for those

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.750
who may not have built
Hangout apps before.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.750
Here's a timeline of the
Hangout apps journey.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.510
It all started in late 2011
when Google+ launched.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.620
We didn't have apps, but Google+
Hangouts shipped with

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.290
a built-in application, the
YouTube application, that

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.910
allowed users to watch a video
together as if you're on the

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.276
couch, even if you're millions
of miles away.

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.980
You're not millions--
maybe thousands.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.980
But it sparked something
at Google.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.720
This is the type of experiences
that we want

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.970
developers to build.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.180
So we started working on
the Hangouts platform.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.950
And we launched and developed
our preview in early 2012.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.800
And from here on out we started
adding new features to

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.770
unlock new types of
applications.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.590
The first applications that we
built was the Effects app.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.260
And it was neat.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.480
It's fun.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.320
It allows you to integrate
little animations, overlays,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.590
within the video stream.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.840
It's very simple, fits on the
side of the screen, but it

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.010
sparked conversation.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.150
Wearing a mustache or a snorkel,
as silly as it

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.560
sounds, can just start a whole
new thread of ideas.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.290
And people at work are
using this to maybe

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.650
offload a little bit.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.720
And we saw these types of
applications being built from

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.320
the early days.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.530
A few months later we went
to general availability.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.500
That means developers could
actually ship their

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.370
applications to all
Google+ users.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.790
One of the first launched
apps was Scoot &amp; Doodle.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.380
It was built fully on the
application platform, and it

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.530
allowed people to
draw together.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.240
You think about how simple
that is to do

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.820
in your daily lives.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.810
You're at your table with your
niece or your daughter and you

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.210
want to draw together.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.950
That's great, but what
if you're traveling?

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.920
Scoot &amp; Doodle allowed you to
connect, even if you're in a

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.410
hotel room in Tokyo while your
kid's about to go sleep, and

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.020
draw something together.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.390
And this app uses different
features of the platform, like

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.980
those overlays we saw that
were a mustache.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.390
They used this part to show
the crayon you're using.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.180
They also use the real-time APIs
that we built into the

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.830
platform to have the smooth
drawing experience seamlessly

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.090
with that fun video piece.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.620
Then last year, I/O, I was on
a stage talking about how

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.780
Hangout apps have evolved,
and it was amazing.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.510
We had even more apps built on
the platform, more engaging

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.450
types of conversations being
spunoff off these apps.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.470
Here's another example that we
unlocked with another release.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.840
This is called "Donut Horns."
It was built by one of our

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.400
friends at an agency.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.490
And at I/O we announced a facial
movement recognition

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.740
API, similar to the overlay,
that just sticks to your face

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.270
with a simple API.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.130
This allowed you to build
interactive demos like this,

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.820
where you could become a unicorn
and catch falling

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.100
doughnuts, clearly something you
want to do at I/O. That's

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.690
silly and fun, but this opens
up a whole new class of

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.940
applications, whether it be a
game like this or things for

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.860
accessibility and helping you
communicate and control

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.900
real-time interactive media.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.280
And as we move forward we
released more and more APIs,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.300
and the platform matured
and grew further.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.770
For example, we launched a app
called Cameraman to enhance

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.870
the broadcast controls to enable
Hangouts on the air to

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.160
have a controllable experience
for those producers.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.750
And then we exposed the API to
allow you to control who is in

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.750
or not in the Hangout.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.060
We also had regular releases
improving the user experience

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.630
of Hangouts themselves to bring
Hangout apps to the

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.080
forefront of the conversation.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.150
And we're still shipping today,
still improving on the

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.360
platform and making progress,
adding new features, and

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.215
unlocking new potential
in the applications.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.970
So let's talk a little bit about
the actual API, a code

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.110
you can write, a way
you can integrate.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.419
The API is built on five
very simple principles.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.140
And these are methods that you
can invoke, events that you

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.950
can listen to and respond to, to
make your apps interactive

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.650
and seamlessly integrate with
the video experience.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.380
These are just quick names,
but around people, the

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.470
real-time APIs, the video
effects themselves, and more

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.420
information about the Hangouts
to tailor the UI.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.670
Let's walk through
a few examples.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.220
Because this is a social
experience, a conversation,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.430
the most important API is the
one that's around people.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.900
So I have a series of
participant APIs that allow

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.400
you to know who's in the
Hangout, who's just joined the

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.320
Hangout, who's leaving the
Hangout, so you can make your

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.940
applications respond to those
events and integrate their

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.010
social identity to make it
a personal experience.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.800
Here's a screenshot of
Hangout Toolbox.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.450
When somebody joins the Hangout
you can see who they

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.570
are and control their
speaking volume.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.870
If somebody has a booming voice
you can turn it down.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.860
And if somebody's too soft
you can bump it up.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.540
Another core class of APIs
is the real-timeness.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.790
Hangouts themselves are
real-time and spontaneous.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.790
If Richard is in a Hangout
and I see him, I'll want

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.715
to join with him.

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:43.310
It happens naturally.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.480
So you have APIs around this
real-timeness of the Hangouts

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.180
themselves that you can
integrate into your

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.350
application.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.920
And we provide APIs as well that
allow you to add another

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.050
level of real-time
responsiveness.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.910
Again with Scoot &amp; Doodle, they
use a series of APIs that

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.800
we collectively call the
real-time APIs to draw the

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.430
points that the user
is drawing and then

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.260
smoothly show the path.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.890
This is used for games,
like a "Donut Horn,"

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.350
or a foosball game.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.780
And just like the Hangouts, you
can make your applications

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.380
responsive in real time.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.265
And the last class of APIs is
around the video, manipulating

00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:28.720
the stream, adding the overlays
for fun and for

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.900
actual effectiveness.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.140
Again, this is a combination of
a bunch of APIs, but they

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.010
overlay using the face-tracking
API.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.450
The unicorn horn--

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.370
the unicorn game doesn't
actually have to write the

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.150
code to figure out where your
face is and stick it on.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.255
They just attach image to what
we call a face, and the

00:10:48.255 --> 00:10:49.930
Hangout tracks it for you.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.940
They have balloons in the
background that move up and

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.960
down, simulating a floating
balloon, using another API.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.850
And then, of course, the facial
recognition API-- the

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.340
application can know where the
face is on the page and then

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.700
make the animation
respond to it.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.220
These are just a few ways
to use the same APIs.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.880
Now a little bit about
the future.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.910
Richard Dunn here is to talk
more about where we're going.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.200
RICHARD DUNN: Hey guys,
I'm Richard Dunn.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.750
I'm the lead engineer for
the Hangouts API.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.880
And Johnson just filled you in a
little bit of the history of

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.930
how the API got started
and the basics.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.400
And I get to do the fun
stuff, the demos.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.150
And those of you that have
been with us from the

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.830
beginning will appreciate a lot
of the stuff that we've

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.930
done here, just trying to work
out the kinks, make everything

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.180
work a little better.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.520
Where is the platform headed?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.090
What do we want to
do in the future?

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.940
And how do we want to make the
experience easier for you to

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.130
develop against and really try
to get a lot of good Hangout

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.640
applications going?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.190
Jonathan talked a lot about the
progress we've made over

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.770
the last year and a half.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.620
I feel like we've released
a lot of rich APIs.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.800
We've tried to cover all the new
features in Hangouts with

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.290
APIs so that you guys can build
the types of experiences

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.400
that we either haven't thought
of yet or haven't had the time

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.770
to work out.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.960
I think the volume control is a
really good example of that.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.990
You guys wanted to be able
to adjust that, and

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.480
you guys wrote it.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.440
So what do we want
to do from here?

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.090
The first thing we want to do is
really focus on faster and

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.510
more flexible releases.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.870
If you've followed along, we've
made regular updates to

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.640
the platform.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.070
But I think that in a lot of
cases that was driven by us,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.290
and we want to fix it so that
it's driven by you more and

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.270
that we get stuff out as
soon as it's ready.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.630
So we're always sitting there
coding new APIs, and we want

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.590
to make sure that
they're in your

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.170
hands as fast as possible.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.680
And as I said, we really want
to get your feedback.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.100
So we want to be building APIs
based on the kind of things

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.336
you guys want to build
applications on.

00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:10.120
We want to hear from you about
what the APIs should look

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.080
like, to just make it easier
for you to write your

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.810
applications.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.800
And we want you to test stuff
out that we want to try out

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.280
and let us know how it works.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.950
And of course, we're Google.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.410
We always want to release
cool stuff.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.130
So we're going to
keep doing that.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.510
Let's talk about the first thing
we're going to do that

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:33.190
enables us to release
things faster.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.640
So for those of you that have
been following along, we've

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.070
had a series of versions.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.400
And as of today we're actually
going to switch to a new model

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.390
for releasing API.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.310
Anyone that's familiar with
Chrome knows that Chrome uses

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.350
sort of a channel model where
you can follow a stable and a

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.740
beta channel and that
kind of thing.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.230
And within those channels
things are just pushed

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.030
automatically.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.680
So we're going to do that.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.460
No more versions.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.970
Instead of batching up APIs
and releasing them in a

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.550
particular version, we're just
going to have one channel, and

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.900
it'll go ahead and update
automatically with all the new

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.960
stuff we come out with.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.900
So this is going to be
the stable channel.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.600
We're going to have
a stable channel.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.420
If you've written an app before,
you know it's just

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.640
basically a single JavaScript
include.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.720
We've changed it a little bit.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.520
You'll notice there's no real
version number in here.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.250
So when we release new stuff,
it'll just automatically come

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.540
into this channel.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.950
The stable API is what you're
going to be using in all of

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.670
your public applications.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.900
It's going to have the APIs
that we've very thoroughly

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.220
tested and run by and
made sure that

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.710
everyone is happy with.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.430
So this is the stuff that
we're very confident.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:56.510
So far we've essentially made
all stable releases, so just

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.950
imagine that continuing but
on a faster schedule.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.060
The fun new stuff, though, is
we're actually introducing a

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.240
second channel, which is
a developer channel.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.640
And this is where we're going to
have basically use this as

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.460
a playground for new features.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.010
This is where we're going to
put stuff that we have

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.350
developed internally but
maybe isn't quite

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.270
ready for prime time.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.140
This is where we'll release new
APIs initially so that you

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.040
guys can give us feedback on do
they look right, do they do

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.230
all the things that you
want to do, is it too

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.400
complicated, et cetera.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.340
This will be for non-public
applications.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.010
So if anyone's familiar with
developing, you can set your

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.610
app to be public.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.290
This for your private
applications.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.590
This is for you to
play around with.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.460
As I said, everything's not
ready for prime time.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.630
It's going to be a little bit of
the Wild West in there, but

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.180
I think you guys will
have fun with it.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.760
But on that note, we want you
to actually be using these

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.800
private applications and testing
them out and trying to

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.370
use them in real world.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.040
So also today we're going to
announce a new developer

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.550
experience.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.020
Anyone that's developed a
Hangout app knows that we have

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.550
this isolated sandbox that
you run in right now.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.960
That's where you run your
developed apps.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.920
It's a little bit wonky.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.440
You can't invite people,
it's not related to

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.010
post, things like that.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.300
A lot of Hangout app developers
are also very

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.630
active in Hangouts.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.010
So there's this disconnect
between the apps they're

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.350
developing and the Hangouts
they're in.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.130
So we're going to introduce
a new developer experience

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.420
that's going to let you
run your private

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.310
apps in regular Hangouts.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.120
And I'm just going to go ahead
and demo that, so bear with me

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.370
a little bit here.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.360
If I go into a Hangout--

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.460
and everyone's familiar with
the basic UX here.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.270
I've got some apps on
the left, et cetera.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.970
And if I go into our app
picker, you'll see the

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.770
featured and recent tabs.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.319
And what we've added is
this developer tab.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.109
Anyone that's been in the
sandbox has seen this.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:14.460
And if I go into that, this'll
actually list the apps that

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.900
I'm currently developing.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.650
So I just put in one of our
sample apps as a test here.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.810
And you can see that I can load
it, and I have, at the

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.510
top, the familiar
developer bar.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.410
This lets me do stuff
like reload the

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.720
app, reset the state.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.930
This is great if you're just
sitting there hacking the

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.380
JavaScript.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.720
Really lets you figure it out.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.890
I'm just going to go ahead and
start another application real

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.270
quick, for the sake
of the demo.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.450
OK, so I'm just in a Hangout.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.270
I've got a regular public
app, doesn't have

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.720
any developer tools.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.720
I have an app that I'm working
on, has the developer tools.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.180
And let's go ahead and
get somebody in this

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.400
Hangout with me.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.180
I'm just going to Hangout
with myself, because

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.430
that's always fun.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:10.020
And when my other half comes
in, we can see that I'm

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.410
running the public app, the
effects app, but I don't see

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.190
my developed app.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.580
So the developed apps are run
privately within the Hangout.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.510
So this is great if you're
just wanting

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.990
to test it out yourself.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.170
It's not really ready, but you
just want to play around with

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.260
the app in a real-world
environment.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.120
You get real people in there.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.050
But of course, that's no fun.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.680
You want to test it with
real people as well.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.200
So what we've added is another
button to the developer

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.920
toolbar, which allows you
to share the app.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.300
And what this is going to do
is basically give everyone

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.830
else in the Hangout with you a
one-time pass to play around

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.480
with this app.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.290
So as long as they're still in
the Hangout with you, they can

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.160
see the app, they can
interact with it.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.860
They move on to another Hangout,
they don't have it.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.260
So basically this is great
for beta testing.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.480
You can get your developers
in there.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.990
If anyone's done this before,
you have this weird thing

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.650
where you had to add
people to the teams

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.630
and things like that.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.640
We're just making it easier.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.280
So let me just demonstrate.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.950
You can see on the left, I can
still see only that I'm in the

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.660
public effects app.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.660
But if I as the developer hit
Share App here, now everyone

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.540
else in the Hangout
can see it.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.910
And they go in, and they can
run the app as normal.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.370
We are going to put up a little
warning, just to make

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.990
sure that the other side knows
that this is a developed app,

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.010
it's maybe not ready for
prime time, et cetera.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:41.370
But as soon as they click
through they can run it.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.250
Come on.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.030
All right, well, let's not
worry too much about it.

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.270
But let's assume that's
going to load.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.520
There we go.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.500
The demo gods are not
smiling on me.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.880
You get the general
idea, though.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.230
They'll be able to see the app
just like everyone else.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.860
Let's go back to there.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.890
That's our new developer
experience.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.400
Just to sum up, no
more sandbox.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.040
We're actually going to end
up retiring the sandbox.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.160
We'll give you a little time
to get used to the new

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.130
experience, but basically just
going to retire it and move to

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.100
this model.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.110
And you'll just, as you're
developing apps, develop them

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.440
in regular Hangouts.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.690
Obviously you can just be in a
Hangout with yourself and play

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.470
around with it in there, but
if you want to bring other

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.570
people into it, see how it works
in the real world, or

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:32.160
even share it with them, you
can run it privately or you

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.120
can share with others
in your Hangout.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.493
So that's our new developer
experience.

00:20:36.493 --> 00:20:40.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.520
RICHARD DUNN: I can see some
of the veterans in the room

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.780
are happy with that.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.280
So we have this new
channel model.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.570
We're giving you new stuff.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.800
And I wouldn't want to give you
new stuff without actually

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.530
giving you new stuff, so we
also have some new APIs to

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.580
announce today in both the
stable channel and the

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.170
developer channel.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.780
So let's start with the
stable channel.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.800
Jonathan pointed out that one
class of apps that really

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.280
helps is these enhancement apps,
the things the tend to

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.870
run in the sidebar that set the
experience of the Hangout

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.360
the way you want it.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.300
Things like effects, things like
volume control, things

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.450
like, anyone that's watched an
HOA, the very popular Lower

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.750
Thirds application that lets me
show a title, these are the

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.260
kinds of things that a lot of
people there are in a lot of

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.420
Hangouts are just bringing
up every time

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.580
they go into a Hangout.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.570
So why should you actually
have to click on

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.110
that app to run it?

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.200
Why don't we just
load it for you?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.350
We're introducing a new API
today to let the app autoload

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.380
itself whenever you
go into a Hangout.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.630
So let's demo that.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.120
I'm going to get out
of this Hangout.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.260
This is the Hangout Toolbox.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.950
Anyone that's familiar with
this, it's basically a bunch

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.000
of utility things.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.070
And one of the more--

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.370
I'm going to go ahead
and close this--

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.730
popular ones is the
Lower Third.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:14.195
So here, if you've watched the
news, I can set a lower third

00:22:14.195 --> 00:22:18.200
that gives my name, what
I do, et cetera.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.240
This is great if you're just
coming into a Hangout, maybe

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.190
you're with strangers, you want
to give them a little bit

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.210
of an update as to
who you are.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.370
And as I said, it's great on
an HOA where you don't

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:33.100
necessarily have the context
of seeing who's in there.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.420
We've added a new option that
lets an application set itself

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.380
to be auto-loaded.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.470
So they've updated their app
here to enable that.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.420
And I can actually
click this on.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.900
And when I click this on, I'll
get a little warning that lets

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.880
me know that this is going to
auto-load the next time I

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.490
want, I can undo it, all
that kind of thing.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:23:07.830
But if I did really want this
and I go into another Hangout,

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.040
it has already started.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.800
And in fact, you can see
that my Lower Third

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.190
popped up as well.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.200
I'm going to give a little shout
out to the Drive team,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.620
who has a new API for
application data.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.860
And I think this is a great
way to basically let an

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.310
application store, say,
a config file.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.400
And what they've done with
Toolbox is say, we'll store

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.670
your Lower Thirds.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.950
And when you auto-start, we'll
actually auto-turn-on your

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:32.540
Lower Thirds.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.350
So anyone that's done a
lot of HOAs is going

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.300
to love this feature.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.190
We really encourage anyone
that's doing an enhancement

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.090
app that they think would be
useful to run in every Hangout

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.850
to turn this on.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.700
And we'd love to see a lot more
of these kind of tools

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.100
that let you shape the
experience of a Hangout.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.930
To sum up, you can now set
your app to auto-load.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:03.150
The user will confirm that
this is what they want.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.400
You might want to look into
some of the Drive stuff.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.040
And I encourage you go to some
of the Drive talks to see how

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.510
you might make that experience
as seamless as possible.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.940
You could even imagine hiding
the app when it comes up and

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.890
knows exactly what
it wants to do.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.470
And this is really allowing you
to set your Hangout the

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.420
way you want it.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.880
So that's going to be in
the stable channel.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.790
So that'll actually be available
for public apps

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.040
immediately.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.640
In the developer channel
we basically have

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.280
a set of new effects.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.950
And I think that these effects
are fairly exciting.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.780
But they still need some
tweaking, so that's why we're

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.640
putting them in the developer
channel and we're letting you

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.650
take a look at them, use them
out, and give us feedback on

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:52.980
how they're working.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.680
Let me demonstrate
two of those.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.220
I'll leave this Hangout.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.400
The first one, for those of you
that are familiar with our

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.950
facial tracking, should come
as an expected evolution of

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:13.770
that, and that is
hand tracking.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:19.290
Oh, that's not good.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.720
Oh, actually, I know exactly
what's happening there.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.640
Does anyone want to sit here
and wait while I fix it?

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.900
I think we can fix it.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.760
Why don't I skip to the
other one while

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.010
I'm fixing it, though?

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.460
Actually, I'll just
talk through it.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.450
Hand tracking, I think it's
fairly straightforward.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.640
We've had facial tracking
for quite a while.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.850
So you've had the ability to
see the face, see points on

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:55.690
the face, track them along,
put the overlays on top.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.300
Jonathan mentioned
the Effects app.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:01.490
We've had the snorkel mask
and let that do it.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.580
But you can also actually
track the face.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.430
So if you want to write your
own game logic or whatever

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.690
that deals with that, you can.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.120
And so we've added
this for hands.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.920
So now if I hold my hand up, we
can actually identify the

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.000
center of the hand and track the
hand as you're doing it.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.290
So you could imagine writing
applications where somebody

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.270
raises their hand to answer a
question and the app actually

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.730
automatically picks up that
they've raised their

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.070
hand, and does that.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.370
Or we had an application
released that was ping pong

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.180
with your face.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.930
And as fun as it is to play ping
pong with your face, I

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.950
think you probably would rather
play it with your hand.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:40.510
So let's do that.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.460
OK, So that's one
of the effects.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.880
And the other one, I know that
the tech guys here were very

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.890
excited about, and that's
background replacement.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.550
We're still playing around with
this, but if anyone's

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.460
familiar with this, I'm sick
of being at I/O and I would

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.740
rather be on a beach.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.580
So I can just go ahead
and select something,

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.810
and I'm on a beach.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.140
Obviously you can see it's a
little raw with picking up.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.130
We've actually got this slider
in the app here that plays

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.970
around with how much of the
background it picks up.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.180
This is why we want to put it
in the developer channel.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.410
We want to have you
guys try it out.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.050
There's a lot of knobs to tweak,
and we'd like you guys

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:30.250
to build apps around it, get
people to play with those, see

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.990
what things work, what
things don't.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.220
We'll have general background
replacement where I can just

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.530
replace the background behind
me with any image, and then

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.960
kind of a cool feature that's
background blur, where it

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.310
really just blurs out the
back very subtly and

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.560
focuses on your face.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.070
RICHARD DUNN: I can.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.890
Let me go back.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.000
Yeah, I should've done that.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.250
I apologize.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.350
Let's do that.

00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:07.630
There you go.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.660
It's a little better.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.990
We noticed this yesterday.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.200
For some reason, under the
lights my forehead tends to

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.070
wash out pretty well.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.330
But you see I can actually
adjust down how much it thinks

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.540
is background and
how much isn't.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.230
And you can get pretty good.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.940
Obviously this works better in
certain situations, like

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.460
against a solid background,
that kind of thing.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.040
But again, we really want you
guys to play around with this,

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.990
let us know under what
conditions it works good, and

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.635
what you think you
can do with it.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.610
Those are the effects, hand
tracking, background

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.830
replacement, and background
blur.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.330
Please try them out, please play
around with them, and let

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.810
us know what works,
what doesn't.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.840
And this is where we're really
going to try and use the

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.520
developer channel.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.430
We want to hear the
feedback from you.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:29:00.210
And we want to change the API to
look the right way, adjust

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.610
the parameters so that it
works well for everyone.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.140
And on that topic, how are
we going to get this

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.020
feedback from you?

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.870
Since the last I/O we've
released communities and that

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:14.500
kind of thing.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.920
And we really want to focus on
creating a good community

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.460
around Hangout app
development.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.360
So anyone that's familiar with
the Google+ Developers

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.930
community, you know
that there's a

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.710
Hangouts category in there.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.730
It's a little sparse
in terms of posts.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.890
We want to change that.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.260
We're really going to try
to engage with that.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.650
I think you should watch
in the next few weeks.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.655
We'll deep-dive into some
of the stuff that

00:29:38.655 --> 00:29:40.550
I've announced today.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.520
This is where we'll start
posting all the

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.530
updates to the APIs.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:48.380
So you'd follow that community
to see all the new APIs in the

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.190
dev channel, see when they get
upgraded to the stable

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.630
channel, that kind of thing.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.170
So I encourage you
all to join.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.810
We're going to get the engineers
from the team

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:03.270
involved as well and really just
both take your feedback,

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.700
solicit your ideas for what you
want to build, and what

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.440
APIs we can unlock for you.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.540
So as I said, we'll post
the API updates.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.790
And we want your feedback.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.950
Just a little upsell, we
have a code lab on

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.980
Friday at 2:00 PM.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.430
We'll be going through some of
these things, building a

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.630
simple app to that covers
all the APIs that

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.080
Jonathan talked about.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.460
I think it's got some of the
new stuff in it-- hand

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.400
tracking, at least.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.660
So if you're interested in that,
I encourage you all to

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:38.900
show up and see how easy it
is to build Hangout apps.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.160
Let me bring Jonathan back up,
and I think we'll just take

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.360
any questions you have.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.578
JONATHAN BERI: Cool, yeah.

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:50.871
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:50.871 --> 00:30:53.248
JONATHAN BERI: There are
mics over here if

00:30:53.248 --> 00:30:54.790
you've got some questions.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.480
RICHARD DUNN: Alan has
a question, I'm sure.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.460
JONATHAN BERI: Please go up to
the mic so people in the

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.012
recording of the stream
can hear it.

00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:06.413
AUDIENCE: Does the hand tracking
track both hands,

00:31:06.413 --> 00:31:07.940
like left and right
at the same time?

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.920
Do you know which hand
is being held up?

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.900
RICHARD DUNN: I think it's
right now just one.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.450
And it does the same
thing that you

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.470
do with face tracking.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.480
So it's just the main--
oh, OK, no, Patrick

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.660
tells me it's two.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.370
So you will get both hands.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:22.830
Does it identify left
versus right?

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:23.340
I forget.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:23.850
Yeah.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.550
So you'll actually be able to
figure out left and right

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.750
hands as well.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:31.600
AUDIENCE: How far do you think
we are from getting HD video

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.850
inside Hangouts?

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.670
RICHARD DUNN: That's
a good question.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.560
Chi, you want to
field that one?

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.360
JONATHAN BERI: For those
watching the recording, we

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.970
don't talk about upcoming
features.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:53.990
But that would be awesome.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.510
RICHARD DUNN: That
would be awesome.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.760
JONATHAN BERI: I would
love that.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.390
AUDIENCE: The auto-start feature
for an app, that's

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:07.296
only triggered by a user
volunteering for the app?

00:32:07.296 --> 00:32:10.465
It's not triggered by a Hangout
owner saying, this app

00:32:10.465 --> 00:32:12.380
is required for this Hangout?

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.730
RICHARD DUNN: Correct.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:18.440
Right now it's centered around
the app, basically providing

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.650
the UX for the user to
say, hey, I want to

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.625
auto-run this app.

00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:23.844
AUDIENCE: So it means in every
Hangout that I'm joining I

00:32:23.844 --> 00:32:27.580
want this app to run, not in
every Hangout that I own.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.130
RICHARD DUNN: Correct.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.620
So think about the experience
that you want

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.840
to have in a Hangout.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.255
This lets you craft that
experience using apps.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.720
We never really officially
announced this, but one thing

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.720
we did a few weeks ago was
remove the restriction of only

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.560
running two apps at a time.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.440
Part of it was to enable this,
so you can actually run as

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.860
many of these extensions
as you want.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.200
If you've got an extension that
sets your lower third,

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.320
that runs as one thing.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.090
If you've got something else
that, I don't know, does skin

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.500
softening or something like that
on your avatar, you can

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.255
run that as a second
extension.

00:33:01.255 --> 00:33:03.750
JONATHAN BERI: Good
question, though.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.270
AUDIENCE: One of the questions
I have, especially with

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.255
backgrounds, all the rest,
is brand marketing.

00:33:08.255 --> 00:33:11.330
One of the very cool things to
do if you're a game company

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:15.160
would be have a Hangout for your
specific game and have

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.880
the background graphic be your
specific game and allow people

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.550
to do defaults and
stuff like that.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.170
Perfect would be when they come
into the Hangout, certain

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.450
apps are pre-automatically
installed or required.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.110
So the other way would be very
good for brand marketing.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.910
They join a game, say the
Godfather or something.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.770
They join that game, and they
would automatically have the

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.480
same experience of everyone
else who's in that

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.410
Hangout at that time.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.940
It's a much more branded
way of doing it.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:46.840
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah, we've
definitely heard

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.590
that feedback before.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.020
And I think if you saw our
recent integration with

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.450
YouTube's Coachella streaming,
we did something similar to

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.940
that where when they came in
they automatically had both

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.180
the YouTube app that was
streaming this and the

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:00.890
Coachella stuff.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.930
So we're definitely working
on that area, and

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:05.950
we'll let you know.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.520
JONATHAN BERI: Actually, a lot
of agencies that I work with

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.679
use a feature we call
the Hangout Button.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.400
It's actually a link that
allows you to put on a

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.199
webpage, a Facebook post,
wherever, that does one of two

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.270
things for both.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.380
You can specify an app to load
if the user clicks on that

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.420
Hangout button.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.480
So it'll load your
branded app.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:28.480
And you can also pass in
metadata with that link.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.470
Let's say it's a sports
team site and they

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.590
have a Hangout button.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.090
They can pass what page they're
on, some campaign

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:39.070
tracking, as well as pre-load
that particular team's app.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.322
So you can do a lot of
that stuff today.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.940
AUDIENCE: I realize you just
announced hand tracking, but

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.659
is finger tracking
on the roadmap?

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:56.170
RICHARD DUNN: I don't know how
detailed we're going to get.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.060
AUDIENCE: Just a supplemental
question, is the image

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.320
buffered data ever going to be
exposed so we can do our own

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.930
custom effects [INAUDIBLE]
segmentation?

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.560
RICHARD DUNN: I think the big
issue there is really a

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.480
privacy thing and just giving
third parties access to that.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.840
I'm sure if we could find a safe
way to do it, we would

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.430
consider it.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.080
But we really have no
plans for that now,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.460
just for that reason.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.682
JONATHAN BERI: Though we'd love
to hear what you would do

00:35:22.682 --> 00:35:25.370
with that data.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.750
RICHARD DUNN: We could enable
very specific scenarios.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.270
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, because if
it's something really cool

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.410
and interesting, maybe we can
solve that problem with

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.570
another API that doesn't expose
the private graphing

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.660
information but enables you
to do something really

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.700
interesting.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.520
We'd love to hear
that feedback.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.130
AUDIENCE: I'm Jeff Douglas with
"Stack Overflow." And I

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.480
want to first say kudos
for the Hangout.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.590
It's changed the dynamic
of our team.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.220
JONATHAN BERI: Oh, fantastic.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:48.600
RICHARD DUNN: Thank you.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.280
AUDIENCE: And we've actually
integrated our own internal

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.700
chat system as a Hangout
application.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.550
RICHARD DUNN: Awesome.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.650
That's what it's there for.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:57.460
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.830
One thing I had a question is
one feature that's been

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:05.370
deployed recently, in the last
couple weeks, is muting while

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.900
you're typing.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.980
There are features like that
that sometimes come into

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.250
Hangout's experience that
we wish we could

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.340
somehow turn off.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.340
Is there a way or is there a
plan for some [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.430
RICHARD DUNN: I think if you
follow some of the releases

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.920
we've done, in general we've
tried to follow all the new

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.480
features pretty quickly
with an API.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.420
And I think moving to the
channel system is really going

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.870
to let us iterate even
faster on that.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:36.680
And so as soon as a feature
comes out, we should pretty

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.240
quickly release an
API for that.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.680
I hadn't heard that particular
one, but we'll definitely keep

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.030
that in mind as a
feature request.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.940
AUDIENCE: As you know, we're all
coders, so as we're typing

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.240
and [INAUDIBLE] mute
it, it's--

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.390
RICHARD DUNN: Understandable.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.095
JONATHAN BERI: This was good
feedback for the algorithm we

00:36:51.095 --> 00:36:52.696
use to do that.

00:36:52.696 --> 00:36:53.090
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah.

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.110
Figure out if the person's a
programmer by what they're

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.380
wearing, and then don't--

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.730
JONATHAN BERI: What
hour they are on.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.130
RICHARD DUNN: Yeah, if it's
3:00 in the morning--

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.070
JONATHAN BERI: What port's
open on the machine.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.410
Studio.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.440
First, thank you for letting the
hosts hide the film script

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.070
and for letting the host mute
notifications as needed.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.900
RICHARD DUNN: Yes, other new
APIs released today.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:18.650
AUDIENCE: Is there a technical
or business reason why a post

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.470
wouldn't be able to say, I want
everybody who enters this

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.750
Hangout to load this specific
application?

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.000
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.820
RICHARD DUNN: I think this is
really a good example of a use

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.040
case that's emerged since
Hangout started, and really

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.150
because of HOA, probably.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.200
This is stuff we weren't
think about on day one.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.340
Remember, we didn't have
Hangouts on air.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.870
So we've definitely heard
that feedback.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.630
And as I said, we're
exploring that.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.010
JONATHAN BERI: One nuance is
users do provide permission to

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.290
expose their Google data, or if
the particular app is using

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:54.770
another Google API.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:58.120
So some apps may not be
able to auto-authorize

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.190
those kind of things.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.452
AUDIENCE: Could be that's an
opportunity for them to

00:38:00.452 --> 00:38:03.150
decline and just not come
into a Hangout.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.560
JONATHAN BERI: That's
a good idea.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.390
We're actually out of time.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.990
Is there a quick question?

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.290
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.340
JONATHAN BERI: This will be
the last quick question.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.870
AUDIENCE: We can screen
share video and stuff.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.600
Is there any way we
can audio share?

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.480
Because if I want to share a
video, I can share the video

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.240
part of it, but I can't
also share the

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.490
audio at the same time.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.350
Or if I want to play a song and
I want people to hear it,

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:30.320
or even some way to be able to
share a YouTube video with the

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:30.700
other people.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.874
I know we can watch a YouTube
video together, but if I'm

00:38:32.874 --> 00:38:35.100
doing a Hangout on air, there's
no way for me to share

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.970
that YouTube video without
a lot of wires.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.760
RICHARD DUNN: I've actually
not heard that particular

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.360
request before, so that's
interesting.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.410
But just sort of off the top
of my head, there are

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.040
definitely complications with
audio that aren't there with

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.740
video, just because am I
playing it locally--

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.040
if you've ever played with the
YouTube app, you have that

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.690
push-to-talk system, just
because you don't want the

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.760
YouTube video conflicting, being
fed back through, and

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.000
that kind of thing.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.740
So definitely something
to look into.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.120
As I said, it's the first time
I've heard that request, but

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.682
I'd love to look into it.

00:39:05.682 --> 00:39:08.426
AUDIENCE: We're doing a show and
we're going to present a

00:39:08.426 --> 00:39:11.340
Russian meteorite exploding,
and there's video and audio

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:11.815
going along with it.

00:39:11.815 --> 00:39:14.710
We want to share it with people,
we can bring up the

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.890
YouTube or bring up even just
a video and show it, but the

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.570
audio won't get piped through,
so we have to come up with

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.410
some other way [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.570
JONATHAN BERI: I have seen
some pretty sophisticated

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.250
solutions to some of these
problems by using virtual

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:29.490
harbor drivers, especially
in interesting embedded

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.600
applications or robotics
or things like that.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I could
just pipe the input.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.184
There's ways to do it, but
people always want to share

00:39:38.184 --> 00:39:40.140
video and they can't
get the audio.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.350
JONATHAN BERI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:41.720
Thanks, guys.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.470
RICHARD DUNN: We'd better
clear the room.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:43.790
We'll be around for a
little bit, if you

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.400
have further questions.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:45.480
JONATHAN BERI: Perfect.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.310
Thank you, everybody.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.822
[APPLAUSE]
