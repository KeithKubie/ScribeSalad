00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.110
Near the end of the last video,
I wasn't as articulate

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.710
as I would like to be.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.430
Mainly because I think 15
minutes into a video my brain

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.590
starts to really warm
up too much.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.060
But what I want to do
is restate what I

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.820
was trying to say.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.750
We got this confidence
interval.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.000
I'll rewrite it here.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.020
I'll just restate the
confidence interval.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.620
So there's the 95% confidence
interval for the mean of this

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.870
distribution.

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:46.620
So, the mean of that
distribution, we got as being

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.990
1.91 plus or minus 1.21.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.460
And near the end of the
video I tried to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.780
explain why that is neat.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.450
Because here we have this
confidence interval for this

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.870
weird mean of the difference
between the sampling means.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.260
So it seems kind of confusing.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.450
But I just want to
restate what we

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.220
saw in previous videos.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.370
This thing right over here, the
mean of the difference of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:17.220
the sampling means, we saw
two or three videos ago.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.170
It's the same thing as the mean
of the difference of the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.715
means of the sampling
distributions.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.910
And we know that the mean
of each of the sampling

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.160
distributions is actually the
same as the mean of the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.170
population distributions.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.570
So this is the same thing as
the mean of Population One

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.860
minus the mean of
Population Two.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.350
And this was the neat result
about the last video.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.730
This isn't just a 95% confidence
interval for this

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.130
parameter right here.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.600
It's actually a 95% confidence
interval for this parameter

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.200
right here.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.910
And this is the parameter that
we really care about.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.180
The true difference in weight
loss between going on the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.930
low-fat diet and not going
on the low-fat diet.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.390
And we have a 95% confidence
interval that that difference

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.250
is between 0.7 and
3.12 pounds.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.320
Which tells us that we have a
95% confidence interval that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.300
you're definitely going
to lose some weight.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.410
We're not 100% sure.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.210
We're confident that there's
a 95% probability of that.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.230
Anyway, hopefully that clarifies
it a little bit.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.490
I didn't want to confuse you
too much with that bungled

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.620
language that I had at the
end of the last video.
