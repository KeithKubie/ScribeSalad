today I'm gonna show everyone a trick

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060
today I'm gonna show everyone a trick
 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.890
today I'm gonna show everyone a trick
that can check your with meticulous no

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900
that can check your with meticulous no
 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.720
that can check your with meticulous no
this I think every adult should know

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730
this I think every adult should know
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.070
this I think every adult should know
this and I don't think everyone does

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080
this and I don't think everyone does
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.730
this and I don't think everyone does
know it it's called casting out nines

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740
know it it's called casting out nines
 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.960
know it it's called casting out nines
it's a method to check your arithmetic

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
it's a method to check your arithmetic
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.670
it's a method to check your arithmetic
it's what they used in the old days

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
it's what they used in the old days
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.310
it's what they used in the old days
before calculators and let's say we're

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
before calculators and let's say we're
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.620
before calculators and let's say we're
doing something like 2039 plus 172 plus

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
doing something like 2039 plus 172 plus
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.720
doing something like 2039 plus 172 plus
whatever 1218 plus 3091 let's see we're

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
whatever 1218 plus 3091 let's see we're
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.830
whatever 1218 plus 3091 let's see we're
doing something like that okay

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
doing something like that okay
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569
doing something like that okay
this add these up I'm just gonna add the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
this add these up I'm just gonna add the
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.069
this add these up I'm just gonna add the
up in the traditional way I'm not doing

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
up in the traditional way I'm not doing
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170
up in the traditional way I'm not doing
anything clever here so you add up

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
anything clever here so you add up
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.779
anything clever here so you add up
column by column okay I reckon it's 6520

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789
column by column okay I reckon it's 6520
 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.610
column by column okay I reckon it's 6520
but what if I've done it wrong or if

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
but what if I've done it wrong or if
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.260
but what if I've done it wrong or if
I've made a mistake so here's a check

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
I've made a mistake so here's a check
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.520
I've made a mistake so here's a check
that you can do so what we're going to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
that you can do so what we're going to
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.350
that you can do so what we're going to
do we're going to reduce each of these

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
do we're going to reduce each of these
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270
do we're going to reduce each of these
numbers to a single digits and the way

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
numbers to a single digits and the way
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790
numbers to a single digits and the way
we do that is we're going to add up the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
we do that is we're going to add up the
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000
we do that is we're going to add up the
digits in each number so 2 plus 3 is 5

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
digits in each number so 2 plus 3 is 5
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.420
digits in each number so 2 plus 3 is 5
plus 9 is 14 I want to reduce it to a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
plus 9 is 14 I want to reduce it to a
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280
plus 9 is 14 I want to reduce it to a
single digit so I'm just going to do it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
single digit so I'm just going to do it
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530
single digit so I'm just going to do it
again now I'm going to take the 14 1

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
again now I'm going to take the 14 1
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.240
again now I'm going to take the 14 1
plus 4 hope you're happy with that I'm

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
plus 4 hope you're happy with that I'm
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.710
plus 4 hope you're happy with that I'm
going to do that with each number one

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
going to do that with each number one
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350
going to do that with each number one
plus seven plus two I reckon that's 10

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
plus seven plus two I reckon that's 10
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.020
plus seven plus two I reckon that's 10
let's switch to reduce that down so 1

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
let's switch to reduce that down so 1
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149
let's switch to reduce that down so 1
plus 0 is a 1 this is what I get

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
plus 0 is a 1 this is what I get
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359
plus 0 is a 1 this is what I get
so I get this 5 1 3 &amp; 4 now I'm going to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
so I get this 5 1 3 &amp; 4 now I'm going to
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.450
so I get this 5 1 3 &amp; 4 now I'm going to
perform the same calculation using these

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
perform the same calculation using these
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.359
perform the same calculation using these
numbers so I'm just adding them here it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
numbers so I'm just adding them here it
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.310
numbers so I'm just adding them here it
says add them together side them

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
says add them together side them
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830
says add them together side them
together okay five plus one it's a six

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
together okay five plus one it's a six
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.219
together okay five plus one it's a six
plus a 3 is a nine plus four it's a 13

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
plus a 3 is a nine plus four it's a 13
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020
plus a 3 is a nine plus four it's a 13
actually I'm going to reduce that down

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
actually I'm going to reduce that down
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.130
actually I'm going to reduce that down
if you don't mind to a single digit 4

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140
if you don't mind to a single digit 4
 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.200
if you don't mind to a single digit 4
but now if you do the same thing with

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
but now if you do the same thing with
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.420
but now if you do the same thing with
your answer ok 6520 add this up is a 13

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
your answer ok 6520 add this up is a 13
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.990
your answer ok 6520 add this up is a 13
which gives me a final digit there of 4

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
which gives me a final digit there of 4
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.780
which gives me a final digit there of 4
and these are the same and they should

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
and these are the same and they should
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.170
and these are the same and they should
be now if they're not the same that's

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
be now if they're not the same that's
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.749
be now if they're not the same that's
how you know your calculation has gone

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
how you know your calculation has gone
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.290
how you know your calculation has gone
wrong so this is a way to check your

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300
wrong so this is a way to check your
 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.070
wrong so this is a way to check your
calculations without having to do the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
calculations without having to do the
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380
calculations without having to do the
calculation all over again

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
calculation all over again
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.880
calculation all over again
now

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
now
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.350
now
that was a bit laborious the way I did

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
that was a bit laborious the way I did
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000
that was a bit laborious the way I did
it there I can actually show you just a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
it there I can actually show you just a
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.830
it there I can actually show you just a
quick way to do it this pick a number

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
quick way to do it this pick a number
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.720
quick way to do it this pick a number
they let's say 43 4 plus 3 equals 7 so 7

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
they let's say 43 4 plus 3 equals 7 so 7
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.360
they let's say 43 4 plus 3 equals 7 so 7
would be the final answer it's called a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
would be the final answer it's called a
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.570
would be the final answer it's called a
digital root but now I'm gonna add 9 to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
digital root but now I'm gonna add 9 to
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.560
digital root but now I'm gonna add 9 to
43 gives me 50 to do the same thing with

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570
43 gives me 50 to do the same thing with
 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.280
43 gives me 50 to do the same thing with
52 it's going to be 5 plus 2 that's also

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
52 it's going to be 5 plus 2 that's also
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.150
52 it's going to be 5 plus 2 that's also
7 and that's true when you add 9 it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
7 and that's true when you add 9 it
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.850
7 and that's true when you add 9 it
doesn't change the digital root so if

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
doesn't change the digital root so if
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.979
doesn't change the digital root so if
you look at this original calculation I

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
you look at this original calculation I
 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.530
you look at this original calculation I
did up here actually can get rid of

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
did up here actually can get rid of
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.699
did up here actually can get rid of
nines so this fall out to start 2039

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
nines so this fall out to start 2039
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.390
nines so this fall out to start 2039
well this 9 has no effect and just get

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
well this 9 has no effect and just get
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.590
well this 9 has no effect and just get
rid of it I don't have to consider it

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600
rid of it I don't have to consider it
 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.890
rid of it I don't have to consider it
but in the same way this 9 here which

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
but in the same way this 9 here which
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.170
but in the same way this 9 here which
represents 90 has no effect that's just

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
represents 90 has no effect that's just
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.479
represents 90 has no effect that's just
like adding 9 over and over again I can

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489
like adding 9 over and over again I can
 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.979
like adding 9 over and over again I can
get rid of it or in fact I can get rid

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
get rid of it or in fact I can get rid
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.229
get rid of it or in fact I can get rid
of this 18th that's like adding 9 twice

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239
of this 18th that's like adding 9 twice
 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.930
of this 18th that's like adding 9 twice
that has no effect on the digital root

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940
that has no effect on the digital root
 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.750
that has no effect on the digital root
same for this 7 or to any combination

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
same for this 7 or to any combination
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.500
same for this 7 or to any combination
that makes 9 can be got rid of and then

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
that makes 9 can be got rid of and then
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.479
that makes 9 can be got rid of and then
you see so much easier now so what I've

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489
you see so much easier now so what I've
 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.160
you see so much easier now so what I've
got now is a 5 a 1 a 3 and a 4 and it's

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170
got now is a 5 a 1 a 3 and a 4 and it's
 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.720
got now is a 5 a 1 a 3 and a 4 and it's
very easy to do and then you can perform

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730
very easy to do and then you can perform
 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.819
very easy to do and then you can perform
the calculation again same thing with

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829
the calculation again same thing with
 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.690
the calculation again same thing with
this lot here look the 5 and the 4

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700
this lot here look the 5 and the 4
 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.640
this lot here look the 5 and the 4
cancel out one on three left over miksa

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
cancel out one on three left over miksa
 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.729
cancel out one on three left over miksa
4 very easy to do this arithmetic it

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739
4 very easy to do this arithmetic it
 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.380
4 very easy to do this arithmetic it
also works for multiplication let's try

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390
also works for multiplication let's try
 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.910
also works for multiplication let's try
a multiplication just to see

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920
a multiplication just to see
 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.970
a multiplication just to see
let's do five hundred and three times

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980
let's do five hundred and three times
 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.130
let's do five hundred and three times
I'll do something easy I'm not trying to

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
I'll do something easy I'm not trying to
 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.900
I'll do something easy I'm not trying to
show off with how good I am at

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910
show off with how good I am at
 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.199
show off with how good I am at
arithmetic so if times 50 what I would

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209
arithmetic so if times 50 what I would
 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.720
arithmetic so if times 50 what I would
do if I saw that is times it by 10 first

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730
do if I saw that is times it by 10 first
 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.460
do if I saw that is times it by 10 first
of all so five oh three oh times it by

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
of all so five oh three oh times it by
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.229
of all so five oh three oh times it by
five which is two five one five and then

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239
five which is two five one five and then
 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.220
five which is two five one five and then
add that up

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
add that up
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.720
add that up
so what I got there seven five four five

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730
so what I got there seven five four five
 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.840
so what I got there seven five four five
I reckon that's the answer but let's

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850
I reckon that's the answer but let's
 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.810
I reckon that's the answer but let's
check let's do the digital roots of each

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820
check let's do the digital roots of each
 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.460
check let's do the digital roots of each
value thousand eight that's a 6 1 plus 5

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470
value thousand eight that's a 6 1 plus 5
 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.259
value thousand eight that's a 6 1 plus 5
that makes a 6 and we're going to

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269
that makes a 6 and we're going to
 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.930
that makes a 6 and we're going to
multiply now we do the same calculation

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940
multiply now we do the same calculation
 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.360
multiply now we do the same calculation
using the digital roots 8 times 6 4

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370
using the digital roots 8 times 6 4
 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.460
using the digital roots 8 times 6 4
4848 will eventually end up being a

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470
4848 will eventually end up being a
 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.520
4848 will eventually end up being a
three an ass check that this is also

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530
three an ass check that this is also
 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.390
three an ass check that this is also
three if it's not I've done it wrong

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400
three if it's not I've done it wrong
 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.570
three if it's not I've done it wrong
let's see okay five plus four I can't

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580
let's see okay five plus four I can't
 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.480
let's see okay five plus four I can't
even get rid of that okay seven plus

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490
even get rid of that okay seven plus
 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.040
even get rid of that okay seven plus
five is a twelve add them together

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050
five is a twelve add them together
 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.160
five is a twelve add them together
hooray I'm happy that ends with a three

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170
hooray I'm happy that ends with a three
 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.830
hooray I'm happy that ends with a three
as well this is what people used to do

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840
as well this is what people used to do
 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.140
as well this is what people used to do
before calculators if you were a

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150
before calculators if you were a
 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.350
before calculators if you were a
scientist or if you are an accountant

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360
scientist or if you are an accountant
 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.420
scientist or if you are an accountant
and you needed to check your figures

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430
and you needed to check your figures
 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.430
and you needed to check your figures
very important to check your figures

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440
very important to check your figures
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.920
very important to check your figures
this is the sort of test that you could

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930
this is the sort of test that you could
 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.910
this is the sort of test that you could
do so if you're wrong you'll be wrong by

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920
do so if you're wrong you'll be wrong by
 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.240
do so if you're wrong you'll be wrong by
some multiple of nine because if you add

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250
some multiple of nine because if you add
 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.280
some multiple of nine because if you add
nine it doesn't change the digital route

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290
nine it doesn't change the digital route
 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.620
nine it doesn't change the digital route
so maybe you're nine off or 90 off

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630
so maybe you're nine off or 90 off
 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.530
so maybe you're nine off or 90 off
that's possible true but this is a check

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540
that's possible true but this is a check
 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.940
that's possible true but this is a check
to see if you're right

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950
to see if you're right
 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.310
to see if you're right
now you might be thinking why does this

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320
now you might be thinking why does this
 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.020
now you might be thinking why does this
work and if you're thinking that well

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030
work and if you're thinking that well
 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.340
work and if you're thinking that well
done you're thinking like a

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350
done you're thinking like a
 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.260
done you're thinking like a
mathematician yeah why does this work

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270
mathematician yeah why does this work
 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.190
mathematician yeah why does this work
that's a good question to ask so and we

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200
that's a good question to ask so and we
 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.830
that's a good question to ask so and we
saw before adding 9 didn't change the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840
saw before adding 9 didn't change the
 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.690
saw before adding 9 didn't change the
digital route adding 9 had no effect

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700
digital route adding 9 had no effect
 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.380
digital route adding 9 had no effect
it's kind of like if it was Monday and I

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390
it's kind of like if it was Monday and I
 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.020
it's kind of like if it was Monday and I
add seven days it's Monday again isn't

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030
add seven days it's Monday again isn't
 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.410
add seven days it's Monday again isn't
it

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420
it
 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.010
it
or if it was Monday and I add 17 days

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020
or if it was Monday and I add 17 days
 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.190
or if it was Monday and I add 17 days
well you'd go through 14 that'll get you

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200
well you'd go through 14 that'll get you
 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.680
well you'd go through 14 that'll get you
back to Monday then you would have three

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690
back to Monday then you would have three
 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.720
back to Monday then you would have three
more days left that'll take you to

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730
more days left that'll take you to
 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.300
more days left that'll take you to
Thursday so it's kind of the same idea

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310
Thursday so it's kind of the same idea
 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.300
Thursday so it's kind of the same idea
any nines in this case have no effect

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310
any nines in this case have no effect
 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.630
any nines in this case have no effect
and then anything left is what you have

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640
and then anything left is what you have
 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.720
and then anything left is what you have
after a multiple of nine what that means

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730
after a multiple of nine what that means
 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.270
after a multiple of nine what that means
is any number can be written as a

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280
is any number can be written as a
 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.120
is any number can be written as a
multiple of nine plus their digital root

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130
multiple of nine plus their digital root
 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.540
multiple of nine plus their digital root
so you pick a number and you can write

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550
so you pick a number and you can write
 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.680
so you pick a number and you can write
it as some multiple of nine plus a

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690
it as some multiple of nine plus a
 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.170
it as some multiple of nine plus a
here's the digital root now what happens

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180
here's the digital root now what happens
 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.000
here's the digital root now what happens
when I add it to another number if I add

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010
when I add it to another number if I add
 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.210
when I add it to another number if I add
that to another number it can be written

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220
that to another number it can be written
 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.770
that to another number it can be written
as a multiple of 9 plus the digital root

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780
as a multiple of 9 plus the digital root
 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.140
as a multiple of 9 plus the digital root
let's say it's be here what happens when

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150
let's say it's be here what happens when
 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.950
let's say it's be here what happens when
I do that we're going to end up with a

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960
I do that we're going to end up with a
 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.150
I do that we're going to end up with a
multiple of nine it's actually nine

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160
multiple of nine it's actually nine
 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.749
multiple of nine it's actually nine
times n plus M

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759
times n plus M
 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.689
times n plus M
plus these two will get added together

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699
plus these two will get added together
 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.649
plus these two will get added together
that B a plus B so adding these two

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659
that B a plus B so adding these two
 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.600
that B a plus B so adding these two
numbers together has the effect of being

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610
numbers together has the effect of being
 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.659
numbers together has the effect of being
a multiple of nine plus the sum of their

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669
a multiple of nine plus the sum of their
 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.629
a multiple of nine plus the sum of their
digital roots and that's why this works

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639
digital roots and that's why this works
 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.010
digital roots and that's why this works
you do our calculations with the

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020
you do our calculations with the
 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.619
you do our calculations with the
original numbers will transfer to the

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629
original numbers will transfer to the
 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.329
original numbers will transfer to the
same calculation with their digital

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:01.339
same calculation with their digital
 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.059
same calculation with their digital
roots with multiplication you'll see we

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069
roots with multiplication you'll see we
 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.719
roots with multiplication you'll see we
had those two numbers as say nine n plus

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729
had those two numbers as say nine n plus
 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:14.769
had those two numbers as say nine n plus
a multiplied by 9 m plus V then you're

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:14.779
a multiplied by 9 m plus V then you're
 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.769
a multiplied by 9 m plus V then you're
going to get a multiple of nine which is

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:17.779
going to get a multiple of nine which is
 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.719
going to get a multiple of nine which is
can be nine times something not very

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729
can be nine times something not very
 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.049
can be nine times something not very
pretty so multiplying two numbers has

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:23.059
pretty so multiplying two numbers has
 

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.769
pretty so multiplying two numbers has
the effect of being a multiple of nine

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:25.779
the effect of being a multiple of nine
 

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.860
the effect of being a multiple of nine
plus the product of their digital roots

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:29.870
plus the product of their digital roots
 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.409
plus the product of their digital roots
and of course multiple of nines can be

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419
and of course multiple of nines can be
 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:37.089
and of course multiple of nines can be
ignored they just disappear these this

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:37.099
ignored they just disappear these this
 

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:40.600
ignored they just disappear these this
would be a nine and this would then be

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:40.610
would be a nine and this would then be
 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.499
would be a nine and this would then be
divided by one plus five is a six that

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:44.509
divided by one plus five is a six that
 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:47.469
divided by one plus five is a six that
doesn't equal three does it that makes

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.479
doesn't equal three does it that makes
 

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:48.309
doesn't equal three does it that makes
no sense

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319
no sense
 

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:50.379
no sense
we have much further to go in our race

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:50.389
we have much further to go in our race
 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:52.389
we have much further to go in our race
for space so we're gonna leave Sputnik

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:52.399
for space so we're gonna leave Sputnik
 

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:54.249
for space so we're gonna leave Sputnik
behind for those who don't know by the

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:54.259
behind for those who don't know by the

way Sputnik was the first settle I ever

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:56.569
way Sputnik was the first settle I ever

way Sputnik was the first settle I ever
to orbit the earth it wasn't launched by

00:07:58.119 --> 00:07:58.129
to orbit the earth it wasn't launched by
 

00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:59.350
to orbit the earth it wasn't launched by
the Russians we probably should have

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360
the Russians we probably should have
