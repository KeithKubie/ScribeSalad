00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.830
We've seen a few examples, and

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.730
you've practiced writing reductions
on your own at this point.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.370
Now I want you to test your
understanding by telling me which of

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.200
the following statements about
these two languages are true.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.090
This one is the familiar
halting problem.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.160
This one we'll call the empty problem.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.620
The set of descriptions
of Turing machines,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.080
where the Turing machine
accepts nothing.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.930
Think very carefully,
and write out on pen and

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.650
paper, any reductions that you find.
