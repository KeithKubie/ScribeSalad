&gt;&gt; We're at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories today with Dr Zalleg, and we're going

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.020
to see some of her sea lions

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.720
&gt;&gt; So you might ask, what do Sea lions have to do with psychology, and why did

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.556
Susan and I come here?

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:13.460
&gt;&gt; Well Dr Zalleg is going to teach us about classical and operant conditioning

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.120
and how she can get her sea lions to do this

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.534
&gt;&gt; Kiss.

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:17.542
