00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.930
With all of this complexity though, you might

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.825
have noticed, some developers decide to build two

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:11.770
separate applications, a desktop app. And a separate

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.100
mobile web app, but there are some problems

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.700

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.670
you encounter with having separate mobile and desktop sites?
