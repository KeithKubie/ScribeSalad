00:00:00.593 --> 00:00:02.070
Voiceover:Sort the drawings according

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.923
to the equation that correctly describes

00:00:03.923 --> 00:00:07.029
the relationship between
the vectors drawn.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.216
An equation may have any number of cards,

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:11.500
and cards with no corresponding equation

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.832
should be left unsorted.

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:14.451
Let's see what they're talking about here.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:16.703
Right over here, they have depicted,

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:19.564
let's see, they're adding
vector A to vector B.

00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:21.265
We see that, because vector B's tail

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:23.721
is at the head of vector A.

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.791
They're adding vector A to vector B.

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.021
If you connect the tail of vector A

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.039
to the head of Vector B,

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.351
you get vector C.

00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:32.264
They're really showing that

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:35.813
vector A plus vector B
is equal to vector C.

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:37.550
Let's see if we can find that.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.646
A is showing that vectors A+B,

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:44.811
vector A plus vector B
is equal to vector C.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.962
Let's look at the second choice.

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:50.148
This choice, right over here is showing

00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:56.323
that vector B plus vector
C is equal to vector A.

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:58.579
So B+C is equal to A.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.603
That is this choice, right over here.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.980
Diagram or graph B is showing us

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.553
that vector B plus vector
C is equal to vector A.

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:10.115
Now let's look at this
choice, right over here.

00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:17.603
This is showing us that B+A is equal to C.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:20.580
It doesn't matter which
way you order them.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:24.153
The way they've set it up,

00:01:24.153 --> 00:01:26.277
this is B+A is equal to C.

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:33.477
That is not one of the choices,

00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:37.082
but you could, whether you're doing A+B,

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:39.243
or B+A, it's going to be the same thing.

00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:41.069
I'm gonna throw it into this category,

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.312
right over here.

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:44.228
This is the same thing as A+B.

00:01:44.228 --> 00:01:47.872
Instead of putting the
tail of B at the head of A,

00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:49.908
they just put the tail
of A at the head of B.

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:50.995
It doesn't matter what order

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:53.687
you are adding those two vectors.

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:55.906
You're still going to
get the same, vector C.

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:57.752
Finally, this right over here,

00:01:57.752 --> 00:02:00.488
this is C+A is equal to B.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.204
This is C+A or A+C is equal to B.

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:08.972
It doesn't matter if we
do vector A plus vector C

00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:11.267
or vector C plus vector A.

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:13.012
Let's just make sure that

00:02:13.012 --> 00:02:17.469
we've got all of these right, and we have.
