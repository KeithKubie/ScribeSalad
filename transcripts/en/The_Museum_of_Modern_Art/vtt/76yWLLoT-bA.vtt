00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.595
My name is Ilit Azoulay,

00:00:02.753 --> 00:00:06.588
and I'm participating
in the exhibition Ocean of Images,

00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:10.011
with the work named
Shifting Degrees of Certainty.

00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:14.973
Shifting Degrees of Certainty
is an image of a map or a brain

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:19.061
at the same time,
containing 85 puzzle pieces

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:24.178
and for each puzzle it's an image
that has a background story

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.485
a historical background,
I would say

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.591
that is served to the viewer
via an audio guide device.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.816
Can you talk to me
about the methodology that you used

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.746
or the process that you used
during that piece?

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:38.956
Yes, when I arrived to Germany,

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:44.026
I started to spot the places
that haven't been bombed

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.921
during the Second World War,

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:52.595
because I wanted to reach the process
or the understanding

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.891
of how certain public spaces
are being preserved.

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:05.441
After coming from Israel
and tracing the law of conservation

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:06.946
and preservation in Israel,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.071
I was very interested to see
how it's taking place in Germany.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:18.580
I started to photograph objects,
architectural relics, certain images,

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.111
all connected to architecture,

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:25.296
and the only main umbrella
that I knew at that point

00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:27.546
is that everything
that I'm photographing

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.176
is either under conservation,
preservation, or restoration status.

00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:37.371
And then I started a process
of understanding, asking questions

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:42.161
regarding the historical background
of each image that I photographed.

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:48.396
And those questions took me
to a road that surprised me very much

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:55.283
and creates the system and the way
that the work shifts itself.

00:01:55.491 --> 00:02:01.806
And it was usually correspondence
with the archives or certain experts

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:05.091
concerning the object
or the image that I photographed.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.003
So the piece is made of 85 images,

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:11.966
but there are also sounds
and recordings that you did

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.010
during your residency.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:18.598
My question is was it conceived
to be right that way from the start?

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:20.098
Yeah.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.478
Usually when I start a project,

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:30.651
there a very few basic rules
that I know from the beginning

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:37.700
but I have to have a big bubble
of unknowing and to open my ears

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:41.536
to what's appeared and revealed
from the process.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:48.711
And it's opened in a way
for me a possibility of a staring,

00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:55.895
leaving your eyes on an image

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.470
that is not necessarily
very interesting,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.961
but while listening to a journey,
imagining a three-dimensional aspect

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:10.350
of other images
that could be there in a way.

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:13.318
So you started working
with the analog process

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.371
at the beginning of your career,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.658
and then you switched to digital.

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.735
How has that affected your work,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.583
and do you sometimes feel nostalgic
about the old analog process?

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:37.718
Yes, I think for me, it's all
mixed with a personal development.

00:03:40.763 --> 00:03:44.350
When I take myself back then,

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.936
I felt I would say that
in the world of communication,

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:52.293
and I feel that a camera
is a communication tool

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.486
but also in other aspects,
all kinds of communication,

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.801
there's so little precise thing.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:03.661
There is so little moments
of real meetings.

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:09.160
So when I found myself
with my first camera

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:16.465
that I got from my grandfather,
a Rolleiflex with a small macro lens,

00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:20.135
I found this special essence,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.265
or special mood
of meeting with objects,

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:27.060
and I felt this photography for me.

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:28.853
So by mistake in a way,

00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:31.355
there was suddenly
no negatives in Israel,

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:36.693
and I found myself
holding a digital camera,

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:41.573
but compared to the 4x5 negative
it was so shallow, the results.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:46.996
So I decided to think
from the beginning of photography,

00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:49.998
and to think about this tool
that painters used,

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:58.173
creating kind of a grid on a glass,
on a piece of a glass,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.636
and photographing the reality
from each square in this grid,

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.226
and then combine it together,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.386
maybe I can have something
that is a little bit similar

00:05:08.553 --> 00:05:12.730
to this 4x5 aspect
that really brings material inside.
