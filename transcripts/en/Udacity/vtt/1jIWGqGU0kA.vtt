00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.340
Which ones did you think, David?

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.170
&gt;&gt; So the first sentence,
colorless green ideas sleep furiously.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.483
I recognized pretty quickly as
a pretty famous example proposed

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:13.164
by Noam Chomsky of how sentences can
be semantically nonsensical, but

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:14.841
still grammatically correct.

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:15.804
The sentence makes sense.

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:19.389
There's still a subject, a verb,
an adverb describing the verb, but

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:21.920
the idea of a colorless
green idea makes no sense.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.440
The idea of ideas sleeping makes
maybe a little bit of sense.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.760
The idea of sleeping furiously
is kind of nonsense.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.040
So the sentence really doesn't

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.490
have much meaning even though
it is grammatically correct.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.240
The second sentence, soft drinks
due from thank bills insurance

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.970
really doesn't make
any grammatical sense.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.150
It does have a seeming subject and
a seeming verb.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.260
But the verb comes right a preposition
suggesting that the verb fills in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.450
the slot proposed by the preposition,
which doesn't make any sense.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.170
So this one doesn't make any
grammatical sense to me.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.230
The same can be said for
the other two negative examples.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.110
They don't really have the normal
subject, predicate sentence structure or

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.060
they have other rules or
constraints that are being violated.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.590
For the other two positive examples,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.490
they still maintain this subject
verb sentence structure.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.260
So here we have wall decor notifies,
which doesn't make sense but

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.670
it matches our structure.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.590
And here we have Tuesday brought
something, which also makes

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.330
no semantic sense, but can still be
thought of as grammatically correct.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.780
Similarly, Tuesday bringing
something does make some sense, but

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.830
a a sharp-edged suite of pumpernickel
makes no sense whatsoever.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.270
&gt;&gt; Note the vocabulary that David used

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.180
in trying to find out which of these
sentences were grammatically correct.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.240
It seemed to me that he was examining
if the structure of these sentences

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.640
was fulfilling certain conditions or
fulfilling certain constraints

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.010
that he expects from his knowledge
of English-language grammar.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.720
One could even say that he was
doing constraint processing.
