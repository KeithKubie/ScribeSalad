00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.600
So the two specific types of sensory memory are iconic memory and echoic

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.195
memory. As I'm sure you're able to deduce from the names, iconic memory has to

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:14.305
do with visual stimuli, whereas echoic memory has to do with auditory stimuli.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:19.260
Iconic memory is presented for only a very short amount of time. For example,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.545
the picture we just saw. Echoic memory is a sensory memory for sounds. Echoic

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:27.385
memory is important for our ability to comprehend and understand language,

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:30.985
because we need to keep sounds in our memory long enough to be able to make

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:37.765
sense of them as words. So sensory memory is preserved for a very short period

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:41.742
of time. So if sensory memory is so brief in duration, how is it that we can

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:45.090
remember for example, someone's phone number or the directions to the gas

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.109
station?
