00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:01.756
Male Voice: In the last video we saw how

00:00:01.756 --> 00:00:03.871
there could be an industry
that has two firms,

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:07.040
a duopoly, and if those
two firms coordinate

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.604
they could behave as a
monopolist and they could

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:12.469
optimize their collective economic profit.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.284
In the last video we saw that would happen

00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:16.759
when they produced 50 units per period,

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.404
and they could split
it, assuming these were

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:21.340
two identical firms, by
each producing half of it.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.289
In the case of the last
video, it was 250 units

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.206
per firm. Then we saw that
there was an incentive

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:30.006
to cheat; that by producing extra units,

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:33.075
from a market's point
of view, the marginal

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.205
economic, or the economic profit on those

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.538
incremental units would
be negative, so the whole

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:40.876
economic profit would shrink a little bit

00:00:40.876 --> 00:00:43.202
as you produced units beyond that,

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:45.208
but the cheater would get a bigger chunk

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:47.138
of those units, or the
bigger chunk of that

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:50.677
economic profit. The
cheater could actually gain,

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:54.552
go from $250 per time period to $280,

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:57.393
and it would be all at the
expense of the non-cheater,

00:00:57.393 --> 00:01:00.271
and then some, who would lose even more

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.010
than what the cheater gained.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.742
Obviously who was
initially the non-cheater

00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:06.285
has an incentive now to cheat, and they'll

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:08.707
both keep increasing,
they'll both keep increasing

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:11.412
production so that if they wanted to keep

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:14.802
doing this one-upmanship. They both have

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.756
the incentive to keep
going assuming that they

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:19.201
don't hold to their cartel agreement

00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:26.544
until you get to a
quantity where there's no

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:30.143
economic profit left.
Right over here, the way

00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:32.653
I've drawn it, the demand curve intersects

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:35.745
the average total cost
curve right over here,

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.211
and there's no economic profit left.

00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:39.792
We're producing a good quantity.

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:42.205
It looks like it's
about 75 units combined;

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:44.807
75 units for the whole market.

00:01:44.807 --> 00:01:48.171
But at this point, the market price

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:51.013
is equal to the average total cost,

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:53.458
and so there's no economic profit per unit

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:56.724
on average. What I want
to do is think about this

00:01:56.724 --> 00:01:58.730
in kind of a Game theoretic way.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.378
Let's look at a bunch of states.

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:05.128
This is the optimal state
that we are starting off in.

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:12.959
You can actually call it
the Pareto optimal state,

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.721
named after Vilfredo Pareto.

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:19.051
All it means is that's
the state where there's

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.791
no other state where you can make someone

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.385
better off without making
the other person worse off.

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:25.035
Any of the states here, there are states,

00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:26.656
for example, where blue is better off.

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:29.070
For example, in this state right over here

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.784
blue is better off,
but green is worse off.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:36.046
So that's why it's
called Pareto optimality.

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:38.952
Now, what I want to think
about is how these characters

00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:42.049
will change their state
due to their incentives.

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.918
Then we'll talk a little bit
about Nash Equilibrium as well.

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:49.199
On this axis, up here,
lets' say this is one

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.040
of the competitors. This
is where they produce 25,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.320
and let's say on the ultimate cheating

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.887
quantity of 75, and this
is somewhat close to

00:02:57.887 --> 00:03:00.395
the market, or that is
the equilibrium quantity

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:03.137
if this was perfect competition,

00:03:03.137 --> 00:03:05.461
they produce half of that, so this is them

00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:11.881
producing 37.5 units. As we
go from 25 to 37.5 units,

00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:16.551
they are cheating more.
This is more cheating

00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:19.801
and over here, this was no cheating.

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:22.332
We can do the same thing
for the blue player.

00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:25.928
I'll write them as B.
This is them producing 25.

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:29.325
This is them producing
37.5. As we go up and up

00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:31.713
and up, they are cheating more.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:36.751
This is a lot of cheating,
or more cheating.

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:38.724
To think of it in a Game theoretical way,

00:03:38.724 --> 00:03:41.862
this is the Pareto optimal
state right over here.

00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:43.392
It's optimal in many ways.

00:03:43.392 --> 00:03:45.922
This is they've maximized
the total economic

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:48.992
profit here. There's
no other state that one

00:03:48.992 --> 00:03:51.546
person would benefit without
making the other worse.

00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:53.460
Now, let's think about whether this is

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.465
a Nash equilibrium. Let's remind oursleves

00:03:57.465 --> 00:04:01.132
what Nash equilibrium was.

00:04:01.132 --> 00:04:05.165
This was a state where
holding all the other

00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:07.473
players constant, so in
this case there's only one

00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:24.042
other player, a player can't
gain by changing strategy.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:25.532
In this case, changing
strategy is changing

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:34.328
your output. Let's see if
that is true of this state

00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:38.065
right over here. Well,
let's hold A constant.

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:40.144
If A is constant, we're
in this column right

00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:42.663
over here. Is there something B can do,

00:04:42.663 --> 00:04:44.803
is there change or strategy B can do,

00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:46.702
that would allow B to gain?

00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:49.461
Sure. B can increase production.

00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:50.794
That's what we saw in the last video.

00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:52.949
We would go from this bottom right state

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.329
to one right above it.
Now B's economic profit

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:58.796
is 280, A's is 200. The pie has shrunk,

00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:00.962
but B has got a larger chunk of it.

00:05:00.962 --> 00:05:03.539
That was not a Nash equilibrium.

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.406
There is, holding all others constant,

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:11.732
there is a player that can gain
by changing their strategy.

00:05:11.732 --> 00:05:14.956
The Nash equilibrium
definition, just to make sure,

00:05:14.956 --> 00:05:17.396
they say it's a state where holding others

00:05:17.396 --> 00:05:21.461
constant no player can
gain by changing strategy.

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.334
We just showed that at
least one player can gain

00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:25.870
by changing strategy
holding others constant.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.595
The same would be true if we
went the other way around.

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:31.288
If we held B constant at 25, A could gain

00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:34.630
by changing his strategy,
could go right over there.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.523
This is not a Nash equilibrium.

00:05:41.523 --> 00:05:43.159
Then regardless of what state we go to,

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.856
if we go to this state, it's still not

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:47.742
a Nash Equilibrium. If we hold A constant,

00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:51.274
B could improve by
increasing his production;

00:05:51.274 --> 00:05:53.866
or if we hold B constant, then A can still

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:55.995
improve by cheating even more.

00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:57.861
None of these are Nash equilibriums.

00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.532
From any one of these states,
if you hold A constant,

00:06:00.532 --> 00:06:04.261
B could produce more; or
if you hold B constant,

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:07.858
A could produce more and get some gain.

00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:11.059
Over here, A's going from
130 to 160 and getting

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:13.581
some gain. You can imagine
this keeps happening

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.328
incrementally. They keep
producing more and more

00:06:15.328 --> 00:06:17.595
and more. We kind of go
there, then we go there,

00:06:17.595 --> 00:06:19.859
then maybe we go there, then we go there.

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:23.168
Then maybe A cheats some more, then B

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:25.082
cheats some more, then A
cheats a little bit more,

00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:27.452
B cheats a little bit more,
maybe a little bit more

00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:29.753
past that, then A cheats
a little bit more.

00:06:29.753 --> 00:06:32.666
The whole time the whole
economic profit pie,

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:35.326
which is the sum of A
and B, is getting smaller

00:06:35.326 --> 00:06:37.179
and smaller until finally A finally cheats

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:40.828
and they're at zero economic profit.

00:06:40.828 --> 00:06:42.588
Now let's think about whether this is

00:06:42.588 --> 00:06:45.124
a Nash equilibrium.
Clearly, they won't want

00:06:45.124 --> 00:06:47.743
to move backwards. If you hold A constant,

00:06:47.743 --> 00:06:51.604
B would not want to
move down. Then he would

00:06:51.604 --> 00:06:54.858
lose economic profit. That doesn't work.

00:06:54.858 --> 00:06:56.442
He doesn't gain by doing
that. If you hold B

00:06:56.442 --> 00:06:58.665
constant, A wouldn't want
to move to the right.

00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:01.214
A would also lose economic profit.

00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:04.665
Now you might say what if
they produced beyond 37.5?

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:07.858
Why can't they keep producing
and go beyond there?

00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:12.469
Holding A constant, if B were
to produce more than 37.5

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:15.591
from this state right
over here, then the total

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.716
pie will get negative
and it doesn't matter

00:07:17.716 --> 00:07:20.176
if B's getting a larger or
smaller chunk of that pie.

00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:21.869
B's chunk is going to be negative.

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:24.057
He's going to drive down
the price even more.

00:07:24.057 --> 00:07:25.745
You can see it over here.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:27.744
If they increase quantity beyond

00:07:27.744 --> 00:07:31.416
this market quantity of 75, 37.5 each,

00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:36.592
if we go beyond that,
the price that they would

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:39.124
be selling at, at that
quantity over there,

00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:42.328
is lower than the average total cost.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.665
You're going to be, the total economic,

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:47.392
the average economic profit per unit

00:07:47.392 --> 00:07:49.414
is going to be negative.
There will be a total

00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:51.455
of negative economic profit.

00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:53.916
Neither of them will want to produce more

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:56.085
from this state either. All of a sudden

00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:59.126
in this topless state,
holding others constant;

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:01.660
if you hold A constant, B can't gain by

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.512
changing his strategy,
and if you hold B constant

00:08:04.512 --> 00:08:06.994
A can't gain by changing his strategy,

00:08:06.994 --> 00:08:12.952
so we are, up here, in a Nash equilibrium.

00:08:12.952 --> 00:08:14.582
This is a Nash equilibrium.

00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:18.933
Like the prisoner's dilemma, it was not

00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:21.688
the optimal state. The
optimal state was here,

00:08:21.688 --> 00:08:23.439
but because they both wanted to cheat,

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:25.281
they both wanted to do this one-upmanship,

00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:26.800
they both broke their contracts,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.192
they could end up in this state over here.

00:08:29.192 --> 00:08:31.367
But this state is stable.

00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:33.023
There's nothing holding
the other party equal.

00:08:33.023 --> 00:08:36.941
There's nothing that they could
do to change, to optimize.

00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:38.922
What they could do, and
this is not what Nash

00:08:38.922 --> 00:08:40.396
applies to, they could say okay,

00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:42.698
we've been really ruining
each others' business.

00:08:42.698 --> 00:08:45.730
Let's go coordinate again
and I'm going to decrease

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.993
production if you decrease production.

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:50.352
That is not, and they
could maybe try to go back

00:08:50.352 --> 00:08:52.798
to this state, and that does
not mean that this is not

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:56.436
a Nash equilibrium because
by coordinating again

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:58.525
we're not holding the others constant.

00:08:58.525 --> 00:09:01.103
We're saying I'm changing
my strategy while

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:03.590
you're changing your strategy. Maybe only

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.153
through another agreement
they could go over here.

00:09:06.153 --> 00:09:08.357
That still doesn't mean that this is not

00:09:08.357 --> 00:09:10.796
a Nash equilibrium. This
is a Nash equilibrium.

00:09:10.796 --> 00:09:13.062
If there's no coordination,
if you hold one player

00:09:13.062 --> 00:09:16.191
