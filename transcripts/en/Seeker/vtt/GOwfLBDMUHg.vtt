00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.220
The Large Hadron Collider is the largest and
most powerful atom smasher in the world.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.590
Built to hunt for new particles and probe
the fundamental forces of nature, this massive

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.990
machine is a 27 kilometer underground loop
filled with supercooled magnets and massive

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.910
detectors that whip particles at the highest
speeds possible, to eventually collide into

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.970
each other.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.980
And during one famous sprint in 2012, particles
collided, and the Higgs Boson was officially

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.980
discovered.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.070
"I would like to add my congratulations to
everybody involved in this tremendous achievement."

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.190
The Higgs is a special particle.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.330
Its presence confirmed the existence of an
invisible quantum field that’s responsible

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.559
for giving particles their mass.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.500
This field permeates the universe, leading
some to suspect that the Higgs may play an

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.570
important role in the origin of everything.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.610
But at this point, the Large Hadron Collider
and the community that built it are at a crossroads.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.500
Physicists haven't found the super symmetry
particles they were hoping to see.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.500
If they did, it would have solved some open
mysteries we have about the Higgs and the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.530
inner workings of the universe.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.990
This has created a huge international debate
over what to do next.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.639
For many at CERN, the institution that runs
the Large Hadron Collider, the next step in

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:25.619
the hunt for new physics is to build an even
bigger machine.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.709
People expected for 40 years before the Higgs
was discovered that the Higgs could not be

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:32.139
a lonely elementary particle.

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:37.080
It would have to come along with a lot of
other things in order to give a coherent,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.390
rational explanation for the origin of its
mass.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.669
And the big surprise since July 4, 2012, when
the Higgs was triumphantly discovered, is

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:46.810
that has not happened.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.039
So that's really four decades of a certain
paradigm for what's going on in physics associated

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.090
with the Higgs that has not worked out the
way that theorists had imagined that it would.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.479
And that's kind of fascinating.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.610
I think the last time something of this degree
of surprise happened in theoretical physics

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.319
was a little over 100 years ago.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.700
What nature has in mind for what the Higgs
is about is something different than what

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.099
theorists had in mind.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.280
While theorists are very confused about it,
the program for experimentalists is completely

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280
clear.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.470
When you run into a kind of elementary particle
you've never seen before, you’ve never seen

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.450
anything like it in physics before you just
put the damn thing under a microscope and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.130
you study it to death.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.590
It’s pretty remarkable that we need to build
enormous machines that produce an incredible

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.440
amount of energy to probe the smallest things
in the universe.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.730
And the push towards higher collision energies
to discover new particles is connected to

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.060
Albert Einstein’s famous equation, e=mc^2.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.000
There’s an equivalence here between energy
on one side and mass on the other side.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.470
When we collide two particles, we gain access
to the kinetic energy they carry.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.490
And out of this kinetic energy, new particles
can be made, according to Einstein's relation.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.620
And of course, the higher the energy that
we bring into this collision, the higher the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.070
mass of a particle that is forming out of
this energy can be.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.080
To get more juice out of the machine, CERN
shut the LHC down for performance upgrades.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.650
They’re working on cranking up the luminosity.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.660
Luminosity is a measure for the quality of
a collider.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.630
And in some sense, it tells you how many collisions
per second this collider can provide.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.280
When two of the elementary particles have
a head on collision, you can tell that happened

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.880
because the result of those collisions come
out at larger angles relative to the beams.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.290
But it's still an incredibly messy, kind of
complicated environment and even when we produce

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.319
new elementary particles like the Higgs, they
don't come out wearing a name tag saying I

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.910
am a Higgs, they decay in a blink of an eye.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.810
It's the results of those decays that experimental
colleagues have to sift through like they're

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.760
looking for a needle in a haystack in order
to actually see the evidence.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.150
This luminosity upgrade would ultimately produce
more collisions and would make measurements

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.940
of particles like the Higgs even more accurate.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.260
Once completed in 2026, it’ll produce an
estimated 15 million Higgs per year, compared

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.800
to the 3 million in 2017.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.989
It will be very beneficial to operate this
infrastructure until about 2035 or 2040.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.060
By then, we will have collected such a huge
amount of data from the collisions that we

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.509
somehow saturate the knowledge that can be
provided by this machine.

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:40.090
Operating it five years longer or 10 years
longer will not give significantly more information,

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.080
which means for particle physicists that the
useful time of life of this accelerator will

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.120
be reached.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.169
These time scales seem way out in the future,
but to put this in perspective: planning for

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.580
the Large Hadron Collider began back in the
1980s, construction was approved in 1994 and

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.090
the first runs didn’t start until 2008.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.560
So to prepare for what comes next, teams are
delivering conceptual designs for next generation

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.430
particle machines.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.949
There are proposals for an International Linear
Collider, which Japan just backed out on,

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.120
China has a circular collider project, and
there’s one from CERN.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.770
I'm in charge of the Future Circular Collider
Study.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.750
What we’re working on is really not an upgrade
of the LHC machine.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.569
It's really new machines to come after the
LHC era, so from 2040 onwards.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.090
It’ll take international collaboration,
billions of dollars, and scientists to invent

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.849
tools that don’t even exist yet.

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.169
First thing's first though, CERN wants a bigger
tunnel.

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.150
On a map, you can imagine you have a circle,
which is the LHC, and then you would put a

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.180
new circle that is roughly four times larger.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.650
The whole existing CERN accelerator complex,
including the LHC, would serve as a pre-accelerator

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.580
for this future 100 km machine.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.379
Like the gearbox in a car, if you want to
drive very fast you must have several gears.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:09.159
You start in a small gear at low velocity,
and once you accelerate, you go to the second

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.330
gear, third gear, fourth gear, fifth gear.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.879
This thing is very similar.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.250
We would start with small accelerators at
low energy, and then we go larger, larger,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.569
larger, and to higher energy, higher energy,
higher energy.

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.909
The CERN study presents a path forward to
achieve these energy gear shifts.

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:30.241
There’s a new lepton collider, which collides
electrons and positrons, a more advanced hadron

00:06:30.241 --> 00:06:36.220
collider, which collides protons and protons
and then heavy ions and then a third option,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.849
an electron-proton collider.

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:43.729
The big difference between an electron and
the proton, which are the two particles that

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:49.409
we have for these colliders, is essentially
that the electron and its anti-particle positron

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:54.210
are point-like particles that to our present
knowledge have no substructure.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.300
When we say the electron looks point-like
and the proton does not, it actually means

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.730
if you bounce things off the electron you
see that the way photons bounce off of it,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.069
you'll see that the electron has no substructure
of any sort.

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:14.199
Who knows, if we're probing things with microscopes
that are a million times stronger than anything

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:18.550
we've seen in some alien civilization that's
a million times stronger than the LHC, maybe

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.400
we would see some substructure to the electron
too.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.029
Or, if you believe string theorists, if we
look at ridiculously short distances, everything

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.800
is made out of some little loop of string.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.400
In what sense are things elementary or composite?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.319
But that's a story for another day.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.319
The Higgs is kind of point like, the Higgs
is sort of point liken and that's just not

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:43.240
good enough to sort of really settle this
theoretically dramatic question.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.969
We can try to measure all the known particles
like the Higgs particle, the W, and the set

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:52.909
particle in the top quark with the best precision
possible.

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:57.649
And for this, you will build this lepton collider,
because the lepton collider could produce

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:03.279
exactly these particles in a very clean environment,
in huge numbers.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:09.309
The electrons are super clean for collisions,
but we cannot reach extremely high energies.

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:15.189
The protons are a bit more dirty in the collision,
but we can accelerate them to far, far higher

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:16.189
energies.

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:20.339
Unlike the electron, a proton is not an elementary
particle.

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:27.469
The proton is kind of a big messy object that's
made up out of these smaller constituents

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:32.599
known as quarks that are held together inside
the proton by the imaginatively named gluons.

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:39.170
When we smash protons into each other at incredibly
high energies, one set is going this way at

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.910
.9999999 the speed of light, the others are
going the other way the same number of 9s

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.390
times the speed of light, and when they smash
into each other, mostly they go splat.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.770
And the debris of the collisions goes into
the direction of the beams that were coming

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.770
in.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:58.030
The next generation Hadron Collider would
smash protons together like the LHC, except

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.840
it'd reach energies of 100 trillion electron
volts.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.220
The Hadron Collider would provide much higher
collision energies that would allow direct

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.910
creation of, today not known particles.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.860
This boosted machine could be used as a tool
to search for theoretical particles like WIMPS,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.560
which are connected to dark matter.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.710
It’s one of the most abundant and mysterious
forms of matter in the universe, and we haven't

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.390
detected it directly yet.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.730
We might be able to, and answer other big
questions, by upping the power and tweaking

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.030
the detector's precision.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.770
A factor of 100 in precision is what we need
to decisively settle the question of whether

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:40.630
the Higgs looks more point-like than anything
we've seen before as far as its probes interact

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.060
with other particles, factor of 10 higher
in energy will let us produce billions of

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.060
Higgs.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.030
100 TV is what we need to settle this question
of the simplest model of weakly interacting

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.600
particles.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.780
The natural sequence is clearly to start with
a lepton collider, which is also a machine

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.520
that is today technically ready for construction.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:09.410
And in parallel to the operation and physics
analysis of this machine, you can use the

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:16.810
time to develop the very high field superconducting
magnets that you need for the successor machine.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.590
The magnets that we have presently operating
in the LHC tunnel can only reach eight or

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.360
nine Tesla, which is the magnetic field strength.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.410
So we want to double this to 16 or even higher.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.320
Magnets, is in this case the really big challenge
for such a project.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.010
All these things need to be addressed from
the very beginning in small setups because

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:43.650
you do not want to build 15 meter long heavy
magnets every time to test something new.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:49.070
While this project is an incredible scientific
endeavor, the price tag is very steep.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.570
These future colliders could cost over $25
billion dollars and would need investment

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.590
from the international community to even get
off the ground.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.560
For this decision process, there are several
aspects, of course.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.150
There's a scientific political one, there
is an economical one.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.960
There is of course also a physics community
process.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:13.070
And this is exactly what started out as a
bottom-up opinion making process, which is

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.100
taking place in Europe in the coming year.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.620
While the discussions continue, some have
even questioned whether an investment like

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.660
this is even the right course forward for
the particle physics community.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.950
There are questions over whether the science
case is as strong, if investing in this project

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.600
is worth the cost compared to other global
issues, and how we can be so sure a machine

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.200
of this magnitude can answer these big questions.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.130
There's a spectrum of possibilities for what
could be out there theoretically and so we

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.400
can’t know until we look.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.280
What's definitely true, is that no one who
is arguing for building these next machines

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.170
is now saying we should build them because
we expect to see particle x, we should build

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.370
them because supersymmetry is around the corner
or extra dimensions are around the corner,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.820
or anything like that.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.980
If you believe that the purpose of doing these
experiments is making new particles, it's

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.840
definitely time to take your ball and go home
and do something else with your life because

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.890
it cannot be guaranteed at all.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.520
I think it's one of the more profound things
that there is to say about this human adventure

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.590
of science.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:14.590
Period.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.870
Which is that everyone who works in fundamental
science has the sense that we're exploring

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.220
something that's out there.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.530
And something that's much much larger than
each one of us individually.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:30.550
So there's this gigantic structure in the
universe, it knows vastly more about the laws

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.550
of nature than we do.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.940
It is nature.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:39.060
By studying it, we put ourselves in the neighborhood
of something that's vastly more powerful,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.820
vastly deeper than any of us are individually.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.170
The only method that we know of to access
this tremendous power and depth, far beyond

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.720
what any of us have individually, is to interact
with it.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.430
And I think that's the ultimate source of
real magic that goes well beyond what humans

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.830
are capable of now, is out there in the structure
of the universe.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.140
And we only can find what it is by interacting
with it.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.120
And studying it.
