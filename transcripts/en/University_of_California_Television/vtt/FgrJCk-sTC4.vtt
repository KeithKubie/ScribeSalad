00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:01.220
(loud whoosh)
(click)

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.387
(beeping)

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:09.423
(cheerful piano music)

00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:12.183
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:14.683
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:21.716
lone the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:25.726
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:29.893
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.697
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.697 --> 00:00:37.437
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.520
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.052
We shape the future

00:00:42.052 --> 00:00:46.371
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:50.212
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:54.379
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.252 --> 00:00:57.997
an exploration made possible

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:01.080
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.753
(techno music)

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.509
(synthesizer music)

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:43.997
- And so, as you said, we
thought we should discuss

00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:46.999
this issue of suicide at this meeting

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.029
because it is something
which has almost certainly

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:54.205
had a major bearing on the
history of our own species.

00:01:54.205 --> 00:01:58.921
I've shown a panel from
a late Roman ivory casket

00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.058
which is in the British museum.

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.975
You'll see it shows two
very different examples

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:08.234
of humans who brought death
on themselves deliberately,

00:02:08.234 --> 00:02:11.202
Jesus, who had no desire to stop living,

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:14.650
but who believed his death
would benefit all mankind,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.155
and then Judas, who had no
thought of benefiting others

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:22.220
but assumed that by his own death

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.786
would at least put an end to
his own intolerable guilt.

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:30.638
Suicide used to be called
self murder (mumbles)

00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:32.950
It may seem hard to associate,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.954
harsh, I should say, to
associate suicide with murder,

00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:38.057
but if we're looking for

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.505
the evolutionary antecedence of suicide,

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:44.434
I think this does in fact
get us off on the right foot.

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:47.267
Humans have always been murderers.

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:50.991
First, of course, they'd been killers

00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.481
of other living beings, (mumbles) beings.

00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:57.186
First, of course, they were
killers of animal prey for food,

00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:58.759
and everybody in the community

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.429
would've been involved directly in that.

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.905
But they were also killers
of other human beings.

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:06.317
Not everyone would've had

00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:09.042
firsthand experience of assassination,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:12.252
but everyone would've known
about it and talked about it

00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:14.239
and no doubt celebrated it.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.802
And then the idea dawned.

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:20.885
Here's how psychiatrist
Erwin Stengel has put it.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.266
"At some stage of evolution,
man must have discovered

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:28.214
"that he can kill not only
animals and fellow men,

00:03:28.214 --> 00:03:30.315
"but also himself.

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:32.033
"It can be assumed that life

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:34.772
"has never since been the same for him."

00:03:34.772 --> 00:03:36.288
But, I think it wasn't so much

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:38.938
the discovery that he can kill himself

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:40.517
that would've changed things.

00:03:40.517 --> 00:03:41.738
It was the discovery

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:44.952
of what killing himself
would've amounted to,

00:03:44.952 --> 00:03:46.535
that it would've amounted to

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:49.504
removing himself from the world.

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:52.087
A human could choose not to be.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.700
That's why non-human animals
don't and can't commit suicide.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.546
At any rate, even if
they do kill themselves,

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:05.001
as perhaps these whales did,
we shouldn't call it suicide.

00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:08.262
That BBC headline clearly
did suggest we might.

00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:10.989
The whales can't have been choosing death,

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.495
because so far as we know,

00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:16.711
they haven't discovered what death means,

00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:18.939
which humans, of course, have done.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:20.744
Humans can choose death,

00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:23.691
knowing pretty well what it
will mean for them personally.

00:04:23.691 --> 00:04:25.699
And I think Stengel is right to say

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.013
that this discovery has
been transformative.

00:04:30.013 --> 00:04:33.759
But we still have to ask,
transformative in just what ways?

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.213
And if we're thinking
about human evolution,

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:39.940
the question must be,
what affects, good or bad,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.857
did this discovery have
on biological survival?

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.998
Other kinds of killing
can clearly be adaptive.

00:04:47.998 --> 00:04:52.772
It's easy to explain the
survival advantages of hunting.

00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:54.426
It's not difficult to explain

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:57.676
the advantages of war or homicide.

00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:00.068
But common sense would seem to say that

00:05:00.068 --> 00:05:04.446
self killing must be the
ultimately disadvantageous act,

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:07.509
a sure path to genetic oblivion.

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.008
Yet, the stark fact is that

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:13.496
suicide is alarmingly common
right across the world.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:14.805
Someone in the United States

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:17.483
kills themselves every 12 minutes.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:18.900
That's 120 a day.

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:22.976
Across the world, more
people die from suicide

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:26.059
than all wars and homicides combined.

00:05:27.648 --> 00:05:29.498
We surely have to ask, then,

00:05:29.498 --> 00:05:33.081
is suicide biologically
adaptive after all?

00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:35.777
Well, the answer is
not going to be simple.

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:37.766
As I implied with my first slide,

00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:39.723
I think we need to distinguish

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:42.223
two rather different kinds of suicide.

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:44.957
And we can call them, as Durkheim did,

00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:48.247
altruistic suicide and egoistic suicide.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.511
And I want to suggest they correspond

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:55.249
to two rather different
conceptions of what death does.

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.030
The first and simplest conception is that

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.486
death results in the
annihilation of the body.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:04.003
The dead person is no longer an actor

00:06:04.003 --> 00:06:06.456
in the physical or social world.

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:08.232
And corresponding to this,

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:11.785
when people choose to bring
about their own death,

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:14.989
they may be trying to make
things better for others

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:18.033
by giving up their own bodily presence.

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:19.373
Jesus died on the cross

00:06:19.373 --> 00:06:22.960
in the hope of becoming
the savior of all mankind.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.011
Or for a more straightforward example,

00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:27.948
Captain Oates stumbled
out to die in the snow

00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:30.203
in the hope of relieving the burden

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:34.719
for the remaining members
of Scott's polar expedition.

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:37.508
Altruistic suicide we can call that.

00:06:37.508 --> 00:06:40.676
But could this kind of
suicide be adaptive?

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:41.980
It certainly could be,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.718
provided it benefits the
subject's kin or social group.

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:47.011
In fact, it's possible that

00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:50.218
a propensity for altruistic suicide

00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:52.016
has been selected in humans

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:54.768
in rather the same way
that something like it

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:58.230
has been selected in the social insects.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.487
So maybe humans are
genetically predisposed,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:02.901
like ants or bees,

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:06.268
to sacrifice themselves
for the common good

00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:08.952
in times of famine or plague or war,

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:13.221
or simply when they become too
old and decrepit to carry on.

00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.953
But now let's look at
another kind of suicide,

00:07:15.953 --> 00:07:18.462
perhaps corresponding
to a second conception

00:07:18.462 --> 00:07:20.009
of what death does.

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.996
This is that death results in
the annihilation of the mind.

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:27.451
The dead person is no longer
a thinker or a feeler.

00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:30.017
And corresponding to this conception,

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:32.051
when people kill themselves,

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:35.704
they may be trying to make
things better for themselves

00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:38.937
by giving up on their
own conscious presence.

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:41.446
Judas Iscariot sought conscious oblivion

00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:46.026
because he could not live with
his internal sense of shame.

00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:49.211
This young couple could not bear the pain

00:07:49.211 --> 00:07:51.708
of being forbidden by
their families to marry.

00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:55.945
This is egoistic suicide,
and it's in many ways

00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:58.674
the absolute opposite
of altruistic suicide.

00:07:58.674 --> 00:08:00.931
Far from hoping to benefit others,

00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:05.535
these self killers are motivated
primarily by self interest.

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.013
They either don't care
about the effect on others,

00:08:08.013 --> 00:08:12.162
or sometimes they even intend
some kind of vengeance.

00:08:12.162 --> 00:08:14.050
And whether they intend it or not,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.026
the effects on family and
friends are often devastating.

00:08:18.026 --> 00:08:21.468
Now, here's the problem from
an evolutionary point of view.

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:25.722
The fact is that 90% of
suicides are egotistical.

00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:28.244
The World Federation for
Mental Health, for example,

00:08:28.244 --> 00:08:32.351
reports that the most common
situations or life events

00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:34.741
that might cause suicidal thoughts,

00:08:34.741 --> 00:08:36.742
they aren't to do with
helping other people.

00:08:36.742 --> 00:08:40.222
They're grief, sexual
abuse, financial problems,

00:08:40.222 --> 00:08:44.709
remorse, rejection, relationship
breakup, and unemployment.

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:46.574
And anthropologist Charles MacDonald,

00:08:46.574 --> 00:08:50.537
having surveyed suicide across
the whole world, concludes,

00:08:50.537 --> 00:08:53.033
"A cross cultural comparison shows that

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.932
"grief over and conflict
between closely related people,

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:59.923
"together with sheer
physical pain and discomfort,

00:08:59.923 --> 00:09:02.271
"cause or promote suicide more often

00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:04.218
"than any other circumstances.

00:09:04.218 --> 00:09:08.011
"The suicide simply
wants to stop hurting."

00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:11.033
What the egoistic suicide wants to achieve

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:14.231
is basically self euthanasia.

00:09:14.231 --> 00:09:16.820
Well, could this be adaptive?

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.965
Well, how could it possibly be?

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:22.699
Most egoistical suicides are young.

00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:25.021
Across the world, it's
the second most common

00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:27.914
cause of death amongst teenagers.

00:09:27.914 --> 00:09:30.223
If they had not died by their own hand,

00:09:30.223 --> 00:09:32.231
this couple hadn't died by their own hand,

00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:34.669
they would almost certainly
have got over the hurt

00:09:34.669 --> 00:09:38.682
and gone on to make a
success of their lives.

00:09:38.682 --> 00:09:40.437
Egoistic suicides ruin

00:09:40.437 --> 00:09:43.174
not only their own biological fitness,

00:09:43.174 --> 00:09:45.695
but those of related individuals, too.

00:09:45.695 --> 00:09:47.412
So what's going on?

00:09:47.412 --> 00:09:50.708
Why do these tragic deaths
happen so frequently?

00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:53.295
I think the answer is all too obvious.

00:09:53.295 --> 00:09:56.154
Humans and humans alone understand

00:09:56.154 --> 00:09:57.728
that by killing themselves,

00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:01.198
they can indeed stop the hurting.

00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:02.986
So there must be circumstances

00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:07.308
when they may well look on
suicide as a rational act.

00:10:07.308 --> 00:10:09.054
They feel sad or jealous

00:10:09.054 --> 00:10:12.351
or unloved or inadequate or whatever.

00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:15.969
These are feelings that
death will make go away.

00:10:15.969 --> 00:10:19.705
Nothing hurts less than being dead.

00:10:19.705 --> 00:10:20.872
In Hamlet's...

00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:23.189
Sorry.

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.747
What's more, as the poetry of suicide

00:10:25.747 --> 00:10:29.189
continually reminds us,
this solution to the hurting

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:30.975
may not only be rational.

00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:34.404
It must often be relatively easy.

00:10:34.404 --> 00:10:36.764
In Hamlet's notorious soliloquy,

00:10:36.764 --> 00:10:39.291
"Who would bear the
whips and scorns of time,

00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:42.291
"the oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely,

00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.698
"the pangs of despised
love, the law's delay,

00:10:45.698 --> 00:10:50.000
"when he himself might his
quietus make with a bare bodkin?"

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.374
A dagger.

00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:53.019
As Hamlet recognizes,

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:56.278
there's an unfortunate
truth about being human,

00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:59.758
probably more true of humans
than any other animal,

00:10:59.758 --> 00:11:03.008
and it is that hurting is part of life.

00:11:03.924 --> 00:11:06.930
The poet (mumbles) said it explicitly.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.335
"Everyone, every human, has
a good reason for suicide."

00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:13.756
The philosopher Wittgenstein
once told a friend

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.764
that all his life, there
had hardly been a day

00:11:16.764 --> 00:11:19.893
in which he hadn't thought
suicide a possibility.

00:11:19.893 --> 00:11:23.790
More typically, among today's
American high school students,

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.214
60% say they've considered
killing themselves.

00:11:27.214 --> 00:11:31.428
14% have thought about it
seriously in the last year,

00:11:31.428 --> 00:11:34.258
and five percent have attempted it.

00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:37.289
That's more than one
million students a year.

00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:41.259
Susan Sontag has written,
"How thin the line

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:44.954
"between the will to live
and the will to die?"

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.978
"How about a hole," she asks,

00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:49.972
"a really deep hole which
you put in a public place

00:11:49.972 --> 00:11:52.762
"for general use, in Manhattan, say,

00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:55.269
"at the corner of Seventieth and Fifth.

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:58.960
"A sign beside the hole reads,
'Four p.m. to eight p.m.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.946
"'Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays, suicide permitted.'

00:12:02.946 --> 00:12:05.215
"Just that, a sign.

00:12:05.215 --> 00:12:07.050
"Why surely, people would jump

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.954
"who had hardly thought of it before."

00:12:09.954 --> 00:12:12.691
As I said, it's not
only rational sometimes,

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.687
but it's also very easy.

00:12:14.687 --> 00:12:16.993
Now, this is a CARTA symposium,

00:12:16.993 --> 00:12:18.989
and we want to understand how humans,

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:20.765
against all the odds perhaps,

00:12:20.765 --> 00:12:23.967
have, in the end, survived and prospered.

00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:25.713
And it looks as thought suicide

00:12:25.713 --> 00:12:28.215
might have been a very significant drain

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.899
on the fitness of our ancestors.

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:33.540
Looks as though it might
have been a major downside

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.734
of their growing sufficiently clever

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:38.146
to understand their own mortality,

00:12:38.146 --> 00:12:40.781
the sequence Ajit talked about.

00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:44.212
It wouldn't have been dangerous
because they feared death,

00:12:44.212 --> 00:12:46.925
but because they were attracted to it.

00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:48.984
But surely, natural selection, then,

00:12:48.984 --> 00:12:51.052
ought to have sorted this out long ago.

00:12:51.052 --> 00:12:53.018
Why haven't humans evolved to have

00:12:53.018 --> 00:12:56.027
better innate defenses against suicide

00:12:56.027 --> 00:12:57.988
built into their mind?

00:12:57.988 --> 00:13:00.482
Of course, Ajit thinks they have.

00:13:00.482 --> 00:13:02.773
When reality becomes too much to bear,

00:13:02.773 --> 00:13:04.606
people simply deny it.

00:13:05.937 --> 00:13:09.789
But, I confess, I don't see
this working as he says,

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.780
or at least not in these contexts.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.724
I see no evidence that humans

00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:17.228
have evolved to have any
kind of natural immunity

00:13:17.228 --> 00:13:20.244
to what I've called the lure of death.

00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:21.946
To the contrary, I'm led to think

00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:24.499
that in the past, if not today,

00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:26.959
suicide might've spread like measles

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.721
in an unprotected population.

00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:31.749
In fact, measles is a surprisingly

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:33.974
alarmingly apposite analogy,

00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:38.769
because the suicide meme
happens to be highly infectious.

00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:40.695
It jumps from mind to mind,

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.526
resulting in the well
documented phenomenon

00:13:43.526 --> 00:13:45.431
of copycat suicides.

00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:49.274
As Durkheim wrote, "Suicide
is very contagious.

00:13:49.274 --> 00:13:51.521
"There is the well known
story of the 15 patients

00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:55.003
"who hung themselves in
swift succession in 1772

00:13:55.003 --> 00:13:58.987
"from the same hook in a dark
passage of the hospital."

00:13:58.987 --> 00:14:02.493
Suicide contagion has been
dubbed the Werther Effect

00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:05.259
after the hero of Goethe's novel,

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:08.486
The Sorrows of Young Werther.

00:14:08.486 --> 00:14:10.751
In the novel, Werther kills himself

00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:13.798
after falling hopelessly in
love with a married woman.

00:14:13.798 --> 00:14:16.712
Following its publication in 1774,

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:20.243
there where literally hundreds
of copycat deaths in Germany.

00:14:20.243 --> 00:14:23.662
Recent research has confirmed
just how strong the effect is.

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:26.017
Every time a celebrity suicide

00:14:26.017 --> 00:14:30.184
is given exposure in a newspaper
or TV, the copycats follow.

00:14:31.432 --> 00:14:35.531
It's estimated that Marilyn
Monroe's death in August, 1962

00:14:35.531 --> 00:14:39.521
was responsible for 200 actual
suicides within a month.

00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:43.963
After a popular South Korean
actress hung herself in 2008,

00:14:43.963 --> 00:14:48.914
suicides jumped 66% that month,
with young hanging victims

00:14:48.914 --> 00:14:52.247
accounting for most of the increase.

00:14:52.247 --> 00:14:55.451
But 66%, that's nothing.

00:14:55.451 --> 00:14:57.312
There are some parts of the world today

00:14:57.312 --> 00:15:00.698
where rates of suicide are 10
times the average elsewhere,

00:15:00.698 --> 00:15:04.648
and this turns out to be
largely to do with copying.

00:15:04.648 --> 00:15:06.582
Among these happy people

00:15:06.582 --> 00:15:09.274
on the island of Palawan
in the Philippines,

00:15:09.274 --> 00:15:11.200
MacDonald's research has documented

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.548
waves of suicide spreading
through small villages.

00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:15.903
The question becomes, then,

00:15:15.903 --> 00:15:18.703
how prevalent was suicide
amongst our ancestors,

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:20.950
say, 50,000 years ago?

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.768
I don't think any paleo-anthropologist

00:15:23.768 --> 00:15:25.707
has ever thought to ask.

00:15:25.707 --> 00:15:27.929
But assuming humans must by then

00:15:27.929 --> 00:15:30.954
have acquired an understanding of death,

00:15:30.954 --> 00:15:34.708
we can be quite sure there were suicides.

00:15:34.708 --> 00:15:37.447
And let's remember, times were harsh.

00:15:37.447 --> 00:15:39.864
In the icy climate of central Europe,

00:15:39.864 --> 00:15:42.463
there would've been plenty
to be unhappy about.

00:15:42.463 --> 00:15:45.285
I think we should allow the possibility

00:15:45.285 --> 00:15:47.763
that there were indeed recurrent plagues

00:15:47.763 --> 00:15:48.980
of egoistic suicide,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.220
with rates topping anything we see today.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.175
Well, if this is true,

00:15:54.175 --> 00:15:56.510
if there were these plagues of suicide,

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.710
and I think it's a genuine
scientific possibility,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.105
what could and did bring it under control?

00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:05.475
Assuming humans have never evolved

00:16:05.475 --> 00:16:08.180
adequate natural immunity to suicide,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.697
the antidote, whatever it
was, must have been cultural.

00:16:12.697 --> 00:16:13.865
And here I have to say

00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:17.546
the picture is complicated
and not well researched,

00:16:17.546 --> 00:16:20.251
but at least some of the
cultural barriers to suicide

00:16:20.251 --> 00:16:22.661
are indeed in plain view.

00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:25.485
In historical times, religious authorities

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:28.954
have regularly issued
anathemas against it.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.537
Medieval Christianity decreed

00:16:30.537 --> 00:16:33.440
that self murderers would go to Hell.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.300
Victims would not be
given a decent burial,

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.703
but rather be buried at
the crossroads at night

00:16:39.703 --> 00:16:42.179
with a stake through the heart.

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:44.520
In many countries, attempted suicide

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.927
has also been made a crime
under the common law.

00:16:47.927 --> 00:16:49.382
In the United Kingdom,

00:16:49.382 --> 00:16:53.549
attempted suicide was not
decriminalized until 1961.

00:16:54.993 --> 00:16:59.160
In the 10 years pre-1961,
there were 6,000 prosecutions.

00:17:00.474 --> 00:17:03.974
5,400 attempted suicides were found guilty

00:17:04.939 --> 00:17:07.752
and imprisoned or fined.

00:17:07.752 --> 00:17:10.525
It was common practice
in the 1950s in Britain

00:17:10.525 --> 00:17:13.032
to have a policeman sitting at the bedside

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:16.963
of an unconscious patient
in accident and emergency

00:17:16.963 --> 00:17:21.130
waiting to interview the
patient when he or she revived.

00:17:22.673 --> 00:17:24.023
There have also been attempts

00:17:24.023 --> 00:17:26.434
to limit the spread of the suicide meme

00:17:26.434 --> 00:17:28.643
by limiting exposure to it.

00:17:28.643 --> 00:17:31.231
In Europe, after the effect

00:17:31.231 --> 00:17:33.538
of Goethe's book became apparent,

00:17:33.538 --> 00:17:36.004
it was soon banned in several countries.

00:17:36.004 --> 00:17:37.807
In Germany, it was even forbidden

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.424
to dress like young Werther

00:17:39.424 --> 00:17:42.269
in blue coat and yellow trousers.

00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:45.800
In most countries today, there
are strict press guidelines

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.515
intended to play down
the reporting of suicide

00:17:48.515 --> 00:17:50.477
to keep it off the front page

00:17:50.477 --> 00:17:53.550
and to avoid sensational headlines.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.982
So we've had suicidal acts being punished

00:17:55.982 --> 00:17:58.491
and information about them suppressed.

00:17:58.491 --> 00:18:01.254
Do these measures actually work?

00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:03.556
Well, yes, I think there's reason to think

00:18:03.556 --> 00:18:05.512
they actually probably do.

00:18:05.512 --> 00:18:08.788
Or at any rate, there's no
reason to think that they don't.

00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:12.965
But surely more focused
methods ought to work, as well.

00:18:12.965 --> 00:18:15.491
In place of punishment or censorship,

00:18:15.491 --> 00:18:18.979
why not try to fight meme with meme?

00:18:18.979 --> 00:18:22.023
Why not oppose a destructive mind virus

00:18:22.023 --> 00:18:24.228
with a redemptive one?

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:28.513
What should we tell people
who want to kill themselves?

00:18:28.513 --> 00:18:30.235
The English priest Chad Varah

00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:33.472
founded The Samaritans in 1954,

00:18:33.472 --> 00:18:36.976
a group dedicated to talking suicides down

00:18:36.976 --> 00:18:39.188
with words of reassurance.

00:18:39.188 --> 00:18:40.930
The message, "There is hope,"

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.218
may seem to verge on the banal,

00:18:43.218 --> 00:18:45.202
but in fact it's the one message

00:18:45.202 --> 00:18:47.240
we can give with confidence.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.420
Research shows that in
nine cases out of 10,

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.721
the hurt isn't going to last.

00:18:52.721 --> 00:18:56.995
Here's Daniel Gilbert,
who already Ajit quoted,

00:18:56.995 --> 00:18:59.909
author of the book Stumbling on Happiness,

00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:01.617
"Few of us can accurately gauge

00:19:01.617 --> 00:19:03.738
"how we will feel tomorrow or next week.

00:19:03.738 --> 00:19:06.988
"We expect to feel devastated
if our spouse leaves us

00:19:06.988 --> 00:19:11.036
"or if we get passed over
for a big promotion at work,

00:19:11.036 --> 00:19:13.218
"but when things like that do happen,

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:16.252
"it's soon, 'She never was right for me,'

00:19:16.252 --> 00:19:19.946
"or, 'Actually I needed more
free time for my family.'

00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:22.764
"People mistakenly expect such blows

00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:26.203
"to be much more devastating
than they turn out to be."

00:19:26.203 --> 00:19:28.500
In a sense, it's a pessimism virus.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.781
We think things are
going to be really bad,

00:19:30.781 --> 00:19:34.220
so bad that we can do
nothing but end our lives,

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.488
but the message of this
research, I suppose,

00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:38.633
is don't jump now,

00:19:38.633 --> 00:19:42.714
because it's not what your
future self would choose.

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:43.936
But have we had to wait

00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:46.508
for a Harvard psychologist
to tell us this?

00:19:46.508 --> 00:19:48.016
No, thankfully not.

00:19:48.016 --> 00:19:52.899
The message is implicit,
presumably for a good reason,

00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:56.684
in much of the hand-me-down
wisdom of our old cultures,

00:19:56.684 --> 00:20:00.033
in stories and songs
and proverbs and so on.

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:03.430
And the good news for our
species is that on the whole,

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.519
with too many dreadful exceptions,

00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:08.502
hope can and does win out.

00:20:08.502 --> 00:20:10.509
And I think that's what basically

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:15.193
has taken us out of the Ice
Ages to where we are today.

00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:16.262
Okay.

00:20:16.262 --> 00:20:18.971
This is the closing talk of the symposium.

00:20:18.971 --> 00:20:23.480
We've heard a lot today about
what a bad thing death is.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.324
We haven't actually heard much about

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:27.491
what a good thing life is,

00:20:27.491 --> 00:20:30.423
which is in the end, of
course, the whole point.

00:20:30.423 --> 00:20:32.436
So I'll finish with a passage

00:20:32.436 --> 00:20:36.189
from George Borrow's
autobiographical novel, Lavengro,

00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:38.749
which echoes some of the things
actually Sheldon was saying.

00:20:38.749 --> 00:20:41.958
As Borrow tells it, he's
been reading Goethe,

00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.226
and it's an autobiography,
I think he had been,

00:20:44.226 --> 00:20:47.206
and he's toying with the idea of suicide.

00:20:47.206 --> 00:20:51.259
He gets into conversation
with a Romany Gypsy, Jasper,

00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:53.730
whom he's befriended on his travels.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.776
I'll read a passage from the novel.

00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:57.486
"What is your opinion of death?"

00:20:57.486 --> 00:21:00.754
said I as I set down beside him.

00:21:00.754 --> 00:21:03.288
Jasper replies, "Life is sweet, brother.

00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:05.802
"Who would wish to die?"

00:21:05.802 --> 00:21:08.273
"I would wish to Die," says Borrow.

00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:10.734
"You talk like a fool," says Jasper.

00:21:10.734 --> 00:21:12.401
"Wish to die indeed.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:16.682
"There's night and day,
brother, both sweet things.

00:21:16.682 --> 00:21:20.765
"Sun, Moon, and stars,
brother, all sweet things.

00:21:22.018 --> 00:21:24.033
"There's the wind on the heath, brother.

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:28.707
"If I could only feel that,
I would gladly live forever."

00:21:28.707 --> 00:21:32.204
Well, this painting is in fact
called The Wind on the Heath.

00:21:32.204 --> 00:21:36.384
And I think the good news is
that we've all been there.

00:21:36.384 --> 00:21:37.224
Thank you.

00:21:37.224 --> 00:21:39.182
(audience applauds)

00:21:39.182 --> 00:21:42.765
(upbeat synthesizer music)
