ALEX LEVICH: Hi everyone,
this is Alex Levich.

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:08.660
I'm a product manager at Google.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.680
Today we'll be talking
about product management.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.760
And we have a great
guest with us,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.900
Aparna, who is actually
building Google Now,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.819
the smart assistant
of the future.

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:19.360
Aparna's going to
share some insights

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.030
about the different skills
that product managers need.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.070
Welcome, Aparna.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.720
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Thank you.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.660
Happy to be here.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.730
ALEX LEVICH: Wonderful.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.130
Aparna, tell us, in your career,
what kind of skills did you see

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.380
is important for product
managers to have?

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.921
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
I think I mean,

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.740
if I were to draw the feature
spec for a PM, if you will,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.020
I think the baseline
characteristic that I look for,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.360
and I think that's a huge
predictor of your success,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
is growth mindset.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.200
Right?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.010
That is, are you able to think
of an experience, a failure,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.410
and actually say, what are
the things that you can learn

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.785
from it, and what are the
specific learnings that you can

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.190
apply in the next
phase of your career

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.640
or next phase of your
project, and so on.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.290
And that sounds
super cliche, right?

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.582
Everyone's talking about this
growth mindset and like--

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:03.498
ALEX LEVICH: So important
for in our industry.

00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:04.480
Changes every day.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.771
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Exactly,
I mean it's super cliche

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.500
to say this, but in the tech
industry, the way you succeed

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.410
is by failing.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.300
Take every successful
product worth its salt,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.980
both within Google, but also
apps like Twitter or Instagram

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.770
or the recent one, Slack,
where literally, it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910
grew out of a failed
gaming startup, right?

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.580
And it's unclear
that you can actually

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.020
get to good instincts
and good judgment

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.470
without actually burning
your hands and experiencing--

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.300
ALEX LEVICH: It's all
feelings and learning, yeah.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.960
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
So to me, I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.418
think that's a huge
characteristic.

00:01:32.418 --> 00:01:37.310
If you're unable or unwilling
to learn from failure,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.330
that's a difficult transition
to make into PM because that's

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.560
exactly how you learn.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.740
I do think the
typical skills that

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.240
are useful for a successful
product manager--

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.650
and these three
things are things

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.024
that I keep thinking
about, which

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:52.740
is one is, I mean the
name is product manager,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.380
so you do need to
have product judgment.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130
And again, that's not something
that you're born with or not.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.940
It's something that's honed
and developed repeatedly.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.990
But the instinct about
what makes-- you're

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.290
in the business of
making useful products.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.120
ALEX LEVICH: Useful
products, yeah.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.790
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
You need to have

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.539
a good judgment and a nose
for what's useful versus not.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.410
That's table stakes.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.830
I think the second thing I think
about is more around execution,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.540
and specifically, OK, it's great
you have a great product plan.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.350
But you're here.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.260
How do you actually
build that onramp?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.455
How do you break down things
into manageable stuff?

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:29.705
ALEX LEVICH: How do you
translate vision into reality?

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:29.990
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Right?

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.090
Into reality.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.680
And to me, a lot of product
managers kind of struggle

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.505
there because they're
either really good

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.720
at painting this
20,000 feet picture

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.324
or really good at the
day-to-day minutiae.

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:42.740
ALEX LEVICH: You
mentioned failure

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.320
as part of growth mindset.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320
That's very interesting.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.690
Tell us about a failure of
yours where you learned a lot.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.570
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
So in my own case,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.660
I think one of the
examples that comes to mind

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.550
is-- when I first joined Google,
I was working on these projects

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.830
with-- so I was the PM
for this research team

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.840
that was doing amazing
things with computer vision.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.380
And one of the product ideas I'd
come up with is, wait a minute,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.730
we have YouTube.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.860
Can we apply this
computer vision technology

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.687
to detect objects within videos?

00:03:11.687 --> 00:03:13.270
Wouldn't it be cool
if you could say--

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.490
ALEX LEVICH: I think it's cool.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.865
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
--hey, this

00:03:14.865 --> 00:03:16.420
is a racing car,
a race car video.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.510
Or this is a video with a
helicopter or whatever, right?

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.200
ALEX LEVICH: That's what people
are still trying to do today.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.366
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: They're
still trying to do it,

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.259
and now, the thing
that was-- well,

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.550
it was a failure, first of all.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.000
It didn't go anywhere.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.100
But the reason it was a
failure, or in retrospect,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.490
what I learned was that
it was a bit too early.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.190
That is, the stage of
YouTube as a product

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.310
there was-- the product
was just getting traction.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.070
There's some basic
first startup problems

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.910
that the team was
trying to solve.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.060
Basically, being able to say,
I don't know, Justin Bieber,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.050
and find videos.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.050
ALEX LEVICH: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.341
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Or
being able to monetize a site,

00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:53.200
being able to scale
the bandwidth issues.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.320
And so here I was, I had
this futuristic idea.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.464
And it was just too early.

00:03:57.464 --> 00:03:58.880
So that's one
lesson I've learned.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.840
That's one kind of failure
where there's a timing issue.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.410
You can do everything right.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.990
ALEX LEVICH: That makes sense.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.230
Yeah.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.100
You got to-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.891
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
So that's one mistake

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:07.960
that I won't make again.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.860
There'll be others.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.560
ALEX LEVICH: Tell us
about you personally.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.930
Across your career,
what are the skills

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.120
that made you personally be
great, be very successful

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.269
product leader?

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.605
Whether it's at Google Now or
before, what comes to mind?

00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:24.980
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
I think one

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.190
of the things I've been able
to do again by just learning

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.130
and improving is this onramp
that I talk about between

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.410
there's a huge,
very powerful idea,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.890
and there is basically
us at the start--

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.140
ALEX LEVICH: At the beginning.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.210
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
--at the beginning.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.600
And how do you actually
build this onramp from here

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.290
to there, but in a way that's
sustainable and tractable.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.960
Right?

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.390
ALEX LEVICH: And brings
user value along the way.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.848
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: And brings
user value across the way.

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:53.800
And I think it's one
of those things where

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.350
if you do it too-- if you
build a very steep onramp,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.130
you may get far enough soon,
but very soon you'll burn out.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.590
You kind of slip back.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.390
And if it's too
slow, then you just

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.492
don't get enough
momentum, right?

00:05:08.492 --> 00:05:09.700
So that's one thing at least.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.850
So for a--

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.600
ALEX LEVICH: It's
a tough balance.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.240
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
It's a tough balance.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.760
ALEX LEVICH: Very important.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.176
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Right, and I

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:15.816
think it's the trade off between
how do you actually build

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:17.190
the right set of
initial features

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.860
that still makes the
product successful

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.980
and engaging, but then
not say that, oh yeah,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.842
we'll throw the kitchen
sink into the first version.

00:05:23.842 --> 00:05:25.800
Which is a temptation
for all product managers.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.250
ALEX LEVICH: Yes.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.291
I was kind of watching
you guys build Google Now.

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.300
You have this amazing
vision, this assistant

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.652
of the future that knows
everything and helps

00:05:32.652 --> 00:05:33.610
with everything, right?

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.650
And we are kind of
in the beginning.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.890
And we see more and
more and more and more.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.240
So that's fascinating to see.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.540
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Yeah, and it's

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.248
very tempting because
you say, OK, you're

00:05:41.248 --> 00:05:42.910
frustrated that, oh,
the product should

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.337
be able to do everything
and then some.

00:05:46.337 --> 00:05:48.420
But the reality is that
you have to pace yourself.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.730
You have to steadily
increase the user value here.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.710
ALEX LEVICH: What are you most
excited about from Google Now?

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.876
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: I'm
just motivated by the fact

00:05:56.876 --> 00:05:59.350
that these phones
have kind of turned

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.460
3.5 billion users into
broadcasting machines, right?

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.640
It's a whole bunch
of information

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.430
being generated all the while
by so many folks talking.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.050
And now suddenly-- but in a
world where everyone talking,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.260
you just need to have the
selective listening, right?

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.700
You--

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.980
ALEX LEVICH: Absolutely.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.445
There's way too much
information, information

00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:15.580
overload.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.840
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: There's
way too much information.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.340
Yeah.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.660
And you have to be able to pay
attention to the information

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.315
that you need, and
that you can act on

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:25.190
that makes your life,
the day-to-day hundreds

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.856
and hundreds of
micro-decisions that you

00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:28.680
make throughout the day better.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.160
And I feel like
we have a chance,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.090
we have a crack at
solving that problem.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.300
ALEX LEVICH: It's not
about adding information.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.160
It's about reducing
information--

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.950
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
It's about filtering it

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.000
down to what you want.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.500
Yeah.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.290
