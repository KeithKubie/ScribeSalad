00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.420
[music playing]

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.600
NARRATOR: Outside the
White House, the last hour

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.514
of the last day of World War II.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:17.117
Here, and across the nation,
tense crowds await the end.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.425
Inside, newsmen are
summoned to the president's

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.827
office to see history made.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.497
I deem this reply a full
acceptance of the Potsdam

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.169
Declaration, which specifies
the unconditional surrender

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.703
of Japan.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:41.574
In the reply, there
is no qualification.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:44.510
Arrangements are now being
made for the formal signing

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:49.582
of the surrender terms at
the earliest possible moment.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:51.417
General Douglas
MacArthur has been

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.254
appointed the Supreme
Allied Commander to receive

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:57.423
the Japanese surrender.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.726
The proclamation
of VJ Day must wait

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.597
until the formal signing of
the surrender terms by Japan.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.467
NARRATOR: Reporters make a
dash for official handouts.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.203
Within a matter of minutes,
the historic news is flashed

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.206
to every country on the globe.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.142
Meanwhile, New York crowds
have been waiting day and night

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:17.677
for word from Washington.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.413
It is two minutes after
7:00, nerves keyed

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:23.316
to the breaking point by
last minute Jap stalling,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.752
by rumors and denials that
surrender is on its way.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.689
Then, the news
hits Times Square.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.525
[cheering]

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.504
All the pent-up joy of five
days waiting is unleashed.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:48.241
New York and Main Street
everywhere pulls out the stops

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.109
and lets go.

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.883
Yes, from coast
to coast, victory

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.918
gets a spontaneous welcome.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.721
San Francisco, blacked
out and constantly alerted

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.924
against Jap treachery,
uncorks the pent-up emotions

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:06.759
of almost four years.

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:12.598
Market Street is a mad house,
but who cares on VJ Day?

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:16.536
In Seattle, Boeing workers,
builders of those giant B-29s

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.538
take some time off at last.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.740
Downtown, at 4th
and Pike Streets,

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:23.409
they see sailors
lift automobiles,

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.279
soldiers kiss pretty
girls, a little trouble,

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.613
but only a little.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:30.683
Then, the Navy takes up
the girl-kissing detail

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.585
and the carrying off
of beautiful maidens.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:38.824
A marathon celebration, as
happy war-working Seattle

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.827
roars its tribute to victory.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.564
The Midwest gives voice too.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.967
At State and Madison, joy is
really breaking out all over.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.438
And the jam-packed Loop
keeps it up all night.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.974
Down south in Atlanta,
it's the same story.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.511
All of north Georgia tries to
squeeze into Peachtree Street,

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:01.714
as people did in every
town in every state.

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:06.252
But VJ Day has a grim side too.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:09.989
Wounded vets at Atlanta's Lawson
General Hospital hear the news.

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:12.792
These men know the
true price of victory.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.727
For them, the war
will never end--

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.461
never quite.

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:21.467
But back in New
York, Chinatown casts

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.869
aside its usual quiet dignity.

00:03:23.902 --> 00:03:26.472
Ritualistic dragons,
symbols of peace,

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.708
cavort along Pell
and Mott Streets.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:33.546
Happy end to eight bitter
years of Jap aggression.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.881
In nearby Mulberry
Street, Little Italy

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:38.484
makes with the noise and
dancing in the street,

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:43.356
a colorful corner of the
big-town celebration.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.892
But it's at Times Square
New York really let's go.

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:51.497
Two million people jammed
into 10 blocks, and listen.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.301
[commotion]

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:58.504
The Great White Way is itself
once more, only more so.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:01.007
And this joyous din
keeps up all night.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.609
But comes the dawn an
even blas  New York

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:05.978
seems to have exhausted itself.

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.881
[music playing]

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.788
But wake up their, son.

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.491
This war was big enough
for two celebrations.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.660
And sure enough, the
entire show starts

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:21.961
all over again by daylight.

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:28.901
The kissing, the impromptu
entertainment, the biggest,

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:31.637
noisiest celebration
in New York's history.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.541
Two days of needed popping off
before we face the realities

00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:39.011
of peace in a world which
contains a new cosmic force,

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:41.914
the atomic bomb.

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:42.947
