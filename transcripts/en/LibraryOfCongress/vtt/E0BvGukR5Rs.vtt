00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Okay,
I think we're waiting

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.950
for one participant who's a couple
minutes away, but we'll go ahead

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.300
and start and he can
join when he gets here.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.020 position:56%
Welcome to the roundtable discussion
for the Copyrights Office study

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.040
on Section 1201 of the DMCA.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.520
Thank you for being here.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.050
My name is Regan Smith,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.340
I'm Associate General Counsel
of the Copyright Office.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.370
As you know, the Office is
conducting this study in accordance

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.590 position:56%
with a request from the House
Judiciary Committee's ranking member

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.690
in response to the Register
of Copyrights' Testimony

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.510
in a 2015 Copyright Review
Hearing regarding the impact

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.730 position:56%
and the efficacy of Section 1201 and
the triennial rulemaking process.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.910
If you're hear, you're probably
familiar with 1201, but just,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.960
I wanted to provide a
little bit of background

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.820
into the statute and
how it was enacted.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.990
1201 is part of the
DMCA enacted in 1998.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.460
And in enacting it,
Congress recognized

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.830
that technological protection
measures could be deployed not only

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.370
to prevent piracy and other
economically harmful unauthorized

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.960
uses of copyrighted material,
but also to support new ways

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.980
of dissemination of copyrighted
material to users digitally.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.350
So Section 1201 protects
circumvention

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.690
of technological measures employed
on or behalf of copyright owners

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.190
to control access to their
works known as access controls,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.350
as well as anti-trafficking
provisions preventing trade

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.050
in either services or tools of
access controls or copy controls

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.340
that protect rights to
copyright owners under Title 17.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.700
Section 1201 also includes a
triennial rulemaking process

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.450
by which the Librarian of Congress,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.550
following a public proceeding
conducted by the Copyright Office,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.020
in consultation with NTIA,
can grant limited exceptions

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.990
to Section 1201(a)(1)'s bar on the
circumvention of access controls.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.060
The rulemaking is intended
as a failsafe mechanism

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.480
through which the Copyright
Office can monitor developments

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.020
in the marketplace and recommend
limited exemptions to protect --

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.390
to prevent the restriction of
fair and non-infringing uses.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.480
The rulemaking has expanded
with each successive cycle.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.360
In the first rulemaking, the Office
received nearly 400 comments,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.280
and that resulted in the
granting of two exemptions.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.540
In the sixth rulemaking, which
was concluded last October,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.770
we received nearly 40,000 comments.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.550
We considered 27 categories and
granted 22 of the exemptions.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.880
Some of the categories in the last
rulemaking concerned the ability

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.180
to access and make
non-infringing uses of works

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.350
such as motion pictures,
ebooks, and videogames.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.090
But others concerned access
to copyrighted computer code

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.820
in consumer devices ranging
from cell phones to smart TVs,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.650
automobiles, tractors, 3D
printers and pacemakers.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.420
The Registrar said
in her recommendation

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.230
that while it's clear 1201
has played an important role

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.060
in developing secure platforms
for digital distribution

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.170
of copyrighted works, it
is also impacting a range

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.110
of consumer activities
that have little to do

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.940
with the consumption
of creative content.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.170
It also has become obvious that
the regulatory process has become

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.930 position:56%
burdensome for participants in these
rulemakings, especially when seeking

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.590
to renew exemptions and that
the permanent exemptions,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.700
such as for security research,
encryption research, or privacy,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.550
may have not adequately
foreseen some

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.890
of the developments since the DMCA.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.330
So this is the genesis
for our study.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.100
We thank you for submitting
your written comments

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.400
which we're looking
at, and we're hoping

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.840
that these roundtables will
facilitate a deeper discussion.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.250
Kevin is going to explain
the logistics

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.590
and then kick off panel one.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.890
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Good morning.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.190
My name is Kevin Amer.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.660
I'm Senior Counsel in
the Office of Policy

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.710
and International Affairs
here at the Copyright Office.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.000
Before we begin, I'd just like to
go over a few logistical items.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.850
First, the -- the roundtable
sessions will be moderated

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.390
by us here at the table.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.990
We will pose questions or
-- or topics for discussion.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.390
And we ask that to indicate that
you would like to be recognized,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.750
you please turn your
name card vertically.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.630
This will be familiar to some
of you who've been to WIPO,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.480
and we'll then call on you.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.490
Just given the number of
panelists and the number of topics

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.630
that we are hoping to cover,
we ask that you please try

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.280
to limit your comments to
about two to three minutes.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.890
We apologize profusely
in advance, if --

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.040
if you do go over substantially,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.520
we will unfortunately
have to cut you off.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.010
We -- you know, we appreciate
your understanding as we try

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.190
to accommodate a lot of
different viewpoints and hear

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.070
from a broad range of speakers.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.270
We also ask, obviously,
that you focus your comments

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.070
on the particular topics that we
provided in our notice of inquiry

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.430
or to particular questions
that -- that we raise.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.630
Also, we've been asked if --
if at the end of your comment,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.610
if you could please
turn off your microphone

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.070
because that avoids interference
on the sound recording.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.230
Second, as you can see, today's
event is being video recorded

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.770
by the Library of Congress.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.210
Panelists, we've provided you
with a video release form.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.000
If you haven't yet signed
it, please do so and --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.340
and return it to one of
us here at the table.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.020
In addition, as you can see, we --

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.820
we do have a court reporter
transcribing the proceedings.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.940
And finally, just before we
begin, we'd just like to note

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.880
that we may seek additional written
comments in response to some issues

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.220
that may come up during
the roundtables.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.230
If we do, we obviously will
provide a formal notice of inquiry.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.320
So at this time, I'd like to
ask everyone in the audience

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.240
to please turn off or mute
any cell phones or devices

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.160
that could interfere
with the recording.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.690 position:56%
Does anyone have any questions about
logistics before we get started?

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.990
Okay. Great.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.290
Before we begin, I'd just

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.900
like to ask my other
Copyright Office colleagues

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.510
to introduce themselves quickly.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.930
&gt;&gt; Abi Mosheim: I'm Abi Mosheim.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.400
&gt;&gt; Jason Sloann: I'm Jason

in the General Counsel's Office.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And then, if we
could just go around the table,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.260
if you all could just
please introduce yourself

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.010
and your affiliation,
we'll start with Mr. Adler.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.310
[ Inaudible Microphone Off ]

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.990
Oh, if you would, turn on
your microphone, if you would.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.290
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Sure.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.800
I think it was on, right.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.930
Oh, okay. My name is Allan Adler.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.280
I'm general counsel and Vice
President for Government Affairs

&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: I'm Troy Dow

&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani: My
name is Raza Panjwani.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.930
I'm a Policy Counsel
at Public Knowledge.

&gt;&gt; Stan Pierre-Louis:
I'm Stan Pierre-Louis.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.460
I'm the General Counsel of the
Entertainment Software Association

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.240
and we represent the
U.S. videogame industry.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.700
&gt;&gt; George Slover: George

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.450
for Consumers Union, the policy

&gt;&gt; Brian Weissenberg:
I'm Brian Weissenberg.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.930
I'm a law student at Stanford Law

representing the Institute of
Scrap Recycling Industries.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.110
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Jonathan Zuck
from ACT, The App Association.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.410
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Great.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.450
Well, welcome everyone.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.140
So the first session is entitled
"Relationship of Section 1201

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.740
to Copyright Infringement,
Consumer Issues and Competition,"

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.320
and this session will explore
the role and effectiveness

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.070
of Section 1201 in
protecting copyrighted content

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.230
and will consider how the statute
should accommodate interests

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.550
that are outside of
core copyright concerns.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.730
So I think we wanted to start just
by getting your view on asking sort

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.990
of a big picture question
and getting your views on --

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:43.250
on the overall role and
effectiveness of Section 1201.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:49.260 position:56%
We had a lot of comments noting the
-- the different distribution models

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.910
that TPMs have facilitated.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.540
And I think some other
comments, you know,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.860
we had several examples of those.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.510
We had some other comments
that I think questioned sort

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:07.190
of the relationship between the
legal protection of TPMs and --

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.090 position:56%
and the effectiveness of those TPMs.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.590
So I think we'd be interested,
just sort of in your general views,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.900
about the extent to which the
legal protections provided by --

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:24.040 position:56%
for TPMs, provided under Section
1201 contribute to the effectiveness

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.510 position:56%
of technological protection measures
in protecting copyrighted content.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:37.050
[ Silence ]

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.120
Mr. Band?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.780
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So I think,
as lawyers, we like to feel

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.090 position:56%
that we have an impact on the world.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.940
But I have a feeling that in this
area, you know, the -- the --

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.510
the technological protection
measures,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.050
to the extent that they've been
effective in protecting the rights

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.650
of copyright owners, it's

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.930
because the technological
protection measures have been

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.160
technologically effective.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.660
We saw early on ineffective
measures such as CSS

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.030
that were very easy to hack.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.760
And, you know, the -- the -- the
-- the technology to hack it,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.070
DeCSS, was widely available.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.580
There was some hacking
of it, some not.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.710
But -- but we now are,
you know, in --

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.590
in generations way beyond that
in terms of the effectiveness

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.970
of technological protection
measures, especially with respect

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.950 position:56%
to all -- all kinds of content
that's in the cloud and you have to,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.760
you know, behind very
secure paywalls.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.550
And I -- I think that the --

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.770
the law has nothing to do with
the effectiveness of those --

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.600
of those systems, certainly to
the extent that one's worried

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.340
about the general public.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.660
I mean, I'm sure some people hack

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.030
into those systems
from time to time.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:06.130
But what makes those work --
and they work very well --

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.450
is the technology, not the
-- not the legal protection.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.900
And to the extent that
one's worried about hacking

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:17.260 position:56%
and this unlawful hacking into these
systems, you have the Computer Fraud

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.620
and Abuse Act and you have --

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:24.420 position:56%
every state has its own anti-hacking
statute, so there's -- there's --

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.550
there's this whole other array
of laws that come into effect.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:35.860
So I think, certainly as they are
in the current form, I think the --

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.820
the 1201 protections really have
very little to do with the success

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.890
of -- of these technological
protection measures.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.190
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.490
Mr. Adler?

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.310
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: I think it was
recognized very early on, in fact,

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.910
because this legislation,
as we know, was the result

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.580
of an international
treaty that determined

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.780 position:56%
that legal protections were
important for technological measures

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.120
that were used to control
access to copyrighted works.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.150
And that was not an accident
because I think the --

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.280
the commonsensical proposition
there is that having the ability

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.570
to use locks, if you will,
or technological measures

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:23.280
to control access, means nothing
if there are no legal restrictions

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.380 position:56%
against people violating those locks
or others in creating the devices

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.470
or offering services
to violate those locks.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.370
So when -- when this legislation
was enacted, it wasn't surprising

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.520
that the House Judiciary Committee
compared the use of this to, quote,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.020
electronic equivalent of breaking
into a locked room in order

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.030
to obtain a copy of a book.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.320
The idea here was all about access.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.300
It is to facilitate consumer
access to works online

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.190
because that would be
convenient, because it was viewed

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.930
that that would cut expenses,
it would cut against the --

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.840
the difficulties people
have in finding these works.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.020
But the notion of bringing access
online meant that access had

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.140
to be secure in the
face of all the ways

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.950
in which online digital
networks are susceptible

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.440
to having people engaging
in unauthorized activities.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.050
So we think that the legal
protections were a necessary part

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.460
of the notion that copyright owners
could use technological protection

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.660
measures in order to make
their works conveniently

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:36.980
and ubiquitously available online
and that's been a wild success.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.280
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.560
Mr. Zuck?

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.860
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Thank you,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.760
and thanks for having
me here this morning.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.970
I -- it -- I may date
myself a little bit,

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:51.210 position:56%
but I remember very clearly going to
Egghead Software and buying a copy

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.160
of a piece of software called
Copy II PC, and that's how,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.950
in my younger unruly days, I copied
software that I wanted to use

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.310
because it took -- it took
creating copyrighted material

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.320 position:56%
to respect it in my particular case.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.220
I think the real purpose
of the legal allowances

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.850 position:56%
and the legal prohibitions that
1201 offers is taking the technology

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.520
out of the mainstream.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.470
It's not an all-or-nothing
proposition.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.770
There's still going to be hackers.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.390
There's still going to be people
that gain access to technology.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.600
But the widespread acceptability of
that technology, that I just walk

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.040
into a Best Buy, for example, and
buy software to break encryption,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.040
is I think what really
is changed by the --

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.100
the legal provisions
that are put in place.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.530
So that's -- that's the connection.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:45.240
I think it has to do with -- with
numbers more than it does a sort

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.570 position:56%
of binary connection that -- between
the two, if that makes sense.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: I think
Mr. Panjwani was next.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.060
[ Silence ]

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.360
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani: Thank you.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.060
When the WIPO Copyright
Treaty was adopted

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.260
and the United States was
considering enacting the Digital

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.990
Millennium Copyright Act,
the consideration I believe

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.940
at the time -- I wasn't
there personally --

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.760
was that there was a necessity
to provide protections

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.380
for rights holders in
order to encourage them

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:21.290
to provide digital goods and
to distribute them online.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:26.580
One of the things we have seen
is that DRM is not necessary

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.880
for a number of business models.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.340
And business owners are entitled to
choose how they wish to distribute,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.840
but we've seen the adoption of
iTunes taking a DRM-free stance,

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.000
we have seen CD Projekts GOG.com
game distribution platform sells

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.860
both classic and newer
releases without DRM,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.670
the Tor Book in print also
releases ebooks without DRM.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.260 position:56%
In the last 7 to 10 years, we've
seen a move away from the assumption

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.100
that DRM is absolutely necessary
to have a digital economy.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.440
Considering that Section
1201 takes that assumption

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.190 position:56%
and then burdens the public's rights
to engage in non- infringing uses

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.190
in order to provide
these protections,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.310
I think it's worth reengaging
in a cost-benefit analysis

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.390
of to what extent do we still need
these very high barriers in order

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.200
to encourage digital distribution.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.850
Beyond that, I think it's
worth talking about the fact

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:24.200 position:56%
that how effective 1201 has actually
been in curtailing digital piracy,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.680
which is something that
Congress explicitly called

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:32.260
out in its legislative history as
a reason for enacting Section 1201.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.320
In our comments, we pointed
to a number of statements

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.790
by various copyright industries
decrying the level of piracy

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.200
that is occurring online
and digitally.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.880 position:56%
And I -- while I know some folks
have responded by saying that, well,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.880
we need to look at the
digital markets we've created,

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.910
the content that has been allegedly
made available by circumventing DRM

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.480
and that is available in these
marketplaces is the same,

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.900
it's not separate.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:02.700
And I think separating these two
sort of conflates correlation

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.550
and causation, that because of
DRM, we now have digital markets.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.880
I don't think that's
necessarily true.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.900
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: How do
we sort of get at that?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.360
I mean, in -- in your experience as
-- I'll open this up to everyone --

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.690
as practitioners, is
-- is it your sense

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.580
that 1201 actions are --
are relatively common?

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.870
Is this -- I mean, I think we had
some disagreement in the comments

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:30.530
as to sort of how commonplace
1201 actions are.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.970
I'd be interested in -- in
your thoughts on that or to --

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.420 position:56%
to pick up on the previous question.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.460
I think Mr. Pierre-Louis was next.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.770
&gt;&gt; Stan Pierre-Louis: Thank you.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:46.190
In about a month, ESA will
be hosting the E3 Tradeshow

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.050
which is our -- the world's
premier videogame tradeshow

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.910
where you've got consoles
with new capabilities,

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.220
new games and software.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.470 position:56%
All that's made possible because of
the twin goals achieved by the DMCA.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.710
When it was passed in 1998, the --

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.160
the thought was, we want
to expand consumer access

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.250
to broadband and to
new technologies.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.280
And one of the ways
we encourage that is

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.810
by getting copyrighted content
online and on other devices.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.690
And part of those twin
goals involved 1201.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.470
We've seen that growth which
makes not only our tradeshow

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:29.730
but our industry a growing
one, $23.5 billion now, the --

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.990
the largest of the media
companies -industries.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.970
And that happens because
we know that our investment

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.540
in our technologies
and in our software

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.040
and in our copyrighted
content will get protected.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.310
When we're talking about
various companies deciding

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.270
to issue certain content
DRM-free, that's a choice.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.450
1201 doesn't require --
is not a required statute.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.630
It's -- it's one that says, if
you implement this technology,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.830
it will have the force of law
if someone tries to bypass it.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.270
But you don't have to use it.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.600
And we've seen many models,
even within our own industry,

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.010
with people putting
out games that are free

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.290
to play and freemium models.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.520
And so, we've seen
the various models win

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.660
out because different games

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.880
and different companies
have different goals.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.350
It doesn't mean one is mandated and
certainly there's no tech mandate

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.700
in it, but I think, if
companies decide to go DRM-free,

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.460
that's certainly not only allowable

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.220
but that's another way
to access consumers.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.000
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Picking up on
Kevin's question, in your industry,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.430
are you aware of instances of using
1201 as an enforcement either,

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.700
you know, in courts
or prior to litigation

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.140 position:56%
to protect the integrity of the DRM?

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.440
&gt;&gt; Stan Pierre-Louis: The --

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.930
the good news about our industry
is we've had a lot of success,

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.030
particularly with the newer console
models, in preventing that access.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.640
And so we've not had to rely
on it in terms of legal claims.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.220
But we know that having it
as a backstop protects us.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.020
We are a U.S.-only
trade association,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.990
but we know that internationally
we've had that success as well.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.320
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.220
I think Mr. Dow was next.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.520
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: Thank you.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.530
So Mr. Band talked about
that there appeared not

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.050
to be any direct correlation
between the legal protections

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.790
and the advancement of the goal

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.340
of making the material
available digitally online

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.540
and that the real value was
in the technology itself.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.460
And I think that there is real
value in the technology itself.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.440
And if you go back and you
look at the NII Whitepaper

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.920
that made the recommendations that
led to the adoption of the DMCA,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.290
it was very explicit in saying
that in this new environment,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.130
the copyright owners would look to
technology to protect their rights

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.610
and that would be a very
valuable tool in terms of helping

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.730
to promote the growth
of digital commerce

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.180
but that technology alone would
be insufficient to meet that goal,

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.730
and that legal protections
alone would also be insufficient

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.030
to meet that goal.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.850
And it was the combination of the
two that were going to be required

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.340
to meet the objective of
encouraging people to sort of jump

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.400
with both feet into a new digital
environment in which content,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.640
in a very high quality,
was put at risk.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.080
And I think the experience has
been that that's what has resulted

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.160
from the DMCA, that people have
relied on the legal protections,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.780
combined with the technological
protections,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.640
to get into these businesses with
both feet, perhaps more quickly

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.290
than otherwise would
have been the case.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.670
I -- I know that the
availability of the --

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.530
the WIPO Treaties and
their discussions,

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.370
the DMCA were directly
relevant to the adoption

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.140
of CSS as a protection for DVD.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.690
It was what led to the
introduction of the DVD,

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.160
which became the fastest
growing consumer platform --

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.120
consumer electronics platform
up to that time in history.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.910
Jonathan is right that that --
that that technology was hacked

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.370
and that there were tools
available to defeat it,

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.800
but that's also what
spawned much of the --

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.740
the precedent that we have
right now in the DMCA is

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.930
in enforcement litigation under
the DMCA dealing with those things.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.600
And it's not -- and the
objective was never to say

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.220
that these technologies
would be hack-proof

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.290
or that there would never
be anyone who would be able

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.620
to access the tools to do it,
or that would be able to figure

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.740
out a way to do it, but that
you would keep these things

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.040
out of the mainstream.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.880
And that's exactly what that
litigation had the effect of doing.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.750
And you know, Mr. Zuck talks
about going into the Best Buy

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.050
and being able to buy
hacking software.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.550
Well, when we were in
litigation with 321 Studios

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.010
over CSS hacking technology,
that was exactly the issue,

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.150
was that you could walk
into Fry's and Best Buy

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.730
and buy consumer-friendly hacking
technology to -- to rip DVDs.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.310 position:56%
And the litigation that was involved
there didn't remove the ability

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.150
to hack DVDs, but it did
take that activity and put it

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.220
at the fringes while leaving
a channel in the mainstream

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.600
that helped to promote the --

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.150
the availability of these
new business models.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.480
Now, in the last 15 years
that I've been in --

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.800
involved in this from a business
side, I've been at the intersection

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.610
of the law and sort of the business
considerations, and I can tell you

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.990 position:56%
that the availability of these legal
tools has been directly relevant

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.550
to the decisions to
get into these markets,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.350
whether it was the development of
AACS as a next-generation standard

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.830
for the protection of high
definition digital content,

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.130
whether it's the willingness
to get into the market for 4K,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.240
whether it's the willingness to
get into the market for the --

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.060
over-the-top television and
authenticated television

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.000
to allow people to do streaming,
the DMCA has been a factor

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.460
in the willingness to engage
in all of those things.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.710
And so, I think it's --
from our perspective,

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:22.480
has been both necessary
and successful.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.780
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.100
Mr. Slover?

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.010
&gt;&gt; George Slover: So in
-- in our experience here,

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.800
it's not been the --
the intended uses

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:39.550
of the technological protection
measures in Section 1201,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:45.220 position:56%
it's the -- the overbroad uses which
I think were probably not intended

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:50.300
or certainly not fully
envisioned in 1998.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.880
So it's, you know, we -- we
heard the metaphor a minute ago

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.250
from the House Judiciary
Committee of breaking into a house

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.850
in order to steal a book.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:05.340
I think of another metaphor,
which is my wife has baked a cake

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.430
which she intends to
take to church on Sunday,

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.790
and my teenaged son is hungry.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.730
And so she can either say,
hey, don't touch that cake,

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.620 position:56%
or she can say, you know what, I'm
so afraid you might touch that cake,

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.600
I don't even want you
setting foot in the kitchen,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.700
and I'm going to lock
that kitchen door.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.050 position:56%
You can't get into the refrigerator,
you can't get into the cupboard,

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.580
you're just going to have to
go hungry because I'm worried

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.450
about that cake on the counter.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.530 position:56%
I think there -- I'm hoping
there's a way to sort of reconfigure

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.210
and reconstitute what
we're doing with 1201

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.440
so that we're really
focused on the --

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.680 position:56%
the protection against infringement,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.660
and we're not capturing the
interoperability and -- and --

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:56.810
and, in my view, less
closely-related side benefits of --

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:04.530
to industry of -- of -- of
denying access to the software.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.720
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Building --
connecting those two thoughts,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.810
Mr. Dow just said that 1201 has
been both necessary and successful

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.710
in the motion picture
type of industries,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:20.250
and you've mentioned
going sort of overbroad.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.880
Is -- has 1201 played a role
in protecting or any sort

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.620
of useful role in the markets
for 3D printers or software

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.510
that anyone's aware of, or cars?

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:37.180
[ Silence ]

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.130
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: So yeah, we take
it to sort of a different place.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.660
I mean, we're -- what -- what
Mr. Slover said is very clear

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.960
from our -- from our industry.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.820
We're -- the automotive
aftermarket is

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.260
about a $350 billion
industry in this country.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.830
And that industry provides
choices to consumers in auto parts

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.660
and where they get
those cars serviced.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.880 position:56%
And we're seeing the use of software

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.580
in virtually every
component on a car nowadays.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.970
And those components --

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.910
some of them, we're not
clear whether they're there

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:09.060
for functional purposes or simply
to make it difficult for people

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.260
to produce parts to
work on their vehicles.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.380
And we're seeing the use of --

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.660
of the 1201 as a way to keep
our industry out of being able

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.960
to reverse engineer and --

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.820
and produce parts and even
service those vehicles.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.630
So we see a pretty broad impact
on our industry going forward

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.620
and even currently, we're seeing
more and more parts, which is --

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.970
with -- with chips on them to --

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.850
that are making it difficult for
our industry to -- to operate in --

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.380
in -- in the aftermarket.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.770
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: So I think we're
going to go with Mr. Weissenberg,

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.040
then Mr. Zuck, Mr. Band,
and then Ms. Greene,

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.340
and then I think we're going
to go on to another question.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.070
So Mr. Weissenberg?

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Weissenberg: I just wanted

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.250
to quickly piggyback
off Mr. Slover here

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.550
and answer your question, Kevin.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:02.230
An example of someone using the
DMCA or 1201 specifically to --

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.340 position:56%
to go after someone or file a claim.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.550
Last year, when ISRI was here
asking for a 1201 exemption

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.920
for phone unlocking, TracFones
response was, you know,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.120
we rely on 1201 to protect our
business model, and we emphasize

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.430
that that's not a copyright
interest and we're grateful, again,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.070
for the Copyright Office
for recognizing that fact.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.640
And that kind of bleeds
into another topic.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.940
I don't want to get there just yet,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.210
but just in case you need
another example, that's one.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Okay.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.930
Yeah. And -- and definitely we're
going to try to explore some

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.010
of these competition issues
later on in this panel.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.630
Mr. Zuck?

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.320
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Thank you.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.940
Yeah. I don't -- I don't want to be
accused of two bites of the apple

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.350
or smuggling a file in a cake or
anything like that, but the --

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.610
some of the questions have
evolved as we've gone along here,

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.710
and I wanted to address
a couple of comments.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.110
One is the notion that
there's other business models

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.920
that don't involve DRM, and
that's certainly the case.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.960
And I think it's important and
worth mentioning that the people

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.320
that make use of DRM don't like it.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.920
It's -- it's not enjoyable to --
to go through the process of trying

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.490
to use technical protection
measures on your products.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.420
It increases consumer support
costs and everything else.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.660
It's simply been a necessary
tool in preventing piracy.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.540
And I can say that it's certainly
been a very successful tool

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.470
in the context of software as well.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.730
And in the app market that
I represent, the distinction

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.260
between software and content
is becoming continually blurred

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.560
as well.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.690
So TPMs are used, not only for
the software itself but also

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.260
for the content that's
embedded in --

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.930
in software where some
of the piracy occurs.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.750
If I've got an app that's teaching
you yoga positions or something

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.970
like that, sometimes the piracy
involves pulling the content

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.010
out of the app and
repurposing it in another app.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.850
So TPMs have proven useful
in the software market.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.620
And then, the final
point is this notion

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.390
about it expanding beyond
its original intention.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.690
And I -- I feel like that
comes up over and over again.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.180 position:56%
And in this context, I always remind
everyone that I'm not a lawyer.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.450 position:56%
But it's my understanding that where
those things have been adjudicated,

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.260
they've come out in favor of a
more restrictive interpretation

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.260
of -- of the DMCA.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.660
So I mean, I -- the -- you know,
whether it's garage door openers

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.950
or printer cartridges
and things like that,

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.590
I think there's some fairly strong
precedents in place to suggest

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.650
that it should be focused on
-- on copyright infringement.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.280
And the -- and the jail-breaking
legislation is another example,

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.660
I think, of where the
system worked to --

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.860 position:56%
to, you know, modify the environment

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.600
in which people are getting overly
experimental in the use of 1201.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.260
But none of that, I
think, undermines the value

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.700
that it's played in what has
been a very successful market,

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.610
and I think we should be very
cautious about upending that.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.910
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.210
Mr. Band?

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.960
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So going --
going back to your question about,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.380
you know, the number of cases,
I think you're right, there --

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.720
there have been relatively few
1201 cases, certainly relative

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.680
to the number of, let's
say, of 512 cases.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.820 position:56%
And it's always important when we're
talking about 1201 to also keep

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.740
in mind that it's part of this
bigger construct of the DMCA.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:08.690
But one of the reasons why there's
been relatively few 1201 cases,

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:12.590
it seems to me, is that it's
-- it's really broadly drafted.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.110
It talks about, not only
the act of circumvention,

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:20.450
but it talks about trafficking,
then there's also 1201(b).

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:26.370 position:56%
The early cases, you know, went very
strongly in favor of rights holders,

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:34.790
and so, there was very -- there
just hasn't been a need for the --

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.260
the litigation because it's
-- it's been -- it's --

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.230
it's been so broadly interpreted.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:44.720
So -- so then, the action
really has shifted very much

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.720
to the rulemaking because,
you know, there --

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.350
you have all these people
who are adversely affected,

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.330
and if you're adversely
affected by the DMCA,

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.450
I mean you have two choices, you
could sort of go ahead and engage

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:00.040
in the activity and hope that,
in the event of litigation,

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.380
that you'll end up with, you know,
you'll end up in the right court,

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.860
right, that you'll end up in the
-- in the Federal Circuit, I guess,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.420
or the Sixth Circuit, as
opposed to the Ninth Circuit.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.540
But, you know, yeah, good luck
in making sure that that happens.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.040
If you're on the defendant side,
you don't really get to choose

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.620
where the action is filed.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.570
And you know, that's one choice.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.570
Or the choice is to -- to
-- to go to the rulemaking.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.250
And so, so much of the
activity and the energy is

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:34.220 position:56%
on the rulemaking side because, you
now, at least there is a rulemaking.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.960
So we're glad for that.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:43.730
But that's why, you know,
because the DMCA is so broad

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.960
and has been interpreted so
broadly by some circuits, you know,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.860
that's pushed all the activity and
the focus onto the rulemaking side

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:57.130
and that's why so much -- so many
of us are so intent on trying

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.350
to get the -- the rulemaking
to work better than it is.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.650
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:03.950
Ms. Greene?

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.250
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: Thank you.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.770
I was actually just going to
say some of what was just stated

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.600
with regard to the reason why
there is not a tremendous amount

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.410
of litigation and the fact that
there have been favorable decisions

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.940
in -- in previous court cases.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.110
What I do want to note about that
though is that it is impossible

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.510
to calculate the chilling effect
that those previous court cases,

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:31.060
even though they were ruled on
favorably, has had on the market.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.570
Entrepreneurs who are just trying
to enter a marketplace may not want

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:37.120
to take the risk that all
of the efforts that they go

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.900
to to develop a new product,
to innovate, and to launch it

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.470
in the marketplace may be for
naught as a result of litigation,

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.690
even if they might
eventually win that litigation.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.650
And so, that -- that is
a -- a great concern.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.480
And then, to the extent that it
has been, you know, pushed --

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.070
the litigation has been pushed
to the rulemaking process.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.100
I do still think there is
a chill in the marketplace

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.040
and a chill specifically
in activities

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.520
that are very clearly not
related to copyright infringement,

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.540
such as security research, and the
burdens of that rulemaking process,

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.580
which I know we'll
be discussing later,

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:19.160
I think do oftentimes go outside of
the question of the effectiveness

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.940
of TPMs in -- in helping
the marketplace,

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:27.910
and in fact sometimes favor the
chill of that type of competition.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.740
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.440 position:56%
So turning from the
effectiveness and the role of the --

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.780
the current law, I think we wanted
to explore a little bit some

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:44.920 position:56%
of the proposed changes to 1201,
and really one of the central points

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.640
of dispute, or disagreement
that we saw in the comments,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:53.650
is this idea that there is or
should be a nexus within 1201

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.560
with copyright infringement.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.910
We had a, you know, large number of
comments supporting the -- the --

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.300
the model obviously

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.320
and the Unlocking Technology
Act that's been proposed

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.780
that would limit circumvention
violations to those undertaken

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.140
for the purpose of infringement.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:17.190
In response, we had several
comments saying that the --

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.030
that accessing a copyrighted
work for purposes

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:24.110
of consumption alone may not
implicate an exclusive right,

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:29.260
and indeed, that type of activity
is -- is really the, you know,

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.290
one of the -- the foundational
reasons why Section 1201

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.590
was enacted.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.810
So I'd like to sort of explore
that debate a little bit.

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:46.260
What are your views as to
proposals to incorporate a nexus

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.790
to infringement within 1201?

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.470
Mr. Adler?

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.820
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Oh, there
is a nexus to infringement

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.060
in 1201, but it's not in 1201 --

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Oh,
microphone, please.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.850
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: There is
a nexus to infringement

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:02.070
in 1201, but it's not in 1201(a).

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:08.280
1201(a) is about access
controls, and "access" is not part

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.810
of the exclusive rights of
a copyright owner under 106.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:18.260
But obviously, access to the work
is the threshold issue with respect

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.940
to whether or not uses of the work

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.720
that implicate the exclusive
rights are going to occur.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:30.730
If you look at -- at the way
Congress structured 1201,

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:36.240
1201(a) was designed to deal with
the question of access independent

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.210
of the issue of infringement
because access to the work, again,

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:46.320
was the question about whether or
not consumers were going to be able

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.160 position:56%
to exploit the marketplace and
whether there would be a marketplace

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.000
of these works online to exploit.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.540 position:56%
When you look at -- at 1201(b),
1201(b) doesn't address the question

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.850
of circumvention of a
technological protection measure

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:10.120
that protects rights of a
copyright owner under section 106

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.840
and Title 17, specifically
because it recognizes

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.590 position:56%
that those rights are themselves
subject to exceptions like fair use.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.860
But that's why those two questions
have to be looked at differently.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.280
The issue of access is
not about infringement.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.570
And to the extent that Congress
did seek to allow copyright owners

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.660
to utilize technological protection
measures to deal with the issue

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:39.540 position:56%
of infringement, that was done in
1201(b) where the balance was struck

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.190
in recognizing limitations
and exceptions like fair use,

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:47.230
while still suggesting that even
though there already are remedies

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.400
in the law to deal
with infringement,

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.090
technological measures can still
help a copyright owner be able

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.440
to deal with that by
at least making sure

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.250
that to the extent they do use
technological protection measures

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.790
to protect exclusive rights,
that those are not subject

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.160
to a marketplace that's rife
with availability of the means

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.600
to circumvent those measures.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.900
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.240
Mr. Band?

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.090
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So I -- I think
the premise of 1201(a) was --

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.440
Allan's right, it's about access.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.900
But it's about access -- I
think what everyone had in mind

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.620
and everyone thought they
were talking about was access

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.600
to something you hadn't
paid for, right?

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.860
I mean, it was -- the idea was,
you know, it was -- it was --

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.070
it was like getting, you know, and
the people were talking about sort

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.400
of getting access to cable
television that, you know, to --

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.230
get access -- getting access
to the premium channel

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.530
that you hadn't paid for.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.630
That's what it was -- but that's
what I think everyone really had

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.930
in their mind.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:49.610
And certainly not the situation
that Mr. Lowe is dealing

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:54.230
with in the automotive context
about a person not being able

00:37:54.230 --> 00:38:00.850
to access his own software in
his own car for the purpose

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:07.490
of making sure that he doesn't pay
marked up prices for repair parts,

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:12.450
and that -- and that that was
not at all what was contemplated.

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:16.650
Now, one can debate
what the words say

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.690
and how they probably should be
-- properly should be interpreted,

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:24.380
but I think it is fair to say
that there's no policy reason

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.660 position:56%
within the confines of the
Copyright Act or within the confines

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:33.200
of Section -- of Title 17, for
there to be any restrictions

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.070
on a person's ability to
access their own property,

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.370
their own copies.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.690
It's one thing to say
I shouldn't be able

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.760
to access something I haven't
paid for, but if I've paid for it

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.560
and it's in my possession,
you know, why --

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.410
why should there be
a legal framework

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.250
that protects my ability
to access that?

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.390
And so, that's why, you
know, we think the -- the --

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:58.020
the Technology Unlocking Act makes
sense and that's why, you know --

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:02.550
and -- and -- and whether it's --
it's through a statutory change

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:07.660
or through a much more
liberal application of the --

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.690
of the rulemaking in the
case of, at least software

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.810
where we see this problem
most pervasively, you know,

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:21.180
we would be able to sort of
simplify your work significantly

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:27.950
and not have the DMCA basically
regulating the entire U.S. economy.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.300
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So earlier we
heard about the various types

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:35.450
of digital distribution, and is
your theory that 1201 should --

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.400
should be limited to --
consumers should be able

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.740
to access what they have paid for?

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.030 position:56%
Does that depend on an understanding
of ownership of the good

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.730
as opposed to a rental model?

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.990 position:56%
I mean, I think some of the things
that come up in the rulemaking is --

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.630
is a fear that consumers
may have paid for a penny

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.500
but want to access a pound.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.030
Does your theory take --

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.960
does it matter whether you actually
own the refrigerator or the book

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.880
as opposed to lending, or
leasing, or a subscription model?

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.200
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: You
know, I -- I --

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.250
I think there's various
ways to -- to -- to --

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.510
to slice the -- the loaf.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:19.350
And certainly, if when we're
amending 1201(a), I mean,

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.690
you could -- I -- I think
the best way to do it is --

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.000
is to simply require a
nexus to infringement

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.030
so if there's really no possibility
of infringement, it's -- it's --

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.830
it's -- it's not within
the scope of the law.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:38.050
And -- and it's like when
you're drafting a statute,

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.300
you can either draft it --

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.010
make it really broad and then start
having all kinds of carve-outs

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.790
and you know you're never going to
have enough carve-outs, but it's,

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.340
you know, it's sort of like
who shows up at the table,

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.050
who has enough lobbying strength to
get a carve-out, and that's the --

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.770
unfortunately the approach
taken in 1201.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:59.340
The alternative is you have a
narrower bill, more tailored bill,

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.710
and you understand that
there might be some leakage.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:05.780
And then, if there's leakage,
then you maybe make amendments

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.460
to take care of --
of -- of those leaks,

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.390
and I think that that's a
better way to approach it.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:16.480 position:56%
But, you know, if -- if, you know,
we're not talking about, you know --

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.080
you know, there's other
ways of doing it.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.330 position:56%
I mean, you could certainly
simply, you know, yeah, you could --

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:25.890
you could carve out software or --
or software -- embedded software.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.210
I mean, there's all kinds
of different ways that --

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.340
ways that 1201 could be amended.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:34.090
Again, I think a nexus to
infringement would be the best way

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:39.150
and the simplest way, but there are
certainly other ways that are --

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.670
that -- that would
be less effective,

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.640
but it would be better
than the status quo.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.940
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.240
And so, could I just, to --

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.140
to follow up, so would a nexus
to infringement encompass this,

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.310
you know, the -- the
sort of paradigm scenario

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.110
that Mr. Adler mentioned
where someone is --

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:59.180
is accessing a copyrighted
movie to watch it?

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.710
Would -- would that -- would
-- would that be a nexus?

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.160
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Yeah, the
problem with requiring a nexus --

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.990
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Oh, microphone.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.290
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.850
The problem with requiring a
nexus to infringement for 1201(a),

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:13.020
where you're dealing with the
issue of access, is that it fails

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.630
to recognize that access to a work
has its own independent economic

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.060
value, whether or not
someone is going to infringe

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.930
as a result of that access.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:24.920
For example, you know, we
hear all the time in --

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.230
in the book industry that the
difference between the use

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:32.820 position:56%
of printed books and -- and
digital -- books in digital formats,

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.480
whether they're in ebooks that
you -- you have, you know,

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.860
that you're looking at in a
device, or whether you're --

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.620
you're actually reading
a book online,

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.560
is the fact that reading
a book is not something

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.800
that actually exploits one

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.170
of the exclusive rights
of a copyright owner.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.470
That's true.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:54.380
But the purpose of putting
a book on the marketplace,

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.890
the purpose of actually creating
a work of original expression

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.720
in book form, is ultimately
to have people read it,

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.120
and that's where the
economic value is.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:08.400
So the notion that the only way
rights holders can protect access

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.060
to their works, or control
access to their works online,

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.710
is if they are able
to show that the means

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:18.390
by which they do it is directly
related to addressing the issue

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.750
of infringement, neglects the
whole notion of what the real value

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.870
of these works is in the
way they're used in ways

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:28.250
that don't involve
infringement at all.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.660
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.990
Did you want to respond
to that quickly or --

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.290
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Oh well, yeah.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.940
I don't -- I don't want to
monopolize, but I mean, I -- I --

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.810
I -- you know, a lot of
it could be taken care

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.130
of conceivably in the drafting.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.130
But even if we're not -- it --
it would seem to me that if I --

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:47.240
if I, let's say, rent a -- a book,
right, and I -- I -- I'm allowed --

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.420
entitled to it based on my
rental fee to have it for a week,

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.670
and I fiddle with the software so
that I can keep it another week,

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:02.450
you know, that seems to me
that might get into this area

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.630
of the kinds of, you know,
what we're -- what -- what --

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.640
what we may be talking
about, that it --

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.590
it conceivably could be
still subject to 1201(a),

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.290
especially to the extent that my --

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.000
you know, in order to
continue reading it,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.570
I need to continue making copies
of it, RAM copies and so forth,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:28.810 position:56%
that are of more than a -- you know,
of more than a transitory period.

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:32.530
So you know, I think even in that
case, it would conceivably --

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:35.310
depending on how you draft it,
it would still be within the --

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.930
you know, the scope of
what I'm thinking of.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.230
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.530
Mr. Dow?

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.830
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: So -- so
Allan is absolutely right.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.800
The absence of a nexus
to infringement

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.200
in the statute is quite deliberate.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.150
In fact, proposals
like the ones you find

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.800
in the Unlocking Technology
Act are not new.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.940
Those were proposals that were made
at the time the DMCA was considered

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.960 position:56%
and they were rejected for a variety
of reasons, including that really

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.770
to have done that would have made
Section 1201 rather duplicative

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:03.650
of Section 106, and that was not
the objective of the Statute.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.860
What Congress saw at the time
that they did this was a world

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.970
in which you had the type of
scenario that Allan just described

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.770
where the value to the -- where
the benefit to the consumer

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.900 position:56%
and the value to the copyright owner
is derived from access to the work,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.650
not necessarily from the exercise
of the Section 106 rights.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.480
So the ability to access a work,
whether it be a book or a song

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.530
or a movie or, you know, any
other form of expressive work,

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.810
doesn't require you to copy
it, doesn't require you

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.310
to distribute it, doesn't require
you to publicly perform it,

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.120
but that the value is derived from
your ability to access at the time.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.600
The thing that was talked about
was the celestial jukebox.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.450 position:56%
We've sort of gone to that model
across the board for different types

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:40.890
of expressive works, and
Congress had that in mind.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:42.720
That's what -- what -- what
the intended result would be.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.260
And the fact that we are
quickly and continually moving

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.900
in that direction is --
is sort of a testament

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.000
to the way that it was structured.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.630
I think that's it.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:54.930
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.370
Mr. Panjwani?

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.670
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani: Thank you.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.770
We believe that a nexus
to copyright infringement

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.970
within 1201 cures a number of
the issues that have manifested

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:11.470
over the last 5 to 10 years,
such as the issues of access

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:15.900
to consumer devices that have
software embedded within them

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.040
and a variety of other competitive
issues that have been implicated.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.180
But taking this back for a moment
to the discussion we've just had

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:29.440
on the right of access and where
it exists in the copyright law,

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.630
Section 1201 -- it sounds like
what we're hearing here is

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:35.190
that Congress intended
to create an --

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:38.240
a exclusive right of
access for authors.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.570
And I don't think we should
be afraid of considering this

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:46.600
in terms of, well, if we have a
nexus of infringement in 1201,

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.160
then what happens to
the right of access.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.020 position:56%
And I think that we should have a
debate on the right of access rather

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.590
than on a prohibition
on circumvention.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.030 position:56%
If Congress wanted to create a right
of access, they could have put it

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:59.610
in Section 106 with the rest of the
exclusive rights granted to authors

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:02.050
of copyright-protected works.

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:06.120
Now, again, looking at some of the
legislative history and the text

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.210
of the statute, there's
no discussion of, well,

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:09.510
we wanted to create
this right of access,

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.890 position:56%
it's we want to create incentives to
enter digital markets and we think

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.250
that this is a necessary step

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:19.450
to incentivize entry
into digital markets.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:25.030
And I don't think that,
you know, a explicit right

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:27.550
of access was contemplated
at that point.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.550
In fact, the WIPO Treaty
says, you know,

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:33.380
we want to have adequate
protections for technical measures

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.070
that are employed by
authors in the protection

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.680
of their rights granted
under, you know, this --

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.500 position:56%
this Treaty which we would then
read in the case of the U.S. Statute

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.310 position:56%
under this Title, which is 106,
which is reproduction, distribution,

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.460
public performance and so forth.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.060
In particular, I would say,
you know, the examples that --

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.760
that Mr. Band and Mr. Adler
were just discussing, you know,

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.750
I think you perhaps
underestimate the creativity

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.630
of plaintiff's counsel and their
ability to identify a violation

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.170
of 106 in any of these
given particular instances

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.560
where you're afraid that
copyright infringement does not get

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.620
at the behavior.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.680
There may be an access to a copy.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.520
Well, where did the copy come from?

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.830 position:56%
You know, is the copy lawfully
possessed at the time of the access,

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:19.220
you know, in the case of a rental?

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.520
Was it sold?

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.820
Well, it was rented.

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.120
After the rent -- rental expires,

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.510
do you still lawfully
possess that copy?

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.420
So I think there are a number
of ways of solving this issue

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.060
that don't require such a broad
prohibition on circumvention

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:34.340
that burdens all other
non-infringing uses.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.380
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Can you speak
to Mr. Adler's distinction

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.540
between access control prohibition
of 1201(a) versus copy controls

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.020
in 1201(b), the anti-trafficking
prohibitions?

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:48.150
I mean, that seems
like, statutorily,

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:51.280
they've made that difference and
we could rely on that as opposed

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.540
to creativity of plaintiff's
counsel.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.710
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani:
It's been our position

00:48:55.710 --> 00:49:00.730 position:56%
that the anti-trafficking provisions
distinction between copy protection

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.230
and access protection,
as far as implementation,

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.390
are largely indistinguishable;
that a TPM used

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:10.680
for access control is a TPM
used for copy control often.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.030
And we've approached that
in the exemption process

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.550
as addressing them more
or less as the same.

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.210
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: Because
you're seeing the merged use

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.450
of controls in the industry?

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:23.750
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani: Right.

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:25.670
In practice, while the
Statute recognizes them

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:29.550 position:56%
as two separate types of control,
in practice, we see them implemented

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:33.050
as more or less as the same.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:34.350
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.650
Mr. Pierre-Louis?

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.950
&gt;&gt; Stan Pierre-Louis: I -- I just
wanted to add that in our industry,

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.210
that's not the case because
you have console manufacturers

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.460
and you have publishers
who produce discs.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.410
They have to interoperate, but they
do have separate types of access

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:47.710
and copy controls within them.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.000
So in our industry,
we've seen the benefit

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.320
of having both of those available.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.530
It's -- it's important to
recognize that we're not trying

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:59.120 position:56%
to identify infringers, we're trying
to identify and cultivate consumers,

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.640
and so, all of these
things help us do that.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.370
And so, access to the work
becomes an important way

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:08.000
of distinguishing the
different uses users want.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.770
Some want it on mobile, some want
it online, some want it on a disc

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:12.740
in a counsel -- in a console.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:17.820 position:56%
And I think all of these rules allow
us to play within that framework

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.070
and meet customers where they are.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:23.580
This is not academic for
us, this is business.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.420
And so, you know, making
a nexus to infringement

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:32.370
in many ways harms the
consumers because, right now,

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.920
and I think this is the -- the
correct interpretation of the law,

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.380
possession of the work is -- is
not what's infringing, it's --

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.580
it's the various uses some
may make, and now we're --

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.010
we're trying to implicate
more on consumers there.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:46.450 position:56%
I think it's important to recognize
that that access control allows them

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:50.780
to make uses and that's what
we're trying to cultivate.

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.080
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.930
Mr. Slover?

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.230
&gt;&gt; George Slover: Yes.

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:57.590
I wanted to go back to your
earlier question about ownership

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:02.700
versus other models
of rental or so forth.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.410
I think ownership is
the core focus --

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:11.950
the rights of a consumer who owns
a product, to be able to use it.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:18.510
And I think you should be careful,
you know, ownership can be written

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:23.830
around by lawyers so that what the
consumer thinks is ownership really

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.130
isn't ownership.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.730
So I think it needs to be broader

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.260
than just a legal definition
of ownership.

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:34.940
But it's the concept of the
consumer's rights and dominion

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:40.080
over the product that they -- that
they've paid for, that they have.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:45.000
And -- and I think it -- a useful
starting point is to try to,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.420
if possible, clear the
smoke around the --

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:55.050
the technology and sort of
the complexities of software

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:59.720
and everything, and try to think
of the -- I -- the -- when --

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.160
when the DMCA was passed, there
was sort of a recognition,

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.470
we need a new legal construct

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:10.650
to bring the traditional copyright
protections into the digital age.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:15.920
Well, I think on the other side, we
need a recognition that the tried

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.930
and true incidence of ownership
should still have value of and --

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:25.910 position:56%
and presence in the digital economy.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:32.220
So, for example, taking the
auto software situation,

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:36.550
if it was something that a consumer
used to be able to do in his garage

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:41.340
with a screwdriver, that
was not a copyright issue,

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:46.640 position:56%
it was not an infringement issue, it
was not a -- an inappropriate use.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:54.230
If the same thing in the -- the
new world requires getting access

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:57.890
to the software in order to
be able to make an adjustment,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:01.390
the fact that there's a
technological protection measure

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:05.450
on top of it should not change the
ultimate calculus and objective.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:09.030
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: So the Copyright
Office is separately undergoing a

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:12.960
study on software in -- in
embedded devices, and I'm wondering

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.470
if what you're saying -- or if
there could be some consensus

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:19.060
around treating software in these
embedded devices differently

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:23.130
than TPMs protecting expressive
works, if that might be another way

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:26.850
to slice it, rather than
a nexus to infringement?

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.780
&gt;&gt; George Slover: Well, I'm not a
copyright lawyer and our experience

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.250
at Consumers Union -- our --

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.220
our point of entry into all

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:37.290
of this was really the
mobile phone unlocking effort

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:40.390
that we helped lead.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:44.460
So I can't speak too
definitively to the broader issue.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:49.690
I do see sort of a -- a big
picture conceptual distinction

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:57.840
between the core creative works
and access to books and movies

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:01.210
and songs, on the one hand,

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:06.850
and products that you now can't
use unless you have software that's

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:08.370
functioning inside them.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:13.180
So what's brought us in, the --
thee concern that we saw was that,

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:18.820
you know, Internet software-enabled
devices, both in the Internet

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:23.180
of Things and then the things that
just sort of operate internally.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:27.440
But I wouldn't want to
put my finger on the scale

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.180
of some of these other issues.

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.480
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.780
Mr. Adler?

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.080
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Yeah.

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.380
I just wanted to make two points.

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:38.320
One is, if I understood
Mr. Panjwani correctly,

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.230 position:56%
he suggested that an alternative
approach by Congress would have been

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.790
to include access within
the exclusive rights enjoyed

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:48.430
by a copyright owner under 106.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.100
And I would only have
to assume that --

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.850
that the constituency
that he represents and --

00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:56.010
and that, for example, Jonathan
represents in their criticism

00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:00.150
of 1201, would oppose
vigorously such a notion,

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:02.810
because that would
lend the idea that --

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:07.250
that access itself had the
attributes of a property right,

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:11.630
which is what exclusive rights
under 106 really are about,

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:17.150 position:56%
rather than this being a question of
whether or not somebody who is going

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:22.710
to use their works in a marketplace
manner, making them available

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:26.670
to people but expecting to be
able to assert certain terms

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:30.310
for condition of availability
and use would be able to control

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:34.710
that in the first instance by
controlling access to the work.

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:37.190
And then, the second point I
was going to make is is that,

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:39.110
just to be clear, I -- I --

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:45.040
I was kind of concerned about
seeing the emphasis in the notice

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:51.100
on talking about 1201 outside
of core copyright concerns.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.550
I'm not sure I have any real
grasp of what that phrase,

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:57.980
core copyright concerns,
actually entails,

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:02.370 position:56%
but it would be a tremendous mistake
to equate that with the notion

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:06.440
of a nexus to infringement,
because obviously,

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:10.610
copyright concerns drive far
more than simply the notion

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:14.680
of whether one of these specific
exclusive rights is violated.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:18.550 position:56%
We've talked, you know, always talk
about the incentives to create works

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:22.190
of original expression in the
first place, which is driven

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:25.100
to a large part by the
private incentives involved

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.490
with the benefits of copyright.

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:30.980
And I think the discussion
we had a little bit earlier

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.800
about access relating itself
to the value of using a work

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.060
without infringing it or without

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.500 position:56%
in any way implicating the exclusive
rights of the rights holder,

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:46.330
that is a core copyright
concern, and we shouldn't treat

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.490
that notion very narrowly
so that we only think

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.920
that core copyright concerns arise

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.780
when we're discussing
about infringement.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And I
think that goes really

00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:59.990
to the point Mr. Slover was
making, and I'd be interested

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:02.240
in people's thoughts about it.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:05.760
I mean, I think what this debate
seems to be sort of struggling

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:11.990
with is, is there a way that 1201
could be reformed that would --

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:18.140
that would include things
like accessing, you know,

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.300
circumventing a TPM to
watch a movie for free.

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.660
So, you know, so that
would be included.

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.860
But things like garage door openers

00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.020
and printer cartridges
would be excluded.

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:32.620
One proposal short of a nexus
requirement that was raised

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:36.030
in the comments is this idea that I
think Regan's question asked about,

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:37.830
which would be a permanent
exemption for --

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:41.170
for software essential to
the operation of a device.

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:42.620
Is that something that would --

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:45.150
would strike the --
the proper balance?

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.100
I'd be interested in
your thoughts about that.

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.350
Mr. Zuck?

00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:52.650
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Thanks.

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:56.970
And -- and yesterday, at the
embedded devices study panel,

00:57:56.970 --> 00:58:01.870
we had a swear jar
whenever we mentioned 1201.

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.540
So I don't -- I don't know
if the same applies today,

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:10.120
but that discussion was
quite robust yesterday.

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.310
And I -- and I -- so, I'll only
briefly reiterate what I said

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:17.150
yesterday, which is that the
same kind of dynamism in terms

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:22.370 position:56%
of product offerings and things like
that still applies to what is sort

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:25.770
of loosely called the embedded
software market as well.

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:28.130
I mean, and so one of the
examples that -- that --

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.470
that I used yesterday was TiVo,

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:35.060
where the hardware was given
away practically as a loss leader

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.440
and it was the embedded software
and the services associated with it

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:42.770
which is where the company TiVo
actually obtained its value.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.230
So I mean, there's some complexity

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.980
about just having a
broad brush approach

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.900
to software that's
embedded in devices.

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:55.730
It would have to be a much more
complicated wording in order to get

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:59.200 position:56%
at the distinctions that people want
to make so that you are excluding,

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.940
you know, printer cartridges
but you're including the ability

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:07.680
to have flexible hardware
subsidy models, et cetera,

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.920
that are pretty prevalent
in this market.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.300
So I -- I don't -- I-- we
certainly couldn't support anything

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:17.060
that was just sort
of a broad exclusion

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:22.100
of embedded software
into -- into 1201.

00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:27.210
I think that would be a mistake.

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:28.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:29.810
Mr. Panjwani?

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:32.420
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani: A permanent
exemption directed towards software

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.320
embedded in consumer devices
I think would be a good start.

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.140
It would address a number of the
overhang issues that we've come

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:43.060
across in recent years such as cell
phones, jail-breaking, tractors,

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:46.100
automobiles, 3D printers,
and so forth.

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.460
However, I think it overlooks
the fact that there are a number

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:52.210
of issues that involve,
quote, unquote,

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:54.590
traditional media and
expressive works.

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.180
Leaving aside the fact, you
know, that one could argue

00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.740
that software code is an expressive
work and necessarily must be

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.920
so to be protected by copyright.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:08.300
In particular, there have been a
number of exemptions, you know,

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.910
and I guess we're going to
go into this more with the --

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:14.370
with the process panel -- involving
where is the appropriate balance

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.190
between access for
fair use purposes,

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:18.580
whether as a documentary filmmaker

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.340
or narrative filmmaker
or an educator.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:25.320
And 1201 places a substantial
burden on those uses as well,

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:29.260
not just those of embedded devices.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.740
And I would also caution
that any attempt

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.770
to create a permanent exemption

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:38.570
on software-enabled devices
would instead turn into a fight

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:41.630
over what exactly is a
software-enabled device,

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:43.480
and I'm sure we have
enough creative lawyers here

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.080
that we could probably
spend years hashing

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.600
out what the appropriate
definition of that would be.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.350
The end result of the litigation
would be not whether a copyright

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:54.650
interest has been violated
but is the thing at dispute

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.570
in this particular
litigation a device

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.060
within the meaning of the statute.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.540
And that opens up a whole
can of worms, I think.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.840
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.140
Mr. Pierre-Louis?

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.610
&gt;&gt; Stan Pierre-Louis:
I think we have

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:08.880
to tread very carefully
anytime we're talking

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.550
about these blanket exemptions.

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.780
You know, when we're
talking about 1201,

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.690
we're talking about software used

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:17.410
to protect software
of an expressive work.

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:20.680
In our case, we're talking about
software used to protect software

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.700
of software, right, because
we are a software industry

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.920
that does creative
and expressive works.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.060
And so, when you're talking
about this blanket rule,

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.410
you swallow the entire industry.

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:34.740
On top of that, when we look at how
our games are still being played

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.880
on various platforms, but in
particular, game consoles,

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.000
when you talk about consumer
devices, game consoles are used

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.350 position:56%
for games, they're used for
television, they're used for movies,

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.540
they're used for all
manner of distribution now

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.640
because consumers demand it and
our companies meet that demand.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.450
So we have to tread very carefully
as we think about what that means

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:56.570
because it implicates more than
just thinking about a tractor.

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:59.140
We're talking about the very
devices that consumers are using

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.950
to consume the content
that we're making.

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.250
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.480
Mr. Band?

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.110
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So switching hats
from the Library Copyright Alliance

01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:13.410
to the Owners Rights
Initiative I was representing

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:16.160
in yesterday's roundtable,
you know, I -- I --

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:19.510
I think they would support
an exemption along the lines

01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:20.920
of what you're talking about.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.700
I mean it, you know,
conceivably a nexus

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:29.190
or something along a broader
limitation would be better,

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:37.410
but this would be a next best --
something that really does target,

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:40.680 position:56%
you know, the situation where you --

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.650
where you do have this
embedded software.

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:47.730
I think the -- and conceivably,
you know, there could be exceptions

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:51.590
to that exception for -- for
Mr. Pierre-Louis' clients.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.010
I mean, that's -- and
-- and -- and -- I --

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:57.420
I welcome Raza's suggestion that we
could spend years negotiating that.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.490
I -- hopefully, I would
have a client in that --

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:02.570
that -- those negotiations.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:06.560
So that -- that actually, you know
-- my -- my retirement, you know --

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.540
that would, you know, be a nice
trajectory towards retirement.

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:13.030
But -- but I think, again,
sort of, you know, just the --

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:17.630 position:56%
the bigger point is is I -- I
certainly don't think that Congress,

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:24.990
when it was talking about
1201 -- and -- and -- and I --

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:27.900
I was part of those
discussions, as some of the others

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.760
around the table were as well --

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.490
they really were not
thinking about tractors.

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:35.700
And the fact that we're
talking about tractors

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:42.080
and that that's been an automobiles
and that that's where it's gone to,

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.850
does suggest that there
is a serious problem here.

01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:49.800
And -- and the fact that we're, you
know, that the Internet of Things,

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.590
we're talking about a
world where, you know,

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:54.040
all these devices are going to
be connected and they're going

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.910
to be connected by software,
and then the -- there --

01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:01.090
there's going to be
these implications

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:04.210
for competition everywhere
because of this Statute.

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:07.500
And so, we need to say, okay, what
do we - - unless you want to --

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:11.950
I mean, you're talking about
how we went from two --

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:17.060
two exemptions to 22 exemptions,
well, I think next year, we're --

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.010
you know, in -- in the next
cycle, it's going to be --

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:22.920
you know, it's going to continue to
grow at a -- at a geometric rate,

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.230
and you know, it won't take very
long before the whole, you know,

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:30.150
building will be working on 1201.

01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:32.770
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.820
I think Mr. Lowe was next.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.470
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: So some of my
points have already been taken,

01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:40.370
but I want to emphasize from
-- from our point of view,

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:41.910
the parts on a car that used

01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:46.600
to be reparable using mechanical
means now are require -- are --

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.640
you require access to the software.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:53.000
So we equate now the software to
the parts and once you take away

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.960 position:56%
that right to repair those vehicles,

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.780
that becomes a really
difficult issue for -- for --

01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.200
for the -- for our industry.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.400
You know, people who modify
their cars in, you know,

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.770
in their garage should still
have the ability to do that.

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:10.640
And I think your suggestion is
a good one to start out as far

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.460
as giving that, you know, some --

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.460
some usability, rather because
these are not expressive works,

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:19.510 position:56%
these are mechanical functions that
are now been taken over by software.

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:21.680
Including, you know,
windshield wipers now that used

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.010
to be all mechanical, now
software might control how

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:27.460
that windshield wiper is operating.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.290
If it's a patent, that's
fine, but you know,

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:31.890
the non-copyrightable
function should not be allowed

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:34.060
to be protected.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.660
Mr. Dow?

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.960
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: Just very quickly,
I think some have talked

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.420
about this exemption
that you suggested

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.720
in terms of embedded software.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.100 position:56%
I think that your question
actually, if -- if I heard it right,

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.660
was about software necessary
to make a device run.

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.300
And I just -- to me, I'm not
quite sure how to interpret that

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.130
and I think it just sort of
highlights how difficult some

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:57.660
of the drafting would be
around something like this.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:59.760
What -- what comes to mind and
the concern that comes to mind

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.250
for me is thinking about,
even some of the early cases,

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:05.390
maybe the very first case under the
DMCA was brought by RealNetworks

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:08.070
and what was at issue there
was an authentication sequence

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:11.020
that in order for you to
be able to use your device

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.930
to stream a RealNetworks,
you know, a --

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.230
a file that was protected
using RealNetworks' DRM,

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:18.670
you had to authenticate the device
to ensure that you were talking

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:22.040
to a real server that would protect
against copying of the content.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.530 position:56%
And somebody had gone in and spoofed
the authentication sequence in order

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:27.470
to get around that process.

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:28.860
And so, in order -- they -- they --

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.910
that was really software
that was required to make

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:32.610
that device work the
way it was supposed to.

01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:35.960
I think in the entertainment field,
a lot of what goes on has to do

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.260
with authentication, right.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.660
If you want to use a DVD
player, that drive has

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.880
to authenticate itself to
ensure that it's playing

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.810
by the rules before
you access the content.

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:47.830
And so, I -- I just want to
urge some caution about how some

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:50.490
of these things that we talk
about in one context really impact

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:53.290
in a totally different context
that would be problematic.

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:54.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Regan Smith: That's a good point,

01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:59.180
and I wonder if anyone else could
speak to whether some of these TPMs

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.350
or software are running
on, you know, both devices

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:06.360
or protecting expressive content
as well as devices that are not.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.730
In the past rulemaking, we talked

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:10.810
about jail-breaking
and variety of things.

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:13.410
And, you know, and one of the
testimonies there said, you know,

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:16.700
the software is the same no
matter what the thing is.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.430 position:56%
So whether 1201 should treat that
all as protecting expressive content

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:22.730
or whether you can
make a distinction

01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:27.040
if the software is running
on multiple types of devices.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:33.120
&gt;&gt; Stan Pierre-Louis: I think
I understand the question,

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.410
so I will try.

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:38.390
So in our industry, there's
the software authentication

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:40.030
that happens with the game console.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:44.530 position:56%
There's also -- there are also
servers where you're playing online,

01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:46.660
you could be streaming the content,
you could download the content.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:52.160 position:56%
All of those require different types
of software in order to interoperate

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.890
because we're soon even going to
have multi-device-type, you know,

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:59.400
where you can go from one
-- multiplatform -- playing.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.640
All those require a lot of
interoperability in software, and,

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.030
I think, as Mr. Dow was
saying, it -- it takes --

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:12.190 position:56%
it takes a lot of thinking about how
those work before we get into rules.

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:16.830
I don't know, for example,
whether some of the software

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.490
that operates the machinery
that some others are talking

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:23.370
about here has this other
copyrightable function in it.

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:25.390
But, you know, I don't know
enough about that technology to --

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:27.210
to say, well, that
shouldn't count, right?

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:28.620
I mean, I think that's the --

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.500
that's where we have
to be careful to tread.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.790
We know in our industries we're
protecting the expressive works

01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:34.640
and so we can speak
very definitively.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.540
But in some of these other
areas, they are also doing things

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:41.070
that are probably copyrightable
and whether you want

01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:42.810
to say it's a high
level or a low level,

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:44.310
it's not for me to judge that.

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.960
What is important is to understand

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.190
that there are rationales behind
each of our uses of software,

01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:50.490
and we've got to be
careful in thinking

01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:52.620
about what we're implicating
and what we're tripping

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.210
over because there would
be unintended consequences.

01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:58.890
And notwithstanding Mr. Band's
idea that we just go really narrow

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:02.150
and we just fix the "leaks," for
us, the "leaks" are the business.

01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:03.570
You know, once they're
out, they're out.

01:09:03.570 --> 01:09:06.300
And so, it's important for us to
be able to monetize that but also

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.600
to make sure that consumers
are getting it

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.280
in the ways that they want it.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.580
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.880
Mr. Zuck?

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.180
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Thank you.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.650
And again, I -- I guess to
understand your question, I --

01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:19.010
there's certainly software
itself is -- is --

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:23.180
I don't know if that
constitutes an expressive work.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.480
But that -- I mean, that's --

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.810
that's where we are interested in
making use of these protections,

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:32.960
and there are a lot of
different licensing models

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.260
for the software itself.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.560
And so, sort of protecting

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:40.130
that dynamism I think is also
really important, that it allows

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:43.510
for different kinds of models
for making software available

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:45.920
to different communities, et
cetera, and that kind of --

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.370
so there's some price
discrimination benefits, et cetera,

01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:50.810
to having dynamic business models.

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:55.020 position:56%
And I think that that's part of what
has made my industry thrive so much.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.620
I -- I guess I'd rather
approach this from the other end.

01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:02.930 position:56%
If we're trying to -- since we have
the 1201 exemption process in place,

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:07.530 position:56%
maybe a -- a better reform is trying
to streamline renewals, for example,

01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:09.550
that once you've identified
something

01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:16.900
that is a clearly acceptable use,
you know, make it a lot easier

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:20.000
to continue that use
somehow, but go --

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.040 position:56%
continue what seems to be a working
process through the Copyright Office

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.010
to determine what are
legitimate uses and -- and just --

01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:30.350
and streamline the process of their
continuation, rather than trying

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:33.460
to go through and predict
legislatively what --

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:38.800
into the future, that we don't
even really know what that'll be.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.840
I mean, like I -- right
now, cameras --

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.170
very often the firmware

01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:46.190
in the camera is what determines
the functionality of the camera.

01:10:46.190 --> 01:10:49.510
So different levels of cameras that
you buy have different firmware

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:52.210
in them and that's actually what
determines their functionality

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:56.170
because it creates
manufacturing efficiencies, right.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:59.940
So the firmware ends up becoming
really critical to the operation

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:03.240
of the camera, but it also is
a distinguishing characteristic

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.430
from -- of the camera, as well.

01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:10.030
And I think that that -- we
want to allow that flexibility

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.840
and the efficiencies
that it creates.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.070
So let's look at this from the
other end and streamline renewals

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.230
of exemptions, for example,
instead of trying to come

01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:21.680
up with a legislative fix that I
think would be a morass and only,

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.230
you know, enrich Jonathan
Band's law firm, right?

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:28.670
I mean, I -- to me that doesn't
feel like enough of an incentive

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:32.260
to disrupt the system that
seems to be largely working.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.770
I mean, we're looking at exception
cases and most of the litigation

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.080
around these exception
cases has come out in a way

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.030
that I think we all
agree was the right way.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.330
And -- and so, that seems

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:43.750
to be a system that's
working, not one that's broken.

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:46.880
And I -- I think that's --
we need to keep that in mind.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.360
I mean, I -- I -- as
a copyright owner,

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.650
I don't mind the default case
being -- the default answer --

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:53.950
I said this yesterday --

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:56.100
I don't mind the default
answer being no, right?

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.570
I -- there's this notion that,
wow, people are disincented

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:02.550
to start new businesses that
might infringe copyright

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:05.600
because their lawyers can't
assure them that it would be okay

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.410
that this creative use of getting
around copyright law would be okay.

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:13.530
And I think it's okay, instead,
that the default answer is no,

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.830
which it is in most cases.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:17.330
It's not that confusing
what's legal and what isn't.

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:21.410
And I think that we need to
look at the exceptions hard

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:24.710
and then find a way to preserve
them into the future as a --

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:28.660
as a better approach, I think,
than rejiggering the law.

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.960
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.380
I saw one or two cards
go up in -- in response.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:36.010
So I'm -- I'm sure people
have some responses.

01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:37.620
Ms. Greene?

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.920
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: Thank you.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.070
I just wanted to respond a bit
to this idea first about the idea

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:48.370
that 1201 is meant to limit access
and that that is rightly the case,

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:51.690
and the idea that it's proper that
the default answer should be no

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:53.370
with regard to exceptions.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.760
We spent a lot of time talking
about the marketplace implications

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.830
of the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of TPM measures.

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:02.790
We have not spent a
lot of time talking

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:07.180
about the public safety
implications of DMCA 1201,

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.610
specifically with regard
to the chilling effect

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:11.550
that it has on security research.

01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:14.380
It was recently noted that there
has been a significant increase

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:18.230
and will continue to be a
geometric increase in the amount

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.900
of connected devices in
the Internet of Things.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:26.560
And what we see is a tremendous
obstacle that security researchers,

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.650
in particular, need to overcome
to ensure that, whether it's cars

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:34.430
or airplanes or refrigerators
or TV sets or any

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:36.470
of the other connected
devices that we all use

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:39.800
and depend on, are in fact secure.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.350
And so, when we set access
as the threshold and say

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:47.220
to security researchers
that you can't breach access

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.610
because that is an infringement
on the purpose of 1201,

01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:53.950
as opposed to protecting the
core intellectual property,

01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:57.250
as opposed to protecting
against copyright infringement,

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:59.270 position:56%
I think what we say to the public is

01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:02.740
that market interests are more
important than the public safety

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.930
or the potential public
health interests of ensuring

01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:11.610
that our increasingly connected
world is in fact secure.

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:12.910
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:15.240
I think Mr. Adler was next.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.560
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Well, I think
with respect to those concerns,

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.280
it's pretty clear that they have
been addressed to some extent

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.750
by Congress through original
statutory exemptions with respect

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:28.710
to security research,
reverse engineering,

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:33.200
and also every three years, we
revisit many of those issues

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.840
in the context of the -- the
triennial rulemaking proceeding.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.280
But again, it goes back
to the question of whether

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.050
or not ultimately the issue of
infringement becomes the tail

01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:46.340
that wags the dog of 1201.

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:51.740
1201 was a recognition that
wholly apart from the issue

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:56.600
of infringement, there was value
with respect to access to a work

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.300
that had to be within the ability
of the rights holder to control.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.670
Otherwise, the rights holder
would have little reason to expose

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:07.870
that work in an online context
for people to be able to access

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:10.290
and use it without
providing any value

01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:12.320
to the rights holder in return.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.540
And -- and one thing
that must be kept in mind

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.690
as we discuss these issues is

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:20.560
that courts have not had any
difficulty whatsoever being able

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.630
to dismiss the notion that fair
use contains a right of access

01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:28.040
to a copy of a copyrighted work.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.340
It doesn't.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.640
It never has.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.940
The arguments in favor of why it
should have never gained any real

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:38.450
traction, and one can
understand why, because, again,

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:44.830 position:56%
it would subject the notion of
access as an independent venue of --

01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:49.910
of economic value to be
limited only with respect to how

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:52.570
that access related to the use.

01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:55.980
And if the use was non-infringing,
whether fair use or not,

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.180
but if it was non-infringing,
you'd be throwing

01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:00.100
out the ability to control access.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.110
And that's really what
1201 was originally about

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:06.930
and continues to be about today.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.230
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.300
So we have about 10 minutes left.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:15.430
So I think we're going to go around
the table one more time to respond

01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:19.290
to this question, it's be -- to
account for the cards that are up.

01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:23.510
And then I think we have time for
maybe one more question after that.

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:26.510
I believe Mr. Panjwani was next.

01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:28.990
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani:
I wanted to respond

01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:32.320
to a couple of the prior comments.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.940
Regarding Mr. Zuck's comment

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:39.100
that the default answer being no is
acceptable, I think the discussion

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:44.440
that we're having right now
about the essential software

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.920
or embedded software exemption,
I think, highlights the danger

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.000
of setting defaults at
no, that the growth of all

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.970
of these other issues
shows that, you know,

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:57.290
we thought the default can be no
because perhaps this is not going

01:16:57.290 --> 01:17:00.790 position:56%
to be such an incredible implication

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:03.280
on a vast range of
economic activity.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.900
But it turns out it is.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:09.250
And, I think, it's worth
reevaluating whether the default

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.680
being set at no makes sense in
-- in -- in light of all of this.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.240
I would also say that
the examples of successes

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.830
that have supposedly
occurred are, for example,

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:23.580
I'm assuming the Chamberlain
case and the Lexmark cases,

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.490
but for each one of those cases,
there's a case, for example,

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:30.470 position:56%
like I believe 1201 came up with MDY
v. Blizzard and I believe it came

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:36.200
up in particular in the RealDVD
case, where a court was faced

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.710
with software that allegedly could
be used for supposed fair uses.

01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:43.830
And the court said, well,
I can't get to whether

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:45.750
or not the use that's
being enabled is a fair use

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:48.280
because there's a circumvention
happening here.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.510
So we never get to
establishing case law

01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:53.490
on core copyright because of 1201.

01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:55.980
I will also point out that
I think that in response

01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:00.200
to Mr. Adler's comments that access
is a right in and of itself, that,

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.530
you know, the comments regarding
the passage of the DMCA is

01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:07.760
that we're creating this ancillary
right of access for the purposes

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.860 position:56%
of discouraging and disincentivizing
and preventing infringement

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:16.830
of the 106 rights, not access
for the sake of access itself.

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:21.090 position:56%
The fear was that digital goods are
so easily reproducible, so trivially

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.720
and so easily distributable
in an online format

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.940
that you need this additional
protection to back up 106,

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:30.490
not as a right that
stands in and of itself.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.430
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:36.170
Mr. Slover?

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:39.440
&gt;&gt; George Slover: Well,
Raza just covered my point.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.180
Raza just covered my point.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.480
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Okay.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.780
Thank you.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.080
Mr. Zuck?

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.380
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Yes, thanks.

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.680
I just wanted to respond briefly

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.580
to the public safety comment made
earlier, that the -- I -- I --

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.840
I think that it's just as
equally important to recognize

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.180
that there's public
safety implications

01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:01.700 position:56%
to tinkering with embedded software.

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.940
And so, again, if we bring public
safety into the discussion,

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.900
security isn't the
only component of that.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:10.000
It's also how the software is being
used and how the interconnection

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.880
between the software is being used
increasingly in medical devices

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.660
and other areas where there's a --

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:19.020
an enormous public safety issue
associated with allowing people

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.020
to tinker with embedded software.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.840
So I mean, I -- we can have that
conversation, but it's going

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.690
to be much broader and
much more complicated

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:30.020
than I think people would
hope that it would be.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.320
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Mr. Adler?

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.630
&gt;&gt; Allan Adler: Well, I -- I would
just again point out, I mean, we --

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:37.900
we -- we talked about this at
the very beginning, that for --

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:41.410
for the models, for example,
in the industry I represent

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:45.660
that are most important,
things like library elending

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.960
or subscription on-demand or
print on-demand or being able

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:55.160
to rent a work on-demand, the issue
there is about software being used

01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.140
to provide access to the expressive
work that's protected by copyright.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:03.310
And we shouldn't let the
difficulties created by the fact

01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:08.030
that software has a dual
identity as both a copyrightable

01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:12.970 position:56%
and protected work in itself and the
fact that its functionality is used

01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:16.630
for purposes of controlling
access to a separate

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:21.720
and distinct expressive work,
to place those expressive works

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.210
in a position that
Congress had not intended.

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:28.560 position:56%
I, again, respectfully disagree with
the comments that were made before

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.920
about the right of access being
something that was considered only

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.190
with respect to the issue of
trying to reduce online piracy.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:38.490
It was not.

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:42.900
It was specifically the case
that Congress sought to be able

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:47.070
to create online markets
for copyrighted works.

01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:51.860
And that was the reason why access
had to be subject to some degree

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.540
of control that was separate and
distinct from what you intended

01:20:55.540 --> 01:21:00.570
to do with the work once
you acquired access to it.

01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:01.870
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:03.170
Mr. Band?

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:05.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So I'll -- I'll
respond to Allan's previous comment,

01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:08.690
not this last comment, but -- but
the -- the -- the issue, at --

01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:10.560
at least, the -- where I see the --

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.390
the big problem with 1201(a)
in this access point, is again,

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:18.870
this is access to something,
whether you have --

01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:20.400
it's one thing to get
access to something

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.610
to which you don't have
a legal right to access.

01:21:22.610 --> 01:21:24.350
I mean, you don't have a
-- you don' t -- you're --

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:28.710
you don't lawfully possess that
item, as opposed to something

01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:31.360
that you've paid for and that
you have lawful access to

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.930 position:56%
and your ability to get inside that.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:37.340
And -- and this really, you
know, and -- and -- and --

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.460
and this really gets to the point

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.510
about security testing
and -- and so forth.

01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:45.530
So yes, Congress did
recognize that, and --

01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:49.510
and, you know, and came up with a
few permanent exceptions, and --

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:52.590
and so there was one
for security testing,

01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:58.190
one for encryption research, one
for interoperability, and so forth.

01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:03.010
But there wasn't one,
let's say, for, you know,

01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:07.970
the testing of the Volkswagen
for purposes of determining

01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:11.960
that they were committing this
enormous fraud on, you know,

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.670
consumers around the world.

01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:18.210
And -- and, you know, but -- and
the idea there is that a person,

01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:20.450
you know, presumably, you
know, whether it was, you know,

01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:24.460 position:56%
consumer report or whoever who would
hopefully be able to do that kind

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:27.350
of research would buy
the Volkswagen, right?

01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:29.110
They're not going to
steal the Volkswagen,

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.640 position:56%
they're going to buy the Volkswagen,
and then they should be able

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.490
to do the testing of all
sorts about how the, you know,

01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:37.860
how the software in it works.

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.220
But a lot of that is not
covered by specific --

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.840
by existing exceptions in the DMCA.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.510
And -- and moreover, there is this
whole generation of, you know --

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:50.770
yes, there are hackers and there
are people who do various kinds

01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:54.200
of testing sort of in the
gray areas of the DMCA,

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.250
but a lot of people just
have decided not to --

01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:59.520
that it's not worth it,
it's not worth the risk.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.790 position:56%
And -- and in the last -- yesterday
we were hearing about how, you know,

01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:07.690 position:56%
there there's this whole -- you have
a lot of academic researchers --

01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:11.680
I mean, you have some who are
willing to get into this area of --

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:15.020
of-- of -- of encryption
research and -- and all the --

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:19.490
all the other kinds of hacking
technologies to figure out how --

01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:21.690
you know, how, let's say,
Volkswagen gained the system

01:23:21.690 --> 01:23:24.220
and to detect those
kinds of problems.

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.570
But if you're -- if you're
working at an academic institution

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.120
and you know that there
are going to be --

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.860
there are colorable legal
issues, or there's a potential

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.250
of a legal issue, and you
have to worry about funding,

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:38.080
people just don't go into
that area of research.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.380
It's just not worth it.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.440
It's hard enough to get published
and tenure to have to worry

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.660
about the -- the -- the
legal issues on top of it.

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.710
So I think, you know, there --

01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:51.200
there's, again, as more software
is included in more things,

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.780
there's all kinds of
problems in that software,

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:57.040
whether it's consumer
protection issues and --

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.260
and safety issues that are
not covered by exceptions,

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:03.000
and to rely on the
exemption process to hope

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.970
that every three years maybe
an exemption will be granted

01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:09.130
to cover whatever you
want to do, is --

01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:14.730
is simply not sufficient to take
care of the enormous problems

01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:19.030
that we could fix probably
by relatively simple changes

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:23.520
to the DMCA, narrowing
its scope a little bit.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.820
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.120
I think Ms. Greene was next.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.050
&gt;&gt; Robyn Greene: So I was
really going to say a lot

01:24:28.050 --> 01:24:31.720 position:56%
of what Mr. Band just said with
regard to the fact that the current,

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.800
permanent, and exemptions are
not sufficient to encourage

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.370
or allow the types of security
research that is needed.

01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:41.970
And there is a chorus of
security researchers who will --

01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:44.340
who will and have said the same.

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.890
I would also just say that
because of the obstacles posed

01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:52.510
by the rulemaking process and the
fact that you have to go through it

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:56.600
because the default is no,
that serves as a further chill.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:02.140
The last note that I would want to
make on -- on this point is that,

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.920
when I was speaking to the
public safety concerns on --

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.470
and the public health concerns,
that not being able to have

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:13.800
as robust security research
as we might otherwise have,

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.840
I was not suggesting that that's
an equity, that it is appropriate

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.820
for the Copyright Office to weigh.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:23.500 position:56%
In fact, it is our position that the
inquiry should be limited to whether

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:28.710
or not the proposed use is --
would constitute an infringement.

01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:32.500
And so, we do align
ourselves certainly more

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.640
with public knowledge's
position on that point.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.990
I was merely making the point

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:38.900
that by expanding the
inquiry beyond whether

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:43.030
or not a proposed exemption would
constitute an infringement does

01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:49.610
in fact implicate significant
public policy concerns negatively.

01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:52.030
And then, the last thing
that I would note is, the --

01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:55.720
the idea of access
being this threshold

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.680
and this important protection, when
we keep hearing this from industry,

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.310
it is sort of like the
industry trying to have its cake

01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:05.530
and eat it too, because oftentimes,
while there are certain industries

01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:08.350
that are able to protect
their products, as --

01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:12.770 position:56%
as the gentleman from ESA previously
stated, there are other industries

01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:16.130
that simply can't and
that still want to rely

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:20.260 position:56%
on limitations to access under 1201.

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.000
And a good example of
this is a study conducted

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.350
by Columbia University which found
that at some point 46 percent

01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:29.820
of Americans engaged
in some form of piracy.

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:32.260
So clearly, piracy is still
a significant problem,

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.240
as many industries themselves say.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.100
Yet the study also found
that the vast majority

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.500
of those individuals wound

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:43.600
up purchasing more digital
products online legally than those

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.180
who never engaged in piracy at all.

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:49.300
And so, I do think that there are
some really interesting findings

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.260
there that it would be worth
thinking about in terms

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:55.910
of the value of limiting access.

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.210
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:26:57.210 --> 01:27:00.030
So we are just about at the time
and I see a couple of other cards,

01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:04.250
and I just wanted to
ask one more question.

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:08.310
So in your responses,
you might want to --

01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:11.430
I invite you to address this
in your responses as well,

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:15.660
and that's the question of how
prevalent, in your experience

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:22.750
as practitioners, is it for 1201 to
be used for what you might regard

01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:31.870
as anticompetitive
purposes or to enforce 1201

01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:33.900
against consumer products?

01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:38.080
On the one hand, you know, we've
heard -- we've heard that, while,

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.980
you know, you have the
Chamberlain and the Lexmark cases,

01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.890
those are several years
old, and in any event,

01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:47.640
the courts rejected the
plaintiffs' claims in those cases.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:50.960
On the other hand, we've
heard that, in any event,

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.500
there still is a chilling
effect by the --

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:56.300
by the prospect of
litigation in these areas.

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:59.030
So it would be helpful
for us just to --

01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:05.130
to have your perspective sort of
on how commonplace these sorts

01:28:05.130 --> 01:28:08.240
of claims are in the 1201 context.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:11.570
And I think Mr. Dow was next.

01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:12.870
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: So I -- I guess --

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:14.730
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: And we -- and we
-- and forgive me, I -- we'll --

01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:16.350
we urge you -- everyone to be brief

01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:18.070
because we're right
up against the clock.

01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:19.370
Thanks.

01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:21.340
&gt;&gt; Troy Dow: So in -- in response
to your question there, it --

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:25.310
my own firsthand experience is
that there's not -- I -- I don't --

01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:27.920 position:56%
I don't have firsthand experience
with a lot of that type of activity.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:31.300
What I see in that area
is largely anecdotal.

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.580
I see it raised in the context
of the rulemaking proceeding.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.020
I also see a rulemaking
proceeding where, as you said,

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.370
I think there were 27 exemptions
asked for and 22 granted

01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:43.620 position:56%
in the last round, and so I'm -- I'm
not sure that process isn't working.

01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.370
I mean, it was intended to be
something that could be flexible

01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:47.670
and respond to these things.

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:50.250
And, in my experience, I'm
not sure it -- that it isn't.

01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:56.120
I had my tent up really to respond
to Mr. Panjwani's notion that --

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.420
that access was not
intended to be separate

01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:00.720
from the rights of
the copyright owner.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.350
I mean, that -- that notion
just simply isn't correct.

01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:08.560
It was very clearly discussed, very
clearly contemplated at the time,

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.860
and I just wanted to highlight,

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:11.700
just coming out of the House
Judiciary Committee Report

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.510
where they -- they say the
technological measures,

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:16.150
such as encryption,
scrambling, electronic envelopes

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:19.080
that this bill protects can be
deployed not only to prevent piracy

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.270
and other economically
harmful and unauthorized uses

01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:23.810
of copyrighted materials,
but also to support new ways

01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:26.140
of disseminating copyrighted
materials to users

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.280
and to safeguard the
availability of legitimate uses

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.220
of those materials by individuals.

01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:35.150
It absolutely was not limited to
protecting access for the purposes

01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:36.450
of preventing infringement.

01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:38.360
It was protecting access
for the purposes

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.030
of incentivizing these new business
models, many of which don't rely

01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:44.580
on exercises of the rights
of the copyright owners.

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.350
In our business, those are
the new business models

01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:47.650
that we're engaged in.

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:50.810
We've got a whole suite of apps
that allow you to gain access

01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:54.080
to our linear television content,
whether it's Disney Channel

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.550 position:56%
or whether it's ESPN or whether it's
ABC, to allow you on your iPhone

01:29:57.550 --> 01:30:01.550
to watch those things on
the go that is controlled --

01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:04.190
the access to those things is
controlled through authentication

01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:08.890
to ensure that you have
permission to have that access.

01:30:08.890 --> 01:30:10.900
But it's not contingent
upon the exercise

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:12.720
of the rights of the
copyright owner.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.020
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:17.870
And quickly please, Mr. Panjwani?

01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:19.570
&gt;&gt; Raza Panjawani: Just
responding to your question

01:30:19.570 --> 01:30:20.870
about the prevalence of --

01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:23.500
of 1201 claims against
sort of consumer activities

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:27.570 position:56%
and pro-consumer activities, I would
note that that's in part asking

01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:31.830
for us to prove a counterfactual
in that it's our perspective

01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:33.130
that the existence of --

01:30:33.130 --> 01:30:34.540
if we assume that many
people are law-abiding

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:37.500
and the law prevents engaging
in pro-consumer activity

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.050
that would be prevented by 1201,

01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:41.920
then that activity
just isn't out there.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.050
I think we have seen the examples
that did come out are involving,

01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:47.350
you know, the inkjet printers.

01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:52.430
And I would point out that we
filed to clarify that legal ruling

01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:54.460
to make sure it extended
to 3D printers.

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:57.930
And that attracted a voluminous
filing by Stratasys, a major player

01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:02.380
in the industry, opposing that
on the ground that no, no, no,

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:07.680
we have this right to lock you
into our first party filament.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.880
And most recently,
another competitor

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.710
of Stratasys 3D systems just
announced end-of-life of one

01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:16.380
of their printer lines,
which had, you know,

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.410
lock in a first-party filament.

01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:21.340
And I think that underscores the
importance of exemptions like this

01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:25.430
and sort of the effect
that 1201 has.

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:26.730
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:28.030
Mr. Pierre-Louis?

01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:29.330
&gt;&gt; Stan Pierre-Louis:
I promise to be brief.

01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:32.860
First, I think it bears repeating
that 1201's been a success story

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.690
in what it aimed to do, right --

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:38.200
in the twin goals of both
getting more broadband out there,

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.760 position:56%
getting more devices innovated, and
getting works online and on devices.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.220
So it's been a success, and
so, we've got to really think

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.530
about how we tinker with it, right?

01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:49.070
There are two types of
tinkerings here, right.

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:52.500
And we've got to be very
careful in how we approach that.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.850
The other is that we've seen
innovation really blossom.

01:31:54.850 --> 01:31:56.270
It hasn't been chilled.

01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:58.340
And what businesses
like is certainty,

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.370
both in what they can and can't do.

01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:02.110
And when they know that they
can make that investment

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:03.700
and get a return, they
will invest more.

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:05.000
And they've done that.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.360
And I think -- I think that's
been proven out, and so,

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.540 position:56%
we've got to be careful how we think

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.820
about the exemption process
and all of those things.

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:13.950
But I think first and foremost,
we've got to look at this

01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:16.780
as a success story that
we want to continue.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:18.080
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.540
Mr. Weissenberg?

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Weissenberg: Well, I'm
not a practitioner just yet,

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:25.650
I'll be graduating in a month
and passing the bar, but I --

01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:27.440
I would again put your
attention to the --

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.850
the TracFone reply comment
from last year's triennial.

01:32:29.850 --> 01:32:31.150
They list -- they do a great job

01:32:31.150 --> 01:32:32.840
of listing all the success
they've had using the DMCA

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:36.080
to protect their anticompetitive
lock-in model.

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.390
Again, we emphasize
that's not appropriate --

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:40.120
that's not an appropriate
use of 1201

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.590
and we urge the Copyright
Office to make a statement,

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:44.670
a clear statement saying that
that no longer has a place

01:32:44.670 --> 01:32:45.970
in this process, so.

01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:47.270
Thank you.

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.570
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:32:48.570 --> 01:32:50.140
And, I think we'll
wrap up with Mr. Band.

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.110
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So I
know Donald Trump thinks

01:32:52.110 --> 01:32:54.960
that unpredictability is a virtue.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.880
But when counseling clients,
unpredictability is -- is not good.

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:03.380 position:56%
I mean, not my unpredictability,
but the unpredictability of the law.

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:09.370
So after the DMCA passed, looking
at a plain reading of 1201(a),

01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:11.540
it was pretty clear
on its plain reading

01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:14.040
that it could be used
anti-competitively.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.830
And I had to counsel
clients, yeah, you can't --

01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:20.250
you know, if you try to circumvent
for this purpose or that purpose,

01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:23.360
to keep competing in the
aftermarket, you're --

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.950
you might have a problem.

01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:29.230
And then, along comes the --
the Chamberlain v. Skylink case,

01:33:29.230 --> 01:33:32.160
and I said, okay, well, you
know, silly me, you know,

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.730
I was just reading the plain
language of the Statute and,

01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:38.000
obviously, it means something
different from the plain language.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.460
But that's good, I like
Chamberlain better, and so,

01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.880
now you can compete
in the aftermarket.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.460
And then, along comes MDY and
says, you know, and they said, no,

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.970
you know, Congress meant, you
know, the plain -- plain --

01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:53.460
plain language controls
and this interpretation

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.210
of Chamberlain is wrong.

01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:58.060
And so now I have to tell
my clients, oh, well you --

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.610
you could have -- you used to be
able to compete in the aftermarket,

01:34:00.610 --> 01:34:03.720
now you can't compete
anymore in the aftermarket.

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.090
And so, that's where we are now.

01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:06.510
That sort of depends where you are.

01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:08.870
I guess in the Sixth Circuit, you
can compete in the aftermarket,

01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:13.050
in the Ninth Circuit, you can't
compete in the aftermarket.

01:34:13.050 --> 01:34:16.010
And -- and just to, you know, as --
as Raza, said, you -- and -- and --

01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:19.160
and -- and the gentleman here said,
you know, you just have to look

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.420
at who is opposing exemptions

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:25.140
to see how it is being
used anti- competitively.

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.960
So we see in the 3D context,
the 3D printer context,

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:32.820 position:56%
it's being used anti- competitively,
in -- in the TracFone case,

01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:35.250
and then, of course, you
know, when -- when --

01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:40.400
when all the major automobile
manufacturers are opposing it

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.870
because it's -- they --
it's clearly, they're --

01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:45.130
they're opposing the
competition that would be enabled.

01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:48.940
So it's quite obvious
that it has a potential

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:53.460
for enormous anticompetitive
implications.

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:54.760
&gt;&gt; Kevin Amer: Thank you.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.060
I -- I think we have
to leave it there.

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:57.360
I -- I apologize.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.980
Thank you to all our panelists.

01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:05.430
We're a little bit over time, so if
I could ask that we limit the break

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:10.170 position:56%
to 10 minutes, if -- if panelists
on session two could plan to be back

01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:13.850
by 10:50, that would be great.

01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:15.150
Thank you.

01:35:15.150 --> 01:35:18.790
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
