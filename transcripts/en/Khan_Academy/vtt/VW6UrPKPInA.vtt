00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.220
I've got five numbers
here, and the goal

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.400
is to order them from
least to greatest.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.550
And it might be obvious to you
that all five of these numbers

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.080
are negative numbers.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.050
So let's just think about
which of these is the greatest

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.150
number.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.642
And you might be tempted
to say oh, well, you know,

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:21.850
if these were all positive,
40 would be the greatest.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.160
So you might be tempted to say
negative 40 is the greatest.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.000
But you have to realize what
the negative is telling you,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.210
and to think about that.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.159
Think about if these
were your dollar amounts

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.390
in your bank account.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.200
Would you rather have negative
$40 in your bank account

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
or negative $7 in
your bank account?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.480
Negative 40 means that
you owe the bank $40.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.940
So it's 40 less
than having nothing.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.720
Negative 7 would mean that
you owe the bank only $7.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.750
So it's actually the
case that negative 40

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.730
is less than negative 7.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.380
And out of all of these numbers,
it is the least of all of them.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.417
So negative 40 is the very
least that you could do.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.750
That's the least amount of
money that you would want out

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.030
of these comparisons
in your bank account,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.570
or the smallest amount of money.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.000
You owe the bank $40.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.710
Not only do you have nothing,
you owe the bank $40.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.860
Then the next smallest
number would be negative 30.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.690
And then the next smallest
after that would be negative 25.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.765
And then the next smallest
after that would be negative 10.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.600
And then finally, the greatest
of all of these numbers-- and I

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.070
will do it in pink--
the greatest of all

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580
of these numbers is negative 7.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.170
And if it's still
not obvious to you,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.950
you could also think of
them in temperature terms.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.790
Which of these is the
coldest temperature,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.460
whether you're talking
about Celsius or Fahrenheit?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.470
Negative 40 would be
the coldest temperature.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.050
Negative 7 would be the
warmest temperature.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.060
There would be the most heat
in the air at negative 7.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.240
Another way to think about it
is we could draw a number line.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.300
So let's draw a number
line right over here.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.440
If this is a zero, and we could
put maybe positive 7 up here.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.380
Positive 7 isn't one
of these numbers,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.280
but then we could plot
all the other numbers.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.160
So this right here
might be negative 7.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.410
If that's negative 7, then
maybe this right over here

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.340
would be negative 10.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.140
Notice we go further and
further to the left of zero.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.350
And then we go a little
bit further to the left.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.570
We get negative 25.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.430
A little bit further to the
left than that is negative 30.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.930
And then you go even
further to the left

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.820
and you get to negative 40.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.990
So if you think of it this
way, the least of these numbers

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.830
is the one that's furthest to
the left on the number line,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.195
and the greatest is the one
that's furthest to the right.
