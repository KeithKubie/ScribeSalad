00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's a simple command as: print eval(myrobot, p)--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I know it wasn't very hard,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but it gets you a kind of fun to play with it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So here's the sequence of numbers I get out.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It turns out, we don't always get the same number.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Sometimes it doesn't work.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's the second run.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These are small values again--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
another one, another one.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here's one that's interesting, so we can look at these errors:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
5, 5, 7, 1--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 6.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It is a good run, so the error is down to 6,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
compared to whatever it would be

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
if you didn't do particle filters and had a random set of particles.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
In fact, to understand this, let me just take the "print eval" command

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and move it to the very beginning, where we have done no particle filters.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So hit run, and what you will find is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
it goes from 38 to 4, 3, 3 in just one step of particle filtering,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which is a drastic reduction of error.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now running many times, there will be cases where it fails,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
where there's just no particle nearby.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Strangely, they don't show up right now.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When I was testing it and programming it, I actually got one of those.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I had an error of like 15 or 20.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Whenever I want to demo something it just doesn't work.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Well, this particle filter is just too good.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.501
It just gets the answer relatively right really, really quickly.
