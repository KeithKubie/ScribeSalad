nobody so we started thinking about
things do you now have for example a

00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199
things do you now have for example a
 

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.929
things do you now have for example a
fingerprint so that we could identify

00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:00.939
fingerprint so that we could identify
 

00:15:00.939 --> 00:15:02.639
fingerprint so that we could identify
the person and immediately run it

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:02.649
the person and immediately run it
 

00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:06.689
the person and immediately run it
through you know high-speed computers to

through you know high-speed computers to
 

00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:08.519
through you know high-speed computers to
identify we know who was entering the

building do you use an iris scan which
 

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:12.179
building do you use an iris scan which
is as good as a fingerprint so that you

00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:12.189
is as good as a fingerprint so that you
 

00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:14.009
is as good as a fingerprint so that you
can do the same thing in a way that

00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:14.019
can do the same thing in a way that
 

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:16.079
can do the same thing in a way that
people think is less intrusive do you

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:16.089
people think is less intrusive do you

through a system all these issues
 

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.370
through a system all these issues
started to come to the forefront with

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:29.380
started to come to the forefront with
 

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.050
started to come to the forefront with
all of the issues that our panelists I

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.060
all of the issues that our panelists I
 

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.340
all of the issues that our panelists I
think are better equipped to discuss

the other issue was who did we think we
 

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.689
the other issue was who did we think we
were screening on those days the issue

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:39.699
were screening on those days the issue
 

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:41.699
were screening on those days the issue
that we had to face was whether or not

what was on the shelf so that we can
 

01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:19.610
what was on the shelf so that we can
restock the shelf then somebody figured

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620
restock the shelf then somebody figured
 

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.890
restock the shelf then somebody figured
out what's the next way use that and now

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:21.900
out what's the next way use that and now
 

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.790
out what's the next way use that and now
here's what the law of unintended
