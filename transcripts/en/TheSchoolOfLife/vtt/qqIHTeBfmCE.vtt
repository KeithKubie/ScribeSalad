00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.609
Restaurants have traditionally enjoyed a crucial
and privileged place in the history of dating,

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.339
providing us with enough privacy to get to
know one another and enough public scrutiny

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:19.199
to help us feel safe as we do so. The food and drink has largely been an excuse. But what we decide

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.109
to eat and drink together isn’t merely incidental
to the real task of mutual understanding.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.860
It too is rich in psychological clues, communicating
messages about who we are and what we might

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.649
be like over a lifetime. How we order can
in a minor key belong to the task of winning

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.420
someone else over to our cause. Let’s think
of a number of ways of ordering food and drink

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.329
that suggest intriguing and complex things
about our identities: What we might order:

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.899
A large mixed salad, accompanied by a plate
of fries on the side; we could eat the fries

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.739
with our fingers and occasionally dip them
in the vinaigrette.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.420
What we’d be communicating: That we’re

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.550
pretty sensible, in many ways, with a keen
eye for restraint and a decent amount of self-control.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:21.250
But, at the same time, that we aren’t afraid
of our own more impish desires. We’d be

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.760
hinting that we were a sound blend of the
mischievous and the prudent; that we had enough

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.890
self-mastery and obedience to have earned
the right for occasional moments of unorthodox

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.990
indulgence. What we might order: Fish fingers
off the children’s menu. What we’d be

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.040
communicating: Through our order, we’d be
implying that we could recognise, without

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.420
anxiety, the claim of the more childish parts
of our personalities, but that we were sufficiently

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.580
grown up to be undisturbed by their presence.
The order might work best if we combined it

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.450
with an obviously sophisticated starter or
desert. No one can be free of the legacy of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.810
their early past, we’d be saying through
our food, what matters is the maturity with

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.750
which we can acknowledge and navigate around
it. What we might order: Almost nothing. What

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.170
we’d be communicating: After putting in
our bare order, we might allow ourselves to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.140
say with beguiling frankness that we were
simply too nervous to eat. This would be importantly

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.670
different from – and much more attractive
than – merely ordering a normal amount,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.070
then pushing it idly around our plate. We’d
be showing that we were upfront in revealing

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.280
that the date meant a lot to us, and that
there was in our eyes nothing shameful about

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.240
being anxious in relation to an event that
might turn out to be hugely significant. Our

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.290
inability to countenance any desert whatsoever
(not even a few berries) would be a flattering

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.069
way of sending out a message that we were
in the company of someone with a power to

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.460
alter our lives. What we might order: Cranberry
juice What we’d be communicating: The deep

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.380
red drink would be a symbol of independence;
we’d be making a rather unconventional order

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.620
through it, this not being what people typically
ask for in a restaurant. But it wouldn’t

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.180
be willful or crazy either. We’d just be
quietly asserting that we didn’t mind appearing

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.959
a little odd for the sake of getting something
we genuinely liked. We’d be, via the glass,

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.810
saying that we were our own sort of people.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.069
What we might order: the chicken, but – we’d
add with a large smile and a hugely polite

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.270
and patient explanation – ideally without
the ginger and garlic and with the sauce on

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.180
the side in a little jug, if that was even
vaguely acceptable to the guys in the kitchen,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.670
who we really hope wouldn’t be put out by
this sort of (in our words) ‘unbearably

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.640
fussy’ request. What we’d be communicating:
That we knew our tastes were complicated and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.420
off the beaten track but that we had the self-belief
and requisite charm to lay out our desires

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.660
calmly and without undue or grating petulance.
Everyone in relationships turns out in time

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.520
to harbour a host of very particular requirements:
no one, however casual they might appear at

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.160
first, is ever really ‘easy’ in the long-term.
So what matters hugely is if we have learnt

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.550
the art of communicating our needs clearly,
with grace, without entitlement or wilfulness,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.940
with the wit and will of the best teacher
– an accomplishment there can be perfect

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.720
opportunities to display in our approach to
the ordering of the main course.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.120
Something we hadn’t ever ordered, but
that was sitting on our date’s plate and

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.770
that looked especially appealing – and that
we’d very sweetly ask if we could have a

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.490
bit of. What we’d be communicating: that
we were ready to step over conventional barriers

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.600
in the name of friendship; that we understood
there were certain standard obstacles to intimacy

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.699
but that we were interested in finding a few
playful ways of getting past them – possibly

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.920
later that night.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.840
In the end the success of a date will not hang entirely on what's eaten or drunk.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.040
But nor should we ignore how much could be communicated through such details

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.840
therefore how legitimate it always is to reflect at depth on more apparently minor sides of love.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:44.560
