The web is always changing
and the way we access it is changing.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.861
The source of that change is you:
developers all around the world who are

00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:14.779
using our tools to create great new things
and with so many tools, the sky's the limit.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.369
But it can't happen without you and your ideas.
We want to know you better so we created a

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.730
new place
just for that -- to hear from you.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.130
We want to hear what inspires you as a developer
and how we can help.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.449
Here you can record a video, share stories
with us, and more.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.100
Let us know what being a Google Developer
means to you.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.821
And you can talk to us in person at Google
Developer

00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:41.170
events all over the world so that we can learn
how to support you better.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.640
Oh, by the way, we also started rolling out
a new

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.649
site for Google Developers. Not just code,
but community,

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.710
news, tools, and other resources. And cake.
Like any open source project, it's a work

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.239
in progress.
With your help, it can be great.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.030
developers.google.com/stories
Change is important to the web. Help us keep

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.760
changing it
together.
