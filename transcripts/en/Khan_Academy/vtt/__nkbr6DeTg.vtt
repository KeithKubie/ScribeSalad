00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:02.861
Voiceover:Gavin has these horses.

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:06.945
Is the number of horses
in each picture below

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:11.410
more than, less than, or same as

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.641
the number of horses Gavin has?

00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:19.137
Let's first look at how
many horses Gavin has.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:25.960
He has one, two, three,
four, five, six horses.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.300
Let's remember that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.090
and let's compare each of
these amounts of horses

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.240
to the six horses that Gavin has.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.641
Let's look over here,

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.296
over here we have one, two, three,

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:41.861
four, five, six horses.

00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:44.866
This is the same number that Gavin has,

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.792
they're just arranged differently.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:49.176
This is the same,

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:52.884
we'll put in the Same as bucket.

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:57.681
Now, here we have one, two,
three, four five horses.

00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:02.054
This is less than the six
horses that Gavin has,

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:04.016
five is less than six.

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:06.301
Here and I can just look at this

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:08.046
and see that there's more than six

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:09.279
but we can count them.

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:11.618
We have one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:13.986
and then another five
that's going to be 10.

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:16.089
Or we can say one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:18.746
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.910
Well 10 is more than six,

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:23.183
10 is more than six,

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.621
so we'll put it in the More than bucket.

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:29.085
Now here we have four and four

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:30.713
well that's going to be eight.

00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:32.235
One, two, three, four,

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:33.764
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:38.290
It's again, that is more
than the six up here.

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:40.588
That's more than six

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:42.371
and then here we have one, two,

00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:43.775
three, four horses.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.818
Well four is less than six,

00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:48.760
so I will put that,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.485
I will put that in the less than,

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:55.948
in the Less than bucket just like that.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.792
Let's check our answer to see how we did.

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:01.379
We got it right.
