so you might have noticed we released a
really cool navigation editor we are not

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
really cool navigation editor we are not
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050
really cool navigation editor we are not
going to talk about that today but there

past year the improvements we made
 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.160
past year the improvements we made
specifically will focus on sample data

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
specifically will focus on sample data
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319
specifically will focus on sample data
which is something really cool we

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
which is something really cool we
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.139
which is something really cool we
shipped in 3.2 and we'll also talk about

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149

constantly at 2.2 and what's coming up
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.470
constantly at 2.2 and what's coming up
with this libraries for first for the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
with this libraries for first for the
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150

hi everyone so to start with we're going

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
hi everyone so to start with we're going
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140
hi everyone so to start with we're going
to talk about delay it a little most of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
to talk about delay it a little most of
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.670
to talk about delay it a little most of
you are probably quite familiar with the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
you are probably quite familiar with the
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500
you are probably quite familiar with the
tool so it's a graphical tool that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
tool so it's a graphical tool that
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410
tool so it's a graphical tool that
enable you to build your layout without

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
enable you to build your layout without
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810
enable you to build your layout without
having to write any xml and it's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
having to write any xml and it's
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.440
having to write any xml and it's
supposed to make you more productive so

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450
supposed to make you more productive so
 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.270
supposed to make you more productive so
what is nice with the layer data in that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
what is nice with the layer data in that
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.770
what is nice with the layer data in that
it also works with your custom views so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
it also works with your custom views so
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.319
it also works with your custom views so
if in your code you have a custom view

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
if in your code you have a custom view
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.810
if in your code you have a custom view
it will render in the layout editor and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
it will render in the layout editor and
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300
it will render in the layout editor and
the nice thing is that any custom view

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
the nice thing is that any custom view
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460
the nice thing is that any custom view
from your project will appear in the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
from your project will appear in the
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.880
from your project will appear in the
palette so our goal is really to make

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
palette so our goal is really to make
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.940
palette so our goal is really to make
you more productive so we've added some

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
you more productive so we've added some
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.440
you more productive so we've added some
nice features this year to do so

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450
 
 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.630
 
the first one I want to talk about is

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640
the first one I want to talk about is
 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.180
the first one I want to talk about is
the conversion so if you right-click on

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190
the conversion so if you right-click on
 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.040
the conversion so if you right-click on
a view you will see the convert view

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050
a view you will see the convert view
 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.830
a view you will see the convert view
option that will make this pop-up appear

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840
option that will make this pop-up appear
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.980
option that will make this pop-up appear
and you will be able to select one of

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990
and you will be able to select one of
 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.100
and you will be able to select one of
the preset component or you can use the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110
the preset component or you can use the
 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.580
the preset component or you can use the
edit text just to pick any view from

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
edit text just to pick any view from
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.410
edit text just to pick any view from
your project and this view is contextual

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
your project and this view is contextual
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.330
your project and this view is contextual
so if you right-click on a view which is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
so if you right-click on a view which is
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.160
so if you right-click on a view which is
not of your group we will show some

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
not of your group we will show some
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.560
not of your group we will show some
preset of non view group views the next

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570
preset of non view group views the next
 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.880
preset of non view group views the next
thing I want to talk about is a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
thing I want to talk about is a
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.490
thing I want to talk about is a
navigation between include layout and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500
navigation between include layout and
 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.250
navigation between include layout and
their parent so in the component tree or

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
their parent so in the component tree or
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.220
their parent so in the component tree or
in the preview if you double click on a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230
in the preview if you double click on a
 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.320
in the preview if you double click on a
component on an include tracker it will

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330
component on an include tracker it will
 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.330
component on an include tracker it will
jump automatically to the children and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340
jump automatically to the children and
 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.940
jump automatically to the children and
if you click on the arrow on the top of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950
if you click on the arrow on the top of
 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.680
if you click on the arrow on the top of
the component tree it will jump back to

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690
the component tree it will jump back to
 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.509
the component tree it will jump back to
the parent this is quite handy to go

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519
the parent this is quite handy to go
 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.280
the parent this is quite handy to go
fast between two layouts the layout

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290
fast between two layouts the layout
 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.040
fast between two layouts the layout
editor is really powerful you'll twist

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050
editor is really powerful you'll twist
 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.900
editor is really powerful you'll twist
constrain layout and constraint layered

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910
constrain layout and constraint layered
 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.960
constrain layout and constraint layered
is a great a great layout because it's

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970
is a great a great layout because it's
 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.120
is a great a great layout because it's
very powerful but it's very verbose

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130
very powerful but it's very verbose
 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.180
very powerful but it's very verbose
right so you might not want to write all

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
right so you might not want to write all
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.520
right so you might not want to write all
your XML by hand so what you should do

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530
your XML by hand so what you should do
 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.620
your XML by hand so what you should do
instead is take advantage of all the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630
instead is take advantage of all the
 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.560
instead is take advantage of all the
menus we have in the layout editor to

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570
menus we have in the layout editor to
 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.979
menus we have in the layout editor to
generate this XML for you so again

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
generate this XML for you so again
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.780
generate this XML for you so again
right-click on the view and then you can

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790
right-click on the view and then you can
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.650
right-click on the view and then you can
use the align any of the top option to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660
use the align any of the top option to
 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.810
use the align any of the top option to
choose your option and we have many of

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820
choose your option and we have many of
 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.910
choose your option and we have many of
them so feel free to check them after

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
them so feel free to check them after
 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.949
them so feel free to check them after
this session and really it can make you

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959
this session and really it can make you
 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.300
this session and really it can make you
more productive but most of you are

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310
more productive but most of you are
 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.789
more productive but most of you are
probably populating your layout at

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799
probably populating your layout at
 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.069
probably populating your layout at
runtime you have data from the internet

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079
runtime you have data from the internet
 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.350
runtime you have data from the internet
and you want to populate them so they

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360
and you want to populate them so they
 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.449
and you want to populate them so they
are not rendering at the layer in the

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459
are not rendering at the layer in the
 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.640
are not rendering at the layer in the
layout editor so to solve this issue

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650
layout editor so to solve this issue
 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.470
layout editor so to solve this issue
Jigga gonna come here and talk about the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480
Jigga gonna come here and talk about the
 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.840
Jigga gonna come here and talk about the
sample data so before we talk about

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850
sample data so before we talk about
 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.190
sample data so before we talk about
sample data let's talk a little bit

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200
sample data let's talk a little bit
 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.680
sample data let's talk a little bit
about tools attributes so the tools

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690
about tools attributes so the tools
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.560
about tools attributes so the tools
attributes are the XML attributes now

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570
attributes are the XML attributes now
 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.910
attributes are the XML attributes now
you actually use to give additional

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920
you actually use to give additional
 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.699
you actually use to give additional
information to the to the under studio

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709
information to the to the under studio
 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.920
information to the to the under studio
under the layout editor you are probably

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930
under the layout editor you are probably
 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.660
under the layout editor you are probably
familiar with many of them

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670
familiar with many of them
 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.680
familiar with many of them
we are not going to talk about all of

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690
we are not going to talk about all of
 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.410
we are not going to talk about all of
them let's covered one example just to

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420
them let's covered one example just to
 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.290
them let's covered one example just to
be clear on this so you probably have

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300
be clear on this so you probably have
 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.590
be clear on this so you probably have
seen this so in your strings file you

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600
seen this so in your strings file you
 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.330
seen this so in your strings file you
get a lint warning saying that you

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340
get a lint warning saying that you
 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.960
get a lint warning saying that you
haven't translated a particular string

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970
haven't translated a particular string
 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.280
haven't translated a particular string
usually what you want to do is to fix

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290
usually what you want to do is to fix
 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.920
usually what you want to do is to fix
this error you translate it and that's

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930
this error you translate it and that's
 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.620
this error you translate it and that's
it the error is gone but there might be

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630
it the error is gone but there might be
 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.970
it the error is gone but there might be
valid reasons what you don't want to

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980
valid reasons what you don't want to
 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.490
valid reasons what you don't want to
translate actually this is string it

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500
translate actually this is string it
 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.480
translate actually this is string it
could be that is the name of the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490
could be that is the name of the
 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.920
could be that is the name of the
application and you don't want to

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930
application and you don't want to
 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.570
application and you don't want to
translate it in every single language or

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580
translate it in every single language or
 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.150
translate it in every single language or
in certain languages so what you can do

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160
in certain languages so what you can do
 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.480
in certain languages so what you can do
here is you basically can tell hundreds

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490
here is you basically can tell hundreds
 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.120
here is you basically can tell hundreds
to do look I know about the server but I

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130
to do look I know about the server but I
 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.580
to do look I know about the server but I
don't want you I don't want you to tell

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590
don't want you I don't want you to tell
 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.220
don't want you I don't want you to tell
me about it because it's fine so that is

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230
me about it because it's fine so that is
 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.970
me about it because it's fine so that is
one example there are many others but

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980
one example there are many others but
 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.130
one example there are many others but
what we want to talk about now is

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140
what we want to talk about now is
 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.280
what we want to talk about now is
actually design time attributes this is

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290
actually design time attributes this is
 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.860
actually design time attributes this is
just a subset of the tools attributes

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870
just a subset of the tools attributes
 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.820
just a subset of the tools attributes
that I talked about

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830
that I talked about
 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.880
that I talked about
there are given additional information

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890
there are given additional information
 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.030
there are given additional information
and context to the layout editor so

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040
and context to the layout editor so
 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.850
and context to the layout editor so
let's see it with one example so in this

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860
let's see it with one example so in this
 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.640
let's see it with one example so in this
case what we have is we created our

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650
case what we have is we created our
 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.940
case what we have is we created our
toolbar we edited the layout on its own

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950
toolbar we edited the layout on its own
 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.920
toolbar we edited the layout on its own
so we use constraint layout we created

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930
so we use constraint layout we created
 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.900
so we use constraint layout we created
it and this is how it will look in the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910
it and this is how it will look in the
 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.170
it and this is how it will look in the
layout editor so what you can see is the

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180
layout editor so what you can see is the
 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.750
layout editor so what you can see is the
toolbar without any context so you can

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760
toolbar without any context so you can
 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.980
toolbar without any context so you can
see the layout but you don't know how

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990
see the layout but you don't know how
 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.840
see the layout but you don't know how
it's going to look at runtime in your

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850
it's going to look at runtime in your
 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.640
it's going to look at runtime in your
application so there is something that

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650
application so there is something that
 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.969
application so there is something that
we can do you can again tell the layout

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979
we can do you can again tell the layout
 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.180
we can do you can again tell the layout
editor this layout is going to be

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190
editor this layout is going to be
 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.790
editor this layout is going to be
included in this other layer that I'm

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800
included in this other layer that I'm
 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800
included in this other layer that I'm
hinting here so using this attribute

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810
hinting here so using this attribute
 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.640
hinting here so using this attribute
choose show in we are letting the layout

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650
choose show in we are letting the layout
 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.770
choose show in we are letting the layout
return know that we want to embed this

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780
return know that we want to embed this
 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.310
return know that we want to embed this
header into the main layout and that way

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320
header into the main layout and that way
 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.219
header into the main layout and that way
we can see it in context so now when we

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229
we can see it in context so now when we
 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.170
we can see it in context so now when we
are editing we know if the colors match

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180
are editing we know if the colors match
 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.840
are editing we know if the colors match
we can actually tweak our design and see

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850
we can actually tweak our design and see
 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.450
we can actually tweak our design and see
how every change impacts our layout and

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460
how every change impacts our layout and
 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.029
how every change impacts our layout and
the best thing is again you can do it

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039
the best thing is again you can do it
 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.219
the best thing is again you can do it
you can edit it right there you don't

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229
you can edit it right there you don't
 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.469
you can edit it right there you don't
have to see it with a blank space or

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479
have to see it with a blank space or
 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.190
have to see it with a blank space or
anything like that

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200
anything like that
 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.830
anything like that
so let's see another interesting use of

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840
so let's see another interesting use of
 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.110
so let's see another interesting use of
design-time attributes when you add a

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120
design-time attributes when you add a
 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.310
design-time attributes when you add a
textview this is

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320
textview this is
 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.230
textview this is
usually what you get so you have hello

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240
usually what you get so you have hello
 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.860
usually what you get so you have hello
world and that's it but you can tell to

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870
world and that's it but you can tell to
 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.020
world and that's it but you can tell to
the layout editor that you know that

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030
the layout editor that you know that
 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.580
the layout editor that you know that
this textview is going to look a

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590
this textview is going to look a
 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.040
this textview is going to look a
slightly different at runtime and you do

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050
slightly different at runtime and you do
 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.230
slightly different at runtime and you do
that but again using the tools namespace

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240
that but again using the tools namespace
 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.840
that but again using the tools namespace
so in this case what we are doing is we

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850
so in this case what we are doing is we
 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.390
so in this case what we are doing is we
are replacing both the text and the text

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400
are replacing both the text and the text
 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.520
are replacing both the text and the text
color and we are telling the layout

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530
color and we are telling the layout
 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.350
color and we are telling the layout
editor at runtime this is going to look

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360
editor at runtime this is going to look
 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.630
editor at runtime this is going to look
different and we are about to see how

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640
different and we are about to see how
 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.480
different and we are about to see how
this is very useful let's go with a

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490
this is very useful let's go with a
 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.240
this is very useful let's go with a
slightly more complicated example when

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250
slightly more complicated example when
 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.190
slightly more complicated example when
you add a recycler view this is what you

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200
you add a recycler view this is what you
 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.700
you add a recycler view this is what you
get by default it takes the space you

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710
get by default it takes the space you
 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.770
get by default it takes the space you
can see how the recycler view is going

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780
can see how the recycler view is going
 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.870
can see how the recycler view is going
to be laid out but it's not very useful

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880
to be laid out but it's not very useful
 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.820
to be laid out but it's not very useful
it doesn't help you to actually come up

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830
it doesn't help you to actually come up
 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.070
it doesn't help you to actually come up
with a good design for it

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080
with a good design for it
 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.690
with a good design for it
it's just a list of elements with a lot

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700
it's just a list of elements with a lot
 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.020
it's just a list of elements with a lot
of empty space so again we can use the

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030
of empty space so again we can use the
 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.330
of empty space so again we can use the
tools attributes do you basically let

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340
tools attributes do you basically let
 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.900
tools attributes do you basically let
the layout editor know this is the

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910
the layout editor know this is the
 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.430
the layout editor know this is the
layout that I'm going to use so you have

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440
layout that I'm going to use so you have
 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.840
layout that I'm going to use so you have
probably seen already list item many

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850
probably seen already list item many
 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.660
probably seen already list item many
times very simple you just say but we

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670
times very simple you just say but we
 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.130
times very simple you just say but we
can do other things we can tell the

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140
can do other things we can tell the
 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.470
can do other things we can tell the
layout editor okay how is this going to

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480
layout editor okay how is this going to
 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.160
layout editor okay how is this going to
look with five elements all these things

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.170
look with five elements all these things
 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.990
look with five elements all these things
you usually cannot do them in the layout

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000
you usually cannot do them in the layout
 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.330
you usually cannot do them in the layout
editor because these are things that

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340
editor because these are things that
 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.610
editor because these are things that
happen at runtime so usually the source

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620
happen at runtime so usually the source
 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.620
happen at runtime so usually the source
of information for a recycler view is an

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:32.630
of information for a recycler view is an
 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.080
of information for a recycler view is an
adapter so the adapter might depend on

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.090
adapter so the adapter might depend on
 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.240
adapter so the adapter might depend on
network on database on many things that

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.250
network on database on many things that
 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.560
network on database on many things that
we don't have available at the same time

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570
we don't have available at the same time
 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.770
we don't have available at the same time
so doing this you give us context and

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780
so doing this you give us context and
 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.630
so doing this you give us context and
then the layer tool will render

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:43.640
then the layer tool will render
 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.670
then the layer tool will render
correctly similar to what you have at

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680
correctly similar to what you have at
 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.320
correctly similar to what you have at
runtime so let's now go into sample data

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.330
runtime so let's now go into sample data
 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.630
runtime so let's now go into sample data
so sample data is it's a feature that we

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:52.640
so sample data is it's a feature that we
 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.320
so sample data is it's a feature that we
introduced in 3.0 and what it does is it

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.330
introduced in 3.0 and what it does is it
 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.260
introduced in 3.0 and what it does is it
helps you to actually populate data that

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.270
helps you to actually populate data that
 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.900
helps you to actually populate data that
is not available at the same time so in

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:01.910
is not available at the same time so in
 

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.180
is not available at the same time so in
this case what we are doing is telling

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:04.190
this case what we are doing is telling
 

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.970
this case what we are doing is telling
the layout editor that I want to use the

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:06.980
the layout editor that I want to use the
 

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.250
the layout editor that I want to use the
tint property and I want to get the data

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:09.260
tint property and I want to get the data
 

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.260
tint property and I want to get the data
from this data source which we call at

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:11.270
from this data source which we call at
 

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.440
from this data source which we call at
sample as less material colors and that

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:14.450
sample as less material colors and that
 

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.020
sample as less material colors and that
data source is simply a file a plain

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.030
data source is simply a file a plain
 

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.730
data source is simply a file a plain
file with a list of colors that you see

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:18.740
file with a list of colors that you see
 

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.150
file with a list of colors that you see
there so what happens in the a design

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160
there so what happens in the a design
 

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.550
there so what happens in the a design
time is the layout editor will get a

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560
time is the layout editor will get a
 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.629
time is the layout editor will get a
different color for every item so

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639
different color for every item so
 

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.999
different color for every item so
that looks better wait but we can do

00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:29.009
that looks better wait but we can do
 

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:31.659
that looks better wait but we can do
more so let's see how you create that

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:31.669
more so let's see how you create that
 

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:35.000
more so let's see how you create that
that file you go to your project new

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.010
that file you go to your project new
 

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.670
that file you go to your project new
sample data directory and that is how we

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680
sample data directory and that is how we
 

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.040
sample data directory and that is how we
create at the directory what we are

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.050
create at the directory what we are
 

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.019
create at the directory what we are
going to put every data source that we

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:42.029
going to put every data source that we
 

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:44.569
going to put every data source that we
have in our case we want to create

00:08:44.569 --> 00:08:44.579
have in our case we want to create
 

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:47.990
have in our case we want to create
material colors so new file and then we

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000
material colors so new file and then we
 

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.819
material colors so new file and then we
name it material underskirt underscore

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:49.829
name it material underskirt underscore
 

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:53.870
name it material underskirt underscore
colors and we just put the list of

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880
colors and we just put the list of
 

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.340
colors and we just put the list of
colors and that's it is that simple now

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:58.350
colors and that's it is that simple now
 

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.380
colors and that's it is that simple now
you can use it in any property in this

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.390
you can use it in any property in this
 

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.069
you can use it in any property in this
case tint so this is one of the types of

00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:04.079
case tint so this is one of the types of
 

00:09:04.079 --> 00:09:05.930
case tint so this is one of the types of
data sources that you can use in sample

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940
data sources that you can use in sample
 

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.960
data sources that you can use in sample
data so it's basically a list of colors

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:08.970
data so it's basically a list of colors
 

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.600
data so it's basically a list of colors
you can have lists of any kind that you

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:11.610
you can have lists of any kind that you
 

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.910
you can have lists of any kind that you
want like regular text and you just

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920
want like regular text and you just
 

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.949
want like regular text and you just
replace it in your text field but you

00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959
replace it in your text field but you
 

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:17.420
replace it in your text field but you
can have other things more interesting

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:17.430
can have other things more interesting
 

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.269
can have other things more interesting
that you can have dimensions so if you

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279
that you can have dimensions so if you
 

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.949
that you can have dimensions so if you
have dimensions using the tools

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959
have dimensions using the tools
 

00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:23.660
have dimensions using the tools
attributes you can tell the layout

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:23.670
attributes you can tell the layout
 

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.970
attributes you can tell the layout
editor I want to use this dimension and

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980
editor I want to use this dimension and
 

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.009
editor I want to use this dimension and
I want it to be different for every item

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019
I want it to be different for every item
 

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:31.970
I want it to be different for every item
and you can do that using sample data we

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980
and you can do that using sample data we
 

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.430
and you can do that using sample data we
also have other types of data sources

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440
also have other types of data sources
 

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.280
also have other types of data sources
you can have images you created in a

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.290
you can have images you created in a
 

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.230
you can have images you created in a
very similar way what you do is you

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240
very similar way what you do is you
 

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.090
very similar way what you do is you
create instead of a file you create a

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100
create instead of a file you create a
 

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.949
create instead of a file you create a
directory and then you drop all your

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959
directory and then you drop all your
 

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.740
directory and then you drop all your
images in there and then recyclerview

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:45.750
images in there and then recyclerview
 

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.079
images in there and then recyclerview
will get a different image for every

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:48.089
will get a different image for every
 

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:51.860
will get a different image for every
item so it's very simple and the last

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:51.870
item so it's very simple and the last
 

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.329
item so it's very simple and the last
type that I want to tell you about these

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339
type that I want to tell you about these
 

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:57.110
type that I want to tell you about these
JSON files so JSON files is a similar

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120
JSON files so JSON files is a similar
 

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.210
JSON files so JSON files is a similar
way to the list that we had before but

00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220
way to the list that we had before but
 

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.460
way to the list that we had before but
it allows you to do something that you

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:01.470
it allows you to do something that you
 

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.110
it allows you to do something that you
cannot do with this is you can have all

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120
cannot do with this is you can have all
 

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.230
cannot do with this is you can have all
your data together in one place you can

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240
your data together in one place you can
 

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.509
your data together in one place you can
add maybe context about why a particular

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519
add maybe context about why a particular
 

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:12.230
add maybe context about why a particular
item is like that or you can even get a

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240
item is like that or you can even get a
 

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.350
item is like that or you can even get a
sample from your dead API and put it

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360
sample from your dead API and put it
 

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.170
sample from your dead API and put it
into the sample data in this case what

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180
into the sample data in this case what
 

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.860
into the sample data in this case what
we have is a list of nodes so what you

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:21.870
we have is a list of nodes so what you
 

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.569
we have is a list of nodes so what you
can see is we have a title and we have

00:10:23.569 --> 00:10:23.579
can see is we have a title and we have
 

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:26.480
can see is we have a title and we have
an alpha and the way that you use this

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.490
an alpha and the way that you use this
 

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.750
an alpha and the way that you use this
in sample data is you can reference any

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760
in sample data is you can reference any
 

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.079
in sample data is you can reference any
of those live elements let's see how to

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:33.089
of those live elements let's see how to
 

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:35.120
of those live elements let's see how to
do that so in this case what we are

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.130
do that so in this case what we are
 

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.819
do that so in this case what we are
telling the layout editor is

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:36.829
telling the layout editor is
 

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:39.489
telling the layout editor is
I want you to replace text at the same

00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:39.499
I want you to replace text at the same
 

00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:41.590
I want you to replace text at the same
time and I want you to do it with

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600
time and I want you to do it with
 

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.319
time and I want you to do it with
example as last the name of the JSON

00:10:44.319 --> 00:10:44.329
example as last the name of the JSON
 

00:10:44.329 --> 00:10:47.169
example as last the name of the JSON
file and then the note that we saw

00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:47.179
file and then the note that we saw
 

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.639
file and then the note that we saw
before so in this case we are doing it

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:48.649
before so in this case we are doing it
 

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:51.790
before so in this case we are doing it
with title and also remember that this

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800
with title and also remember that this
 

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.439
with title and also remember that this
will change depending on the name of the

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:53.449
will change depending on the name of the
 

00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:55.059
will change depending on the name of the
JSON file it doesn't even need to be

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:55.069
JSON file it doesn't even need to be
 

00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:57.999
JSON file it doesn't even need to be
called JSON but if you don't want to

00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:58.009
called JSON but if you don't want to
 

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:00.789
called JSON but if you don't want to
provide your own data sources hundreds

00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:00.799
provide your own data sources hundreds
 

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:03.340
provide your own data sources hundreds
to do will also provide it or it already

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:03.350
to do will also provide it or it already
 

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.739
to do will also provide it or it already
comes with a a set of predefined ones so

00:11:05.739 --> 00:11:05.749
comes with a a set of predefined ones so
 

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.569
comes with a a set of predefined ones so
you don't have to create your own we

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:07.579
you don't have to create your own we
 

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:10.119
you don't have to create your own we
give you a set of them we give you names

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:10.129
give you a set of them we give you names
 

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:12.579
give you a set of them we give you names
we give you a lot and ipsum obviously

00:11:12.579 --> 00:11:12.589
we give you a lot and ipsum obviously
 

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.369
we give you a lot and ipsum obviously
and we also give you a set of images for

00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:15.379
and we also give you a set of images for
 

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:17.710
and we also give you a set of images for
example you can use avatars and you

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720
example you can use avatars and you
 

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.809
example you can use avatars and you
don't even need to create images you can

00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:19.819
don't even need to create images you can
 

00:11:19.819 --> 00:11:23.289
don't even need to create images you can
just use the ones that we give you and

00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:23.299
just use the ones that we give you and
 

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:25.749
just use the ones that we give you and
again how to use that is very similar

00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:25.759
again how to use that is very similar
 

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:27.309
again how to use that is very similar
the only difference that you can see

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:27.319
the only difference that you can see
 

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.280
the only difference that you can see
here is we added tools as the name a

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:30.290
here is we added tools as the name a
 

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.319
here is we added tools as the name a
space of the data source so instead of

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:32.329
space of the data source so instead of
 

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:36.100
space of the data source so instead of
being at sampled now is a tool sample so

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.110
being at sampled now is a tool sample so
 

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.439
being at sampled now is a tool sample so
using syntax completion you can see like

00:11:38.439 --> 00:11:38.449
using syntax completion you can see like

that you actually see on the slide the

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360
that you actually see on the slide the
 

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.720
that you actually see on the slide the
barrier which allows you to position an

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:21.730
barrier which allows you to position an
 

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.900
barrier which allows you to position an
element relative to a set of elements so

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:24.910
element relative to a set of elements so
 

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.329
element relative to a set of elements so
whatever the position and the dimension

00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:27.339
whatever the position and the dimension
 

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:30.629
whatever the position and the dimension
of those element that that element on

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639
of those element that that element on
 

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:32.189
of those element that that element on
the right is going to position correctly

00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199
the right is going to position correctly
 

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:34.379
the right is going to position correctly
so essentially we've constantly at one

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:34.389
so essentially we've constantly at one
 

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:36.989
so essentially we've constantly at one
point one we have a really flexible

00:16:36.989 --> 00:16:36.999
point one we have a really flexible
 

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:40.079
point one we have a really flexible
layout something that should essentially

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:40.089
layout something that should essentially
 

00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:44.819

let you express any UI and you can just

00:16:44.819 --> 00:16:44.829
let you express any UI and you can just
 

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:47.759
let you express any UI and you can just
add it to your project by using normal

this room to hear me talk about
 

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:04.280
this room to hear me talk about
constantly at 2.0 so

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:04.290
constantly at 2.0 so
 

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.740
constantly at 2.0 so
we've constructed up to 2.0 we are

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:06.750
we've constructed up to 2.0 we are
 

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.240
we've constructed up to 2.0 we are
starting with constantly at one and

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:08.250
starting with constantly at one and
 

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.789
starting with constantly at one and
constantly at one is a great base as I

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799
constantly at one is a great base as I
 

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:13.610
constantly at one is a great base as I
said it gives the entire flexibility

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620
said it gives the entire flexibility
 

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.679
said it gives the entire flexibility
that you need to create your UI and it

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:15.689
that you need to create your UI and it
 

00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:20.590
that you need to create your UI and it
comes with the UI builder and one of the

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600
comes with the UI builder and one of the
 

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.579
comes with the UI builder and one of the
concepts that we introduced and

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:22.589
concepts that we introduced and
 

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.079
concepts that we introduced and
constantly at one was the concept of

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:24.089
constantly at one was the concept of
 

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.079
constantly at one was the concept of
helper object object that even though

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:27.089
helper object object that even though
 

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.970
helper object object that even though
you can manipulate them into the UI

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980
you can manipulate them into the UI
 

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.909
you can manipulate them into the UI
builder in the UI builder did you not

00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919
builder in the UI builder did you not
 

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:34.430
builder in the UI builder did you not
appear on your screen when you run the

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440
appear on your screen when you run the
 

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.890
appear on your screen when you run the
application but essentially they help

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900
application but essentially they help
 

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.200
application but essentially they help
you create your UI so one of them is the

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.210
you create your UI so one of them is the
 

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.760
you create your UI so one of them is the
guideline object you know if your

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:40.770
guideline object you know if your
 

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:41.450
guideline object you know if your
designer

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460
designer
 

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.350
designer
typically you know specify a UI with

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360
typically you know specify a UI with
 

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.560
typically you know specify a UI with
horizontal lines etc well you can simply

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:48.570
horizontal lines etc well you can simply
 

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.490
horizontal lines etc well you can simply
replicate those in in your UI so it's a

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500
replicate those in in your UI so it's a
 

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.260
replicate those in in your UI so it's a
lot easier for you to set up your screen

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:54.270
lot easier for you to set up your screen
 

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.930
lot easier for you to set up your screen
similarly with one point one we have the

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940
similarly with one point one we have the
 

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.240
similarly with one point one we have the
barrier I just talked about and what's

00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.250
barrier I just talked about and what's
 

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.640
barrier I just talked about and what's
nice with those helpers object is that

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:01.650
nice with those helpers object is that
 

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.700
nice with those helpers object is that
we do have some support for them in the

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:04.710
we do have some support for them in the
 

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.830
we do have some support for them in the
UI builder so you can simply manipulate

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840
UI builder so you can simply manipulate
 

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.770
UI builder so you can simply manipulate
them and add elements to those helper

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780
them and add elements to those helper
 

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.289
them and add elements to those helper
object in the component tree by dragging

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299
object in the component tree by dragging
 

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.320
object in the component tree by dragging
elements into them something you might

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:15.330
elements into them something you might
 

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.450
elements into them something you might
not realize is that those helpers

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460
not realize is that those helpers
 

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.200
not realize is that those helpers
objects are not view groups they only

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.210
objects are not view groups they only
 

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.510
objects are not view groups they only
keep a reference to the views so we

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520
keep a reference to the views so we
 

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.810
keep a reference to the views so we
still keep the entire view tree very

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820
still keep the entire view tree very
 

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.630
still keep the entire view tree very
flat but because they are just

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640
flat but because they are just
 

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.270
flat but because they are just
references we can have you know one

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280
references we can have you know one
 

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.430
references we can have you know one
object being referenced in multiple

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440
object being referenced in multiple
 

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.850
object being referenced in multiple
helpers and that's starting to be very

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860
helpers and that's starting to be very
 

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.830
helpers and that's starting to be very
interesting for us and you can think

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840
interesting for us and you can think
 

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.220
interesting for us and you can think
about the helpers a way of keeping a few

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:43.230
about the helpers a way of keeping a few
 

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.640
about the helpers a way of keeping a few
reference to a bunch of views you can

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:46.650
reference to a bunch of views you can
 

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.169
reference to a bunch of views you can
still get a flat hockey and the way we

00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179
still get a flat hockey and the way we
 

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.120
still get a flat hockey and the way we
think about it is that a helper gives

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:53.130
think about it is that a helper gives
 

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.260
think about it is that a helper gives
you a way of you know encapsulating a

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:57.270
you a way of you know encapsulating a
 

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.159
you a way of you know encapsulating a
behavior in 2.0 we are going to expose

00:19:01.159 --> 00:19:01.169
behavior in 2.0 we are going to expose
 

00:19:01.169 --> 00:19:04.280
behavior in 2.0 we are going to expose
those helpers as the constraint at work

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.290
those helpers as the constraint at work
 

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.020
those helpers as the constraint at work
class so you'll be able to create your

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.030
class so you'll be able to create your
 

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.289
class so you'll be able to create your
handle on helpers and if you have your

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.299
handle on helpers and if you have your
 

00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:11.180
handle on helpers and if you have your
own helpers in your project similar to

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.190
own helpers in your project similar to
 

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.460
own helpers in your project similar to
what we have with custom views they will

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:13.470
what we have with custom views they will
 

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.680
what we have with custom views they will
be present in the Android studio so

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:15.690
be present in the Android studio so
 

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.000
be present in the Android studio so
you'll be able to manipulate your own

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.010
you'll be able to manipulate your own
 

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.010
you'll be able to manipulate your own
objects

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.020
objects
 

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.380
objects
we we kind of highlighted three broad

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.390
we we kind of highlighted three broad
 

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.950
we we kind of highlighted three broad
categories for the helpers in 2.01

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960
categories for the helpers in 2.01
 

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.440
categories for the helpers in 2.01
categories layout manipulation helpers

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:27.450
categories layout manipulation helpers
 

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.820
categories layout manipulation helpers
that are going to help you create a

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:28.830
that are going to help you create a
 

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.530
that are going to help you create a
layout

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:29.540
layout
 

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.320
layout
another one is helpers that will apply

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:33.330
another one is helpers that will apply
 

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.950
another one is helpers that will apply
something after the layout has been done

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960
something after the layout has been done
 

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.190
something after the layout has been done
so kind of post layout and finally we

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200
so kind of post layout and finally we
 

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.440
so kind of post layout and finally we
have some helpers because helpers are

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:42.450
have some helpers because helpers are
 

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.410
have some helpers because helpers are
views or can be views as well helpers

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:45.420
views or can be views as well helpers
 

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.740
views or can be views as well helpers
that we can use to do some specific

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:48.750
that we can use to do some specific
 

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.160
that we can use to do some specific
rendering specific display for the

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:52.170
rendering specific display for the
 

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.440
rendering specific display for the
virtual layout this is one of the

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:54.450
virtual layout this is one of the
 

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.160
virtual layout this is one of the
concepts that we are really keen on the

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:58.170
concepts that we are really keen on the
 

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.980
concepts that we are really keen on the
idea is that the helper is going to set

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:00.990
idea is that the helper is going to set
 

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.230
idea is that the helper is going to set
the constraint for you the simplest

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240
the constraint for you the simplest
 

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.880
the constraint for you the simplest
example I can think of is a linear

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:04.890
example I can think of is a linear
 

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.060
example I can think of is a linear
helper you know if you created a chain

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.070
helper you know if you created a chain
 

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.520
helper you know if you created a chain
in constantly at one well that will

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:10.530
in constantly at one well that will
 

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.960
in constantly at one well that will
allow you to do exactly the same thing

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:11.970
allow you to do exactly the same thing
 

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.060
allow you to do exactly the same thing
but you will manipulate it a little bit

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.070
but you will manipulate it a little bit
 

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.510
but you will manipulate it a little bit
like linear layout for instance the only

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520
like linear layout for instance the only
 

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.340
like linear layout for instance the only
difference is that you have all the

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:19.350
difference is that you have all the
 

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.430
difference is that you have all the
features that chain provide you and the

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440
features that chain provide you and the
 

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.460
features that chain provide you and the
way you use them it's very easy it's a

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:25.470
way you use them it's very easy it's a
 

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.620
way you use them it's very easy it's a
normal view you can constrain that you

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:27.630
normal view you can constrain that you
 

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.320
normal view you can constrain that you
itself when the only thing you need to

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.330
itself when the only thing you need to
 

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.680
itself when the only thing you need to
care here is that list of ID's that you

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:33.690
care here is that list of ID's that you
 

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.980
care here is that list of ID's that you
reference we have another virtual layout

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:36.990
reference we have another virtual layout
 

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.580
reference we have another virtual layout
that will launch with 2.0 which

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:39.590
that will launch with 2.0 which
 

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.720
that will launch with 2.0 which
essentially implements the flexbox

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:41.730
essentially implements the flexbox
 

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.169
essentially implements the flexbox
layout semantics so those object are

00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:45.179
layout semantics so those object are
 

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:48.230
layout semantics so those object are
pretty useful but you know at the same

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240
pretty useful but you know at the same
 

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.799
pretty useful but you know at the same
time I think you know pretty expected

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:50.809
time I think you know pretty expected
 

00:20:50.809 --> 00:20:53.120
time I think you know pretty expected
but when we are developing those helpers

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.130
but when we are developing those helpers
 

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.880
but when we are developing those helpers
we come up with you know additional use

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:55.890
we come up with you know additional use
 

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.140
we come up with you know additional use
cases so one example of post layout

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:00.150
cases so one example of post layout
 

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.299
cases so one example of post layout
object is a flying object let's say that

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:02.309
object is a flying object let's say that
 

00:21:02.309 --> 00:21:04.790
object is a flying object let's say that
you want your objects on first layout to

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:04.800
you want your objects on first layout to
 

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.520
you want your objects on first layout to
fly in well you could simply reference

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:07.530
fly in well you could simply reference
 

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.830
fly in well you could simply reference
this object with the flying decorator

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840
this object with the flying decorator
 

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.150
this object with the flying decorator
and that's all

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160
and that's all
 

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.720
and that's all
so no code it's purely declarative you

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:14.730
so no code it's purely declarative you
 

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.120
so no code it's purely declarative you
just add that to your XML file reference

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.130
just add that to your XML file reference
 

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.940
just add that to your XML file reference
that object and it will animate on first

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:19.950
that object and it will animate on first
 

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.110
that object and it will animate on first
launch we have another object that's

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120
launch we have another object that's
 

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.260
launch we have another object that's
very powerful

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:25.270
very powerful
 

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.190
very powerful
and layers allows you essentially a lot

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200
and layers allows you essentially a lot
 

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.250
and layers allows you essentially a lot
of things it can it kind of allows you

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:32.260
of things it can it kind of allows you
 

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.460
of things it can it kind of allows you
to consider a set of views and apply

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:35.470
to consider a set of views and apply
 

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.450
to consider a set of views and apply
operation to them so there is a bunch of

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:38.460
operation to them so there is a bunch of
 

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.400
operation to them so there is a bunch of
graphical operation that you can apply

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.410
graphical operation that you can apply
 

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.230
graphical operation that you can apply
and we will do the math behind the scene

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240
and we will do the math behind the scene
 

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.990
and we will do the math behind the scene
to apply them correctly you can also set

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000
to apply them correctly you can also set
 

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.360
to apply them correctly you can also set
it up so that it takes by default the

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:48.370
it up so that it takes by default the
 

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.880
it up so that it takes by default the
bounds of the views that it references

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:50.890
bounds of the views that it references
 

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.830
bounds of the views that it references
and you can use it to set up a

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840
and you can use it to set up a
 

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.430
and you can use it to set up a
background very easy diff and that way

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440
background very easy diff and that way
 

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.120
background very easy diff and that way
another use case that we will expose is

00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.130
another use case that we will expose is
 

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.770
another use case that we will expose is
you could use the layer a little bit

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:01.780
you could use the layer a little bit
 

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.460
you could use the layer a little bit
like you would use layers in graphical

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:04.470
like you would use layers in graphical
 

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.220
like you would use layers in graphical
photo editors to have a bunch of layers

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.230
photo editors to have a bunch of layers
 

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.620
photo editors to have a bunch of layers
to specify your elements and when you

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:10.630
to specify your elements and when you
 

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.800
to specify your elements and when you
are hockey okay with those elements

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:12.810
are hockey okay with those elements
 

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.850
are hockey okay with those elements
constraints you could lock that layer

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:14.860
constraints you could lock that layer
 

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.240
constraints you could lock that layer
and be sure to not inadvertently modify

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.250
and be sure to not inadvertently modify
 

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.750
and be sure to not inadvertently modify
them so it's a very powerful helper here

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760
them so it's a very powerful helper here
 

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.400
them so it's a very powerful helper here
is a quick example on how it would look

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:23.410
is a quick example on how it would look
 

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.100
is a quick example on how it would look
like by drawing a background around a

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.110
like by drawing a background around a
 

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.350
like by drawing a background around a
bunch of buttons being reference and

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360
bunch of buttons being reference and
 

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.540
bunch of buttons being reference and
without having to set up the constraint

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:30.550
without having to set up the constraint
 

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.030
without having to set up the constraint
manually I can you know easily see

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:33.040
manually I can you know easily see
 

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.280
manually I can you know easily see
around the subject with with a

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.290
around the subject with with a
 

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.800
around the subject with with a
background and just to prove you that we

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:37.810
background and just to prove you that we
 

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:42.480
background and just to prove you that we
are still with a flat view tree we can

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:42.490
are still with a flat view tree we can
 

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.860
are still with a flat view tree we can
apply this operation that I'm talking

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:43.870
apply this operation that I'm talking
 

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.870
apply this operation that I'm talking
about and everything will just follow

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880
about and everything will just follow
 

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.580
about and everything will just follow
but the background will stay where it is

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:47.590
but the background will stay where it is
 

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.770
but the background will stay where it is
so it's a city example it's just to show

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:49.780
so it's a city example it's just to show
 

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.940
so it's a city example it's just to show
you the the potential of those objects

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:52.950
you the the potential of those objects
 

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.970
you the the potential of those objects
another use useful decorator is a

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:56.980
another use useful decorator is a
 

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.790
another use useful decorator is a
circular reveal and it actually does

00:22:59.790 --> 00:22:59.800
circular reveal and it actually does
 

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.100
circular reveal and it actually does
what it says and it's the typical effect

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:02.110
what it says and it's the typical effect
 

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.200
what it says and it's the typical effect
that you've been familiar with with

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.210
that you've been familiar with with
 

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.590
that you've been familiar with with
material design and if I press the

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600
material design and if I press the
 

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.720
material design and if I press the
button that's better the interesting

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:09.730
button that's better the interesting
 

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.820
button that's better the interesting
thing here is that you'll notice that it

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:11.830
thing here is that you'll notice that it
 

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.280
thing here is that you'll notice that it
only applies to the elements referenced

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:14.290
only applies to the elements referenced
 

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.280
only applies to the elements referenced
so we have this row of buttons that we

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:17.290
so we have this row of buttons that we
 

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.290
so we have this row of buttons that we
are not referenced and so the circular

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:19.300
are not referenced and so the circular
 

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.740
are not referenced and so the circular
reveal did not apply to them and if you

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:22.750
reveal did not apply to them and if you
 

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.410
reveal did not apply to them and if you
played with circular reveal you see that

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:25.420
played with circular reveal you see that
 

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.960
played with circular reveal you see that
it's actually a bit tricky to do that

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:26.970
it's actually a bit tricky to do that
 

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.160
it's actually a bit tricky to do that
the interesting thing here as well is

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.170
the interesting thing here as well is
 

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.900
the interesting thing here as well is
that we are not creating our own

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:30.910
that we are not creating our own
 

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.580
that we are not creating our own
circular reveal we are just using the

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:32.590
circular reveal we are just using the
 

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.820
circular reveal we are just using the
normal circular reveal but essentially

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:35.830
normal circular reveal but essentially
 

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.040
normal circular reveal but essentially
we package it in a way that makes it a

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.050
we package it in a way that makes it a
 

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.100
we package it in a way that makes it a
lot easier for you

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.110
lot easier for you
 

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:44.470
lot easier for you
to play with and using your layouts so

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480
to play with and using your layouts so
 

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.760
to play with and using your layouts so
on that same idea we have decorators

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:48.770
on that same idea we have decorators
 

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.460
on that same idea we have decorators
that are helpers that are here to draw

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:51.470
that are helpers that are here to draw
 

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.430
that are helpers that are here to draw
things and same things we reproduce and

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440
things and same things we reproduce and
 

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.370
things and same things we reproduce and
you can draw something with it so that's

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:00.380
you can draw something with it so that's
 

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.870
you can draw something with it so that's
probably a little confusing in terms of

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:01.880
probably a little confusing in terms of
 

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.549
probably a little confusing in terms of
what type of effect you can get with

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559
what type of effect you can get with
 

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:07.630
what type of effect you can get with
that so let me show you so you may want

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640
that so let me show you so you may want
 

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.549
that so let me show you so you may want
an effect like that now kind of a lava

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559
an effect like that now kind of a lava
 

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:12.669
an effect like that now kind of a lava
lamp effect with you know those blows

00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:12.679
lamp effect with you know those blows
 

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:14.680
lamp effect with you know those blows
moving around and what you'll see is

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:14.690
moving around and what you'll see is
 

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.430
moving around and what you'll see is
that the result of that effect will

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440
that the result of that effect will
 

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.560
that the result of that effect will
depend on the position of those blobs

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:20.570
depend on the position of those blobs
 

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.080
depend on the position of those blobs
but the final rendering has to take in

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.090
but the final rendering has to take in
 

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.750
but the final rendering has to take in
account all of them and that would

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760
account all of them and that would
 

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.370
account all of them and that would
normally be a very difficult affair to

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:27.380
normally be a very difficult affair to
 

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.960
normally be a very difficult affair to
achieve so the way it works with the

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:28.970
achieve so the way it works with the
 

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.580
achieve so the way it works with the
helpers that you can think about it that

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:30.590
helpers that you can think about it that
 

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.289
helpers that you can think about it that
way you have a converse right like what

00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:32.299
way you have a converse right like what
 

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:37.240
way you have a converse right like what
you paint on you have actually some

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:37.250
you paint on you have actually some
 

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.060
you paint on you have actually some
image views that are essentially sitting

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.070
image views that are essentially sitting
 

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.560
image views that are essentially sitting
on top of that and they are normally

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:41.570
on top of that and they are normally
 

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.810
on top of that and they are normally
made views so you lose nothing here they

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:43.820
made views so you lose nothing here they
 

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.880
made views so you lose nothing here they
are normal views normal widgets you can

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:45.890
are normal views normal widgets you can
 

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.060
are normal views normal widgets you can
apply the usual things but we put their

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:49.070
apply the usual things but we put their
 

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.530
apply the usual things but we put their
own background to be transparent and

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:50.540
own background to be transparent and
 

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.810
own background to be transparent and
then we use the decorator to do the

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:52.820
then we use the decorator to do the
 

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.240
then we use the decorator to do the
background and you can easily get an

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:55.250
background and you can easily get an
 

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.460
background and you can easily get an
effect like that now for instance a

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:57.470
effect like that now for instance a
 

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:05.240
effect like that now for instance a
little slower there you go so

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.250
 
 

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.060
 
and just to show you the bonds are

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.070
and just to show you the bonds are
 

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.580
and just to show you the bonds are
correct we still have our images

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:10.590
correct we still have our images
 

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.610
correct we still have our images
another type of decorator that you can

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.620
another type of decorator that you can
 

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.649
another type of decorator that you can
use in your project is the bottom panel

00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659
use in your project is the bottom panel
 

00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:18.169
use in your project is the bottom panel
decorator so let's say that you have a

00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179
decorator so let's say that you have a
 

00:25:18.179 --> 00:25:19.100
decorator so let's say that you have a
layout like that

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.110
layout like that
 

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.960
layout like that
that you may have created by using a

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:20.970
that you may have created by using a
 

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.200
that you may have created by using a
chain very easy but you'd like to set a

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.210
chain very easy but you'd like to set a
 

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.350
chain very easy but you'd like to set a
background on those objects and maybe

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360
background on those objects and maybe
 

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.779
background on those objects and maybe
change their colors so you can simply

00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:29.789
change their colors so you can simply
 

00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:31.789
change their colors so you can simply
apply this decorator or reference this

00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799
apply this decorator or reference this
 

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:33.680
apply this decorator or reference this
element and we'll do the rest of the

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:33.690
element and we'll do the rest of the
 

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.500
element and we'll do the rest of the
work and because well we can do a little

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:36.510
work and because well we can do a little
 

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.690
work and because well we can do a little
more interesting stuff here you know I

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700
more interesting stuff here you know I
 

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.580
more interesting stuff here you know I
can show you what it may look like when

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:40.590
can show you what it may look like when
 

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:45.350
can show you what it may look like when
you click on those buttons so just to

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360
you click on those buttons so just to
 

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.470
you click on those buttons so just to
give you an idea of the type of effects

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480
give you an idea of the type of effects
 

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:56.140
give you an idea of the type of effects
you can get with decorators

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:56.150
 
 

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.050
 
so I'm clicking on this my menu comes in

00:25:59.050 --> 00:25:59.060
so I'm clicking on this my menu comes in
 

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.810
so I'm clicking on this my menu comes in
I can press that so model menu comes in

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:01.820
I can press that so model menu comes in
 

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.410
I can press that so model menu comes in
I press it and there's a circular reveal

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:04.420
I press it and there's a circular reveal
 

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.480
I press it and there's a circular reveal
it's of course a very silly UI but it

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:07.490
it's of course a very silly UI but it
 

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.090
it's of course a very silly UI but it
just to give you you know an idea of

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:10.100
just to give you you know an idea of
 

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.050
just to give you you know an idea of
what you can do

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:11.060
what you can do
 

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.780
what you can do
what's very interesting here is that if

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:13.790
what's very interesting here is that if
 

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:17.470
what's very interesting here is that if
if you look at at it in studio and you

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480
if you look at at it in studio and you
 

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.320
if you look at at it in studio and you
know if i zoom on the componentry you'll

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:20.330
know if i zoom on the componentry you'll
 

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.650
know if i zoom on the componentry you'll
notice that actually you know we mostly

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:23.660
notice that actually you know we mostly
 

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.050
notice that actually you know we mostly
have just views and just a bunch of

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:26.060
have just views and just a bunch of
 

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.560
have just views and just a bunch of
helpers there's actually no code here so

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:29.570
helpers there's actually no code here so
 

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.780
helpers there's actually no code here so
I think it's really it's really useful

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:31.790
I think it's really it's really useful
 

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.340
I think it's really it's really useful
addition to your tool set as a

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:33.350
addition to your tool set as a
 

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.340
addition to your tool set as a
programmer to try to really separate you

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:36.350
programmer to try to really separate you
 

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.940
programmer to try to really separate you
know the the feel with you know the

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:39.950
know the the feel with you know the
 

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.690
know the the feel with you know the
actual you know you know you actual that

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:43.700
actual you know you know you actual that
 

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.090
actual you know you know you actual that
data and your actual behavior in your

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:46.100
data and your actual behavior in your
 

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.370
data and your actual behavior in your
application so to summarize with your

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:48.380
application so to summarize with your
 

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.590
application so to summarize with your
helpers you know you can tag your views

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600
helpers you know you can tag your views
 

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.570
helpers you know you can tag your views
with those essentially you can

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:52.580
with those essentially you can
 

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.190
with those essentially you can
encapsulate and reuse the behavior and

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200
encapsulate and reuse the behavior and
 

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.790
encapsulate and reuse the behavior and
it's all declarative let me talk briefly

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:57.800
it's all declarative let me talk briefly
 

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.610
it's all declarative let me talk briefly
about the earth management so you've

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:00.620
about the earth management so you've
 

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.580
about the earth management so you've
been probably playing with constraint

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:03.590
been probably playing with constraint
 

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.980
been probably playing with constraint
set on the constantly at one point one

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:05.990
set on the constantly at one point one
 

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.720
set on the constantly at one point one
which is a way of encapsulating an

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:07.730
which is a way of encapsulating an
 

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.600
which is a way of encapsulating an
entire state for a layout and if you

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:10.610
entire state for a layout and if you
 

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.760
entire state for a layout and if you
switch between two of those states you

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:12.770
switch between two of those states you
 

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.570
switch between two of those states you
can animate them so that's very nice but

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:16.580
can animate them so that's very nice but
 

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.590
can animate them so that's very nice but
you know

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600
you know
 

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.380
you know
initializing those things is a little

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:20.390
initializing those things is a little
 

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.850
initializing those things is a little
cumbersome you have to create your

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:21.860
cumbersome you have to create your
 

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.450
cumbersome you have to create your
layout I know lot of layout manually etc

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:25.460
layout I know lot of layout manually etc
 

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.690
layout I know lot of layout manually etc
so in 2.0 will have a separate XML file

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:28.700
so in 2.0 will have a separate XML file
 

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.480
so in 2.0 will have a separate XML file
that lets you specify States because

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:31.490
that lets you specify States because
 

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.100
that lets you specify States because
essentially that's what they are this is

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:33.110
essentially that's what they are this is
 

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.350
essentially that's what they are this is
you know I have a I have a layout that's

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360
you know I have a I have a layout that's
 

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.970
you know I have a I have a layout that's
a lot has different representation

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:36.980
a lot has different representation
 

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.150
a lot has different representation
represent the different states and you

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:40.160
represent the different states and you
 

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.580
represent the different states and you
can associate that with with default

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:42.590
can associate that with with default
 

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.580
can associate that with with default
layouts so the way you would use them is

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:45.590
layouts so the way you would use them is
 

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.560
layouts so the way you would use them is
simply by calling set your description

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:47.570
simply by calling set your description
 

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.380
simply by calling set your description
and we'll do the rest of the job you can

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:50.390
and we'll do the rest of the job you can
 

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.870
and we'll do the rest of the job you can
then switch state simply by calling set

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880
then switch state simply by calling set
 

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.690
then switch state simply by calling set
States with the state ID and that's it

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:55.700
States with the state ID and that's it
 

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.050
States with the state ID and that's it
one nice thing is that you can specify a

00:27:59.050 --> 00:27:59.060
one nice thing is that you can specify a
 

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.750
one nice thing is that you can specify a
region on when a specific constraint

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760
region on when a specific constraint
 

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.640
region on when a specific constraint
constraint set is going to be applied

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:03.650
constraint set is going to be applied
 

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.500
constraint set is going to be applied
and by plugging that into on

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:05.510
and by plugging that into on
 

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.070
and by plugging that into on
configuration changed

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080
configuration changed
 

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.649
configuration changed
and I'm showing that on a chrome on the

00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659
and I'm showing that on a chrome on the
 

00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:11.479
and I'm showing that on a chrome on the
Chromebook you'll see that automatically

00:28:11.479 --> 00:28:11.489
Chromebook you'll see that automatically
 

00:28:11.489 --> 00:28:12.919
Chromebook you'll see that automatically
depending on the size of the window

00:28:12.919 --> 00:28:12.929
depending on the size of the window
 

00:28:12.929 --> 00:28:15.139
depending on the size of the window
we'll switch layouts so that's a very

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:15.149
we'll switch layouts so that's a very
 

00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:17.299
we'll switch layouts so that's a very
it's a very easy way for you to have

00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:17.309
it's a very easy way for you to have
 

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:19.489
it's a very easy way for you to have
different behavior for layouts if you

00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:19.499
different behavior for layouts if you
 

00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:22.100
different behavior for layouts if you
want to little more fancy to be little

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:22.110
want to little more fancy to be little
 

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.899
want to little more fancy to be little
more fancy you can on the preview change

00:28:23.899 --> 00:28:23.909
more fancy you can on the preview change
 

00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:26.539
more fancy you can on the preview change
plug a transition manager and then we

00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:26.549
plug a transition manager and then we
 

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:29.659
plug a transition manager and then we
will animate the layout transition so I

00:28:29.659 --> 00:28:29.669
will animate the layout transition so I
 

00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:31.639
will animate the layout transition so I
think we've devices that Chromebooks

00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:31.649
think we've devices that Chromebooks
 

00:28:31.649 --> 00:28:34.220
think we've devices that Chromebooks
that's the type of use case that's are

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.230
that's the type of use case that's are
 

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:39.109
that's the type of use case that's are
going to be more and more useful and

00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:39.119
going to be more and more useful and
 

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:42.580
going to be more and more useful and
that's essentially layout management so

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:42.590
that's essentially layout management so
 

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.349
that's essentially layout management so
to quickly recap on cosmically r2 so far

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:45.359
to quickly recap on cosmically r2 so far
 

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:48.139
to quickly recap on cosmically r2 so far
we have the helpers API we have those

00:28:48.139 --> 00:28:48.149
we have the helpers API we have those
 

00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:50.779
we have the helpers API we have those
virtual layouts and decorators we have

00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:50.789
virtual layouts and decorators we have
 

00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:53.930
virtual layouts and decorators we have
the REST API we also have other stuff I

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:53.940
the REST API we also have other stuff I
 

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.489
the REST API we also have other stuff I
haven't talked about like a new fluent

00:28:55.489 --> 00:28:55.499
haven't talked about like a new fluent
 

00:28:55.499 --> 00:28:57.289
haven't talked about like a new fluent
API for manipulating the constraints

00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299
API for manipulating the constraints
 

00:28:57.299 --> 00:29:00.710
API for manipulating the constraints
directly and we have motion layouts and

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720
directly and we have motion layouts and
 

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.470
directly and we have motion layouts and
to talk about motion layouts I am really

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480
to talk about motion layouts I am really
 

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:13.500
to talk about motion layouts I am really
happy to introduce John thanks

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:13.510
 
 

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.830
 
now I'm really excited to show you guys

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840
now I'm really excited to show you guys
 

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.440
now I'm really excited to show you guys
motion layout it's a brand new layout

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:19.450
motion layout it's a brand new layout
 

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.409
motion layout it's a brand new layout
that we're introducing with constrained

00:29:22.409 --> 00:29:22.419
that we're introducing with constrained
 

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:26.390
that we're introducing with constrained
layout 2.2 so let's kind of get into it

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:26.400
layout 2.2 so let's kind of get into it
 

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.909
layout 2.2 so let's kind of get into it
it starts off with a subclass of

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919
it starts off with a subclass of
 

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:32.250
it starts off with a subclass of
constraint they are called motion layout

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:32.260
constraint they are called motion layout
 

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.460
constraint they are called motion layout
it's a layout it has all the properties

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:35.470
it's a layout it has all the properties
 

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.980
it's a layout it has all the properties
of constraint layout but the whole trick

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:40.990
of constraint layout but the whole trick
 

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.770
of constraint layout but the whole trick
with animating between two constraint

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:43.780
with animating between two constraint
 

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.880
with animating between two constraint
sets that's will be done for you by

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:47.890
sets that's will be done for you by
 

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.880
sets that's will be done for you by
motion layout so if you have two

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:50.890
motion layout so if you have two
 

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.730
motion layout so if you have two
constraint sets it will switch between

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:53.740
constraint sets it will switch between
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.190
constraint sets it will switch between
them and animate between them by itself

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200
them and animate between them by itself
 

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.240
them and animate between them by itself
but you notice because it's a constraint

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:03.250
but you notice because it's a constraint
 

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.330
but you notice because it's a constraint
layout you can actually use the helpers

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:06.340
layout you can actually use the helpers
 

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:12.570
layout you can actually use the helpers
that were shown there but it also

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:12.580
that were shown there but it also
 

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.200
that were shown there but it also
provides you with the ability to edit

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.210
provides you with the ability to edit
 

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:20.130
provides you with the ability to edit
the custom attributes of the system so

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:20.140
the custom attributes of the system so
 

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.840
the custom attributes of the system so
you notice the blue light there it's

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:23.850
you notice the blue light there it's
 

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.760
you notice the blue light there it's
changing because it's a custom attribute

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:26.770
changing because it's a custom attribute
 

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.730
changing because it's a custom attribute
in the system so constraint sets now can

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:29.740
in the system so constraint sets now can
 

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.280
in the system so constraint sets now can
handle custom attributes allows you to

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:32.290
handle custom attributes allows you to
 

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:38.669
handle custom attributes allows you to
animate anything one of the other things

00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679
animate anything one of the other things
 

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:43.200
animate anything one of the other things
that it does is it allows you to control

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:43.210
that it does is it allows you to control
 

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.850
that it does is it allows you to control
on touch directly so it'll manage your

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:47.860
on touch directly so it'll manage your
 

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.490
on touch directly so it'll manage your
touch events by tracking your velocity

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:50.500
touch events by tracking your velocity
 

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.880
touch events by tracking your velocity
of your finger and matching it the

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:53.890
of your finger and matching it the
 

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.720
of your finger and matching it the
velocity of views in the system and

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:56.730
velocity of views in the system and
 

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.730
velocity of views in the system and
naturally give you a smooth transition

00:30:59.730 --> 00:30:59.740
naturally give you a smooth transition
 

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:05.310
naturally give you a smooth transition
between them by a touch we also support

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320
between them by a touch we also support
 

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.650
between them by a touch we also support
help us because it's just a constraint

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:07.660
help us because it's just a constraint
 

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.720
help us because it's just a constraint
layout so they help us Nicholas just

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:09.730
layout so they help us Nicholas just
 

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.990
layout so they help us Nicholas just
showed there the air too and they can

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000
showed there the air too and they can
 

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.799
showed there the air too and they can
they can work together and apart now

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:19.809
they can work together and apart now
 

00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:22.590
they can work together and apart now
let's change the transition a little bit

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600
let's change the transition a little bit
 

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.020
let's change the transition a little bit
we want to move the eye into the middle

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.030
we want to move the eye into the middle
 

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.470
we want to move the eye into the middle
of the screen but if we look

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480
of the screen but if we look
 

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.300
of the screen but if we look
mostly there's a bit of a problem here

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:29.310
mostly there's a bit of a problem here
 

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.640
mostly there's a bit of a problem here
you see the arrow

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:31.650
you see the arrow
 

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:36.110
you see the arrow
clashes with the I will have to fix that

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120
clashes with the I will have to fix that
 

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.380
clashes with the I will have to fix that
and the way we do that is a feature we

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:39.390
and the way we do that is a feature we
 

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.950
and the way we do that is a feature we
call keyframes essentially if we have a

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960
call keyframes essentially if we have a
 

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.400
call keyframes essentially if we have a
beginning and an end of a path we can

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:46.410
beginning and an end of a path we can
 

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.070
beginning and an end of a path we can
distort the path by adding a keyframe

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080
distort the path by adding a keyframe
 

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.230
distort the path by adding a keyframe
and once we add the keyframe it will

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240
and once we add the keyframe it will
 

00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:00.530
and once we add the keyframe it will
avoid the path it's pretty cool so now

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:00.540
avoid the path it's pretty cool so now
 

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.190
avoid the path it's pretty cool so now
we have a motion scene it has constraint

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200
we have a motion scene it has constraint
 

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.480
we have a motion scene it has constraint
sets it has on touch keyframes custom

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.490
sets it has on touch keyframes custom
 

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:15.590
sets it has on touch keyframes custom
attributes with a little flag on your

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600
attributes with a little flag on your
 

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.630
attributes with a little flag on your
device you can see the path of all the

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640
device you can see the path of all the
 

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.540
device you can see the path of all the
objects you've set in it so you can

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:20.550
objects you've set in it so you can
 

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.360
objects you've set in it so you can
understand what all your views are doing

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:23.370
understand what all your views are doing
 

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:30.560
understand what all your views are doing
on device so one of the nice things that

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:30.570
on device so one of the nice things that
 

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.440
on device so one of the nice things that
we've supported it is nesting of

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:33.450
we've supported it is nesting of
 

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:38.180
we've supported it is nesting of
constraint set of motion layouts so in

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:38.190
constraint set of motion layouts so in
 

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:43.840
constraint set of motion layouts so in
this particular example we have two

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:43.850
this particular example we have two
 

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:49.240
this particular example we have two
views being animated by a third view

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.250
views being animated by a third view
 

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:53.150
views being animated by a third view
they're both constraint motion layouts

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:53.160
they're both constraint motion layouts
 

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.630
they're both constraint motion layouts
and they are both being driven by a

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640
and they are both being driven by a
 

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.310
and they are both being driven by a
third motion layout the top view is just

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320
third motion layout the top view is just
 

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.840
third motion layout the top view is just
doing a fade to black

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:02.850
doing a fade to black
 

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.760
doing a fade to black
but you'll notice something else in that

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:04.770
but you'll notice something else in that
 

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:08.810
but you'll notice something else in that
view this is an animated view that was

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820
view this is an animated view that was
 

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.240
view this is an animated view that was
custom written by Nicolas that is being

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.250
custom written by Nicolas that is being
 

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.810
custom written by Nicolas that is being
driven by motion layout because it's

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:16.820
driven by motion layout because it's
 

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:21.500
driven by motion layout because it's
implements a non progress method so you

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:21.510
implements a non progress method so you
 

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.330
implements a non progress method so you
couldn't drive your own custom

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340
couldn't drive your own custom
 

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:28.750
couldn't drive your own custom
animations directly from motion layout

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760
 
 

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.280
 
so one of the things that's really good

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:31.290
so one of the things that's really good
 

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.960
so one of the things that's really good
at is synchronizing motions it's

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:34.970
at is synchronizing motions it's
 

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:38.270
at is synchronizing motions it's
anything that's very complex sequences

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:38.280
anything that's very complex sequences
 

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.060
anything that's very complex sequences
of many things moving on the screen

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.070
of many things moving on the screen
 

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.659
of many things moving on the screen
it'll handle

00:33:41.659 --> 00:33:41.669
it'll handle
 

00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:43.609
it'll handle
and we'll also allow you to interact

00:33:43.609 --> 00:33:43.619
and we'll also allow you to interact
 

00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:49.219
and we'll also allow you to interact
with it with the touch so we added one

00:33:49.219 --> 00:33:49.229
with it with the touch so we added one
 

00:33:49.229 --> 00:33:51.289
with it with the touch so we added one
more thing to the system something we

00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299
more thing to the system something we
 

00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:55.399
more thing to the system something we
call cycles this is the ability to build

00:33:55.399 --> 00:33:55.409
call cycles this is the ability to build
 

00:33:55.409 --> 00:33:59.269
call cycles this is the ability to build
into the keyframes oscillatory behaviors

00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279
into the keyframes oscillatory behaviors
 

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:02.930
into the keyframes oscillatory behaviors
it can vibrate and shake in various ways

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940
it can vibrate and shake in various ways
 

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.359
it can vibrate and shake in various ways
and you might wonder okay so what did we

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:05.369
and you might wonder okay so what did we
 

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:10.309
and you might wonder okay so what did we
do with these key cycles so in this

00:34:10.309 --> 00:34:10.319
do with these key cycles so in this
 

00:34:10.319 --> 00:34:13.329
do with these key cycles so in this
particular example first let me just

00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:13.339
particular example first let me just
 

00:34:13.339 --> 00:34:16.279
particular example first let me just
unfold them with a staggered effect but

00:34:16.279 --> 00:34:16.289
unfold them with a staggered effect but
 

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:18.950
unfold them with a staggered effect but
now I can take one and have it roll

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960
now I can take one and have it roll
 

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.309
now I can take one and have it roll
because it's oscillating oh I can do a

00:34:22.309 --> 00:34:22.319
because it's oscillating oh I can do a
 

00:34:22.319 --> 00:34:24.649
because it's oscillating oh I can do a
different effect I can have it sort of

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659
different effect I can have it sort of
 

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.309
different effect I can have it sort of
bounce along the edge I got bored and I

00:34:28.309 --> 00:34:28.319
bounce along the edge I got bored and I
 

00:34:28.319 --> 00:34:33.500
bounce along the edge I got bored and I
just had that one flying around another

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:33.510
just had that one flying around another
 

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.079
just had that one flying around another
typical example is you put it like doing

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:36.089
typical example is you put it like doing
 

00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:41.059
typical example is you put it like doing
a little shake at the end so now one of

00:34:41.059 --> 00:34:41.069
a little shake at the end so now one of
 

00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:43.399
a little shake at the end so now one of
the cool things is we build that it is

00:34:43.399 --> 00:34:43.409
the cool things is we build that it is
 

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:46.759
the cool things is we build that it is
so we're building an editor for that

00:34:46.759 --> 00:34:46.769
so we're building an editor for that
 

00:34:46.769 --> 00:34:50.419
so we're building an editor for that
thing we call it the motion editor it's

00:34:50.419 --> 00:34:50.429
thing we call it the motion editor it's
 

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:55.430
thing we call it the motion editor it's
part of the design surface but now

00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440
part of the design surface but now
 

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.089
part of the design surface but now
you'll be able to do those edits

00:34:58.089 --> 00:34:58.099
you'll be able to do those edits
 

00:34:58.099 --> 00:35:05.539
you'll be able to do those edits
directly in the design surface so kind

00:35:05.539 --> 00:35:05.549
directly in the design surface so kind
 

00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:07.609
directly in the design surface so kind
of to take you through how you would do

00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619
of to take you through how you would do
 

00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:12.140
of to take you through how you would do
that in the design surface this based on

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.150
that in the design surface this based on
 

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.599
that in the design surface this based on
constraints layout you just create your

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:14.609
constraints layout you just create your
 

00:35:14.609 --> 00:35:16.490
constraints layout you just create your
constraints for your first constraint

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500
constraints for your first constraint
 

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.120
constraints for your first constraint
set switch to the second edit the

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.130
set switch to the second edit the
 

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.829
set switch to the second edit the
constraints for the second constraint

00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839
constraints for the second constraint
 

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:25.519
constraints for the second constraint
set and then once you do that if you hit

00:35:25.519 --> 00:35:25.529
set and then once you do that if you hit
 

00:35:25.529 --> 00:35:27.890
set and then once you do that if you hit
play it will show you the animation

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900
play it will show you the animation
 

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.509
play it will show you the animation
between those two constraint sets

00:35:31.509 --> 00:35:31.519
between those two constraint sets
 

00:35:31.519 --> 00:35:34.849
between those two constraint sets
there's a checkbox to enable showing you

00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859
there's a checkbox to enable showing you
 

00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:38.539
there's a checkbox to enable showing you
the path so now you can see the path but

00:35:38.539 --> 00:35:38.549
the path so now you can see the path but
 

00:35:38.549 --> 00:35:40.450
the path so now you can see the path but
how would you add a keyframe

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:40.460
how would you add a keyframe
 

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.789
how would you add a keyframe
well you just position the cursor where

00:35:43.789 --> 00:35:43.799
well you just position the cursor where
 

00:35:43.799 --> 00:35:48.019
well you just position the cursor where
you want it you add the type of keyframe

00:35:48.019 --> 00:35:48.029
you want it you add the type of keyframe
 

00:35:48.029 --> 00:35:51.529
you want it you add the type of keyframe
that you want to add and you can just

00:35:51.529 --> 00:35:51.539
that you want to add and you can just
 

00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:53.309
that you want to add and you can just
distort the key

00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319
distort the key
 

00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:56.489
distort the key
by selecting the keyframe and moving it

00:35:56.489 --> 00:35:56.499
by selecting the keyframe and moving it
 

00:35:56.499 --> 00:36:00.959
by selecting the keyframe and moving it
around on the screen and let's just do

00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:00.969
around on the screen and let's just do
 

00:36:00.969 --> 00:36:04.670
around on the screen and let's just do
that one more time so you could see it

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680
that one more time so you could see it
 

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.359
that one more time so you could see it
just select a position any position

00:36:08.359 --> 00:36:08.369
just select a position any position
 

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:14.670
just select a position any position
creates a keyframe and then we just move

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680
creates a keyframe and then we just move
 

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:21.590
creates a keyframe and then we just move
it

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:21.600
 
 

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.160
 
so here's much more complex motions

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.170
so here's much more complex motions
 

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.250
so here's much more complex motions
they're all being animated this one has

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260
they're all being animated this one has
 

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.590
they're all being animated this one has
quite a few keyframes in it just

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:30.600
quite a few keyframes in it just
 

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.890
quite a few keyframes in it just
designed to allow you to set

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900

transparency on some things change the

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:36.390
transparency on some things change the
 

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.840
transparency on some things change the
size of other things move them around

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:38.850
size of other things move them around
 

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:59.550
size of other things move them around
but it all works in the IDE thank you

00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560
 
 

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.099

about it
 

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:41.470
about it
so think about it there is code labs for

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480
so think about it there is code labs for
 

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.060
so think about it there is code labs for
