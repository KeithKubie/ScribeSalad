raising local taxi so if you do the

00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519
raising local taxi so if you do the
 

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:14.059
raising local taxi so if you do the
numbers right you realize that almost

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:14.069

others another through higher taxes so
 

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.230
others another through higher taxes so
if you do the numbers about eighty

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240

by one so the size of the public sector

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:00.500
by one so the size of the public sector
 

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:05.830
by one so the size of the public sector
so in Italy is not the largest public

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840
so in Italy is not the largest public
 

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.350

so is it allows the trade balance to be

if the composition of output is is is
 

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:29.070
if the composition of output is is is
fixed and this I think is is the problem

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080
fixed and this I think is is the problem
 

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.960

is difficult if you want is not such a
 

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.900
is difficult if you want is not such a
bad situation because if you did not

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:39.910
bad situation because if you did not
 

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.550
bad situation because if you did not
have the productive set of the sector of

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:41.560
have the productive set of the sector of
 

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.370
have the productive set of the sector of
the economy if zero was the mean but

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:44.380
the economy if zero was the mean but
 

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.380
the economy if zero was the mean but
zero is also for everybody you've been

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:46.390
zero is also for everybody you've been
 

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.510
zero is also for everybody you've been
trouble right now you have a part which

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:48.520
trouble right now you have a part which
 

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.850
trouble right now you have a part which
is productive you have to allow this

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:50.860
is productive you have to allow this
 

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.250
is productive you have to allow this
part of the economy to increase and to

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:53.260
part of the economy to increase and to
 

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.380
part of the economy to increase and to
shrink the other but if you do this I

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:55.390
shrink the other but if you do this I
 

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.900
shrink the other but if you do this I
think there is a future so there is a

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:57.910
think there is a future so there is a
 

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.150
think there is a future so there is a
relatively easy future the issue is how

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:00.160
relatively easy future the issue is how
 

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.330
relatively easy future the issue is how
to do it there are other problem so this

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:03.340
to do it there are other problem so this
 

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:10.550
to do it there are other problem so this
is a an interesting it looks at the

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:10.560
is a an interesting it looks at the
 

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.810
is a an interesting it looks at the
percentage of firm the teryx but this is

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:12.820
percentage of firm the teryx but this is
 

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.780
percentage of firm the teryx but this is
to tell you that it is not for those

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:15.790
to tell you that it is not for those
 

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.760
to tell you that it is not for those
firm that are productive it is not a

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:17.770
firm that are productive it is not a
 

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.670
firm that are productive it is not a
comparative competitiveness problem so

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:20.680
comparative competitiveness problem so
 

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.160
comparative competitiveness problem so
this is the percent of firms exporting

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.170
this is the percent of firms exporting
 

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.710
this is the percent of firms exporting
to selected markets abroad so this here

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720
to selected markets abroad so this here
 

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.350
to selected markets abroad so this here
the firm that are exported to china and

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360

with us and canada and these are the
 

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.490
with us and canada and these are the
countries so if you look at this look at

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:35.500
countries so if you look at this look at
 

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.160
countries so if you look at this look at
the last column you see that

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.170
the last column you see that
 

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.750
the last column you see that

export the size of the firm's and we'll
 

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.340
export the size of the firm's and we'll
get a moment to what this size is so

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:37.350
get a moment to what this size is so
 

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.460
get a moment to what this size is so
small it's a it's a limitation to the

small it's a it's a limitation to the
 

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:45.980
small it's a it's a limitation to the
ability to to export so why the size is

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:45.990
ability to to export so why the size is
 

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.380
ability to to export so why the size is
smaller with anything now we're talking

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:48.390

differently in german the private
 

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.400
differently in german the private
companies are ninety percent so it's

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:10.410
companies are ninety percent so it's
 

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:13.159

is that the management is all in-house
so sixty-six percent of the management

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960
so sixty-six percent of the management
 

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.220
so sixty-six percent of the management

domestic home family management and this
 

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.900
domestic home family management and this
is is a problem because if you if you

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:44.910
is is a problem because if you if you
 

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:47.150
is is a problem because if you if you
want the management to be to be your son

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:47.160

to grow very fast and this is one of the
 

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.650
to grow very fast and this is one of the
issues why I think this has to do with

00:34:59.650 --> 00:34:59.660
issues why I think this has to do with
 

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.630
