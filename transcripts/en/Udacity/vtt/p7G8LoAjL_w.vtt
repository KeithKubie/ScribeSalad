00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.510
We've talked about a lot in this lesson,
but

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.840
really there are three things
that you should take away.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.870
&gt;&gt; First, listen to your users,
for real, over the phone or

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.670
by looking at the reports
we just talked about.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.330
And move fast to correct and
improve your models.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.940
Test new ideas and let the data talk.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.330
&gt;&gt; And
do your best to solve a real need.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.330
Users will be happy to pay for
something that create value.
