00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.920
What is the length of
the hypotenuse of this triangle?

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.350
Just a note, like all the other
drawings, this is not to scale.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.110
And just as a reminder,
a squared + b squared = c squared.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.210
Enter your answer in the box.
