00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.790
We already know that the
product rule tells us

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.510
that if we have the product of
two functions-- so let's say

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.200
f of x and g of x--
and we want to take

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.520
the derivative of this
business, that this is just

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.980
going to be equal
to the derivative

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.280
of the first function,
f prime of x, times

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.950
the second function, times g
of x, plus the first function,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.830
so not even taking its
derivative, so plus f

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.165
of x times the derivative
of the second function.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.870
So two terms, in each term
we take the derivative of one

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.370
of the functions and not the
other, and then we switch.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.340
So over here is the
derivative of f, not of g.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.522
Here it's the derivative
of g, not of f.

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:49.230
This is hopefully a
little bit of review.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.790
This is the product rule.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.373
Now what we're
essentially going to do

00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:53.780
is reapply the
product rule to do

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.754
what many of your calculus books
might call the quotient rule.

00:00:56.754 --> 00:00:58.670
I have mixed feelings
about the quotient rule.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.086
If you know it, it might make
some operations a little bit

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:03.879
faster, but it really comes
straight out of the product

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:04.379
rule.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320
And I frankly always
forget the quotient rule,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.230
and I just rederive it
from the product rule.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.970
So let's see what
we're talking about.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.650
So let's imagine if we
had an expression that

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.140
could be written as f
of x divided by g of x.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.990
And we want to take the
derivative of this business,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700
the derivative of
f of x over g of x.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.610
The key realization
is to just recognize

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.990
that this is the same thing
as the derivative of-- instead

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.610
of writing f of
x over g of x, we

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.355
could write this as f of x times
g of x to the negative 1 power.

00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:45.620
And now we can use
the product rule

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.910
with a little bit
of the chain rule.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.520
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.030
Well, we just use
the product rule.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.970
It's the derivative of the
first function right over here--

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.880
so it's going to
be f prime of x--

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
times just the second
function, which is just

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.460
g of x to the negative 1
power plus the first function,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.960
which is just f of x,
times the derivative

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.439
of the second function.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.980
And here we're going to have to
use a little bit of the chain

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.640
rule.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.434
The derivative of
the outside, which

00:02:24.434 --> 00:02:25.850
we could kind of
view as something

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.660
to the negative 1 power with
respect to that something,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.700
is going to be negative 1
times that something, which

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.525
in this case is g of x
to the negative 2 power.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.150
And then we have to
take the derivative

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.740
of the inside
function with respect

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.880
to x, which is
just g prime of x.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.890
And there you have it.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.490
We have found the
derivative of this

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.750
using the product rule
and the chain rule.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.260
Now, this is not
the form that you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.660
might see when
people are talking

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.410
about the quotient
rule in your math book.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.620
So let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.480
All of this is going to be equal
to-- we can write this term

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.490
right over here as f
prime of x over g of x.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.160
And we could write
all of this as-- we

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.020
could put this negative
sign out front.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.070
We have negative f of
x times g prime of x.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.555
And then all of that
over g of x squared.

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:30.650
Let me write this a
little bit neater.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.835
All of that over g of x squared.

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.830
And it still isn't in the
form that you typically

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.240
see in your calculus book.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.855
To do that, we just have
to add these two fractions.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.980
So let's multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.720
here by g of x so that we have
everything in the form of g

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.810
of x squared in the denominator.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.430
So if we multiply the
numerator by g of x,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.740
we'll get g of x right
over here and then

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.530
the denominator will
be g of x squared.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.050
And now we're ready to add.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.450
And so we get the
derivative of f

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.910
of x over g of x is equal to
the derivative of f of x times g

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.460
of x minus-- not plus
anymore-- let me write it

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:28.020
in white-- f of x
times g prime of x,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.320
all of that over g of x squared.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.410
So once again, you
can always derive this

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.420
from the product rule
and the chain rule.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.150
Sometimes this might be
convenient to remember in order

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.110
to work through some problems of
this form a little bit faster.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.010
And if you wanted to kind of see
the pattern between the product

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.430
rule and the quotient
rule, the derivative of one

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.050
function just times
the other function.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.710
And instead of
adding the derivative

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.860
of the second function
times the first function,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.140
we now subtract it.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.190
And all that is over the
second function squared.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.212
Whatever was in the denominator,
it's all of that squared.

00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:06.670
So when we're taking
the derivative

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.720
of the function in the
denominator up here,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.070
there's a subtraction, and then
we are also putting everything

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.930
over the second
function squared.
