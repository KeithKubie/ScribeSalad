00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.390
Movies go through a number of changes between
inception and the final cut that's released

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.180
in theaters, and sometimes the DVD will include
those scenes that were deleted or an alternate

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.180
ending.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.220
There are many reasons the writers, producers,
or director may choose to go with a different

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.539
ending than the one that was originally planned
- whether because the first ending didn't

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.190
test well with audiences or the studio didn't
feel it would be appropriate for the movie.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.870
No matter the reason, a movie's alternate
ending can give fans an idea of where the

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.629
film could have gone if certain changes hadn't
been made.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.820
Here are Screen Rant's 10 amazing alternate
movie endings you've never seen.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.710
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
The final film in George Lucas' original Star
Wars trilogy received some backlash from fans

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.329
that appreciated the darker themes in Episode
V, especially due to Return of the Jedi's

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.600
inclusion of Ewoks.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470
However, according to the film's producer
Gary Katz, the original outline for Episode

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.110
VI had Han Solo dying in a raid on an Imperial
Base with a more "bittersweet and poignant"

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.110
ending.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.320
But, Lucas decided the film needed a much
happier final act and Return of the Jedi was

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.390
overhauled.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.259
Another reason Lucas didn't want any of the
main trio of heroes killed?

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:08.990
Toy sales.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.990
Furious 7

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.229
One of the more tragic reasons that a film
would need to change its ending is the death

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.170
of a star, which happened to be the case for
Furious 7 when Paul Walker passed away in

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.170
the middle of filming.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.179
The final cut of the film had Walker's character,
Brian, retiring with his family away from

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.499
the world of crime and street racing depicted
throughout the Fast and Furious series.

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.950
However, this was changed from early versions
of the script, which had Brian remaining part

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.640
of the crew led by Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto,
and setting up future sequels.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.600
But, as director James Wan explained, the
final ending made more sense in light Walker's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.909
passing and it worked as a tribute to the
actor's involvement in the series.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.249
X-Men: The Last Stand

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:46.299
The final instalment in the X-Men trilogy
of the 2000s has largely been seen as the

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.039
weakest of the three movies, trading massive
action set pieces for smaller character moments.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.979
When The Last Stand was released on DVD, three
alternate ending scenes were included that

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.310
depicted a new school year at Xavier's Academy,
Rogue still with her powers, and Logan returning

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.079
to the bar from the first X-Men film.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.459
However, during the scripting process there
was another major change to the entire third

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:05.909
act of The Last Stand.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.569
According to director Brett Ratner, the original
script had the final standoff taking place

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.000
in Washington D.C. - with the Golden Gate
Bridge sequence occurring in the middle of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.420
the film - but he urged the writers to change
it because too many other movies at the time

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.350
had used the country's capital city in their
final set pieces.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.870
Scott Pilgrim vs the World

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.530
The trouble with basing a movie on a series
of comic books is that the source material

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.900
may not be complete at the same time as the
film.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.270
That was the case with Edgar Wright's Scott
Pilgrim vs the World movie, which originally

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.170
ended with Scott and Ramona going their separate
ways while Scott got back together with his

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.190
high school-aged girlfriend, Knives.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.360
Unsurprisingly, the original ending didn't
test well with audiences, but at the time,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.790
that was how Bryan Lee O'Malley's comics had
left the characters.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.611
Then, when the writer completed the series
with Scott and Ramona getting together, Wright

00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:53.140
changed the ending to his film accordingly
- and audience scores went up.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.790
Wright also later revealed that an early draft
of the script had Gideon Graves transforming

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.670
into a giant robot, but it was scrapped for
being too similar to Michael Bay's Transformers.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.670
Chronicle

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.540
What happens when three teenagers accidentally
stumble into superhero-like powers?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.490
Chronicle, from director Josh Trank and screenwriter
Max Landis, attempts to answer that question

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.630
as Matt is forced to fight his former friend,
Andrew, who takes a turn for the villainous.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.950
The film ends with Matt promising to use his
powers for good from then on, but Landis'

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.040
original ending took a much more literal depiction
of super-heroics.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.300
The original script had the film jumping ahead
two years to show a dam breaking in Asia,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.370
with Matt swooping in to thunderous applause
from those about to drown.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.150
He hypes the crowd even further - shouting
"F*** YEAH KOREA!" - then uses his telekinetic

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170
powers to stop the giant wave of water.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.170
Alien

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.900
Sigourney Weaver's role as Ridley Scott's
cat-loving action heroine Ripley has become

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.819
a fan favorite character in the Alien franchise
since the film was released in 1979.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.420
But, one version of the ending would have
prevented Ripley from appearing in any of

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.100
the other movies in the series.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.670
Scott had apparently discussed the idea of
having the xenomorph kill Ripley by biting

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.020
her head off, then recording a final entry
in her log by mimicking her voice.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.010
However, the producers nixed the idea because
it was too dark and urged Scott to make sure

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.370
the creature died in the end.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.590
We'll never know if Alien would have been
as successful if Scott had kept his original

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.920
ending, but we do know Ripley wouldn't be
the action hero we know today.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920
Interstellar

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.070
The ending of Christopher Nolan's 2014 space
and time travel film left many audience members

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.070
confused.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.009
The final sequences see Cooper jettison into
a black hole hoping to send data to his daughter

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.879
on Earth, which he does through a 5th-dimensional
tesseract.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.570
However, according to the director's brother
and screenwriting partner Jonathan Nolan,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.219
that wasn't the original ending to the film.

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.789
The screenwriter said Interstellar first had
a "more straightforward" ending in which the

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.659
wormhole collapsed "when Cooper tries to send
the data back."

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.249
It's unclear how this event would specifically
change the ending, but it certainly seems

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.840
as though it wouldn't have confused quite
as many people in the audience.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840
Watchmen

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.279
Before Zack Snyder tackled the DC Comics Extended
Universe, he adapted Alan Moore's critically-acclaimed

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:51.440
Watchmen series.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.750
The film was praised for its faithfulness
to Moore's comic, but an early version of

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.400
the film that had Terry Gilliam attached to
direct had a much different ending to both

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.180
Moore and Snyder's versions.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.889
As revealed by producer Joel Silver, Gilliam's
Watchmen would have ended with Ozymandias

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.689
convincing Doctor Manhattan to go back in
time and stop himself from being created,

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.270
which would have changed all the present day
superheroes into people that simply dressed

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.889
up like heroes from comic books.

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.029
Snyder has since openly criticized Gilliam's
ending, though his film's final act was also

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.900
criticized for not exactly following the source
material.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.900
The Hateful Eight

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.620
Quentin Tarantino's eighth feature film was
almost cancelled after the movie's original

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.629
script leaked online in January 2014.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.509
But, the director held a stage reading of
the script with the entire cast, where they

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.479
announced the production would be moving forward
with some changes made to the story.

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.120
According to those that read the initial script
or saw the stage reading, Tarantino's original

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.639
ending had a much bloodier final act with
only Chris Mannix left alive - while in the

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.699
film he was joined by Major Marquis Warren.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.041
Additionally, the violence and who kills who
in the final shootout was tweaked for the

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:53.100
film, likely to provide some surprises for
those that read the original script.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.949
Kick-Ass 2

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.370
Another instance of a film being adapted from
a comic series that hadn't been completed

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.150
is the Kick-Ass series, based in the books
by Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.979
According to Kick-Ass 2 writer and director
Jeff Wadlow, Millar originally had the villain,

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.360
played in the movies by Christopher Mintz-Plasse,
die at the end of the second volume.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.999
However, with a third installment to the movie
series in mind, Wadlow convinced Millar not

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:17.120
to kill the villain, and just leave him wounded
instead.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.979
So, Millar's original ending would have prevented
Mintz-Plasse from returning to the series,

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.900
but since Kick-Ass 2 wasn't as well received
as the first film, a third movie may be out

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.599
of the cards anyway.

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:29.819
So what do you think of our list?
