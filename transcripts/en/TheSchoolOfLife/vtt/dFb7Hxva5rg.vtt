00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.660
It’s difficult to know much for certain
about the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu.

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.740
Even his name can be a little confusing; it
is also sometimes translated as Laozi or Lao Tze

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.100
Lao Tzu is said to have been a record keeper
in the court of the central Chinese Zhou Dynasty

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.110
in the 6th century B.C., and an older contemporary
of Confucius.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.310
He may also have been entirely mythical—much
like Homer in Western culture.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.359
Lao Tzu is said to have tired of life in the
Zhou court as it grew increasingly morally corrupt.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.120
So he left and rode on a water buffalo to
the western border of the Chinese empire.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.109
Although he was dressed as a farmer, the border
official recognised him and asked him to write

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.780
down his wisdom. According to this legend,
what Lao Tzu wrote became the sacred text

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.760
known as the Tao Te Ching.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.420
After writing this piece, Lao Tzu is said
to have crossed the border and disappeared

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.210
from history, perhaps to become a hermit.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.300
In reality, the Tao Te Ching is likely to
be the compilation of the works of many authors

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.380
over time. But stories about Lao Tzu and the
Tao Te Ching itself passed down through different

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.850
Chinese philosophical schools for over two
thousand years.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.869
Lao Tzu was the leading figure in the spiritual
practice known as Daoism

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.979
which is more than two thousand years old,
and still popular today. There are at least

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.960
twenty million Daoists, and perhaps even half
a billion, living around the world now, especially

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.590
in China and Taiwan. They practise meditation,
chant scriptures, and worship a variety of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.109
gods and goddesses in temples.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.539
Daoists also make pilgrimages to five sacred
mountains in eastern China in order to pray

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.689
at the temples and absorb spiritual energy
from these holy places, which are believed

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.219
to be governed by immortals.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.820
Daoism is deeply intertwined with other branches
of thought like Confucianism and Buddhism.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.600
There is a story about the three great Asian
spiritual leaders (Lao Tzu, Confucius, and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.479
Buddha). All were meant to have tasted vinegar.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.530
Confucius found it sour, much like he found
the world full of degenerate people, and Buddha

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.859
found it bitter, much like he found the world
to be full of suffering. But Lao Tzu found

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.039
the world sweet. This is telling, because
Lao Tzu’s philosophy tends to look at the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.349
apparent discord in the world and see an underlying
harmony guided by something called the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.819
Dao 道 = the path

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:13.599
The Tao Te Ching

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.170
which describes the Dao, is somewhat like
the Bible: it gives instructions (often vague

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.030
and generally open to multiple interpretations)
on how to live a good life. It discusses the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.420
“Dao” as the “way” of the world, which
is also the path to virtue, happiness, and harmony.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.239
"The way" isn’t inherently confusing
or difficult. But in order to follow the Dao,

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.170
we need to go beyond simply reading and thinking
about it. Instead we must learn

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.840
flowing, or effortless action.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720
It’s a sort of purposeful acceptance of
the way of the Dao

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720
 and living in harmony with it.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.540
This might seem lofty and bizarre, but most
of Lao Tzu’s suggestions are actually very

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.959
simple. First, we ought to take more time
for stillness. “To the mind that is still,”

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.000
Lao Tzu said, “the whole universe surrenders.”

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.709
We need to let go of our schedules, worries
and complex thoughts for a while and simply

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.620
experience the world.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.959
We spend so much time rushing from one place
to the next in life, but Lao Tzu reminds us

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.700
“nature does not hurry, yet everything is
accomplished.” It is particularly important

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.689
that we remember that certain things—grieving,
growing wiser, developing a new relationship—only

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.700
happen on their own schedule, like the changing
of leaves in the fall or the blossoming of

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.299
the bulbs we planted months ago.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.220
When we are still and patient we also need
to be open.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.700
“The usefulness of a pot comes from its
emptiness.” Lao Tzu said. “Empty yourself

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.019
of everything, let your mind become still.”

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.310
If we are too busy, too preoccupied with anxiety
or ambition, we will miss a thousand moments

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.959
of the human experience that are our natural
inheritance. We need to be awake to the way

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.310
sounds of the birds in the morning, the way
other people look when they are laughing,

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.379
the feeling of wind against our face. These
experiences reconnect us to parts of ourselves.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.900
This is another key point of Lao Tzu’s writing:
we need to be in touch with our real selves.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.900
We spend a great deal of time worrying about
who we ought to become, but we should instead

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.469
take time to be who we already are at heart.

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:06.549
We might rediscover a generous impulse, or
a playful side we had forgotten, or simply

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.079
an old affection for long walks.

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.110
Our ego is often in the way of our true self,
which must be found by being receptive to

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.709
the outside world rather than focusing on
some critical, too-ambitious internal image.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.949
“When I let go of what I am,” Lao Tzu
wrote, “I become what I might be.”

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.830
Nature is particularly useful for finding
ourselves.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.169
Lao Tzu liked to compare different parts of
nature to different virtues. He said,

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.430
"The best people are like water, which benefits
all things and does not compete with them.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.110
It stays in lowly places that others reject.
This is why it is so similar to the Dao."

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.780
Each part of nature can remind us of a quality
we admire and should cultivate ourselves—the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.400
strength of the mountains, the resilience
of trees, the cheerfulness of flowers.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.979
Of course, there are issues that must be addressed
by action, and there are times for ambition.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.289
Yet Lao Tzu’s work is important for Daoists
and non-Daoists alike, especially in a modern

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.770
world distracted by technology and focused
on what seem to be constant, sudden, and severe

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.039
changes.

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.229
His words serve as a reminder of the importance
of stillness, openness, and discovering buried

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.189
yet central parts of ourselves.
