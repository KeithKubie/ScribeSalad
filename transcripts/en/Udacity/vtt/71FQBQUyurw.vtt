00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.969
Now let's look at how an attacker
can defeat the IDS so

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.670
that his attack can go undetected.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.090
We call that an IDS performs
passive monitoring.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.000
That is, a network IDS takes
a copy of the network traffic and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.670
analyzes it while the traffic
is reaching the end host.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.040
Therefore, in order for the IDS to
detect the intrusion that's happening at

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.760
the end host, he must see
the same traffic as the end host.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.830
However, this is not always the case.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.450
An attacker can exploit this
in order to evade the IDS.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.010
The reason that the IDS and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.850
the end host are seeing different
traffic is because they're using

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.365
two different operating systems that
process traffic in different ways.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:50.160
In particular, TCP/IP protocol
specifications have ambiguities

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.190
that lead to different implementations
in different operating systems.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.820
As a result, if the IDS runs on Unix and
the end host runs on Windows,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.820
they may not process certain
packets exactly the same way.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.300
For example,
options such as time to live or

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.070
error conditions associated
with fragments and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.030
checksums are handled in different
ways in different operating systems.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.060
By exploiting these evidences,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.390
the attacker hopes that the IDS would
not see the attack traffic, yet the end

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.270
host will be affected by the attack
traffic as intended by the attacker.
