00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.880
PROFESSOR: We've got three
lectures left-- today,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.620
Thursday, and next Tuesday.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.230
So today we're going to
talk a little bit more

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:46.710
about modal analysis, and we did
initial conditions last time.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.350
This time we'll do
harmonic excitation mostly

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.390
with a little review there.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.350
Thursday-- let me say
this slightly differently.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.710
Modal analysis looks at
the vibration of a system

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.000
with many degrees of freedom
and looks at one mode at a time,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.664
but you can also just solve
the whole thing at once.

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:18.080
You don't have to break it
down into the individual modes,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.870
so you can come up with
a-- if you have a harmonic

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.597
excitation on a system with
many degrees of freedom,

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:26.930
if you put in a harmonic
force, the whole thing is going

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.090
to shake, and you can
solve it in one go,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.470
and that's essentially using
a transfer function approach.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.980
So this is breaking it
down one mode at a time.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.570
Here we're going to do this
concept of transfer functions

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.820
for Hij, so response at location
i due to an excitation at j.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.780
In a multiple degree
of freedom system,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.340
you get many different
combinations.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.380
So this is steady state
response, but done all at once.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.680
And Tuesday-- and also this
has an application to something

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.305
I called dynamic absorbers.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240
I'll just be able to
scratch the surface of that,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.020
but the Hancock Building across
the way-- I told you a couple

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.570
lectures back about it.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.100
In the 1970s, it was
brand new, and the windows

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.162
were falling out.

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:18.870
And there was lots of
windows falling out

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.120
at the bottom and
none at the top,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.920
and the thing was
bending back and forth

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.420
like just a cantilever,
a reed in the wind,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.750
and one of the
fixes for it is they

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.000
put a thing called the dynamic
absorber on the 58th floor.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.380
There are two 300 ton blocks of
lead on a pressurized oil film

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.230
so they can slide back and
forth on the 58th floor

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.660
of that building.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.210
They're called
dynamic absorbers.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.590
And at the expense of letting
these big blocks of lead slide

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.110
back and forth, it keeps
the building from vibrating.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.220
It keeps the windows
from falling out.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.740
So I hope to get to
talking a little bit

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.380
about dynamic
absorbers-- one other way

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.860
of stopping problem vibration.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.630
And on Tuesday, we'll talk
about strings and beams.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.845
Just a brief introduction
to continuous systems.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.739
And that'll be our last
lecture, and probably

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.530
give you a very quick
review then of what's

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.080
going to be covered
on the final,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.793
but mostly the final will
be covering this last third

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:32.890
of the course on vibration.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.460
So let's turn to modal
analysis, and posted on Stellar

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.260
is a little too page handout
that gives you a just step

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.375
by step cookbook approach to
conducting a modal analysis.

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:49.250
And we're going to hit
the highlights of that

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.900
this morning as a way of
reviewing what we learned

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.470
last time and moving on to
calculating the response

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.910
to harmonic forces.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:11.700
So we begin with some n degree
of freedom system linearized.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.779
We're only dealing with
linear equations of motion.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.300
And our first step is we
need equations of motion.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:31.060
So you write them
m-- in general, you'd

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.990
write out your equations
of motion for the system,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.100
and these x's here are just
my generalized coordinates.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.640
They can be rotations,
deflections, whatever

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.694
makes sense in the problem.

00:04:42.694 --> 00:04:43.610
That's the first step.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.670
You need your
equations of motion.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:55.690
Second step, find undamped
natural frequency--

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.306
is the omega i's-- I'll just
call it omega i's-- and mode

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:01.805
shapes.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.380
And the mode shapes
we put into a matrix

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.070
that we call a
mode shape matrix.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.340
I write it as u.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.010
So that's the next
step in the problem.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:32.830
The third is basically to apply
or invoke the modal expansion

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.570
theorem.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.940
This is the key to
the whole thing,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.560
and that is to say that you can
write the generalized motions

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.950
of the system-- the
responses of the system--

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:56.800
as a weighted sum of the
individual modes of the system.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.960
So the q's are the
modal amplitudes.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.910
The u's are the mode shape--
each mode, like the first mode,

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.640
has some amplitude
and time dependence,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.370
and its motion is distributed
to the whole system

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.181
according to its mode shape, and
that's what that statement is.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.190
And another way of writing
it which is more intuitive

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.350
is this is a summation
then of i equals

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.440
1 over the degrees of freedom
of the system of the mode

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:39.390
shapes times qi of t, the modal
amplitudes of the response

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.250
of that single degree
of freedom system

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.270
that describes
each of the modes.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:09.200
Now, I should-- the
qi's are the solution

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:16.350
to n equations of
the form mi qi double

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:28.400
dot plus ci qi dot
plus ki qi equals

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.370
the excitation for that single
degree of freedom system.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.150
So the modal
expansion theorem says

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.110
we're going to take
each mode of the system,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.940
treat it like a single
degree of freedom problem.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.700
And so for the first
mode, I would be 1.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.120
You would have a modal
mass, damping, stiffness,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.710
and a force for that mode.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.935
And you know how to solve for
the response of a single degree

00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:53.820
of freedom system to
initial conditions,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.900
or the steady state response
to some harmonic input,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.080
and you would do that
for each of the modes.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.130
And to get back to
the final answer,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.540
you sum them back
up again this way.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.100
So I've put up here
on the board where

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.340
that-- the description
of that demo,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.110
and we went through
all this information

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.650
last time so you have it in
your notes for last time.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.050
If you missed it last
time, I put it up again.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.360
So here's the demo on the table.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.980
This is my diagram of it.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.640
Mass 1, mass 2,
spring, lowercase k1,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.720
lowercase k2-- so
the lower cases

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.390
I'm going to use to
describe system parameters.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.929
Uppercase K's and
that sort of thing

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.799
will be my modal parameters.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.440
So this has masses,
stiffnesses, and damping,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.400
and this damper is connected
to the non-moving frame,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.880
and so is this one to
model the damping sliding

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.320
up and down on that shaft.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.750
So the equations of
motion of the system

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.680
are here in your
generalized coordinates.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.900
And I've included
the possibility

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.130
that I could have a force
in the first mass, F1,

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.360
a force in the second mass.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.900
So this is a completely general
set up for this problem.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.910
Then you need to find the
natural frequencies and mode

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.440
shapes, so you assume a solution
of the form e to i omega t.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.020
Plug in, and you get
this algebraic equation.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.590
Minus omega squared m plus k
times some vector, which will

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.680
turn out to be the mode shapes.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.665
And either this is
0, which is trivial,

00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:34.870
or the determinant of this
is 0, and this gives you

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.840
the roots of this
determinant, give you

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.900
the natural frequencies
of the system.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.680
If it's a four degree of freedom
problem, you get four roots.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.280
So we found for this
particular problem

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.980
that the natural frequencies
are 5.65 and 17.69,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.140
and the mass matrix, if
you weren't here last time,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:06.840
in kilograms, 3.193, 0.63.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.750
And the stiffness matrix
in newtons per meter

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.780
for that system is this.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:22.250
Notice, stiffness matrices
are always symmetric,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.150
and this one minus 36, minus 36.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.340
And many of you have
been taking 2001.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.690
Did anybody invoke
something called

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.410
Maxwell's reciprocal theorem?

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.760
Have you run into that?

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.990
Well, this comes from
structural analysis,

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.660
this notion of the
symmetry of the K matrix.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.710
The mass matrix is also
going to be symmetric.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.910
So we need to find--
to do modal analysis,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.910
you make this calculation.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.550
You transpose mu.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.975
This is the transpose of
the mode shape matrix mu,

00:10:56.975 --> 00:11:00.190
and if you do that
calculation with these numbers

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.640
and those mode shapes,
you get a new mass--

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.420
you get the modal
mass matrix, which

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.520
is guaranteed to
be diagonal, even

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.850
if it wasn't to begin with.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.640
This is the numbers you get.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.630
The stiffness matrix certainly
wasn't diagonal to begin with.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.950
It looked like that.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.580
And we multiply u
transpose times k times u,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.890
and we get a diagonal matrix.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.890
This element here
we'd call capital K1.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.600
It's the modal
stiffness for mode 1.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.770
This is the modal
mass for mode 1,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.370
and they represent a--
they're the numbers we

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.050
need to write a single degree
of freedom equation of motion

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.850
of the kind at the bottom
of that board up there.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.250
So we want to write
M1q1 double dot

00:11:52.250 --> 00:12:03.570
plus some c1q1 dot plus k1q1
equals, in general, a-- this

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:08.300
is a 1-- some excitation, but
it's a single degree of freedom

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.110
system.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.330
If it's a single degree
of freedom system,

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.830
what's its natural frequency
using the parameters

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.610
in this equation?

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.490
AUDIENCE: k1/m1.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.660
PROFESSOR: Right, so
omega 1 had better

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:31.590
be the square root of k1/m1, and
that's the square root of-- k1

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:37.400
is 91-- nope.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.230
That's the real [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.030
I need my u transpose k here.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.640
113.71.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.490
113.71.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:56.420
And the modal mass for
system one is 3.556.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.370
So that's 3 or so and
100 and something.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.160
That's neighborhood of 35, 36.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.890
Square root of 36 is about 6.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.450
So it needs to give
you back exactly

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.210
the correct natural
frequency, which

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.040
you found in the
beginning when you

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.900
solved for the natural
frequencies and mode

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.440
shapes of the system.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.420
So I repeated myself here.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.060
And if you write the
same thing-- omega 2--

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.200
it better be equal to k2/m2.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.639
So these are just ways
of verifying that you've

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.930
done your arithmetic correctly.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.380
And I haven't done the
damping matrix yet,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.730
because the damping
matrices have

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.500
to be treated rather carefully.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.550
They don't
automatically uncouple,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.420
and so we'll address
it in just a second.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.560
The damping matrix,
however, would

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:58.220
be written utcu
would give me what

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:06.225
I hope is a diagonalized
modal damping matrix.

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:08.440
I'm trying to make these
look like caps or something

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.610
to make them look a little
different from the c's

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.070
of the dashpots themselves.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.900
We hope to find a
diagonalized damping matrix,

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.890
but we have to make some
effort to make that happen.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.900
Finally, one thing we
haven't dealt with before.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:31.940
In order to-- when we derive the
single degree of freedom modal

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.680
systems, we had to
multiply through

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.980
by this u transpose, the
original equations of motion,

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.360
and so what we haven't
worked with yet

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:50.540
is how do you get the
modal forces in the system?

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.610
And they come from the
calculation u transpose

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:59.290
times the generalized
forces in the system.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.520
So that's a vector
times a matrix gives you

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.650
a new vector, which are
the generalized forces.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.430
And we're going to do
that example in more

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.760
detail in a few minutes.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:24.680
So last time we did the
initial conditions problem,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.680
and we need the
results of that to do--

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.990
we need the damping that
we learned from that to do

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.140
the force vibration problem.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.320
So let's go back and review a
little bit about what we did.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.570
So let's let, for a moment,
the generalized forces be 0.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.530
So no excitation.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.530
So we're only doing an
initial conditions problem,

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:55.470
and let's assume that we have
some set of initial conditions

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.430
on the generalized
displacements at time 0.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.720
So those initial conditions
on displacements--

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.290
they'll look something
like x10 down to xn0,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.880
and we just have a two degree of
freedom system in our example.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.875
And also you could have
an x dot at t equals 0,

00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:21.270
and that would be some vector
of v10's down to vn0's.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.300
And for today, we're
going to let those be 0s.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.190
So we're just going to
have an initial deflection

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.650
in the system and
see what happens.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:38.700
And we learned last time that,
since the modal expansion

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.160
theorem is what makes
this whole thing work,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:52.490
the idea that x can be
written as u times q--

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.360
then we ought to be able to say
the same thing for-- if these

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.240
are initial conditions,
then we should

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.870
be able to get the initial
conditions in modal

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.460
coordinates.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:11.319
So x at 0 here is also
u at the q's at 0,

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.140
but we normally
would specify these.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.569
We need to know those.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.560
Well, to get these I just
multiply through by u inverse

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.940
so that the q, the vector of the
initial displacements in modal

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:31.980
coordinates, is just
equal to u inverse times

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.330
the initial conditions--
the initial deflections

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.350
in the generalized coordinates.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:45.730
And q dot at 0, if you had
non-zero initial velocities,

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.940
would be u inverse
times x dot at time 0.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.680
So let me tell you
where we're going.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.955
I'm not going to
go back all the way

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:09.580
through the initial
conditions problem.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.630
That was last lecture.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.690
I'm going to review
the results of it,

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.010
because what I want to
get to is, how do you

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.680
compute the response by
modal analysis-- the response

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.010
to a harmonic force?

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.450
For example, if you
get close to resonance

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.120
for a single degree
of freedom system,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.610
what controls the
height of that peak?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.290
If you drive a single degree
of freedom system at resonance,

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.960
what's the most
important parameter?

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.870
AUDIENCE: Damping [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.661
PROFESSOR: Damping.

00:18:37.661 --> 00:18:39.570
So we really need
to know damping.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.040
And the way we get damping is--
one of the ways is measure it.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.160
So I want to measure
the right damping

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.990
so that I can do--
what I'm trying

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.940
to get to is to do the
force vibration problem,

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.830
but I need to get some
estimates of damping to do it.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.560
Now, I said damping
can sometimes

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.330
be a problem, so I'm
going to show you--

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.660
I alluded to this
damp last time,

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.280
but I wasn't able to kind of
really clearly go through it.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.660
So I'm going to make a damping
model, my damping matrix

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.050
for my system such
that it is proportional

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:21.740
to the original mass and
stiffness matrix of the system.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.482
So alpha is just a parameter
that I get to choose.

00:19:24.482 --> 00:19:26.190
Beta is another one
that I get to choose,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.010
and this is m and
k, the original mass

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:36.150
and stiffness matrices
of this problem

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.400
or any n degree of
freedom problem.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.400
We're doing these two
degree of freedom examples

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.060
because they're
tractable on the board.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:48.110
So if I make my damping
matrix look like that,

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:53.440
it is guaranteed to work when I
do u transpose times that times

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.950
u, because we know the mass
and stiffness matrices give me

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.710
diagonals, so I'm just
essentially doing that again.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.015
So this is guaranteed to
give me a diagonal matrix.

00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:03.780
It's what I want.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.400
Yes?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.330
AUDIENCE: So are those
the original mass?

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.690
PROFESSOR: Yes, these
are the original ones.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.509
Usually, if I'm really trying
to write the modal ones,

00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:15.050
I'll draw them with a diagonal
through them or something just

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:20.910
to-- so these are m and
k, just like up here.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.650
Right there.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.600
They're right from
the original system.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.620
They're the ones on
the top of this board.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.940
There's the mass matrix,
damping matrix, stiffness matrix

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.020
for the original
equations of motion.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:38.450
So I am saying that my
unspecified damping matrix,

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.010
which is written
as c1, c2 there--

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:48.100
I'm going to
represent it this way,

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.010
so that u transpose cu, which
is the calculation I need

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:58.140
to be able to do-- what
that gives me is an alpha,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.400
and here's my modal
mass, diagonalized

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.760
modal mass matrix that
results, plus a beta

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.280
times my diagonalized
stiffness matrices.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.400
So Christina, these guys are
the modal ones after doing

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.550
u transpose mu, u transpose ku.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.150
So we have a two degree
of freedom system,

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.870
and when I do this
calculation, I'll

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:34.600
get modal mass m1, m2, k1, k2.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.350
So the final diagonalized
stiffness matrix

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:47.080
will end up looking like some
capital C10, capital C2 here.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.150
That's my diagonalized
damping matrix.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.890
It'll come from these, and
I'll just write them out.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:22:02.390
So the C1 will be an
alpha m1 plus beta k1,

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:10.750
and C2 will be alpha
m2 plus beta k2.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.130
So I have two free
parameters with which

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.810
I can fit-- I can fit
those parameters to give me

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.990
the damping that I want,
and I'm going to measure

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.000
the damping in the system.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.570
And then I'm going
to find the two

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.940
parameters that make that work.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.030
That's why I'm
going through this.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.875
All right, running out of room.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:55.461
So zeta 1, the damping
ratio for mode 1--

00:22:55.461 --> 00:22:57.210
if it's a single degree
of freedom system,

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.240
you say, oh, well that's
the damping constant over 2

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.420
omega 1 m1.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.307
That's how we
define damping ratio

00:23:07.307 --> 00:23:08.890
for a single degree
of freedom system,

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.160
but we know what
these quantities are.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:17.760
This then is an alpha
m1 over 2 omega 1 m1

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:26.020
plus a beta k1
over 2 omega 1 m1.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.860
k1/m1 is omega 1 squared.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.970
So put omega 1 squared up here.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.750
Cancel with that.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:39.090
These two gives you-- this
gives you alpha over 2

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:47.130
omega 1 plus beta
omega 1 over 2,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.010
and I can do the same
thing for zeta 2.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:24:02.470
Be my c2 over 2 omega 2 m2, and
that'll give me an alpha over 2

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:08.650
omega 2 plus beta
omega 2 over 2.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.350
So if I can measure a value
for this damping and a value

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.310
for that damping, I have.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.980
These are known then.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.580
I have two equations
and two unknowns, alpha

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.500
and beta-- just algebraic
equations that I can solve.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.500
So now I need to
conduct my experiment.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.020
I have this system.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.940
Without external
excitation, it's

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:53.080
just a free vibration system--
typical equations of motion.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.260
The first mode would
look like m1q1 double dot

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:08.040
plus c1q1 dot plus
k1q1 equals 0.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.634
I'm looking for
solutions to that,

00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:11.550
and there's a similar
one for the second mode.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.169
And what I want to
do is excite only one

00:25:23.169 --> 00:25:24.210
of these modes at a time.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.090
Now, you've seen this
demo done before,

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.330
but at a certain
combination of deflections,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.560
it'll respond only in mode
1, and a different one

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.620
will respond only in mode 2.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.400
And it's guaranteed
that, if you deflect

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.870
a system in the shape of one
of its modes and let it go,

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.660
it will only vibrate
in that mode,

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.900
but let's prove to
ourselves that that actually

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.190
is going to work.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:26:02.820
So I'm going to let, for
example, initial conditions--

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:11.160
x10, x20-- be in
the shape of mode 1.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:21.770
Well mode 1 is 1, 2.2667--
is the mode shape of mode 1.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.620
I'm just going to let that be.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.320
I'm going to deflect it
in the shape of mode one,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:36.830
and I'm going to let x10 dot
and x20 dot-- those are 0.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:42.090
And I need to
know, if I do that,

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:46.240
what are the resulting
initial conditions

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.890
in modal coordinates?

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:58.010
Well, we know q10 and
q20-- I can obtain them

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:07.100
by doing u inverse times this.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:12.320
So this will be u inverse-- last
time-- I'm going to write this.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.230
Last time I made a mistake.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.890
So u inverse-- I left out a 0.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:37.030
So 0.0898, 0.9102,
0.4016, minus 0.4016.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.430
So that's u inverse, and
I'm going to multiply it

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.130
by one of the mode shapes.

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:49.310
1 and 2.2667.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.470
So I'm saying that
my initial conditions

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.190
are going to look exactly
like one mode shape.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:58.390
To compute the equivalent
modal initial conditions,

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:04.050
I multiply the generalized the
coordinate initial conditions

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.370
by u inverse.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.940
Here's u inverse times that,
and if I do that calculation,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.960
I get exactly 1, 0.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.230
And if instead of
the first mode shape

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:23.510
I put in the second mode
shape, the 1 minus 0.2236--

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:28.510
if I did that, I would
get exactly 0, 1.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.960
So I just wanted to go through
that just so you'd see it--

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.560
that the math bears it out.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.670
If you put in a
deflection that's exactly

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.160
the shape of a mode,
then you will get back

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.889
an equivalent initial condition
in the modal coordinates

00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:50.930
for only that mode and
everything else will be 0.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:51.900
So that's q.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.220
This is q10-- is that guy.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.970
And this q20 in this case is 0.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:02.500
OK?

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.040
So now we're ready
to do the experiment.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:15.440
So if I deflected in the shape
of mode 1-- come back here.

00:29:18.817 --> 00:29:21.400
And now would be a good time to
lower the lights a little bit.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.040
And unfortunately we have that
white chalk in the background

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.670
to distract us, but
it's now deflected only

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.979
in the shape of
mode 1, and now it's

00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:34.270
going to behave like a single
degree of freedom system,

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.470
right?

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.760
So how would you estimate--
do a quick estimate

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.980
of the damping of mode 1.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.970
I gave you a little
quick, easy rule

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.121
you could use a few times back.

00:29:51.121 --> 00:29:51.620
What was it?

00:29:58.242 --> 00:30:00.140
AUDIENCE: Do the 50% thing?

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.660
PROFESSOR: Do the 50%
thing she suggests.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.910
Now, can you be a
little more specific.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:05.410
Pardon?

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.910
AUDIENCE: The half life.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, how many--
what am I looking for?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.180
How many--

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.010
AUDIENCE: Cycles.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:15.540
PROFESSOR: Cycles it takes
for the thing to decay 50%.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.930
So the reference line is here.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.740
I've deflected it that far,
and it'll start vibrating,

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.660
and when the top of
this on a vibration

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.827
gets to the halfway
point between here

00:30:25.827 --> 00:30:27.410
and the reference--
reference is where

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.350
it starts-- that'll be my 50%.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:37.540
So one, two, three, four.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.740
Got about four cycles when
it only went down halfway.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.755
Now, when I did it in
my office the other day,

00:30:43.755 --> 00:30:46.920
I only got 2 and 1/2 cycles.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.070
So we're going to use 2
and 1/2 cycles because I

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.380
ran the numbers for that.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.710
This thing is very
sensitive if it's

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.100
inclined a little bit,
because that changes

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.160
the friction on the shaft.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.660
So in my office the other day,
there was a lot more damping.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.570
So anyway, pretend
it's 2 and 1/2.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.320
Now, while we're at it,
let's do the other case.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.970
So the other case we
want to deflect it

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.700
in the shape of mode 2.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.380
So I go down, say,
a unit amount.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:29.170
It's now deflected downward
some amount and upwards such

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.890
that the ratio is in the
mode shape of mode 2.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:38.080
So every unit I went down,
I go up minus 22% of that.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.310
So that's what's been done here.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:45.450
So when I release this
one, now the reference line

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.580
for the second one is
up here down to here.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.217
So when this upper one decays
to halfway-- about here--

00:31:54.217 --> 00:31:55.550
that'll be the number of cycles.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.950
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.040
Anyway, in my office
I got about 10.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.200
We're going to use my numbers,
but that one is clearly

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.380
a lot less damped.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.220
That thing just went on, an
on, and on, and on, and on.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:31.680
So in our experiment then-- so
we conducted our experiment.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:43.000
Zeta 1 is approximately
equal to point 1.1

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.460
over the number of
cycles to decay 50%,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.760
and when I did the
experiment in my office,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.300
that was 0.11 over 2.5.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.810
So it was really decaying
fast, and so when you only

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.830
have two or three
cycles, it helps

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.450
to use even fractional cycles.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:02.740
And it's OK to use
fractional cycles.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.810
This is just an estimate.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.750
That's going to
give us a number.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:12.850
Zeta 2 is approximately
0.11 over the number

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.350
of cycles to decay 50%,
and in this case, that's

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.770
going to be 10.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:27.540
And so that gives me 0.011, or
what's known as 1.1% damping.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:34.736
And the other one,
0.11/2.5, gives me 0.044,

00:33:34.736 --> 00:33:38.140
or 4.4% damping.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.030
Percent of what?

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:43.210
Anybody remember what
happens when you're at 1?

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.975
Have a damping ratio of 1.0?

00:33:44.975 --> 00:33:46.100
AUDIENCE: Critical damping.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.820
PROFESSOR: That's
critical damping.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.000
That's that crossover point.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.990
If you have 1 or greater,
you get no oscillation.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.030
It just goes and stops.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.270
Less than 1, it will
actually across 0

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.640
and oscillate a little bit.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:07.810
Well, now I have
values for 0.044 0.011

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.699
that I can plug in to
these two equations,

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:13.610
and I now have two equations and
two unknowns, alpha and beta,

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.110
because I know
omega 1 and omega 2.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:24.270
So solve for alpha,
and for alpha I'm not

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.680
going to do that on the board.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.510
It's kind of a waste
of good lecture time.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:34.800
10.71.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:48.080
And beta, minus 0.033.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.650
So they can be positive or
negative to make these work

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.530
out, but those are the
two values you need,

00:34:54.530 --> 00:35:00.210
and that says that we're going
to model the damping matrix

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:15.240
of the system as 10.71m
plus minus 0.033k.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:21.460
And we'll compute the
diagonalized damping matrix,

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:27.700
which comes from utcu,
and did I write that down?

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:39.600
I didn't, but I don't need
it, because I know the damping

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:45.450
that I'm after 0.044 and
0.011, because in order

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.250
to complete this problem, if
I wanted to go to completion

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:53.610
and have the transient
decay of the system,

00:35:53.610 --> 00:36:01.860
I would have it in for each
of the two modal systems.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:11.130
q of t for the first mode would
be some e to the minus zeta

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:22.600
1 omega 1t cosine omega
1-- I left out my q10.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:35.210
q10 cosine omega 1d
times t-- that's the most

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:47.400
of the initial displacement
part-- plus q10 dot plus zeta

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:53.770
1 omega 1 q10.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.890
All of that over omega 1d.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:07.130
All of this times sine
omega 1d times time.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.880
So this is just the response to
initial conditions for a single

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.500
degree of freedom system, and
you'd have a similar one for q2

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.960
of t, except now all the ones
would be replaced by 2's.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:26.020
So you have an e to the
minus zeta 2 omega 2t times--

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.200
and those are your
two-- that would

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.960
be in general the response
to initial conditions

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.370
in modal terms.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:39.160
And if you want to get
back to the final response

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:44.950
in your generalized coordinates,
then it's just summation

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:52.100
i equals 1 to 2, in this
case, of u mode shape,

00:37:52.100 --> 00:38:03.400
or mode 1, q1 plus mode
shape for mode 2 q2 of t.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.772
So these two added together
would give you total response.

00:38:07.772 --> 00:38:08.730
So that's the response.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.771
Kind of a quick review of
what we learned before.

00:38:10.771 --> 00:38:12.960
Response to initial
conditions, but now

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.840
along the way we've learned
how to experimentally fix

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.140
the damping matrix,
so it'll work,

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.850
and actually get it to give us
exact accurate results if we

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:28.770
want to do a response to any
initial conditions problem.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.710
But now we also have damping
ratios for this system,

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:35.425
and we can now go on to do
the force vibration problem.

00:38:35.425 --> 00:38:37.050
And the force
vibration problem will

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:42.380
be pretty easy at this point.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:47.200
So that was a quick review of
response to initial conditions

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.970
by modal analysis-- how to find
a damping matrix that works.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.070
We've also proven
that, if you deflect

00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:00.220
a system in the shape of a mode,
it responds only in that mode.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.660
That's all pretty
use-- and that's

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.510
generally true of
vibration systems.

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.357
So we know-- I banged
on this before.

00:39:06.357 --> 00:39:08.190
We know these things
like to shake a little.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.757
They're flexible, and
this one has a mode shape.

00:39:10.757 --> 00:39:11.840
It's kind of a cantilever.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.940
It's first mode.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.540
It bends like that a
little bit, and this thing

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.826
has to bend with it.

00:39:16.826 --> 00:39:18.575
But if I were able to
just give this thing

00:39:18.575 --> 00:39:21.350
an initial deflection just
in the shape of that mode

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:26.080
and let it go, it will
vibrate in just that mode.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.550
And if I do it in some
other contorted way

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.251
that its initial shape isn't
just one mode and let it go,

00:39:32.251 --> 00:39:34.000
it'll vibrate in a
couple different modes.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.490
AUDIENCE: Is there
a way to visualize

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.980
the modal coordinates?

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.326
Would they be the center of
a mass of certain things,

00:39:41.326 --> 00:39:42.992
or would they would
be the center masses

00:39:42.992 --> 00:39:45.420
of the springs or something?

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.350
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
taught a vibration course

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.690
for many, many years, and I
scratched my head long and hard

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.190
to try to come up
with an example

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.340
where you could do
exactly what you asked.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.810
I know of one
example that works.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.340
In general, the
modal coordinates--

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.140
it's a coordinate
transformation into some system

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.810
that it's very hard to place
yourself physically so you can

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.280
see what's going on, but
to answer your question

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.630
I'll show you one and you
still have enough time

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.460
to get through the other part.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.240
Imagine this eraser.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.570
It's a car, a car automobile
suspension system.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.650
So here's the car.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:30.340
Sits on springs, the tires
and its suspension system.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.120
Got a center of mass
that's here somewhere.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.070
And I'm only going to consider
vertical motion of this thing.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.770
Now, you can imagine that
it could go up and down,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.000
but you can imagine it can
also pitch back and forth.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.860
So I'm going to have two
generalized coordinates.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.330
One is the vertical deflection
of its center of mass,

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:57.140
and the other is
the angular rotation

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.660
of the center of
mass with respect

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.760
to my initial horizontal.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.400
Now, you get equations
of motion of this.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.780
One, you'll get an mx
double dot kind of equation

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.280
by summing the forces
on this and the forces

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.100
from the springs.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.090
And of course
you'll have dampers

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:15.100
and those kinds of things.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.930
So you'll have
one force equation

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.230
by summing the forces on it.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.620
You'll have another equation
that's sum of torques,

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.330
and it's an i theta double
dot kind of equation.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.737
So it'll be a two degree
of freedom system.

00:41:26.737 --> 00:41:28.195
You'll get two
natural frequencies,

00:41:28.195 --> 00:41:30.210
and two mode shapes.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:34.220
And the two natural
frequencies look

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.685
approximate-- the two
mode shapes look-- here

00:41:37.685 --> 00:41:41.000
is the original
undeflected system.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.190
One mode shape the system
moves up and rotates up.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.730
It has both positive rotation
and some positive deflection.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:53.760
And I need to draw this
over here a little further.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.280
So here's the original system.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.940
It moves up in its
mode shape like that,

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.610
and when it goes down to its
max negative, it's like that.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.880
So it goes through a motion.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.640
And if you think about it,
if you extend these lines out

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.150
here, you come to a point
that this intersects.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:17.020
And so in fact,
in the first mode

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:23.060
of vibration of this thing, if
you went and sat right here,

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.440
you would just see this
thing go through an angle.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.812
And that, in fact, is the
modal coordinate for mode 1.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:37.310
And the second mode
I've kind of forgotten.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.760
It goes has a sign
change, and so when

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:47.370
you're going--
deflecting upwards,

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:53.580
it goes-- positive flexion
upwards-- it tips downwards.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:43:01.210
And when it goes the other
way, it goes like that.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.180
So this one, it goes
up and rotates up.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.850
And the second mode, when
it goes up, it rotates down.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.780
And out here is the point at
which you could go sit there,

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.937
and you would just see this
thing rotate up, rotate down

00:43:15.937 --> 00:43:17.020
if you went and sat there.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.410
So you move yourself
to a place where

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.430
you can see with a
single coordinate--

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.410
with only the angle
measured by this point,

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.556
you can completely
describe that modal motion.

00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:30.680
And with only the angle
measured around this point,

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.380
you can describe
the modal motion.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.320
But in general, you can't do it.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.600
So if I'm out here-- if
my eye is at this point,

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.111
I'll see this
thing go like that.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:47.581
That help?

00:43:47.581 --> 00:43:48.523
AUDIENCE: Yeah, a lot.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.390
PROFESSOR: So one of the
hardest things for me

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.050
as a lecturer is, since
I really like vibration

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.840
and I've taught it
for 35 years or so,

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.800
to try to cram everything I know
about vibration into the one

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.950
third of this course.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:10.740
So I obviously don't do that.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.330
So I'm trying to give you--
my goal then becomes give you

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:17.300
some basic insight
about vibration

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.240
so that, when you do get
out there in the real world

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.647
and you need to know something,
need to solve a vibration

00:44:22.647 --> 00:44:24.230
problem, you'll know
the fundamentals,

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.835
and you'll know where
to go look it up.

00:44:26.835 --> 00:44:28.960
And if you want to take
another course or something

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.170
in vibration, you can do that.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.670
All right, now we've got to
do, in relatively short order,

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:41.150
response of our initial
system over here

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:44.730
to some harmonic excitation.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:53.860
And the one I've
chosen to do-- let's

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.300
imagine that I
just-- I'm just going

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:02.900
to put a force, a harmonic
force, on this mass,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.400
and I want the steady
state response.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.300
And you can imagine, if I do it
close to the natural frequency

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.760
of one of the modes, you're
going to get a lot of that,

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.410
but if I do it close to
the natural frequency

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.630
of the other mode,
I can do it too.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:23.485
So let's do the steady state
harmonic excitation problem.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.690
So we're going to
do this problem.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:43.810
F2 of t-- so my generalized
forces are 0 some magnitude

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:47.070
Ft e to the i omega t.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:58.210
And the modal forces
are u transpose F,

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:00.070
and that would be
the calculation

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:12.050
one and 2.2667, and 1, and minus
0.2236-- my two mode shapes

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:16.490
transposed multiplied
by 0 and F2.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:36.000
So that says that q1 is
F2.2667 F2e to the i omega t.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.400
And q2, the modal
force for mode 2,

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:53.180
is this times that-- is minus
0.2236 F2 e to the i omega t.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:57.420
So I've put on just
a force on one mass,

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.560
but it gets distributed in a way
that it'll excite both modes,

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.470
and it'll excite mode one
in an amount 2.2 times F2.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:10.710
And it'll excite mode 2
in an amount minus 0.22.

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.420
So mode 1 is going to
get more excitation

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:19.090
in this particular case because
of the shape of the modes.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.210
The bigger the
modal deflection is

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.282
at the point of
application of the force,

00:47:23.282 --> 00:47:24.740
the more that mode
is going to get.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:38.320
Well, now these gave you
two equations of motion.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:48.100
m1q1 double dot
plus c1q1 dot k1q1

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:59.877
equals, in the case of mode 1,
2.2667 F2 e to the i omega t.

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:01.710
And that's a single
degree of freedom system

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.990
excited by a harmonic force.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.080
We worked that problem.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.070
We know what the
answer looks like.

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:13.740
So for example, the
magnitude of the response q1

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:19.510
is given by the magnitude
of the force q2 times

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:23.900
the magnitude of a transfer
function, which is the response

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:31.380
q1 per unit input force
q1 evaluated at whatever

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.360
frequency I evaluate it at.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.319
So the magnitude of
the response magnitude

00:48:35.319 --> 00:48:36.860
of the modal force
times the transfer

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.010
function, and this
transfer function

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:44.450
is this exactly the
same form as when

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.745
we did just the single degree
of freedom system as x/F.

00:48:47.745 --> 00:48:51.730
That's what I called the
response x over input force F.

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.800
Same thing, where just
now the response is q,

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.510
and the input
force is capital Q.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:04.290
Therefore, that looks
like magnitude of Q--

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.220
and I made a mistake here.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.765
Q1.

00:49:07.765 --> 00:49:21.270
The magnitude of force Q1,
which is this, times 1/k1--

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:27.230
this should look familiar--
1 minus omega squared

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:32.860
over omega 1 squared
squared plus 2 zeta

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:40.400
1 omega over omega 1
quantity squared square root.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.750
So there's that transfer
function expression.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:48.680
At resonance, for example,
all this goes to 0.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.860
Omega over omega 1 goes to 1.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.070
This whole denominator
turns into 1/2 times

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:55.450
the damping ratio, for example.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.540
And Q1 over k1 is
the static deflection

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.750
of the system under the
load-- under a static load

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:06.800
of that large.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.900
So I'll do the problem.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.580
If the excitation
frequency happens

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.990
to be right on the natural
frequency for mode one,

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:28.716
then I can evaluate this at
1 omega over omega 1 is 1,

00:50:28.716 --> 00:50:31.580
and I've worked that out.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:40.820
That says that
magnitude of q1 here--

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:57.360
2.2667F2/k1 times
1 over 2 zeta one.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.270
That's what all
this condenses to.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.560
We know what k1 is.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.940
We know what zeta 1 is.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.430
F2 is the thing
we're specifying.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:13.910
And so zeta 1 for example
is what-- it was 0.044.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:21.500
So you plug in your 0.044 here,
and this whole thing works out

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:26.660
to be-- actually I'll write
down the numbers here--

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:40.620
2.2667F2/k1 is
10984, and not 109.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.120
That's k2.

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:56.350
113.71 times 11.36,
which is 1/2 times zeta.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:01.950
1/0.088 is 11.36.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:16.590
The final analysis--
q1 is 0.227F2.

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.932
So it's just a single degree
of freedom system excited

00:52:18.932 --> 00:52:20.640
by harmonic force,
and you can figure out

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.180
how big its response is.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.830
I could do the same
thing for mode 2.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:29.234
Is mode 2 resonant?

00:52:29.234 --> 00:52:29.734
No.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.690
So this is instructive.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:46.820
The magnitude of
the responsive q2

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.250
is the magnitude of the
force times the magnitude

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:57.416
of the Hq2 per unit input 2q.

00:52:57.416 --> 00:53:05.730
It looks like that, but
this time this is minus

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:17.290
0.2236F2/109.84, which is k2.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:27.250
And then all of the denominator
involving one minus-- and this

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:34.060
will now be omega--
over omega 2 squared

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:44.690
squared plus 2 zeta 2 omega over
omega 2 squared square root.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:46.248
This number here is k2.

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:52.435
The reason I'm going
to this is this one

00:53:52.435 --> 00:53:58.740
is not resonant, and
in fact, what's omega?

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.792
Well, in fact, what
is the excite--

00:54:00.792 --> 00:54:01.750
I started this problem.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:06.350
I said let the excitation
frequency be what?

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:08.130
Natural frequency of mode 1.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:10.970
So omega in this
case equals omega 1.

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:15.090
Therefore, for this
problem, omega over omega 2

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:21.020
is omega 1 over omega 2,
and that's 5.65 something

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.310
over 17 point something.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.830
It's about 1/3.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.850
So we are exciting
the second mode

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.970
at about 1/3 its
natural frequency.

00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:36.259
And so this is 1 minus 1/3
quantity squared and so forth.

00:54:36.259 --> 00:54:37.800
And if I run the
numbers, I just want

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.760
you to see what happens
with the numbers.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:46.780
This turns out to be
0.806, and this turns out

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:53.060
to be-- remember this
is 0.01 something here.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:57.860
This number turns out to be 5
times 10 to the minus fifth.

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.173
That's a really small number.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:07.500
And this whole square
root of this stuff

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:17.220
turns out to be 0.898.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:24.430
And in the end, q2 works out-
the magnitude of q2 works out

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:35.970
to be 0.0023F2.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.300
I did this on purpose.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.580
If, when you're at resonance,
meaning the excitation

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:43.410
frequency is close to
the natural frequency

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:51.140
for any linear vibration system,
then this term is important,

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.900
and it'll be the most important
term in the denominator,

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.190
because this term goes to 0.

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:57.510
It's the only term
in the denominator,

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:58.820
and it's likely be quite small.

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:03.230
That's why it gives you
one over that big response,

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:06.710
but when you're not-- when this
denominator-- if you're not

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:12.610
at resonance, this term
almost always is negligible,

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:14.290
and it's this term
that governs it.

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:17.380
So here you are at 0.8
versus 10 to the minus fifth.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.230
So away from resonance,
this term is important,

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:23.910
and on resonance,
that one is important.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:27.130
And now, how would you
get back to-- we've now

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:31.800
got the two responses.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.990
How do we compute the
total system response?

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.846
How would you do it?

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.220
The modal expansion theorem.

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.020
AUDIENCE: Put it back
into x [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:55.020 --> 00:57:02.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
x equals u cubed.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.790
That's where we started.

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:13.170
And q1, since this is a
harmonic excitation problem,

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:16.550
if the input had been
e to the i omega t,

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:20.430
then the output is some e to the
i omega t minus a phase angle.

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:24.160
So this is going to look
like some q1 amplitude.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:29.710
Say, cosine omega 1t minus
phi 1 but at resonance,

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:32.920
we know the phase
angle is pi over 2.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:39.280
And q2 of t is going
to be the amplitude q2

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:45.080
times some cosine omega 1t--
because that's the excitation

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:48.660
frequency-- minus phi 2.

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:58.260
And remember, each
of these systems--

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:05.620
these transfer functions,
Hq/Q for whichever one

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:10.260
it happens to be
looks like this.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:13.730
Different amounts of damping
give you different heights

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:15.350
of the peak at resonance.

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:20.010
And this is omega over omega i.

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:24.220
So when you're at
resonance, you're at 1.

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.220
So what we've done is we have
a two degree of freedom system.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.420
We're exciting it at the
natural frequency of mode 1.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.587
So it means for mode
1, we're right here.

00:58:34.587 --> 00:58:36.170
Let's say that's
where our damping is,

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.610
so that's going
to be our transfer

00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:41.830
function for that mode, but
drawn on the same figure,

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:46.130
where are we for mode 2?

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:49.370
We're at omega 1 over
omega 2, which is somewhere

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:52.262
in the neighborhood of 0.3.

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:55.450
So we are in here.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:59.600
So this is omega over omega 2.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.500
This is omega over omega 1.

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.100
So down here,
we're at about 0.3.

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:09.070
Here we're at 1.0, so we're at
resonance for one of the modes,

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:12.450
and we're here in what's called
the stiffness controlled region

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.050
for the other mode.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:17.010
This mode-- mode 2 basically
acts like a spring.

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:21.620
The dynamic
amplification is about 1.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:25.140
It just gives you the
static response for mode 2

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.560
and the resonant
response for mode 1.

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.900
I know what I was going
to draw to remind you.

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:44.570
This figure has a phase
diagram that goes with it,

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:50.150
and for lightly damped
systems, it goes from 0 to pi.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:55.780
And at resonance, all
of them cross pi over 2.

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:59.530
When it's a response to a force,
a simple force, at resonance,

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:03.610
the phase angle is pi
over 2, so the response

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:06.760
lags the input by 90 degrees.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.930
When you're down
here in this region,

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.950
the response moves
with the input.

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.730
The phase angle is
basically 0, and up in here

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.620
the phase angle is 180 degrees.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.544
It acts like a driving mass.

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.860
So our two responses
look like that,

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.340
and to get back into
modal coordinates, x1,

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:46.010
x2 is going to look like
u1 q1 of t plus u2 q2 of t.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.770
It's harmonic.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:48.490
Steady state response.

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:50.575
You know the
amplitudes, q1 and q2.

01:00:50.575 --> 01:00:52.540
We figured them out.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:01:06.860
One of them is 2-- q1
turned out to be 0.227F2,

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:18.560
and q2 is 0.0023F2.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:31.470
And this one, point
cosine cosine.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:36.145
So if we do that, if you put
your excitation only on here,

01:01:36.145 --> 01:01:37.895
it's trying to tell
you that mostly you'll

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:44.380
get mode 1, and not much
mode 2, but that's primarily

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:47.130
caused because you chose
to put the excitation

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:52.940
frequency at where?

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.970
The natural frequency
of mode one.

01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:00.530
So if I had made my excitation
here the same place,

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:04.500
but made the frequency close to
the natural frequency of mode

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.440
2, which of the two modes
would have dominated?

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.720
Mode 2.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.608
So I've got another little demo.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:17.585
We're doing well.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.765
Out of necessity, to
do it on the blackboard

01:02:25.765 --> 01:02:28.370
and in relatively
short time, we've

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:35.250
only talked about a two degree
of freedom two rigid body

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.190
system.

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:38.800
This is a continuous system.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.780
It's a taut string.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:46.950
It's your violin string, and
I've put some white tags on it

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:49.075
so that you could see it
against black backgrounds.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.030
Everything that we've learned
about the behavior of this two

01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:58.170
degree of freedom system
will apply to a three,

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.100
or four, or five degree
of freedom system,

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.800
but actually the
basic lessons apply

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.890
to continuous systems, too.

01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:10.940
So the lesson we just learned
is, if you excite a system,

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.740
this has many
natural frequencies.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.930
And in fact, if the
first one is at 1 Hertz,

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:19.430
which this just about is--
maybe a little more than that.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.280
First mode is like that.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.790
Maybe 2 Hertz.

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:24.250
The second mode is twice that.

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.650
Third mode is three times that.

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.350
It happens to be really simple.

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:31.360
So if I put a force-- the
only force in this problem--

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.630
I'm going to do the
analogous problem here.

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:36.890
Harmonic excitation-- I'm going
to do it in one little place

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:41.980
right here, and if I drive this
system at the natural frequency

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.710
of mode 1, what do you see?

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.000
What mode is
dominating response?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.550
Mode 1.

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:55.440
Very, very small
responses of other modes.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.330
So now if I can get the system
to stop shaking, if I drive it

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:08.850
at exactly the same place at
a different natural frequency,

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:11.390
I see 3/2 sine waves there.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.246
So I was driving it at
the natural frequency of?

01:04:14.246 --> 01:04:15.220
AUDIENCE: Mode 3.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:16.750
PROFESSOR: Mode 3.

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:17.890
And there's no mode 1.

01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:20.520
No mode 2.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.085
Now I need a helper.

01:04:22.085 --> 01:04:24.000
Can somebody come
hang onto this for me?

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:32.160
You've got to keep
the tension on it.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.190
So now I'm going to teach
you a really important lesson

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:40.300
about systems exciting systems.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:44.640
The second mode-- I might have
a hard time driving it here.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.787
Let me see if I can get
the second mode going.

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:55.495
There's second mode.

01:04:55.495 --> 01:04:56.900
I has a node right here.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.650
There's a point right
here with no motion.

01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:04.240
If I sit here, and I'm going
to let the system stop--

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.580
if I drive this system at the
second mode natural frequency

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.090
right here, what will happen?

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.922
Pardon?

01:05:16.922 --> 01:05:18.130
AUDIENCE: It would be mode 1.

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.075
PROFESSOR: Maybe [INAUDIBLE] 1.

01:05:20.075 --> 01:05:22.926
But how much mode 2 will I get?

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:33.700
So another lesson here is that
continuous systems have nodes,

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.474
points of no motion,
and the second mode

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:37.890
happens to have a
node right here.

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.580
This point doesn't
move one when it's

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.400
vibrating in the second mode.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.290
And the modal force
looks something

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:47.560
like the generalized
force times a mode shape,

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.880
u transpose F. That's
how we got the-- you have

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.210
to multiply the generalized
external force times the mode

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:59.340
shape to get the modal force.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.070
Well, here's my
generalized force.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:05.670
What's the amplitude
of the mode shape here?

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:06.430
0.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:10.250
F times 0 is 0.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.100
There is just no way
I can get this thing

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.420
to vibrate in the second
mode by driving it at a node,

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.010
and that's just generally true.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:22.750
Take it to the bank
and remember that.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.650
Thank you.

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:28.430
All right.

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:30.380
Something else I wanted to do.

01:06:34.244 --> 01:06:34.910
I need you back.

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:48.380
So when you give a system
an initial deflection,

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.780
because when we want to
get initial conditions,

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:56.200
we said that the equivalent
modal initial conditions were

01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:00.740
u inverse times the u inverse
times to the initial conditions

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.750
in generalized coordinates.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.990
So for a continuous
system, this thing

01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:07.980
has mode shapes that look
like sine and pi x over l.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.100
Those are the mode shapes.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.620
And if I take this
thing and grab it

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.634
about in the middle,
wherever that node was,

01:07:14.634 --> 01:07:16.050
and give it an
initial deflection,

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:17.424
the shape that
initial deflection

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:18.940
is kind of a triangle.

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.310
You've all had Fourier series.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.530
This a triangular shape.

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:30.940
Could you express this shape
as a Fourier sine series?

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.367
Sure.

01:07:32.367 --> 01:07:34.700
And it just happens that sine
waves are the mode shapes.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.970
So you would be coming
up-- the Fourier

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:40.660
coefficients are
the modal amplitudes

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.240
of n initial conditions.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.040
And so whatever the Fourier
coefficients for this are

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.070
are the modal amplitudes
for each of the modes.

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.550
So which mode do
you think is going

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:54.020
to-- which Fourier
sign component is going

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.654
to be largest in this one?

01:07:58.438 --> 01:07:59.370
AUDIENCE: Mode 1?

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:00.230
PROFESSOR: Mode 1.

01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:02.890
By the way, all even
numbered modes would be 0

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:04.560
because they're asymmetric.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.450
This is a symmetrically
shaped pulse.

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:12.920
The modal initial conditions
for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are 0.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:17.350
You will get non-zero Fourier
coefficients for 1, 3, 5, 7.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:18.950
The biggest one is mode 1.

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:22.640
So what do you expect to
see if I let go of this?

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.939
Vibration primarily at?

01:08:23.939 --> 01:08:24.855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.020
PROFESSOR: And a little
bit of some others.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.145
Now, let's say they all
had about the same damping.

01:08:34.145 --> 01:08:36.927
Let's say they all
had 10% damping.

01:08:36.927 --> 01:08:37.510
No, excuse me.

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:38.779
All had 1% damping.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:40.850
That means they'll go
through about 10 cycles

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:44.010
to decay to halfway.

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:48.130
So if they all have
the same damping,

01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:50.180
even if there are several
other modes present,

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.069
which ones are going
to last longer in time?

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:58.540
Mode 1, because it takes
just longer in time

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.979
to get to 10 cycles.

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:04.210
The other modes
get there quicker.

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:07.979
If you take a guitar string
and plunk it, or a violin,

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:10.069
or a piano, you'll
hear the basic tone.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:13.122
And what makes it sound nice,
you have those nice overtones,

01:09:13.122 --> 01:09:15.580
but if you listen carefully,
the overtones die out usually,

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.580
and you're left with the
fundamental at the end.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:20.560
If you smack a piano
key hard, you'll

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.460
get an interesting
sound at the beginning,

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.740
and then it'll mellow out.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.180
And you'll hear just a
pure tone at the end,

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.569
and that's because the higher
frequencies damp out quicker

01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:34.100
because they get in more
cycles per unit of time.

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.985
That's the other quick lesson.

01:09:36.985 --> 01:09:38.990
I have one thing I
want to explain to you

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:43.920
which will help maybe a little
conceptual understanding

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.609
about-- this came up in
a homework discussion--

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:51.800
and that is just a note
about stiffness matrices.

01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:12.280
There's a really fast easy way
to assemble stiffness matrices.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:26.950
So here's a three mass system
and a spring, spring, spring.

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:33.610
And I'm going to put a
spring here and one here.

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:50.410
k1, k2, k3, k4,
k5, and k6-- and I

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.345
want to get my stiffness matrix.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.230
The stiffness matrix-- this is a
three degree of freedom system.

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:04.130
It'll be a 3 by 3, and
it'll have elements up here,

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:26.230
which I'll call k11, k12,
k13, k21, k23, k31, k22,

01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:28.260
and so forth.

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:32.148
So what's the new
meaning of kij?

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:38.660
So ki11-- i as 1.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.151
J is 1.

01:11:41.151 --> 01:11:43.150
If you can understand the
interpretation of what

01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:45.620
a stiffness matrix
is, it'll help

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:49.440
you make it much easier
for you to find them.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:12:07.060
So kij is the
force required at i

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:21.070
due to a unit deflection
at j due to sounds

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.830
kind of like a causal thing.

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:25.520
I don't quite mean that, but
so let's think about this.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.630
What's k11?

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:33.480
So k11 is the force required
at 1 per unit deflection at 1.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:39.520
So if I take this system and
I make it move over one unit,

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:45.100
and the other-- this is now
x1 here, by the way. x1,

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.160
x2, x300 so x2 and x3 are 0.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.490
I do this one a time.

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:52.700
I move this over one unit.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.140
How much force does it
take to make that happen?

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:56.829
A real system.

01:12:56.829 --> 01:12:57.620
You're grabbing it.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.010
You're pulling it over one unit.

01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:01.610
You're making some springs move.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:04.140
How much force does it
take to move that one one

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.339
unit holding these still?

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:14.150
Well, you're going to-- one,
force on a spring is kx.

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:17.560
If x is one, the force for
trying to stretch this spring

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.700
is k1 times 1.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.350
The force required to push
on that spring as k5 times

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:31.190
5-- k5 times 1. k2 times one.

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:35.800
The k11, this first
element, is the sum

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.030
of all of the springs
connected to it.

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:44.980
k1 plus k2 plus k5.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:45.860
So how about k12?

01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:57.620
k12 is the force required at
1-- actually, let me do k21.

01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:00.110
Make a little more
sense-- is the force

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:08.671
required at 2, because I've
moved the system one unit at 1.

01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:10.920
That's what the problem--
that's this thing I've done.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.990
I've moved this one unit.

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.080
In order to keep
this one from moving,

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.914
do I have to apply force to it?

01:14:17.914 --> 01:14:20.349
How big?

01:14:20.349 --> 01:14:22.300
AUDIENCE: k2.

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:25.890
PROFESSOR: k2 or minus k2?

01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:28.090
This thing is pushing,
going over one unit.

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.450
It compresses that spring.

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:31.310
It's pushing on this thing.

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:32.640
I say it cannot move.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.150
What do I have to do?

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:42.000
Push back minus k2, and you
can go through-- and then how

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.040
about number 3?

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:50.090
What's the force required at 3
because I've moved the one at 1

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:52.610
by 1 unit?

01:14:52.610 --> 01:14:53.970
Move this over.

01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:56.480
Are there any springs
connected to mass 3 that

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.106
are affected by that motion?

01:14:58.106 --> 01:14:58.980
AUDIENCE: k5.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.905
PROFESSOR: k5, and it pushes
on it through that spring,

01:15:01.905 --> 01:15:15.300
so I have to resist by--
so k31 equals minus k5.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:16.340
So now then you go on.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.715
If you want to
get the next ones,

01:15:17.715 --> 01:15:19.110
OK, you go to the next system.

01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:20.460
This is now can't move.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.480
This can't move.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.820
We're going to let this
be unit deflection.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:26.530
So unit deflection at
two, add up the springs.

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:32.320
k2 plus k3 plus k6--
and that's all there is.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:41.080
So k22, k2 plus k3
plus k6, and then you

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.000
go through all the
ones that it affects,

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.870
and you'll get
minus this and that.

01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:48.290
So that's the meaning.

01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:50.600
Each of the elements of
that stiffness matrix

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.570
have that meaning to it.

01:15:52.570 --> 01:16:10.310
And to give this closure,
we have equation of motion,

01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:14.950
but the stiffness matrices also
applies to the statics problem.

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:22.120
So you have mx double dot
plus cx dot plus kx equals

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.404
F. What if I only want
to do a statics problem?

01:16:25.404 --> 01:16:27.070
I'm going to put a
static force on here,

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:29.780
and I want to know
the deflections,

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.300
or I'm going to
cause deflections,

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.750
and I want to know what
force it takes to do it.

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:38.110
Well, the static problems--
let this be 0, this be 0.

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:44.840
And it says kx equals F.
So in this three degree

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.750
of freedom system, what
forces are required to cause

01:16:49.750 --> 01:17:00.560
the deflection 0, 0, 1.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.280
I want to deflect it one
unit on the third mass only.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.730
What forces do I apply it to
the system to make it happen?

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:14.860
Well, you just multiply it out.

01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:19.150
This is F1, F2, F3.

01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:22.850
So it'll only be this one.

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:24.760
This times this, this, and this.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.330
The only ones that matter
are these three here,

01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:37.150
and this will end up
being k31 times 1.

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:44.940
This will be k-- I guess
I've got to round-- 13.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:51.275
And we get 21, 22, 23, k33.

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:56.710
Those are the three
forces required.

01:17:56.710 --> 01:18:01.230
You put on those forces.

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.910
Force is equal to these amounts.

01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:06.262
You will get that deflection.

01:18:06.262 --> 01:18:07.470
So that's just a little help.

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:10.400
That gives you a little
insight as to what

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.000
stiffness matrices mean.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.720
So you can do them
by inspection.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.192
Once you understand that, you
can actually just fill them

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:21.890
in by inspection, just by
doing unit displacements

01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:25.360
at each place and
adding up the forces.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.112
See you on Thursday.
