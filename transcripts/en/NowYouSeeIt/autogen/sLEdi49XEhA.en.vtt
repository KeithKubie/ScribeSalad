00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.300
 What is important about the dinner scene? Why does the director spend his time on such a simple matter? 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.240
 This will be the focus of our discussion today. Welcome to Now You See it 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 Don't interrupt me. 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.840
 I think the dinner scene is one of the most powerful and revealing scenes in the movie. 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.540
 It’s not just about people eating more, but about communicating. 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.380
 And the communication mentioned refers to the action of getting along at the table. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.940
 The director uses the dinner scene to reveal the relationship between each character. How do they get along with each other, or can’t 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.480
 But I think there is more content at the same time we are going to know the typical dinner "program" 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.000
 You eat, talk about your day, talk about a few jokes and call it the night. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 And when the dinner "program" in the movie has a problem, we will pay special attention because we are used to the typical "program". 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.400
 That's why the dinner scene has many potential possibilities. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 Whether it is humor 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.320
 Or dramatic 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.700
 Let's take a look at the three steps of the dinner scene: eating, conflicts and accidents 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.660
 Whether you are a contract killer or a god, you need to eat and eat to make you like a personal class. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.760
 Eating can make characters appear like our general humanity while allowing us to enter their world, and then create links 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.700
 We can't be associated with the role of stealing diamonds or being shot but can link a debate on the table. 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.720
 Dinner scenes can make us resonate with the characters 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 Tarantino uses the dinner scene in the movie "Scrambled" and "Black Chasing Order" to bring us into the movie world. 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.120
 Just when we see that the character is eating happily 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.360
 Suddenly shooting and robbing the restaurant gave us more shock, because we just saw who they are. 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.700
 Human beings, eating at the same human beings 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.000
 When people get together to eat, they should be in harmony. 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.360
 However, things are not always the case. Instead, the dinner scene is the perfect way to show conflicts. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.220
 When people are angry and leave 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.400
 Break the plate 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 Or being isolated 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 This reveals a lot of information about the role rather than using "saying" 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.200
 Therefore, a successful typical dinner "procedure" cannot convey more information. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.280
 Dinner is not always smooth in real life, not even in movies. 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.799
 Since we understand how this "program" may be 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.880
 It would be more interesting when things didn’t happen as expected. 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.500
 Or more dramatic 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.840
 From the familiar dinner scene to the alien shape from someone’s chest 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.080
 Increased fear 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.460
 If dinner is just "dinner", it will be very boring. 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.219
 The director will not waste any shots, such as a simple dinner scene without conveying other important information. 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.000
 That's why I don't need to use "say" for movie movies. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.700
 It doesn't need to say "These two are not good" or "This person is just like you and me." 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.800
 It can be used to "play" 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.940
 Use "play" instead of "speak" to make the film a new level 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.940
 And the dinner scene can be very brilliant. 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360
 Thank you for watching
