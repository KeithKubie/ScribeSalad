00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.632
As we saw in the last video, 
in 1942

00:00:02.632 --> 00:00:06.053
we start to see the tide turn 
in the Pacific.

00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:07.182
Just as reminder -

00:00:07.182 --> 00:00:08.967
In December of 1941,

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.761
you have the Japanese attack 
of Pearl Harbor

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:13.130
which brings the United States
into World War II.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.850
And as we get into 1942,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.846
you have the Doolittle Raid
on the mainland of Japan

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:21.436
which is a psychological victory
for America and the allies.

00:00:21.597 --> 00:00:25.126
Then you have the Battle of Coral Sea
and then Midway.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.211
Midway in particular was a huge

00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:29.249
-- I shouldn´t put red there,
I should leave it blue --

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.950
was a huge success
for the American Navy,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.314
followed by Guadalcanal

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:39.834
after which the U.S.
is able to go on the offensive

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:41.091
against the Japanese.

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:45.287
We see a significant turning of the tide
in 1942 in the Pacific.

00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:48.684
And it also turns out 
to be the case in Europe

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:53.238
that we see a turning of the tide
in 1942.

00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:55.928
Just as Guadalcanal is occuring,

00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.243
you might remember

00:00:57.243 --> 00:01:04.571
that in 1941 Hitler and the Nazis decided
they want to attack the Soviet Union,

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.177
probably not a good idea,
they going to stretch themselves thin,

00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:12.117
but they do so anyway.

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:18.056
The Siege of Leningrad 
starts in 1941,

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:22.466
and then in 1942 by August,
they are able to reach Stalingrad,

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.140
which is right about here.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.313
And Stalingrad,
it´s now called Volgograd,

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:32.541
is right about there
if the map extended over there.

00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:37.729
This is a major series of battles
in World War II.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.094
Movies are made about Stalingrad,
incredibly bloody.

00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:46.726
Incredibly -- if you look at the pictures

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:53.366
of the city of Stalingrad 
after the battles there,

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:56.203
the city is essentially in ruins.

00:01:56.203 --> 00:02:05.409
But the battles in Stalingrad
start in August of 1942

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.511
and they continue for several months,
going up to February of 1943.

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.092
But this marks the turning point
for Hitler.

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:14.073
He´s getting bogged down
in Leningrad,

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:15.910
he´s getting bogged down
in Stalingrad,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.543
eventually gets defeated in Stalingrad
in early 1943.

00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:22.758
And his armies 
are really spread thin.

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:30.196
Stalingrad is a hugely important event

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:32.356
or series of events
in World War II.

00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:34.198
And let´s just be clear
where we are right now.

00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:40.202
Stalingrad commences in August of 1942.

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:42.003
And just to frame it in your mind -

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.342
relativ to the Pacific Theater,

00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:46.923
this is right around
- plus or minus a few weeks -

00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:49.245
of when Guadalcanal was going on,

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:53.385
conflict between the Japanese
and the American navies.

00:02:53.385 --> 00:03:00.326
You have these incredibly 
bloody series of battles at Stalingrad.

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:02.343
Then in October,

00:03:02.343 --> 00:03:04.458
we´ve been talking about this
back and forth,

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:05.398
in North Africa

00:03:05.398 --> 00:03:06.006
and some people are:

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.890
"Why are they even
worried about North Africa?"

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.599
And I should have mentioned
this earlier,

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.619
but we have to remember
that there is somewhat strategic here

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.189
called the Suez Canal.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.410
Why is the Suez Canal strategic?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.305
It connects the Mediterranean
with the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:24.088
You don`t have to go 
all the way around Africa

00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:27.427
to go from Europe
to the Indian Ocean.

00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:34.893
It`s an incredibly strategic passage
or way to travel by sea

00:03:34.893 --> 00:03:40.293
between -- I guess for the world -- 
but especially between Europe and Asia.

00:03:40.293 --> 00:03:41.162
You can imagine,

00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:44.143
the British were very keen
on protecting the Suez Canal

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:48.107
and the axies would have loved
to get control of the Suez Canal.

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:49.157
Let me write this here.

00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:54.369
This right over here
is the Suez Canal.

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.929
And as we go into October,

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.302
this is Stalingrad commences
right over here.

00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:04.253
And as we go into October,

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:09.819
the British are able to defeat or
start to deafeat the axies

00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:11.702
and then push them back.

00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:16.490
This eventually leads to the British
being able to go all the way to Tunisia.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.071
This is the final back- and-forth-blow

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:23.436
that starts to secure victory
for the allies in North Africa.

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:28.939
And at the same time
that this is commencing in October,

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:34.869
you have other allied forces,
starting to arrive in Morroco and Algeria.

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:40.938
Forces from the U.S.
are arriving in Morroco,

00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:43.057
and forces from the U.K.,
from Great Britain,

00:04:43.057 --> 00:04:47.577
are arriving in Algeria.

00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:50.952
This is going to give the allies
control of North Africa,

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:56.854
from which they can now
mount assaults onto the European mainland,

00:04:56.854 --> 00:04:59.596
which we will see
in the next series of videos.

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:02.927
Definitely the tide is turning,

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:06.501
and the allies are starting
to be able to go on the offensive

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:09.124
both in the Pacific
and the European Theater.
