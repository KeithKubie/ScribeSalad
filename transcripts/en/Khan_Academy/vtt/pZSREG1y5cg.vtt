00:00:00.802 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Things in the universe

00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.001
don't just shift around,

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.017
they also rotate.

00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:07.664
And so what we're going
to do in this video

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:12.035
is start to think about
rotations and rotational motion.

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:14.439
And I'm intentionally
continuing to spin this

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.896
because I find it hypnotic.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:17.933
But the question is,

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.909
well, how do we start to
quantify these things,

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:21.453
measure them, and describe them

00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:23.965
so that we can predict what will happen?

00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:28.629
Well, what if we introduce a
notion of angular displacement?

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:31.826
We have displacement, which
is a shift in position.

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:34.153
But what if you have a change in angle?

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:35.729
That seems like it would
describe something.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:39.163
For example, right here, my
angle would be zero radians.

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:42.205
And then if I move counterclockwise

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.521
pi over two radians,

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.357
now my angle is pi over two.

00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:47.774
So why not define

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.178
going from there to there

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:55.646
as an angular displacement
of pi over two radians?

00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:58.253
And if I were to displace
by pi over two again,

00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:00.003
I would go over here.

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:03.232
And if I were to go negative pi radians,

00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:05.419
well, that would be just like that.

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:07.948
Negative pi over two from there

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:10.743
would get me right over there.

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:13.137
That seems like a fairly intuitive thing.

00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:17.197
And you might be saying y is
positive counterclockwise,

00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:19.502
and y is negative clockwise?

00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:21.185
Well, that just tends
to be the conventions

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:23.052
that we use for angles.

00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:23.885
So there you have it.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:25.631
We've already built our foundation

00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:28.385
for describing rotational motion.

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:32.730
We could have an idea
of angular displacement,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.480
angular displacement,

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.017
which we can define more formally

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:40.666
just the way we just described it.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.239
We could say, well, look,

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.788
this is going to be our change in angle,

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:47.337
so change in, Greek letter delta,

00:01:47.337 --> 00:01:49.980
and angle, we use the Greek letter theta,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.585
which we've been using since
geometry or trigonometry class.

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:56.730
And so our angular
displacement you can define as

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.817
your final angle minus your initial angle.

00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:03.354
And we could say that
this is a vector quantity

00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:06.383
because you can either
go counterclockwise,

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:09.880
in which case this is going
to be a positive quantity.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.829
Or you could go clockwise,

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.079
in which case this is going
to be a negative quantity.

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.941
Well, that's all nice and fair,

00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:19.102
but I know what some of you are thinking.

00:02:19.102 --> 00:02:23.083
It's nice to be able to see how
much your angle has changed,

00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:26.378
but isn't it much more
interesting to also describe

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:28.413
how fast that angle is changing?

00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:31.477
For example, here it's
changing quite slowly.

00:02:31.477 --> 00:02:34.020
Let's say it takes us three seconds

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.070
to have an angular displacement of two pi.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.237
One Mississippi, two
Mississippi, three Mississippi.

00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:43.987
That feels very different,

00:02:43.987 --> 00:02:46.635
a lot slower than if I
did that in one second.

00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:49.971
One Mississippi, two Mississippi.

00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.299
So what if we were to have something

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.951
that would describe our
rate of change of angle?

00:02:56.951 --> 00:02:59.227
Well, we could borrow some terminology

00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:00.561
that we've used in the past.

00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:02.394
Instead of calling that velocity,

00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:05.160
we could call that angular velocity,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.993
angular

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:07.946
velocity.

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:10.439
And how would you define that?

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.505
Pause this video, think about that.

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:16.804
Well, angular velocity, you
could just say that is our

00:03:16.804 --> 00:03:18.054
change in angle

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:22.360
over a certain amount of time.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.201
If I change two pi radians

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:26.818
in one second,

00:03:26.818 --> 00:03:28.799
well, that's going to be a lot slower

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.185
than if I change two pi
radians in half a second.

00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:35.046
And the letter we use
for angular velocity,

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:38.183
the convention, is the Greek letter omega,

00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:41.141
which looks like a fancy lowercase w.

00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.591
Or at least this right over
here is the lowercase omega,

00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:46.628
which looks like a fancy lowercase w,

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:49.916
which we use for angular velocity.

00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:51.866
And this, too, is a vector quantity

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:56.033
because it's measuring a rate
of another vector quantity.

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.321
And so just to hit the point home,

00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:03.014
just to review it all, make
it all jell in your mind,

00:04:03.014 --> 00:04:04.375
angular displacement,

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:07.407
it's nothing more than
our change in angle.

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:11.332
If our change in angle is
counterclockwise, like this,

00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:12.408
it's going to be positive.

00:04:12.408 --> 00:04:13.432
So let's say,

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:15.209
so an angular displacement,
we might start here.

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.024
We don't always start at zero radians.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.756
So let's say we start at pi over two.

00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:20.896
An angular displacement of pi over four

00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:22.705
would take us right over there.

00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:24.419
An angular displacement from there

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.835
of negative pi over two,

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:28.418
might take us right over there.

00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:31.825
And if we cared about angular velocity,

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:34.882
if we said, hey, we are going to go

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:37.602
pi radians every second,

00:04:37.602 --> 00:04:39.016
well, then that would be like this.

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:41.973
It would be one second, two seconds,

00:04:41.973 --> 00:04:44.954
three seconds, four seconds.

00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:47.469
If we were to say we'd do
two pi radians every second,

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.019
then that would be twice as fast

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:51.120
in terms of angular velocity.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.765
One Mississippi, two
Mississippi, three Mississippi,

00:04:54.765 --> 00:04:58.432
four Mississippi, five Mississippi.

00:04:58.432 --> 00:04:59.634
So there you have it.

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:00.960
And in the next few videos

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.391
and in the practice
exercise on Khan Academy,

00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:06.556
we will get even more
familiar with these ideas

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.510
and see how powerful they are

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.593
for describing rotational
motion in the universe.
