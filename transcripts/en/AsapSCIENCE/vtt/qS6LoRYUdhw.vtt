00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.460
Death by drug overdose has been on the rise
in the US, with a 2.2-fold increase from 2002

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160
to 2015.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.500
But what is the most dangerous drug in the
world? [Illustrated by Kurzgesagt.]

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500
If we’re simply talking about the most lethal substances, scientists use something called

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.640
the “median lethal dose” or LD50 which
measures how much of a substance is required

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.520
to kill half the members of a tested population.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.060
So something like coffee requires around 13g
to kill a 70kg person, while the venom of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.800
an Inland Taipan snake requires much less,
with only 0.00175g.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.520
Using this method, the most deadly substance
on Earth?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.329
Botulinum Toxin...or Botox.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.950
Oral ingestion would require only 0.00000007g
to kill a 70kg person.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.640
However, ‘most dangerous’ doesn’t always
mean ‘most lethal’.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.200
In the UK, a group of experts decided to look
at how much “harm” the most common recreational

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.859
drugs cause using 16 parameters, including
types of physical, psychological and social harm.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.130
For example, a drug may cause physical damage
but not be lethal, it could cause you to become

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.730
completely dependent, it can be more likely
to cause loss of relationships, or decreased

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.360
mental functioning; and these are all forms
of ‘harm’.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.390
Using these criteria, they concluded that
the most dangerous drug to an individual is heroin.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
Heroin can be injected, snorted, or smoked,
and enters the brain rapidly, particularly

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.720
when injected into the bloodstream.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.430
Here, it attaches to opioid receptors, creating
a surge of pleasurable sensations.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.130
It’s also highly addictive, with intense
withdrawal symptoms that begin within hours

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.540
of a hit, including insomnia, cold flashes,
muscle and bone pain, nausea and vomiting.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.890
Receptors in the brainstem are also affected,
impacting important physiological processes

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.080
such as breathing and blood pressure.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.790
Which is why overdosing causes breathing to
slow or stop entirely, leading to the accumulation

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.790
of CO2 in the blood and ultimately death.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.100
And since heroin is unregulated, it is especially
difficult for users to know the strength of

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.720
the dose, making the risk of OD-ing high.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.140
Additionally, the drug can be mixed with other
compounds, like Fentanyl, making it even more

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.140
dangerous.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.959
Fentanyl, like heroin, is an opiate but is
50-100 times as strong because it is very

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.710
lipophilic - meaning it penetrates our fatty
brain more easily.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.489
And in terms of lethality alone, it is much
more dangerous than heroin to users.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.750
It was initially used as a prescription pain
reliever but because of its addictiveness,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.489
it was mostly used in end of life cases.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.680
It has since emerged as a recreational drug,
where the number of reported fentanyl related

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.850
overdoses has increased 7X from 2012 to 2014
in the US, and continues to see more widespread

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.159
use worldwide.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.480
But there is an even more dangerous drug!

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.989
Though crack cocaine and methamphetamine top
the list of harm to an individual just after

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.099
heroin, finding the most dangerous drug overall
involved studying 20 different popular drugs,

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.939
and also looking at the harm they place on
others.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.209
This includes the physical and psychological
harm, crime, degradation to families and communities,

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.760
and economic costs - and in the end it turns
out the most dangerous drug in the world is…

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.760
alcohol.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.560
To ensure this wasn’t simply a UK phenomenon,
a European group attempted the same process

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
putting more emphasis on individual harm and
less on economic harm.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.079
And even with the different weightings the
two groups found largely the same result.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.610
A large contributor to the danger of alcohol
is its wide use.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.620
The majority of the world does drink (61.7%),
and drink a lot, with an average of 17 litres

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.800
of pure alcohol consumed per person per year.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.069
The World Health Organization found 3.3 million
deaths worldwide were caused by dangerous

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.329
alcohol consumption in 2012, meaning alcohol
kills 1 person every 10 seconds.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.640
But experts don’t recommend a prohibition
stance on alcohol.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.739
By all accounts, the war on drugs has been
deemed a failure, and nations who have stepped

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.260
away from hardline policies and implemented
decriminalization, harm reduction and education,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.560
have seen significant declines of drug abuse.
