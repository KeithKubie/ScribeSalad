00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939
cybersecurity is a unique challenge

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949
cybersecurity is a unique challenge
 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.710
cybersecurity is a unique challenge
today because one we are so utterly

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720
today because one we are so utterly
 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.450
today because one we are so utterly
dependent upon our digital

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460
dependent upon our digital
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.579
dependent upon our digital
communications and our digital control

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
communications and our digital control
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.900
communications and our digital control
of things and so it's going to become

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
of things and so it's going to become
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.480
of things and so it's going to become
ever more essential that we have the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
ever more essential that we have the
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.280
ever more essential that we have the
ability to provide security that we're

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290
ability to provide security that we're
 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.670
ability to provide security that we're
confident in the challenge is if we were

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
confident in the challenge is if we were
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240
confident in the challenge is if we were
against dr. know or mr. big in a cave

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
against dr. know or mr. big in a cave
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.460
against dr. know or mr. big in a cave
somewhere you could understand the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
somewhere you could understand the
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.290
somewhere you could understand the
threat and you could sort of limit the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
threat and you could sort of limit the
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.750
threat and you could sort of limit the
threat and the threat would have a

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760
threat and the threat would have a
 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.070
threat and the threat would have a
predictable limitation and what they

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
predictable limitation and what they
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.929
predictable limitation and what they
could do they'd have to pick an avenue

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
could do they'd have to pick an avenue
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.429
could do they'd have to pick an avenue
of approach and they'd have to go at

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
of approach and they'd have to go at
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.659
of approach and they'd have to go at
that Avenue of approach because they

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
that Avenue of approach because they
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.370
that Avenue of approach because they
can't do all things at all times

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
can't do all things at all times
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380
can't do all things at all times
the problem with cybersecurity that's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
the problem with cybersecurity that's
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.840
the problem with cybersecurity that's
not the threat there are some entities

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
not the threat there are some entities
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.639
not the threat there are some entities
like that there's some state sponsored

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
like that there's some state sponsored
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.319
like that there's some state sponsored
entities that are focused on certain

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
entities that are focused on certain
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.250
entities that are focused on certain
things but the barrier to entry into the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
things but the barrier to entry into the
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.740
things but the barrier to entry into the
cyber world is very low you can get in

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
cyber world is very low you can get in
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.299
cyber world is very low you can get in

your basement in your boxer shorts and
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700
your basement in your boxer shorts and
you can have a computer and you can get

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
you can have a computer and you can get
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.069
you can have a computer and you can get
into the game and it's sort of the idea

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
into the game and it's sort of the idea
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.410
into the game and it's sort of the idea

keyboards somebody's going to create a
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.410
keyboards somebody's going to create a
cyber security challenge and so and it's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
cyber security challenge and so and it's
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.899
cyber security challenge and so and it's
constantly morphing and adapting whereas

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
constantly morphing and adapting whereas
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760
constantly morphing and adapting whereas
the cyber security requirement is to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
the cyber security requirement is to
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219
the cyber security requirement is to
protect things so you essentially have

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
protect things so you essentially have
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.469
protect things so you essentially have
to protect everything that you value all

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
to protect everything that you value all
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.490
to protect everything that you value all
the time

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
the time
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440
the time
the people who want to attack that can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
the people who want to attack that can
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450
the people who want to attack that can
attack at their choosing wherever they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
attack at their choosing wherever they
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.020
attack at their choosing wherever they
want and constantly change their attacks

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030
want and constantly change their attacks
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.760
want and constantly change their attacks
constantly just like water goes against

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
constantly just like water goes against
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.429
constantly just like water goes against
a dam it just goes until it finds the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
a dam it just goes until it finds the
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560
a dam it just goes until it finds the
weakest point at some point something

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
weakest point at some point something
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.980
weakest point at some point something
happens technology changes human error

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990
happens technology changes human error
 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.810
happens technology changes human error
technological glitch or whatever there's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
technological glitch or whatever there's
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.490
technological glitch or whatever there's
a good likelihood that they'll get in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
a good likelihood that they'll get in
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.609
a good likelihood that they'll get in
and so if you think about the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
and so if you think about the
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.230
and so if you think about the
cybersecurity problem the first thing I

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
cybersecurity problem the first thing I
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.969
cybersecurity problem the first thing I
don't think will work is the Maginot

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
don't think will work is the Maginot
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:41.359
don't think will work is the Maginot
Line

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369
Line
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.340
Line
you know the Maginot Line was created by

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
you know the Maginot Line was created by
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.190
you know the Maginot Line was created by
the French in the 1930s to prevent the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
the French in the 1930s to prevent the
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260
the French in the 1930s to prevent the
Germans from doing a repeat of the First

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
Germans from doing a repeat of the First
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.850
Germans from doing a repeat of the First
World War and invading France from

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
World War and invading France from
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.700
World War and invading France from
Germany people think of it now is the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
Germany people think of it now is the
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.770
Germany people think of it now is the
stupidest thing ever built but it's not

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
stupidest thing ever built but it's not
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.990
stupidest thing ever built but it's not
really correct because the Maginot Line

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
really correct because the Maginot Line
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.270
really correct because the Maginot Line
actually worked the Germans did not

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
actually worked the Germans did not
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.580
actually worked the Germans did not
invade across the German French border

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
invade across the German French border
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.499
invade across the German French border
now the fact is they went through

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
now the fact is they went through
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.630
now the fact is they went through
Belgium they still got into France and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
Belgium they still got into France and
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.419
Belgium they still got into France and
conquered France in the summer 1940 so I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
conquered France in the summer 1940 so I
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.070
conquered France in the summer 1940 so I
think the lesson to be learned is there

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
think the lesson to be learned is there
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.280
think the lesson to be learned is there
have to be defensive things set up as

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
have to be defensive things set up as
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.760
have to be defensive things set up as
best

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
best
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.640
best
we can for cybersecurity but it's gonna

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
we can for cybersecurity but it's gonna
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.720
we can for cybersecurity but it's gonna
have to be this constantly adapting

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
have to be this constantly adapting
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.880
have to be this constantly adapting
constantly morphing defense-in-depth

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
constantly morphing defense-in-depth
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.760
constantly morphing defense-in-depth
with some offense to with going out and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
with some offense to with going out and
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.110
with some offense to with going out and
figuring out where the threats are

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120
figuring out where the threats are
 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.720
figuring out where the threats are
arising and that that defense in depth

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730
arising and that that defense in depth
 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.090
arising and that that defense in depth
means that you can't have one line the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
means that you can't have one line the
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.890
means that you can't have one line the
government can't put a big wall up and

government can't put a big wall up and
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.200
government can't put a big wall up and
everybody hides behind it nor do we want

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210
everybody hides behind it nor do we want

each organization each commercial firm
or government organization to be an

have to get a network to defense where

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370
have to get a network to defense where
 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.250
have to get a network to defense where
every time something happens and we

every time something happens and we
learn from it the entire network learns

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610
learn from it the entire network learns
 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.500
learn from it the entire network learns
immediately we're gonna have to have

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
immediately we're gonna have to have
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.140
immediately we're gonna have to have
that kind of speed because there will be

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
that kind of speed because there will be
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.270
that kind of speed because there will be
breaches there will be mistakes but the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
breaches there will be mistakes but the
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.010
breaches there will be mistakes but the
organiz organized UM's got to learn it's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020
organiz organized UM's got to learn it's
 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.510
organiz organized UM's got to learn it's
gonna have to be a lot like the human

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520
gonna have to be a lot like the human
 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.760
gonna have to be a lot like the human
immune system the human immune system is

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770
immune system the human immune system is
 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.850
immune system the human immune system is
extraordinary because about 10,000 times

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860
extraordinary because about 10,000 times
 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.280
extraordinary because about 10,000 times
a day it gets attacked by something that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
a day it gets attacked by something that
 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.650
a day it gets attacked by something that
could hurt the human body but as it

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660
could hurt the human body but as it
 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.170
could hurt the human body but as it
responds and it sends out you know and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180
responds and it sends out you know and
 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.600
responds and it sends out you know and
antibodies to it it does it and it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610
antibodies to it it does it and it
 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.490
antibodies to it it does it and it
learns from that and so if it has a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500
learns from that and so if it has a
 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.130
learns from that and so if it has a
breach one time it actually builds up

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140
breach one time it actually builds up
 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.740
breach one time it actually builds up
antibodies against that challenge and

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750
antibodies against that challenge and
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.180
antibodies against that challenge and
has them at the ready for the next time

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
has them at the ready for the next time
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.220
has them at the ready for the next time
that's how we build up immunity to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
that's how we build up immunity to
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.140
that's how we build up immunity to
things and I think the human immune

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
things and I think the human immune
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.030
things and I think the human immune
system is the way our cyber defense is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040
system is the way our cyber defense is
 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.460
system is the way our cyber defense is
going to have to be which means it it

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
going to have to be which means it it
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.430
going to have to be which means it it
has to be integrated

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440
has to be integrated
 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.500
