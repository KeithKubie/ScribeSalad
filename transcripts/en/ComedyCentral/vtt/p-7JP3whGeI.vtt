00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:03.436
- You try to be a good employee.

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.270
You show up, you
sit at your desk,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.872
you move things around on it,

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:08.841
you update your screensaver,

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:10.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
you finally find
the nearest printer.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.445 align:start size:88% position:13%
But sometimes it's
still all just too much.

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:16.215
So here's a tip, leave early.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.284 line:0%
Leaving early, while
it sounds challenging,

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.053
is actually really easy and
great for your mental health.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.455 line:0%
Here's the first thing you do.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.924 align:start position:0% line:0%
Create an event in your
calendar for the last half hour

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.459 line:0%
of the day that you're
supposed to be there.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.894 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Now I have to
invite some people.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.762 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I'm gonna go with
this list of interns

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.297 line:0%
who don't work here anymore.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.733 line:0%
I'm also gonna invite
an actual employee,

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.269 line:0%
Peter Vietz, who will
get an email about it

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.205 align:start position:0%
and then email me saying he
didn't know there was a meeting

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.540 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I'll say, "Sorry, I
looped you in accidentally."

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.276 line:0%
Now, at the same
time I'm gonna book

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:45.077 line:0%
a conference room on
the seventh floor.

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:46.545 line:0%
There are never any
conference rooms

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.080 line:0%
on the seventh floor available.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.582 align:start size:97% position:3%
So that means Dan M, who works
in conference room booking,

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:52.251
is gonna email me saying that,

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.253
and I'm gonna say, "Oh
no problem, I'm gonna

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:55.888
"move my meeting
back to my office."

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.924 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now I'm professional
and considerate.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.325
Ta da, and now I
have two alibis.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:02.161
So now, when I hang this sign

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.063 align:start size:84% position:16%
on my office at
the end of the day,

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
no one can say I
wasn't in a meeting.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.499 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that, ladies and
gentlemen, is how

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:09.268
you have a healthy
work life balance.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have a gym membership to cancel.
