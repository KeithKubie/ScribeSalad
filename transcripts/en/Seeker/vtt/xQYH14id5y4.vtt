00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.660
So, THAT’s Pluto!

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.110
And it’s not the cratered, ancient, barren
rock of blandness I thought it was going to

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.330
be...

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.330
Hi there!

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.809
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and today I’m at Youtube Spaces in

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.570
Los Angeles to talk a little about NASA’s
New Horizons mission to Pluto and some Kuiper

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
belt awesomeness.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.340
As you may have heard, New Horizons punched
through the Plutonian system on July 14, carrying

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.730
out the mother of all flyby photo ops.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.750
During its brief encounter, after flying through
the solar system for nearly a decade to get

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.120
there, the probe carried out thousands of
observations of the dwarf planet and its wonderfully

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.390
diverse moons.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.350
The probe is now hurtling through the Kuiper
belt, nearly 17 million miles from Pluto (at

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.350
time of filming!)

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.140
Although the flyby was over in a matter of
minutes, huge quantities of data is now stored

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.660
inside the spacecraft’s computer memory
and it’s going to take over a year for the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.000
mission to beam all that information back
to Earth.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.530
But already we are seeing some rather dreamy
high-resolution views of a surprisingly dynamic

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.980
and -- frankly -- amazing little world.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.820
Now before we get into WHAT Pluto really is,
let’s look back at what we thought it would

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.190
look like before we got this very privileged
closeup view.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.729
Pluto lives in the Kuiper belt, a frozen hinterland
in the outer solar system.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.619
In recent years, dozens and dozens of other
small objects have been discovered out there,

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.740
but only a small number have, so far, been
categorized as dwarf planets.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.130
In 2005, Kuiper belt astronomer Mike Brown
discovered the small world Eris.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.249
That discovery spurred on the debate of what
a planet actually IS, resulting in the controversial

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.789
decision by the IAU to reclassify Pluto as
a dwarf planet in 2006.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.679
As it turns out, with the help of New Horizons,
Pluto’s size has been precisely measured,

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.469
and, although it may not be technically a
planet, it is the KING of dwarf planets, beating

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.579
Eris’ width by 20 or so miles.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.919
The question of whether or not Pluto is a
planet now seems rather academic as New Horizons

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:46.020
has revealed a world that is UNLIKE anything
else in our solar system.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.799
It doesn’t even resemble Neptune’s moon
Triton, which came as a surprise to astronomers.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.810
The biggest surprise for me -- and many planetary
scientists -- is how young Pluto’s surface

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.810
is.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.920
Living in the Kuiper belt, one would expect
Pluto to have a craggy, cratered and ancient

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.659
surface, not so dissimilar to its inner solar
system dwarf planet cousin, Ceres.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.590
The Kuiper belt is supposed to be a historic
record frozen in time when the solar system

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.810
was violently forming and smashing asteroids
and planets together.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.469
Mike Brown refers to the Kuiper belt as the
“blood spatter” of the solar system, where

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.910
the forensic evidence of the solar system’s
violent formation billions of years ago can

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610
be found frozen in time.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.360
But Pluto’s surface appears fresh, only
a few tens of millions of years old, so this

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.319
evidence has been mostly eroded away by surprisingly
dynamic processes.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.269
Amazingly, through high-res images of Pluto,
we can see active ICE FLOWS AROUND MOUNTAINS,

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.590
much like the glaciers on Earth.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.349
Where the energy comes from to support these
flows is, for the moment, anyone’s guess.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.700
Then there’s Pluto’s heart.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.370
I mean really, a HEART emoji.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.190
Pluto is just messing with us now.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.950
The heart, named “Tombaugh Regio” after
Pluto’s 1930 discoverer Clyde Tombaugh,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.370
is a wonderfully exotic region containing
ice sheets, mountain ranges and active geological

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.370
features.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.799
The entire surface is covered with a rich
assortment of minerals and chemicals that

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.239
will take scientists years to understand where
they came from and how they fit with the early

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.829
formation of our solar system.

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.629
And then there’s Pluto’s atmosphere!

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.609
Although we’ve known for years that the
dwarf planet possesses a thin atmosphere,

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.920
New Horizons was able to look back THROUGH
these atmospheric gases after flyby, seeing

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.209
a beautiful solar eclipse and took critical
measurements of the atmospheric chemicals.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.909
New Horizons has found that Pluto’s atmosphere
is a complex hydrocarbon factory, where methane

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.930
gets broken down by UV light from the sun
and more complex hydrocarbon compounds create

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.540
an ice particle haze at lower altitudes.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.360
THOSE compounds then undergo chemical alterations
freezing onto Pluto’s surface as tholins.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.870
And tholins are exciting as they are prebiotic
chemicals that all life as we know it is based

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.870
on.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.079
Even though we are in early stages of understanding
the New Horizons observations, we’re already

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.200
seeing an incredibly complex Pluto that seems
to have surpassed everyone’s wildest fantasies

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.099
as to how exotic this place really is.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.090
And I haven’t even discussed Pluto’s moons,
including Charon, which could be considered

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.670
to be Pluto’s binary partner -- that will
have to wait for a future video.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.760
So does it really matter whether or not Pluto
is classified as a planet?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.780
In my view, no.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.689
I actually think Pluto is showing us just
how diverse and complex planetary bodies can

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:37.500
be and, perhaps, our notion as to what constitutes
a planet is woefully outdated.
