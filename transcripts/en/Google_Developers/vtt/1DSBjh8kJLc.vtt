00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:07.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to "Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.290
Today, I'm going to be chatting
with Jared Finder, who's

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.442
a software engineer
on the Tango platform.

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:12.900
And if you're not
familiar with it,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.510
it's all about
augmented reality.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.176
And we're going to
be really geeking out

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:18.610
over the amazing things you
can do with AR and Tango.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.220
Come check it out.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.100
So Jared, you're a software
engineer on the Tango platform

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.770
here at Google.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.240
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
keep hearing about Tango

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.030
and seeing cool
demos, and I know

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.150
it's got something to do
with augmented reality

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.050
and-- could you
clarify it for us?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.790
What is Tango?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.370
JARED FINDER: So
Tango is where we're

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.980
adding some extra technology to
standard Android smartphones,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.610
like this one.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.980
This is the Lenovo's phone
coming out later this year.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.854
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:42.000
JARED FINDER: And we're
allowing it to basically

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.050
have this 3D
understanding of the world

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.182
so that you can place
virtual objects that,

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:48.140
like, feel like they're
part of the real world.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.300
Now, what kind of technology
are you adding to the phone?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.580
It must be hardware as
well as software, right?

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.810
JARED FINDER: Right.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.059
So on the hardware, you have
this extra little fisheye

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.820
lens and a depth camera.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.760
And so combined, it's like
kind of how humans work

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.510
to understand the world in 3D.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.972
It gets to know where it
is, and it knows the shape

00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:04.930
of the world around it.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.805
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:07.450
So the depth camera,
is that like what

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.241
the sensors on video
games used to be like,

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:11.130
where they bounce an
infrared off a wall

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.589
and map the
environment around you?

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:13.379
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.280
It sends out infrared
light to figure out

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.480
how far away everything is.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.600
And then the fisheye
camera works all visually

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.579
to figure out how
far you've moved,

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.870
and where you are in the world.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.140
And so together, when
you combine these,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.870
you can place something on the
table and, as you move around,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.240
know how far you've
moved around the table.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.752
So it all renders and
looks like it's just

00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:32.710
part of the real world.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.228
And now, there's a software
element to this, as well,

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.170
in Tango, and I assume
some kind of Tango SDK.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.080
What's all that?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.913
JARED FINDER: Right.

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:41.260
So our Tango SDK,
that allows you

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.420
to basically plug
into the existing

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.200
technology on Tango phones.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.030
And so you can add that
to any existing app.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.260
It basically-- we have-- a
lot of people are writing,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.910
you know, 3D apps
for the first time,

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.386
or they have an existing 3D
app they want to port to Tango.

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.010
And so we integrate
with, like, popular

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.015
3D engines like Unity, Unreal.

00:01:59.015 --> 00:01:59.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.389
Oh, cool.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:04.530
So like if I have assets already
in something like Unity, then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.500
I can reuse them
in my Tango app.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.959
I don't need to have yet
another 3D modeling format.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:09.750
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.850
It's really simple.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.470
You just take our SDK, bring
it into your existing project,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.090
and then you would
position the camera

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.212
based on what our SDK has.

00:02:17.212 --> 00:02:19.670
And then it's like how far you
want to roll with it, right?

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.755
Do you want to start having
a special interaction

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.130
where you place
things on tables,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.280
you place things on the floor,
where you add these extra 3D

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.200
objects that are virtual
but they seem real,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.284
all to the existing world?

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:31.825
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's pretty cool.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:34.140
So that's kind of useful,
not just for gaming,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.506
but like architects
surveying-- you know,

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:37.880
if you're buying
a new house, you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.870
can visualize what it would
look like with furniture,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.610
that type of thing?

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.776
JARED FINDER: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:44.950
We see this kind of being useful
in terms of games, of course.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.160
And I'm a big gamer.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.892
But also for
education and utility.

00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:48.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.740
JARED FINDER: One big thing
I've seen that I didn't really

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.120
realize is, like,
how big dinosaurs

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.317
are until I walked around
one with a Tango device.

00:02:56.317 --> 00:02:57.650
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, wow, cool.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.550
How big are they?

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.300
JARED FINDER: It
depends on the dinosaur.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.850
Their tails are
spectacularly long, though.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.010
Like, a dinosaur that's, like,
this tall, would be, like,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.570
a super long tail.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
to balance, right?

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.423
JARED FINDER: I assume so.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.520
I haven't been with one.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
like, you know that scene

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.550
in "Jurassic Park" when it
comes down and takes the guy out

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.070
of the--

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.946
JARED FINDER: That hasn't
happened to me yet.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.195
LAURENCE MORONEY: You don't
want that to happen in AR.

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:21.000
JARED FINDER: It could
be a little scary.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.480
LAURENCE MORONEY: Do you
have any demos we could see?

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.620
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.120
So one thing that
we've been working

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.460
on-- this is something
we wrote internally--

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.380
is this measuring tool.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.890
So it just figures out
where different points

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.990
are in the 3D world.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.460
And when you know
where they are,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.620
you can measure, like,
how big this table is.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.744
How big do you think it is?

00:03:36.744 --> 00:03:38.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: How big?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.470
About four feet?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.480
3.5 feet?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.245
I don't know.

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:44.420
I'm not very good
at measuring things.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.217
It's like one hand,
two hand, three hand.

00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:47.050
JARED FINDER: Right.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.920
So let me actually
start up this app here.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.169
JARED FINDER: And so
what I'm going to do,

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.189
I'm going to place a point right
here at the end of the table.

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
kind of place a point

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.740
here, that type of thing?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.911
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:58.010
It's actually right here.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.885
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.870
JARED FINDER: So now I'll place
a point over at the far end.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.220
And how big did you say it was?

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.106
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Maybe 3.5, four feet.

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:08.730
JARED FINDER: Yeah,
so it says here you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.405
can see three feet, 10 inches.

00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:11.530
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, nice.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.940
Hey.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.110
So-- oh, I see there's a
line I point at-- 3'10".

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.390
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.681
So there should be a line
from, like, right around here

00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:18.800
to way over there.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.966
LAURENCE MORONEY: Very cool.

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:20.640
I like it.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.815
Nice.

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:23.190
JARED FINDER: So
that's one thing

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.570
we see that's really cool.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.374
What it's doing here is
it's adding virtual objects

00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:27.915
to the world.

00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:29.970
So you noticed that there
was one right around here.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.011
There was one down there.

00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:33.870
And they like-- as you move the
device around, they lined up.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.940
So even though they
were fully virtual,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.560
they looked like they were
part of the real world.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.510
And it was
interesting how it was

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.340
able to calibrate the
length in the real world,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.480
or measure the length without
any kind of calibration.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.730
JARED FINDER: Right.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.563
That was just because,
as I moved it around,

00:04:44.563 --> 00:04:46.370
it knew how far it had moved.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.260
Like, another thing you
can do with it is you

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.270
can add virtual
objects to the world

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.960
so that you can know,
like, if we wanted

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.340
to add an extra chair here--

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.000
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Well yeah, it's

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
a little uncomfortable here.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.390
Is there something I
can put my feet up on?

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.181
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:01.740
Do we have room for it,
is kind of the question.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.810
So let's place this
barstool right here.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.930
And it's filled up.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.455
And so now I'm going to position
it just right on the floor.

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:12.980
And so you can see we've got a
little virtual barstool right

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.480
here.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.150
There, you can see.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, neat.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.450
JARED FINDER: You could actually
move it around as you drag.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.408
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:05:17.408 --> 00:05:20.710
And as you gave the phone to
me, it stayed in position.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.890
That's pretty cool.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.420
So I'm gonna pop
my feet up on it.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.000
I like.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.500
Nice.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.592
So to get a model like
that one, all you had to do

00:05:28.592 --> 00:05:30.050
was like-- you were
using something

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.307
like Unity, the Unity engine?

00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:32.140
JARED FINDER: Right.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.770
So this was written in Unity,
because it turns out writing

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.090
a 3D engine's a lot of work.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.860
And so lots of people like
to use existing 3D engines so

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.250
that they don't need to become
experts in 3D rendering.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.330
So now building
something like this--

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.830
and you work on the
actual platform,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.150
and I believe you work on, like,
integrating things like Unity

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.920
into the platform.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.520
JARED FINDER: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.061
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm sure you
saw lots of interesting demos,

00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:53.830
and probably lots of
interesting things

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.340
went wrong along the way, like--

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.870
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.020
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What's the funniest bug

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.330
you've ever encountered?

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.840
JARED FINDER: So
the best time is

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.870
that like-- this is very
intensive processing,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.790
and so it turns out that a
thing you don't think about,

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.630
I think, with phones normally--
I normally really don't think

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.870
about it, except for when
I'm in developer mode--

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.215
is how the phone
generates a lot of heat.

00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:14.090
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.700
JARED FINDER: And so
some bugs only come up

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.020
when the phone gets really hot,
and not when it's really cold.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.866
And those are a
particular class of bug

00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:23.240
that's kind of
like when you have

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.397
multi-threading bugs
that you end up having

00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:26.480
to spend a lot of time on.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.146
And so I had one bug
that was like that.

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:30.700
And I was trying to identify
that, yes, this was only

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.220
happening when
the device is hot.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.680
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.540
JARED FINDER: So we have ways to
simulate the device being hot,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.970
but we don't have a way to
simulate the device being cold.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.059
JARED FINDER: So I
have to take my device,

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:43.460
and I put it in the
fridge next to the water.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.570
I was worried.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.140
I had to walk away
for five minutes

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.367
while it actually cooled down.

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:49.950
I was really worried
someone was going

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.250
to come in and be like, wow.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Why is
there a phone in the fridge?

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.570
JARED FINDER: Yeah,
exactly, right?

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.695
They'd be like, why is
there a phone in the fridge?

00:06:55.695 --> 00:06:56.980
Did someone lose it here?

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.100
Let's take it and give
it to lost and found.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.209
And I was like-- and then
I'd come back and not

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:02.250
be able to see my device.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.375
But it all worked out fine.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:04.740
And in fact, that was the bug.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.990
The bug was, in
fact, a hot/cold bug.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: Interesting.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.820
JARED FINDER: And so
when it cooled down,

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.960
I was able to fix the
part of the platform that

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.740
was having issues.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what
I'm learning from this

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.796
is I have to add a refrigerator
to my suite of debugging tools.

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:17.570
JARED FINDER: No, no, no.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.460
Our whole goal is that
we worry about that

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.846
so that, as an app developer,
that stuff just works.

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:22.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.294
Now actually, as
app developers go,

00:07:24.294 --> 00:07:26.710
I know there's an upcoming
summit for the Google Developer

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.539
Experts, the GDEs,
right, for Tango.

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:29.330
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you
guys are putting together

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.330
a lot of information.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.180
What kind of stuff is
going to be available?

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.804
JARED FINDER: Well,
so the whole thing.

00:07:34.804 --> 00:07:36.070
AR is really new, right?

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.230
And so we're really looking
to find who want to be

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.090
or who already is
being the AR experts.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.340
And so we want to find, like,
AR experts throughout the world

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.510
where we are just looking
for people to make

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.430
lots of cool apps.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.930
And so we're looking for GDE
who are going to be AR experts,

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.500
and we can educate them
in how you use Tango,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.520
how to teach other
people about Tango, how

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.825
to make apps using Tango.

00:07:58.825 --> 00:07:59.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.065
So big effort coming from Google
to start training the trainers,

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:03.565
effectively.

00:08:03.565 --> 00:08:04.590
JARED FINDER: Exactly.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
if I'm not lucky enough

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.200
to be able to go
to this summit, how

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.087
can I get started with Tango?

00:08:09.087 --> 00:08:10.920
JARED FINDER: So right
now, we already have,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.529
like, a really good
developer website.

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:13.820
You can just find it on Google.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.080
Search for Developers Tango.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.610
It's
developers.google.com/tango,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.450
but I just search for it.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.860
We also have a really good
Stack Overflow community,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.020
where you can ask questions,
and then other people

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.520
who are interested Tango
developers help you out.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.010
And then our samples.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.720
We have published a whole
bunch of open source samples

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.582
that you can use to build up and
build an existing app off of.

00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:36.540
And so we're trying to
hit different use cases.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.360
You know, people who are
interested in measuring,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.730
we have a simple
measuring sample.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.309
People who want to
add virtual objects,

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.890
we have an add virtual
objects sample.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.580
So those two things
that you just showed me,

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.940
are they available as samples?

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.480
JARED FINDER: So there are
samples that you could see--

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: But do--

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.710
JARED FINDER: --to build
off of these things.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.820
Yeah.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.020
JARED FINDER: I'm
really proud actually

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.797
of the adding virtual
objects sample,

00:08:52.797 --> 00:08:54.130
because I spent a bunch of time.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.300
It was like my first sample.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:55.575
LAURENCE MORONEY: Aw.

00:08:55.575 --> 00:08:56.390
JARED FINDER: You
always like, you know,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.717
the first thing that you add.

00:08:57.717 --> 00:08:59.300
And I spent a bunch
of time making it.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:08:59.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.110
Cool.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.401
So if I want to get started,
or if anybody wants to get

00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.669
started,
developers.google.com/tango?

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:05.460
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: So all the
docs are there, the samples,

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.280
those kind of things are
there, as well as a great Stack

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.020
Overflow community.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.190
JARED FINDER: Right.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.160
We have links to
everything else from there.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.909
So from there, you can
get to our samples,

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:15.700
you can download our SDK.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.750
And yeah, go to the
Stack Overflow community.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.580
Well, thank you so much, Jared.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.540
This has been awesome.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.498
It's been a lot of fun.

00:09:21.498 --> 00:09:23.550
I'm inspired to go out
and start building and--

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.470
JARED FINDER: Yeah, I hope
you get a Tango device.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: --hope
that I'll get a phone, yeah.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.020
So--

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.960
JARED FINDER: It's
just-- other than

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.793
that, it's just a normal
Android smartphone.

00:09:28.793 --> 00:09:31.450
So it's like, do you want
your smartphone to do AR?

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.200
Get a Tango phone.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.449
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds good.

00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:34.250
Thank you so much.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.940
JARED FINDER: Yeah.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.520
It was great.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if
you want to learn more

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.910
about Tango or
augmented reality,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.700
take a look at the links
in the description below.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.158
And if you've any questions
for me or for Jared, as always,
