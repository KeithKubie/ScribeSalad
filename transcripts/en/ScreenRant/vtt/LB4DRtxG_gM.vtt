10 Awful Scenes In Amazing Movies

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.420
It’s very rare that you can claim a movie
is absolutely perfect.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.960
Sometimes even our most beloved movies can
contain scenes that for one reason or another

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.400
just don’t seem to gel with the rest of
the film.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.250
These are the scenes you take a bathroom break
during, fast forward, or just sit there wondering

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.250
what the filmmakers were thinking.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.130
You’ve seen our 10 Amazing Scenes In Terrible
movies, now here’s 10 Awful Scenes in Amazing

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.970
Movies.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.970
&nbsp;

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.970
The Breakfast Club

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.800
Considered by many to be one of the best high
school films of all time, 1985’s The Breakfast

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.290
Club was marketed as a realistic look at the
lives of teens in the 80s.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.550
In one scene, several of the characters get
high in the library, but the pot has a strange

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.390
effect on Emilio Estevez’s jock character
who for some reason decides to hot box a room

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.239
on his own before going into a high energy
dance, complete with gymnastics and shadow

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.239
boxing.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.210
He caps this odd sequence by shattering a
window with his powerful scream.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.309
I’ll have what he’s having.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.309
Django Unchained

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.790
By the third act of Quentin Tarantino’s
Django Unchained, several of the film’s

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.780
main characters have been killed off and we
expect the former slave’s final revenge

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.890
to be imminent, instead a narrative detour
is taken to make room for the director’s

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.320
worst cameo to date.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.410
Taking Django away from Candyland not only
stops the film’s action dead in its tracks,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.600
but it also contains a highly questionable
Australian accent from Tarantino who should

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.990
have left this sequence on the cutting room
floor.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.990
Interstellar

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.111
Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi epic prided itself
in being more science than fiction, but one

00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:34.530
of the film’s key emotional moments contained
a bit too much whimsy for most viewers.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.370
Doctor Brand’s speech about love transcending
time and space seemed a little out of place

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.180
in this largely cerebral thriller and rubbed
a lot of audiences the wrong way.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.681
Ultimately the speech didn’t really contradict
the film’s themes, the writing was just

00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:54.910
a little too on-the-nose for most of us to
stomach.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.910
Star Wars

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.530
In 1977, audiences didn’t yet know the full
history of Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.560
nor had they ever seen a lightsaber duel,
so when the two faced off there was little

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.400
in the way of expectations to be met.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.570
Looking back at the blockbuster classic, this
fight does not hold up, but seems stiff, lifeless,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.819
and completely lacking in the action and emotion
that even the following film, The Empire Strikes

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.790
Back, was able to achieve with its lightsaber
duel between Vader and Luke.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.090
Lord of the Rings -The Fellowship of the Ring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.360
In the first Lord of the Rings film, the hobbits
had their own little adventure before the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.689
fellowship had even formed.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.629
While on Weathertop, Frodo receives a wound
from a Ringwraith that almost kills him.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.939
When he comes to in Rivendell, he believes
his journey has come to an end, and Peter

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.582
Jackson treats it like an epilogue, one that
will later be echoed in the many epilogues

00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:37.582
of Return of the King.

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:40.720
The hobbits have a gleeful reunion and talk
of going back to the Shire, but with two and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.430
half movies remaining we know their journey
is just beginning and watching them celebrate

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.830
feels as redundant as second breakfast.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.830
The Master

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.830
P.T.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.390
Anderson’s last few films have been anything
but straightforward.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.390
The director likes to challenge his audiences
with complicated characters behaving strangely.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.700
The Master depicts the unlikely friendship
between a troubled world war II veteran and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.150
the leader of new religious movement.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.969
The dialogue in their final meeting has all
the meaning of a nonsensical dream and concludes

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.889
with the master inexplicably singing lyrics
to the jazz standard ‘(I’d like to get

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:13.030
you on a ) Slow boat to china”.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.730
Ambiguity is one thing, but this is just confusing.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.909
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part
1

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.900
The trend of breaking up popular franchise
conclusions into two parts can often result

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.870
in some pretty blatant filler scenes.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.060
Perhaps the best example of this is Harry
and Hermione’s awkward dance in Harry Potter

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.510
and the Deathly Hallows part 1.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.590
It’s a grim point in the film for the characters
and this is Harry’s attempt to lighten the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.920
mood, but Harry’s goofy dance moves paired
with Nick Cave’s brooding music make for

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.440
a strange and uncomfortable moment.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.380
Clearly Hermione doesn’t know how to react
to this either.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.450
Thanks for the Grade 8 dance flashback Harry.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.450
Drive

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.150
Despite its art film proclivities, most of
Drive follows a somewhat rational logic that

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.010
seems to go out the window when the driver
sets his sights on Nino, the despicable gangster

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.239
played by Ron Pearlman.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.959
For no apparent reason, the driver dons a
creepy mask and stares at Nino through the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.480
window of a crowded restaurant for an extended
period of time as if he were a character in

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
a horror film.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.639
He doesn’t enter, but instead walks back
to his car so he can use it to ram Nino’s

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.639
off a cliff.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.609
Still masked, the driver confronts his bloodied
victim on the beach and stares him down for

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.959
a few moments before Nino decides to help
him finish the job by running into the ocean

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.049
where he can be easily drowned by the driver.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.130
Thanks for not making this weird Nino!

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.130
Gangs of New York

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.140
Martin Scorsese’s 2002 flick attempted to
depict gang warfare as it was in mid-19th

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.140
Century New York.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.851
The opening sequence sees Bill the Butcher’s
gang face off against Priest Vallon’s gang

00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:35.410
of Irish immigrants, and begins with promise
as we feel we’re in the competent hands

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.860
of a master filmmaker.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.820
Then all of a sudden the character known as
“Hellcat Maggie” literally flies through

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.880
the air, pounces on a victim and bites off
his ear.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.910
At this point the scene becomes something
else entirely.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.940
The music changes to a synthy modern rock
soundtrack and what follows looks like the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.220
man who gave us Raging Bull decided to let
his teenaged nephew direct for a day.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.220
It was an odd choice to begin a film that
would contain no further scenes shot, edited

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.920
or scored using this style that looks more
like an ultra violent music video than a feature

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.370
film.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.700
Captain America: Winter Soldier

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.780
Captain America: Winter Soldier is one of
the highest rated Marvel movies to date.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.810
One of the reasons for this was the plot’s
many twists and turns.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.600
One red herring involved Nick Fury faking
his death.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.000
Just so there’s no doubt left in the audience’s
mind, we’re made to witness several minutes

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.570
of characters wordlessly watching doctors
try to revive him.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.140
They even ran out of reaction shots and felt
it necessary to include this one where Black

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.060
Widow is clearly speaking but her dialogue
has been cut.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.690
Once he’s been pronounced dead, Black Widow
decides she needs an even closer look, you

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.030
know, to poke him and make sure he’s not
faking it.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.480
