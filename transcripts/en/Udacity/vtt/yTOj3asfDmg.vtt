00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.680
As we mentioned earlier,
Stage 2 is similar to Stage 1,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.810
but raises the bar both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.410
It also introduces some
striking requirements,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.070
with respect to patients
participation in their care.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.530
Here we see the bar going up
from 40% E-Prescribing to 50%.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.940
And the qualitative

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.890
addition that prescriptions be compared
to at least one drug formulary.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.000
A list of medications usually
reviewed by experts, and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.510
felt to be cost effective treatments for
their target condition.
