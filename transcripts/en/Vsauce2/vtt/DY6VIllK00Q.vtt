00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.700
Vsauce!

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.700
Kevin here.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.650
My image and voice recorded, backed up, uploaded
and saved...forever.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.259
Your cat photos, political arguments, the
first private message you sent your future

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.770
husband or wife, your comments on this video
- authenticated, labeled, and recorded.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.770
Somewhere.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.520
For as long as someone is around to keep the
lights on.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.220
For the first time in human history.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.050
Ordinary people will never be forgotten.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.680
At least half of what makes you - you.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.350
In Documenting Individual Identity, Jane Caplan
explains identity as having two parts.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.010
There’s the subjective you, the “self-same.”

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.461
You know who you are because you are you.

00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:47.470
You have your memory, which Oscar Wilde called,
“...the diary that we all carry about with

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.470
us.”

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.070
And then there’s the “sameness with another”
half of your identity - what others can know.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.410
That includes classifications others assign
to you to identify and make sense of you.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.890
And until you can upload your consciousness
to BrainTube, this may be the only part of

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.600
your identity capable of being recorded.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.770
The categorical checkboxes and evidence you
leave behind.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.770
And we’ve been obsessively trying to record
ourselves long before selfie sticks.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.299
The oldest way to archive yourself is to pass
on your DNA and name.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.300
Offspring have received patronymic and matronymic
names consistently across cultures and some

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.630
traditions pass down the same exact name.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.630
The longest-running name suffix tradition
came from the German House Of Reuss, which

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.329
named every son Heinrich all the way up to
Count Heinrich LXXV - who ended the line with

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.170
his death as an infant.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.510
And in 2010, Christopher Columbus XX, a naval
veteran who sailed around the world, returned

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.149
to Panama 500 years after his ancestor's last
voyage.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.840
But the first widely-used device to express
our individual identity to others was the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.140
cylinder seal.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.590
Invented in Mesopotamia, they were carved
out of stone and used to create an impression

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.289
in moist clay.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.560
These seals marked personal property, served
as signatures on official documents and were

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.930
often buried with their owners alongside other
precious items like gold and silver.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.769
By 3500 BC they advanced to state a person’s
name, occupation and where they lived.

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.530
For example, this seal depicts a King holding
back two gryphons, which expressed his ability

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.239
to control the chaotic forces of nature.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.810
And these symbols on the left represent his
personal identity.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.849
But cylinder seals weren’t exclusive to
Kings and the elite - they were worn around

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.150
the necks of the general public and losing
one was the equivalent today of losing your

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.129
ID and credit card.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.850
If you were a weaver, your cylinder seal may
feature a spider.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.599
If you were Apilsha the weaver, you might
include a mark above the spider to differentiate

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.569
yourself from Zuzu the weaver who places a
mark on the right side of his spider.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.099
As civilization advances and communities grow
larger, it takes more to stand out.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.310
Ask squirrels.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.210
The size of a group of squirrels, called a
scurry, directly influences the individuality

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.659
of signals used to choose a mate.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.799
So whether you’re talking about Belding’s
ground squirrel or high school, the larger

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.599
the group - the more symbols of individuality
play a role in getting a date.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.830
The longest lasting human symbols of identity
are set in stone.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.849
The Pyramids, tombs built to protect and preserve
Pharaohs and their legacies, were constructed

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.440
with joints so tight that no water can get
in and from stone so hard that no water can

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.440
penetrate it.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.170
&nbsp;Which is why your neighbor’s house may
be falling down but pharaoh Khufu’s tomb

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.019
is still standing after 4,500 years.

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.269
From timeless structures to timeless culture,
carved in stone on the front of the Temple

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.230
of Apollo at Delphi was a simple aphorism:
“Know Thyself.”

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.530
The most famous of the 147 Delphic Maxims,
a list of truths to live by, it highlighted

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.099
the importance of identity as early as 6th
century BC.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.099
&nbsp;

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.640
Sages, leaders, and human experience continued
to develop life's instruction manual, but

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.609
it took another two thousand years for the
first evidence of a common person saving their

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.749
data every day.

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:16.900
Diary or journal.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.470
Both words come from latin - diarium meaning
“daily allowance” and diurnus meaning

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.720
“of the day.”

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.020
Luca Landucci, an apothecary who learned to
write by bookkeeping for his accountant father,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.710
chronicled the city's events, which were equal
parts news and drama.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.740
It was eventually copied and passed throughout
Tuscany, which makes Landucci’s blog the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.060
first to go viral.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.680
But his actions were an anomaly for hundreds
of years to follow.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.150
Before 1700, we have accounts of fewer than
500 diaries.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.150
Total.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.040
Today, there are over a billion users active
on Facebook every day talking about their

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.540
lives and checking in on others.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.310
The oldest known diary is Marcus Aurelius’
Meditations, in which he advises, “Do not

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.090
act as if you were going to live a thousand
years, soon you’ll be ashes or bone.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.310
A mere name at most - and even that is just
a sound - an echo.”

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.820
But saving sounds wasn’t possible until
the development of the phonautograph.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.310
Alexander Graham Bell's version used a severed
human ear attached to a stylus.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.720
When he shouted into the ear, his voice was
etched into glass.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.960
Our voices were the most reliable way to pass
personal stories through oral tradition, epic

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.820
tales and song.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.950
The first songs were inscribed in cuneiform
on clay but only fragments survived.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.950
The Seikilos Epitaph, the earliest known complete
song, was recorded in ancient Greek musical

00:05:42.950 --> 00:06:00.800
notation on a stele - a stone funerary monument.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:11.520
And there’s a reason one of the oldest songs
was carved into a tombstone: death has historically

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.740
been our impetus to preserve the details of
life.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.370
Not just marking graves, building temples,
erecting monuments or painting funeral portraits,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.210
but by creating probate records.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.270
The word probate comes directly from the latin
‘probare’ meaning ‘to prove’ - the

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.720
documents created at death to prove a person
lived.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.110
My own middle name came from my great grandfather
- Julius Lieber.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.800
This genealogy book contains an entry about
him that describes his entire life, a father

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.850
of six, an engineer, a skilled mechanic, with
98 words.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.370
I’m only three generations removed from
having a written legacy that fits in four

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.610
tweets.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.720
The elements of our identities we want to
record haven't changed much in thousands of

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.110
years.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.500
Egyptian sculptor Bak created a selfie of
him with his wife in 1345 BC.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.490
Bamboo slips with a single column of Chinese
characters were like Tweets in 300 BC.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.660
The Republic of Letters exchanged ideas across
Europe like a 17th century Facebook group.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.500
And every one of your Instagrammed food photos
would be carefully scrutinized by Jean Anthelme

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.640
Brillat-Savarin, who said, "Tell me what you
eat; I will tell you what you are."

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.720
Often abbreviated to, “You are what you
eat.”

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.160
But the immediacy and the volume have very
recently changed - astronomically.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.240
In 1995, 16 million people were connected
by the internet - &nbsp;we’re now over 3.2 billion.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.690
Uploading home videos, wishing a Happy Birthday
to our cousin’s best friend’s sister,

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.900
reading about and interacting with people
we’ll never meet face to face.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:54.090
The data we transfer is predicted to reach
88.4 exabytes per month -- that’s 88.4 billion

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.430
gigabytes.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.710
Storage numbers are getting so big we’re
struggling to find ways to label them.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:06.640
And recording equipment that was once prohibitively
expensive is now probably in your pocket.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:13.480
The free apps in a smartphone represent $900,000
worth of equipment about thirty years ago.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.140
Copying a book before the 12th century was
a lonely task reserved for trained monks that

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.830
could take a year, which is why one scribal
note at the end of a book stated, "Finally

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.420
that's finished, now give me some wine!"

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.200
Today, with a Google Fiber connection and
about three days, you could hypothetically

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.010
download all 37.8 million books stored at
the Library Of Congress.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:40.110
Until the end of the late 1800s, low literacy
rates meant most people couldn’t write about

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.070
themselves even if they wanted to.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.500
By the 1950s, we made a legitimate attempt
to create a database of dreams.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.560
And today, smart bracelets record our every
heartbeat.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.150
But heartbeat data isn’t...really...us.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.710
So who are we recording?

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.921
Your ID, which was developed after nations
realized they could no longer rely on a note

00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:07.870
signed by a dignitary pinned to the hat of
a courier as sufficient proof of identification,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.050
records your height, birth date, and eye color.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:15.890
Your social media profiles add identifiers
like your favorite music or sports teams,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.640
friends, and pictures of you wearing your
favorite outfits.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.610
It's a far cry from the 14th century, when
the majority of people had the wardrobe of

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:29.670
a cartoon character, with “wanted posters”
describing criminals by their one set of clothes.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:35.800
We now have access to a previously unimaginable
number of identifiers, and ways of recording

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.700
that are so easy we don't even realize we're
doing it.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.370
Immortality may be part of the new normal.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.420
The Ancient Egyptians had to preserve their
bodies through mummification, their internal

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:53.280
organs in canopic jars, and their faces with
death masks, all in the hope that their soul

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.570
would find its way back after death.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.810
Back home.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:02.430
They believed erasing one’s memory on Earth
would erase their immortality.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.430
&nbsp;

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.269
But the Sumerians, those inventors of the
cylinder seal, believed there was no heaven

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:09.320
- only hell.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.310
And by honoring their dead, buried safely
below or in a shrine next to their house,

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:20.070
by giving them food and drink - by keeping
a record of their life - &nbsp;they could avoid

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.200
the, “Land Of No Return.”

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.980
A place we might have eliminated without even
realizing it.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.029
And as always - thanks for watching.
