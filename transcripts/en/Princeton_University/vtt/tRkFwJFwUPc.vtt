[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:07.200
CHRISTOPHER L.
EISGRUBER: By honoring

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.400
Toni Morrison in this way, we
recognize the indelible impact

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.830
she has had on this university.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.490
Arriving at Princeton in 1989 as
the Robert F. Goheen Professor

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.540
in the Humanities, Morrison's
transformative presence

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.460
as a member of the
creative writing program

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.300
played a central role in
diversifying our campus

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
by attracting other faculty and
students of color to Princeton 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.730
and deepening our commitment
to African American studies.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.130
She also served as a
catalyst for expanding

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.310
Princeton's commitment to the
creative and performing arts.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.940
In 1994, she founded
the Princeton Atelier.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.010
Professor Morrison's
leadership has

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.380
helped Princeton to
become the increasingly

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.020
imaginative and inclusive
institution that we know today.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.570
Through these myriad
contributions, and now

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.920
through the name
of Morrison Hall,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.580
Professor Morrison's legacy
will have enduring significance

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.130
for all who walk our campus.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.700
RUTH SIMMONS: West College
is an iconic structure,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.470
part of the fabric of
the Princeton identity.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.800
How right and just for
Morrison to be indelibly linked

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.600
with its history.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.210
Her presence in a new
Princeton narrative

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.460
is not so much to endorse the
way things have always been,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.560
but to point to the way they
can and will be in the future.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.720
The bookends of that
powerful display

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.540
of her artistry on a snowy
night, on the one hand,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.010
and the dedication of
Morrison Hall on the other,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.310
celebrate the compelling
story of her association

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.780
with this university.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.230
Forever to be entwined the
story of a great writer

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.675
and a great university
with the good sense

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:55.360
to turn towards
the future will be

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.170
recounted through the ages
advancing the legacy of both

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.022
in a powerful way.

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:05.850
MACKENZIE BEZOS: In that first
workshop with her a year later

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.890
when she shut the
classroom door and treated

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.970
us like we were the only
people in the world.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.020
Sharing excerpts from
books that she loved.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.180
And telling stories that
made her laugh until tears

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.130
streamed from her eyes.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.740
And focusing the group's
attention on each student's

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.420
writing with her keen
observations and solemn

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.580
attention.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.560
Or when senior
year I sat waiting

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.050
in that crowded anteroom once
a month for my thesis meeting.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.710
And discovered that when
her advisees' turns come,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.770
she would draw them out
of that waiting area.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.770
And shut the door on
the ringing phones.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.820
And give them two
impossibly focused hours.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.870
Turning the pages of their
manuscripts one by one.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.920
And initiating painstaking
and patient conversations

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.300
about individual words, and
phrases, and the stories they

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.520
were struggling to create.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.300
I would say that one of the most
inspiring and surprising things

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.570
that she has given
me is a real example

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.405
of a life of passionate devotion
to more than one calling.

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:18.350
TONI MORRISON: This is
a very, very special,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.690
beautiful occasion for me.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.780
Thank you, thank you both.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.516
You're very, very
important to me.

00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:28.786
I'm so happy that you
were willing to come

00:03:28.786 --> 00:03:33.766
to tell me how wonderful I was.

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:39.956
[APPLAUSE]
