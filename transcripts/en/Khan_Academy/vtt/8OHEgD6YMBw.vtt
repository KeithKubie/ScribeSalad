00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.200
Voiceover:A newborn calf
weighs 40 kilograms.

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.867
Each week its weight increases by 5%.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.100
Let W be the weight in
kilograms of the calf

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.600
after t weeks.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:15.000
Is W a linear function or
an exponential function?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.966
So, if W were a linear
function, that means

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.766
that every week that goes by, the weight

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.000
would increase by the same amount.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.967
So let's say that every week that went by,

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:26.533
the weight increases ...

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.033
Or, really, they're
talking about mass here.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.666
The mass increased by 5 kilograms.

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:32.666
Then we'd be dealing
with a linear function.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.033
But they're not saying that the weight

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.566
increases by 5 kilograms.

00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.333
They're saying by 5%.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:42.333
After one week it'll be
1.05 times 40 kilograms.

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.633
After another week it'll
be 1.05 times that,

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:46.900
it'll be 5 percent more.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.800
After the next week
it'll be 1.05 times that.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.166
So really, if we really
think about this function,

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.433
it's going to be 40 kilograms times 1.05

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:56.700
to the t power.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.566
We're compounding by 5% every time.

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:03.133
We're increasing by a factor of 1.05.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:04.302
Or another way of thinking
about it, by a factor

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:07.266
of 105% every week.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.766
Because we have that growth by a factor,

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.100
not just by a constant
number, that tells us

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.333
that this is going to be
an exponential function.

00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:17.333
So let's see which if these
choices describe that.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.233
This function is linear, no, we don't have

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.233
to even read that.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:21.166
This function is linear, nope.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.700
This function is exponential
because W increases

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.166
by a factor of 5 each
time t increases by 1.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.100
No, that's not right.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.466
We're increasing by 5%.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.300
Increasing by 5% means
you're 1.05 times as big

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.866
as you were before increasing.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.833
So it's really this
function is exponential

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:41.233
because W increases by a factor of 1.05

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.866
each time t increases by 1.

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.466
That, right over there,
is the right answer.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.866
Let's try 1 more of these.

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:50.500
Determine whether the quantity described

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.300
is changing in a linear fashion

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.000
or an exponential fashion.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:57.300
Fidel has a rare coin worth $550.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.466
Each year the coin's
value increases by 10%.

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:01.967
Well, this is just like the last

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:03.200
example we saw.

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:04.966
We're increasing every year that goes by

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.400
as we increase by a factor of 1.1.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.966
If we grow by 10%, that's
increasing by a factor

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:12.333
of 110% or 1.1.

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.066
So this is definitely exponential.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.233
If it was increasing $10 per year,

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:17.666
then it would be linear.

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:19.400
But here we're increasing by a percentage.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.534
Your uncle bought a car
for 130,000 Mexican pesos.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.833
Each year the value of the car decreases

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:28.400
by 10,000 pesos.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.100
So here we're not multiplying by a factor,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.033
we're decreasing by a fixed amount.

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:34.833
1 year goes by, we're at 120,000.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.400
2 years goes by we're at 110,000.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.333
So this is definitely a linear ...

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.867
This can be described by a linear model.

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:44.900
The number of wild hogs
in Arkansas increases

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.666
by a factor of 3 every 5 years.

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:50.233
So a factor of 3 every 5 years.

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:51.633
They're not saying it increases by 3 hogs

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:52.800
every 5 years.

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.866
We're multiplying by 3 every 5 years.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.234
So this is definitely ...

00:02:57.234 --> 00:03:00.600
This one right over here
is going to be exponential.

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.933
Then, finally, you work as
a waiter at a restaurant.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.400
You earn $50 in tips every day you work.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.301
Well, this is super ...

00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:09.800
This should jump out as very linear.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:12.133
Every day you work, another $50.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.500
Work 1 day, $50.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.666
2 days, $100.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.134
So forth and so on.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.366
They're not saying that
you earned 50 times

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.933
as much as the day before.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.900
They're not saying that
you earned 50% more.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.100
They're saying that you're increasing

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.466
by a fixed quantity.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.800
So this is going to be a linear model.
