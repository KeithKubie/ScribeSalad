1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,360
The Joe Rogan experience now,
how often do you practice?

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,570
Do you practices outside of hypnosis?

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,840
Is there like some things you
concentrate on or meditate on? Yeah,

4
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:13,730
so I do my best to just,
it's kind, Kinda like,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,020
the weird thing about me is fighting is
something that is just kind of happened

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:24,500
by accident, but it's caused
me to search for so much peace,

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,150
like inner peace because of everything
that I go through emotionally being a

8
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:33,530
fighter. So going from this,
I know Shab told you about it,

9
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:37,580
but going from this kid who was just
like super overweight my whole life,

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,140
never fit in with anybody, I was always
just like this introverted, Gothic,

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,090
weird kid that nobody, you
know, nobody ever talked to,

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,160
didn't ever even want it to fight. Oh,
I've always been non confrontational.

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,210
But somewhere in the journey
of becoming a fighter,

14
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:57,860
I was like, ah, this is cool,

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,770
but I need to find more
peace because this is like,

16
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:02,720
it's bringing up way too much,

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,380
just like just way too much. My,
of my anger kind of like, you know,

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,590
from everything that I held onto.
So, uh, practice meditation,

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,400
a lot of meditation. I read a lot of
different, I'll study different religions,

20
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,770
whatever, wherever on that.
Um, all just to find peace.

21
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:24,771
Peaceman how confrontational guy
wind up being an elite cage fighter.

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,900
[inaudible] stop and think
about what, I know what, yeah.

23
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,580
It's, that's a very strong, I'm still
trying to wrap my mind around it. Yeah.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,400
But I think that, um, internally
there's just a lot of,

25
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,730
there's a lot of expression. I, for
me, it's a, it is a big expression man.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,310
It's an expression of just

27
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,770
my, my danger, my ferociousness
this, the, the, the, the,

28
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,240
the part of myself that I've
always held back. You know,

29
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:59,010
it's like I have to hold back. Um, I'm a
big guy, you know, like I, if I get angry,

30
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,270
I'm afraid I can, you know, break
something and you're like, you know what,

31
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:04,710
it's like, it's crazy. So fighting for me,

32
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:08,880
like when I train after training,
I'm super peaceful.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,370
Right after I fight,
I feel like I've grown.

34
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:15,010
I feel like this guy is trying to hurt
me. All these things like it's, it's,

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,070
it's just a place where
we both agree like, Hey,

36
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,830
I'll give you my strength versus
your strength or whatever.

37
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,680
Whatever powers that strength is,
what will we meet in the middle?

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,120
And so it helps me balance,
man. It does. Yeah.

39
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,030
Because when I'm not fighting,
I'm so relaxed. It's crazy.

40
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,550
It makes sense. And I think that
something that could aid a lot of men.

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,140
I think just at least training,
just a speck.

42
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,610
I think there's something particularly
soothing about hitting a heavy bag.

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,640
There's something particular
like when you're done, man,

44
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:48,090
you feel so good when you're done
hitting pads. We've done sparring.

45
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,270
You feel so just peaceful.
Yeah. You got it all out.

46
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,850
You don't have anything left in here now.

47
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,650
I thought a lot of men carry a
lot of extra bullshit. Yeah, man.

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,710
Well that dash tray extra for
no reason you to let it out.

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,000
Let it out. Yeah. Some guys will
build it up in the gym. Right.

50
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,390
And they're super huge and it's
like, I, you gotta let it out.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,080
But then gaining and swing those arms.
Yeah.

52
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:15,730
You'd see less of that now. It was
too, it seems like, but yeah, it just,

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,900
it would be nice if,

54
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,230
I really think they should teach kids
how to fight at a very early age.

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,960
That'd be cool. I think it's the opposite.
It would have the opposite effect.

56
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,230
I think people would fight less.
I think if you taught kids how to fight,

57
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:30,550
they would just train and spar and they
would get it all out of their system

58
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,490
there and they'd probably
fight a lot less. It's in,

59
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:36,010
it's kind of like in our
nature, right? Like everybody,

60
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,840
everybody's got curiosity. Like, I
wonder what it's like. Yeah. The,

61
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,580
the closest they have tutors,
the wrestling team.

62
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,760
You can join the wrestling team and they
will teach you a very important part of

63
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:49,510
fighting. But other than
that, like they're not going
to teach you how to fight,

64
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,540
but for wrestling, he's kind of like,
now at least it's kind of a loophole.

65
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,340
Like they don't teach
boxing in high school,

66
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,250
but they'll teach you how to wrestle
and that they're pretty crazy, man. Hey,

67
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,800
wrestling's get rough. Or it
seems like, fuck yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,640
Will the high school kids are savages.

69
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,070
I remember being a high school kid in a
high school wrestling room. It was awful.

70
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,240
And those kids were trying to kill each
other and they work at the hardest to,

71
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,900
yeah, run it with plates over
their head and all that stuff.

72
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,310
And football teams just lifting
weights and run in practice.

73
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,080
Those guys are doing ridiculous shit.

74
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,480
Slaven everybody seen that movie vision
quest, right? You saw, I've never seen it.

75
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,800
Never saw it. I've never seen it. Dude,

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,920
it's Matthew Modine and Matthew Modine
plays this badass wrestler and he's going

77
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:32,590
up against this dude who's this other
badass wrestler and he comes to visit the

78
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:36,190
guy while he got his training and this
dude's got a log on his back and he's

79
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:40,360
walking up stadium stairs
and they had the, he says,

80
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,910
you think you make the weight?
Cause he Matthew Modine's character,

81
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,970
she had to cut weight. And he goes,
I hope so. He goes, hope so too.

82
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,740
He keeps walking up the stairs like a kid.
When did this come out? Long time ago,

83
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:54,480
man. Back when Madonna was
young. Oh that's the restaurant.

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,270
So He's walking up the stadium stairs,

85
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,810
carrying a fucking log on to great movie,
man.

86
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,390
Every wrestler that I knew
when I was in high school,

87
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,150
everyone worship this movie.
What year did the shit come out?

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,810
It's probably like 85 or something
like the cover for it. Is it 85 Bam.

89
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,850
I nailed it son. Is that the
cover for it? Yes. Look at that.

90
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,240
I didn't even look like you have
anything to do with a wrestler.

91
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:22,390
I'd definitely would not click that
on Netflix thinking and I was around

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,550
restaurant movie at all.

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,150
She was hot as the Sun to fun times.
But yeah,

94
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:31,990
that was like the quintessential wrestling
movie because he just was dedicated.

95
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,450
And then there was this friend who
lied about being native American.

96
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,130
Is that what that is? I'm gonna say
what's that vest he's got going on.

97
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:41,500
Just wanted to be different. Stand out.
But it was a, it's a fun movie, man.

98
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,150
It's a fun movie. I have to
get into that for sure. Yeah.

99
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,320
Not a whole lot of movies about wrestling.
That's the least glamorous,

100
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:50,890
but probably toughest sport for high
school kids to get into. Definitely.

101
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:54,310
You know, that's, I stayed away
from him, you know, I tried out for,

102
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,800
I tried out for volleyball in high school,
actually made the team,

103
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:02,000
but my grades were terrible so I never
got to play. But I was like heavyset dude.

104
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,520
And I tried out. I made it. I think it
was just kind of like a joke though.

105
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:06,800
I think the coaches were just
messing with me and my friends too.

106
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,780
When did you get involved in martial
arts? Uh, when I was 20, so 2010.

107
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,150
So really quick,
right after high school I started,

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,710
um, I started traveling. So
I used to play in a band.

109
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:26,210
I used to play a mini bands and willing
guitar. I play guitar, I play drums,

110
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,840
I play keyboard,
a little bit of everything.

111
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,780
Every Christmas my mom
would just know that,

112
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,200
just give me a new instrument and I'd
lock myself in my room and teach myself

113
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:39,770
how to play. And that's just always
how like music was my first love,

114
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,880
my first love. So I taught yourself. Yeah,

115
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,920
I just put on headphones and I would
just match the sounds and then keep

116
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,720
restarting the songs over and over again.

117
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,340
And then if it were like a keyboard song,

118
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,150
I'd play it like just on
the CD player and you know,

119
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,110
as it evolved and for
some reason I can just,

120
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,650
I can match tunes with
whatever instrument it may be.

121
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,040
You've always been able to
do that since kid. Wow. Yeah.

122
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,670
So no formal training.
Nothing. That's crazy.

123
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,350
I've tried to take, I've tried to
take guitar lessons before, um,

124
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,230
but it didn't work for me and my mom
was just wasting her money like I was

125
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,620
learning, but it was Kinda like school
for me. Like I had a teacher, he saw me,

126
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,640
okay, this cord, this cord. And I was
like, Eh, like just let me feel it.

127
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:29,180
Like I gotta I gotta feel it. You know,
like I can hear it, I can, I can feel it,

128
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:33,650
I'll get it. And so I stopped going.
How many people do it like, like that?

129
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,250
I'm not sure. I know there's a lot of
people that can just kind of play by ear,

130
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,480
but so I'll like,

131
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:41,900
I just love instruments so I'll pick
anything up and just start playing it and

132
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,950
ended up teaching myself how to
play drums, bass guitar keyboard.

133
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,630
I played the standup Bass
in uh, in middle school. Um,

134
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,560
I've got like a little home production,
like beats studio at home, all that stuff.

135
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,770
So after high school I
started touring and uh,

136
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,950
that's when like I started
getting my heaviest.

137
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:05,810
We were eating fast food every single
day, three times a day, never drank water,

138
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,950
soda, only smoking like a pack
and a half of cigarettes a day.

139
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,220
And just on the road
traveling. And then, uh, by 19,

140
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:17,000
I got up to 305 pounds,
19 years old.

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,990
And I remember one night laying down
to go to bed and I just felt my heart

142
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,130
pumping bridezilla Leslie and I was
just like, no way. This is like,

143
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,690
I think I'm going to die.

144
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,720
And like I woke up in a panic and weird
thing is I got up and I went outside for

145
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:36,590
maybe like 10 minutes and I smoked
another cigarette and I was just like,

146
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,850
this is the problem.

147
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,180
Like I'm coughing up stuff my hardest
gonna give out and I'm only 19 years old,

148
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:44,451
you know?

149
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:49,280
So around that same week is when
I discovered MMA with my brother,

150
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,410
just like watching ultimate
fighter on TV. And so, uh,

151
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,980
I went on my last tour and,
uh, I told the guys like, Hey,

152
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,590
I'm going to go train MMA. And they're
like, oh, you're going to be a fighter,

153
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:01,800
like you think, you know? And I was just
like, I don't know what I'm going to be,

154
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,420
but I'm going to go train and get
healthy. And they're like, okay, cool.

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,360
We'll see you in a couple of
months, you know what I mean? Like,

156
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:09,460
no one really believed that I was going
to go and actually train and fight.

157
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:12,990
I told you, I said, well, he's been looks
as big, quiet nonconfrontational guy. So,

158
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,360
um,
yeah,

159
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,710
I went and took my first
class Moitai and March 1st,

160
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,710
2010 took my first Muay Thai class and
then after like a month of doing Muay

161
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,310
Thai,
I started to see progression.

162
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,700
I started to see like my face
was slimming down all this stuff.

163
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:33,150
So it gave me motivation to
keep going. And then, um,

164
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,020
I remember going to a MMA event amateur,

165
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:40,440
and I saw really big heavyweight
guys going at it. So I was like, ah,

166
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:44,610
I think I want to do it. I want to give
it a try. And, uh, so my coach was like,

167
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:48,180
okay, if you lose 100 pounds, I'll like,
I'll find you a fight. And I was like,

168
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,260
a hundred pounds. He's like, yeah,

169
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,470
I'll find you a fight if you
lose a hundred pounds. So, um,

170
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,500
I just kept training within 11 months,
lost 100 pounds,

171
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,470
and then took my first fight.
And then she been like,

172
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,070
every fight has been until now because
it's like now I have like more of a drive

173
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,310
and a passion for it, but all the way up
until then, everything kind of happened.

174
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:13,200
By coincidence or just like, I
just, I didn't really want to fight,

175
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:16,050
but I had a lot of people like, oh,
you're so good. Like keep doing it.

176
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:19,890
And I was the first time in my life I've
ever had people supporting me to like

177
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:24,891
really do something that was big and I
was a new guy and I was in shape and I

178
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,670
can, you know, girls are noticing
me now. I'm like all either,

179
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,970
my whole life changed within a
year of training MMA. Like wow.

180
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,260
From going to this guy that nobody even
paid attention to, to just like, oh, hey,

181
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,860
how's it going? Are you know,
like, oh, you're so in shape.
And I was just like, oh,

182
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:44,490
this is weird. It's still weird. It's
only been nine years, eight years,

183
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,360
you know? So everything is
still very new to me. I've only,

184
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,780
my first day stepping on the mat was like,
you know,

185
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,590
nine years ago did. That's
an amazing story. It's crazy.

186
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,530
That's like a legit success
story. Yeah. It's, you know, is,

187
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:03,930
is that you look at a ridiculous
ringtone. Do you have sir? Is that,

188
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,810
so I thought I turned it off. What
is that? It's just like stock iPhone.

189
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,420
I wasn't though. You ventured
into the options. Yeah.

190
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,540
Went down in there. Yes, sir.
Um, so yeah, that's like,

191
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,320
that's kind of how everything
started. And then with three, five,

192
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,350
three or four fights, and then I
tried out for the ultimate fighter,

193
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,270
so I had like three or four fights
in one year being a pro and a,

194
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,390
and then the ultimate fighter trials came
out and I like tried out for that and

195
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:37,290
like made it on and I was like, Oh shit.
So most of my career has been in the UFC.

196
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,490
Wow.
Yeah.

197
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,250
[inaudible].
