00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:01.708
- [Instructor] The function f is defined

00:00:01.708 --> 00:00:03.719
over the real numbers.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.839
This table gives a few values of f.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.171
So when x is equal to negative 4.1,

00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.926
f of x is negative five.

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:14.426
F of negative 4.01

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:16.625
is negative 55,

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:18.121
so they give us a bunch of values

00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:20.762
for different x's of what f of x would be.

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:24.661
What is a reasonable
estimate for the limit

00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:28.244
as x approaches negative four of f of x.

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:30.837
So let's think about what's happening.

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:33.559
To think of a reasonable
estimate for the limit

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.707
as x approaches negative four,

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:37.140
we'd want to think about well,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.631
what does it look like the
function is approaching

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.070
as x approaches negative four

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.504
from values less than negative four,

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:47.038
so that's what we have here on the table.

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:48.264
And then we'd also want to think about

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:51.297
well, what does it look like
our function is approaching

00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:53.495
as x approaches negative four

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:56.743
from values greater than
negative four from the right.

00:00:56.743 --> 00:00:57.984
So this is approaching,

00:00:57.984 --> 00:00:59.797
this is what is f of x approaches,

00:00:59.797 --> 00:01:01.855
x approaches negative four from the left?

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:03.484
This is what is f of x approaching

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:07.686
as x approaches negative
four from the right?

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.749
So let's think about it.

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:13.778
When x is negative 4.1,
we're at negative five.

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:16.703
Then we're at negative 4.01,

00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:19.056
we go to negative 55.

00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:22.803
And then when we get to negative 4.001,

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:26.051
so we're only 1/1000
away from negative four,

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.968
we get to negative 555.

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:34.601
So this just seems to get
larger and larger and larger

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:38.518
and then at negative
four, it's negative 5,555.

00:01:39.943 --> 00:01:41.784
So this is interesting.

00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:45.229
There could be a scenario
where this is getting more and,

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.106
this is getting infinitely negative

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:48.978
as we get close to negative four.

00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:52.031
And that negative four then jumps back up

00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:53.531
to negative 5,555.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:02:00.422
Or this is a situation where
we are at negative four.

00:02:00.422 --> 00:02:03.228
We're just kind of approaching
this value right over here.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:05.986
It's unclear based on the
information in the table.

00:02:05.986 --> 00:02:08.059
Now let's think about what's happening

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:10.542
as we approach from the right.

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:12.618
So at negative 3.9, we're at five.

00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:15.056
Negative 3.99, we're at 55.

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:17.473
Negative 3.999, we go to 555.

00:02:19.248 --> 00:02:21.139
So this seems to be getting larger

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.004
and as we get closer and
closer to negative four

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.852
as x gets closer and closer to
negative four from the right,

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:28.778
it looks like f of x is getting larger

00:02:28.778 --> 00:02:29.749
and larger and larger.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.982
It's not going more and more negative.

00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:35.312
So as I mentioned if you
wanted to think about scenarios

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:37.005
of what might be happening here,

00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:38.197
we don't know for sure because remember

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:41.081
when we're using a table
we're just taking samples.

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:45.265
So let me let me draw what
could be happening here.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:49.245
Once again, we don't know
for sure just by sampling.

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:50.678
But once again, they just want us to get

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:52.230
a reasonable estimate.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.122
So that's the x-axis

00:02:54.122 --> 00:02:56.039
and that is the y-axis.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.330
And we care about x equals negative four.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.264
So let's say that this is

00:03:03.264 --> 00:03:06.731
this is x equals negative
four right over here,

00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.483
x equals negative four.

00:03:08.483 --> 00:03:10.104
So there's a couple of scenarios.

00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:14.271
There's one scenario where
it's doing something like this,

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:17.245
where it's doing something like this,

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:20.736
where it's just going to negative 5,555

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.976
and so this isn't at the same scale.

00:03:22.976 --> 00:03:26.795
So there's this scenario
where this right over here

00:03:26.795 --> 00:03:28.295
is negative 5,555.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.477
But then from the right,

00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:34.267
you're doing something
completely different,

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:35.323
or not completely different,

00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:36.740
you're going in the opposite direction.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.536
So from the right, it looks like this.

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:40.481
You're just getting larger
and larger and larger,

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:44.260
just getting more and
more and more and more.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.494
I guess as you get closer
and closer to negative four

00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:47.509
from the right

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.539
maybe you're going to positive infinity

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.366
or maybe you're going to,

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.262
well we don't know based on this data.

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:54.270
It looks like it could just be

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.278
going unbounded to positive infinity

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:58.793
and then right at negative four

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:00.876
you go to negative 5,555.

00:04:01.753 --> 00:04:04.232
In this situation, you would have no limit

00:04:04.232 --> 00:04:05.773
at x equals negative four.

00:04:05.773 --> 00:04:07.603
Even though the function is defined there,

00:04:07.603 --> 00:04:08.699
you would have no limit,

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.283
because when you approach from the right,

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.784
you're going to positive infinity.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.003
When you approach from the left,

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.749
you're either going to negative infinity

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:18.567
or you're going to the
value negative 5,555.

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:20.476
Another scenario that might be happening

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:21.577
as we approach from the left

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:23.253
might be something like this.

00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:25.253
It might be approaching,

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:30.259
it might be approaching negative infinity.

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.537
And then you just jump back up

00:04:32.537 --> 00:04:34.159
to this value right over here.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.539
So let me erase this
one just so you can see

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.116
what I'm talking about.

00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:39.287
So this is another scenario

00:04:39.287 --> 00:04:40.781
that right at negative four,

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.479
so from either side it looks like you are,

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.739
you have an asymptote going on.

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:47.797
So from either side you have

00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:49.999
this vertical asymptote right over here.

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.021
So as you approach from the left,

00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:53.107
you're going to negative infinity.

00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:54.012
As you approach from the right,

00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:55.029
you're going to positive infinity,

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.004
but right at negative four,

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.314
you're defined at this value.

00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:58.796
So this is another possibility.

00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:01.758
But in this case as well,
there's no limit here.

00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:04.369
You're not approaching
the same finite value

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:05.989
from both sides.

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:08.006
Now one thing that you'll sometimes see is

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:09.370
if people think that okay,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.005
if you're approaching the same,

00:05:11.005 --> 00:05:13.918
either from both sides you're
approaching positive infinity

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:16.272
or from both sides you're
approaching negative infinity.

00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:20.382
Sometimes people say, "Oh
my limit is infinity."

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:22.008
Or "My limit is negative infinity."

00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:24.287
So let's say you have
a situation like this

00:05:24.287 --> 00:05:26.454
where from, at some value,

00:05:28.243 --> 00:05:30.165
and you're think about
the limit as you approach,

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:31.782
as x approaches that value,

00:05:31.782 --> 00:05:32.755
as you approach from either side,

00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:35.573
you're going to positive infinity.

00:05:35.573 --> 00:05:39.070
Well formerly you still wouldn't
say the limit is infinity,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.746
because a limit formally is a finite value

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:43.860
that you are actually approaching.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.078
So in any of these scenarios,

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.011
especially the scenario that we see here

00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:48.502
where you're going to
positive infinity here,

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:49.543
negative infinity,

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:53.501
or you're going to negative 5,555 here,

00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.317
the limit does not exist.

00:05:55.317 --> 00:05:57.650
So let me just circle that.
