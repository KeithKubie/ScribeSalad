1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,530
Okay.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,170
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon?

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:07,290
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast and ahhh

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,120
just checking. Yeah,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,100
just checking in on you. I'm
just checking in on your, hello.

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,940
This is Susan Blue's team calling. Um,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,910
that's a character I see. We still
call up a buddy of mine all the time.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,960
They pretend to be as casting director
and I would just call them up with the

9
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:32,120
worst fucking auditions. Every, hello?
This is Susan Bloomstein calling.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,720
I have an audition for
you with flora feature.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,800
Okay.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Do you have a problem with being naked
around other men in positions that

13
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:47,360
involves you staring at your
ankles? If you have a prob, if not,

14
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:51,290
give me a cool stupid shit like
that. It was always like, you know,

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,590
something that I guess would be considered
homophobic as instead of just being

16
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:56,330
funny, you know?

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,500
Is it homophobic to suggest that he would
be uncomfortable staring at his ankle?

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,480
Ankles, I should say.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,250
Yeah,

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,580
and the company of other men.
I don't know what's going on.

21
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:12,660
How was your Thursday? Did you get paid
today? Huh? Did they write some numbers?

22
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,650
On a piece of paper and then you stuck
it in a machine and somehow you can get

23
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:18,650
waffles. Okay.

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,293
Yeah, man.

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,740
All the money's in the air now.
I don't know where it is. Yeah,

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,910
no safe to say either. Some white
dude has all of it. Russian dude,

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,940
which his guest is a white dude, but
white dude means American dude, right?

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,390
Or English, right? Russian
dude or Chinese dude.

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,000
One of them's got it. Maybe somebody
in Singapore. He has all the money,

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,560
Japanese guy. And of course you've
got the fucking Saudi princess.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,690
They got something like six
people have it all right now.

32
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,240
And the rest of us just get pieces
of paper with numbers on it.

33
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:54,410
But as long as we believe in it,
no matter what they say on TV,

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,780
no matter how bad they say it's getting,

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,410
as long as we just continue
to fucking believe in it,

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,610
just keep writing numbers to each
other. Right? Next thing you know,

37
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:07,690
I got a shirt. You got a
Taco? Everybody's happy.

38
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,560
Susan Blum, Steen colleague. Um, anyways,

39
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,820
uh, so here's what's going on with
me last night. Me and the lovely Nia.

40
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,160
My beautiful lady,

41
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,940
we went down and saw a ag pop.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480
He has a new album out the post pop
depression and I'm basically like 90% of

43
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,130
Queens of the stone age.
Who was backing him up? Uh,

44
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,590
John Theatre was not on drums,
um, but it was pretty much,

45
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:44,591
I think the rest of the band and Iggy
pop out model was fucking amazing show.

46
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,500
I'd lucked into these tickets.
I was doing a comedy show.

47
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,380
I ran into somebody that
works for the band. They said,

48
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,660
we've got a couple extra
tickets. Do you want to go?

49
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:55,450
My freckle stood up at
attention and of course I went,

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,580
I went down there and God damn it, what
an amazing show. Silverman opened up,

51
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,450
she fucking crushed it.
And I'm Maggie Pot man.

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,140
There's a bucket list
right there. Bucket list.

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,450
Wanted to go see the guy
fucking comes out there, right?

54
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:14,500
He's got it on a sports coat with no
shirt underneath that. He's 68 years old.

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,660
All right. After one song,

56
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:19,870
the code is gone and he's
prance around with no shirt on.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,670
68 years old.

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,370
It was some fucking shit guy. Just
doesn't give a fuck. I'm gonna fuck,

59
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,550
I'm going to post a picture of
the guy. You know what I mean?

60
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,160
He's still in great shape, you know? Sure.

61
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,460
There's a little less this city issues
here or there with the skin, but I mean,

62
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:39,550
other than that, the guy looks like he
can do more pushups than I could ever do.

63
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,610
I hope I look that good
at his age. You know,

64
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,640
when he's still got that beautiful
Marsha Brady fucking haircut.

65
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,380
Gorgeous hair. Oh God. I was jealous. Um,

66
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,890
anyways, the band absolutely
fucking smashed it.

67
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,480
He was all over the stage. Um, it was,

68
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,280
it was fucking incredible,
man. It was just,

69
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,230
it just an absolutely amazing night.

70
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:09,010
And then me and Nia finished it off
as much as I'm trying to get in shape.

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,120
One of the great things to do out here
in Los Angeles is to hit your favorite

72
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,360
fucking Taco truck or
late night taco spot. Um,

73
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,410
it's just the best. And there was one a,

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,580
I got a buddy of mine cut another comedian
for shot who's like a connoisseur of

75
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,560
all the taco trucks.
I was basically a guy,

76
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,620
I went down just east of the
fucking one west of the one 10,

77
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,060
um, you know, and like Beverly Boulevard,
what do you got? And He fucking,

78
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,950
he gave me like three taco trucks,

79
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,420
like Google mapped all the way back to
my house and we ended up stopping off at

80
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:48,250
one and a, Oh fuck. I didn't
get any Tacos, actually.

81
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,480
Got a God damn case of DHEA,

82
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,560
which is the classic default
White Guy Order at a taco truck.

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,130
You know. Can I get a chicken
case today? Can I get one away?

84
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,450
I'll be technically that you said even
Mexican is she has changed with chicken.

85
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,540
Hell, we do that. Um, it was
just a, a, a, a great night.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,440
And um, another night where
I didn't smoke a cigar.

87
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,340
I haven't smoked a cigar since
February 16th. And uh, you know,

88
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:22,170
you have a problem with something when
you know the exact date, you know of,

89
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,140
uh, when you stopped doing
it, you know other shit.

90
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,710
If you just don't give a fuck, you just
like, you want to go to McDonald's?

91
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:33,090
Yeah, no. When's the last
time you ate there? Oh,

92
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:36,030
I don't know man. I spent
a while. We'll get year.

93
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,340
That's when you don't have a
price. That's, that's when,

94
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,560
if there was an issue of addiction,

95
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:42,390
it's just completely out
of your fucking life.

96
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:46,770
But I know the exact date was
February 16th. I know where I was.

97
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,800
I know what I smoked and I know
what I felt like when I had it.

98
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:53,160
And I've been thinking about
it every fucking day and I'm,

99
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,030
I'm trying to go on a little
bit of a run here. Cause if, uh,

100
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,840
I don't cut the shit out of my life this
summer, I will be a four years smoker.

101
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,500
Like what the fuck?
What am I doing? Um, so,

102
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,980
but I've been holding fast with
these uh, fast are holding strong,

103
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,990
whatever the fucking expression is.
I only have two a month. Alright.

104
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,400
I two in January,

105
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,350
two and a half in February
because I started smoking
when it wasn't lit well and

106
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,100
I've got another one, so I have one and
a half that nice. That's not bad. Right?

107
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,550
Come on. You guys aren't doctors
generally speaking? I should be all right.

108
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:33,440
My Body can handle that. Two and a have
fucking days. I mean two and a half,

109
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,100
two a month. Once every 14 days.

110
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,850
I still fucking stupid. Maybe
I'll just go down to one a month.

111
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,640
I want to be special occasion guy. I
figure I'll smoke one at the rose bowl.

112
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,810
Smoke one super bowl Sunday my birthday.

113
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,703
Uh,

114
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,740
what else you got flagged day then.
I don't give a fuck about that.

115
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,540
It's a bunch of Jewish
holidays in September.

116
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,380
I am in show business as a nod to
them. That'd be really selfish.

117
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:10,720
Like I give a shit, right? Like
I give a shit about, you know,

118
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,370
like I'm actually acknowledging
another religions. Real reasons I was,

119
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:18,260
I'm just looking for an
excuse to smoke a cigar tall.

120
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,210
My Jewish brothers and sisters
out there and a sign of support.

121
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
What are you going to deal, Bill? Huh?

122
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,250
Make a donation to the
museum of tolerance. No,

123
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:32,251
I am going to smoke a Cuban cigar
and honor to all of your wonderful

124
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:37,060
contributions to comedy in show business.

125
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,680
Okay.

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,990
Like for a year, that
would be perfect. Right?

127
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:45,470
There's not a fucking doctor on
the planet. They always got it.

128
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:47,930
They always get it. That job
is just a rain on your parade.

129
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,060
I saw if I went in and say, doc, look,
I smoked for a year. Is that bad?

130
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:56,030
And be a getaway. You know, it's, you
know, it's not bad, but they always go.

131
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,240
Ideally. Yeah.

132
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:04,241
Ideally I'd live in a fucking bubble and
I would be breathe perfect fucking air

133
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:06,770
and I would drink clean
water and I have, um,

134
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,580
a microbiotic what the fuck are you
doing doc? You gotta be doing something

135
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,180
going in here, taking
everybody's blood pressure,

136
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,460
all God damn day looking
at fucking skin tags.

137
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,560
You're telling me you
don't have an outlet?

138
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,623
Um,

139
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,380
I dunno. So anyways, having settled
that probably smoke word next week,

140
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,390
but I liked this month, this
month is going good because,

141
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,900
um, you know, I've already
like, you know, my,

142
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,870
the first two months of the year
I really feel like I should,

143
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,180
my hands should be shaking as I'm
talking about, this is so bad.

144
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,130
I want to smoke. I, uh,

145
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,410
I had my first one January 1st and
then January 8th I had the second one.

146
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,280
I was like, fuck,

147
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,370
the month isn't even half over and I
going to white knuckle at the rest of the

148
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,070
way. And then I did it again in February.

149
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,250
I smoked more on like the fifth and then
one on like this I guess the 16th then

150
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,720
I got another two fucking weeks.

151
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,830
So now I feel like I'm ahead of
the game cause it's like the 10th.

152
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,230
If I can just make it to like the 15th,

153
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,853
you know,

154
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,350
then I can actually go on a run and
do one every week for four weeks.

155
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,750
Then white knuckle it through
April. Oh, it just sucks.

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,050
How come everything fun
fucking kills you. You know,

157
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,470
just fucking kills you sitting around
Eating Goddamn yogurt by the way.

158
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,690
You know, I figured out what was
causing the train, not the lead,

159
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,810
the fucking station. I became
mobilly Parfait, right.

160
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:34,470
And I went down to this shoe shop and
they will fucking raving about this.

161
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,460
You know, this all natural
yogurt with coconut in it.

162
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,900
You know all that probiotic has
probiotics in it. This is, you know,

163
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,730
this isn't negative biotics. This is
positive pro. This is proactive biotic.

164
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,900
You have two kinds of bacteria within
your intestinal tract. Shut the fuck up.

165
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:54,510
I put this stuff in them. I
couldn't, I couldn't shit for days.

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,560
I just kept beating it cause they that
down at the juice shack there. Right.

167
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:01,290
They kept telling me how
healthy it was and a little did.

168
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,020
A little did I know I was
building like a fucking wall.

169
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,610
You know what sets city?
They're in Greece with all,

170
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
it's the whole city's just a
bunch of white walls, you know?

171
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,230
That's what I was building in my stomach.
Where are you built? I don't know.

172
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:19,230
It's the first thing I thought
of. I go fuck yourself. You know,

173
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,130
I'd like to see you not shit for three
days and try to dance around it and keep

174
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:27,360
it funny. Okay. How did
I get this mood? Um,

175
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,840
then he was, hold on one second. Hold
on. Nancy Reagan died. Everybody,

176
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,750
yeah,

177
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,230
she died and a lot of people were
really upset about that. You know,

178
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,250
she was a great woman. I'll tell
you what made her great. Uh, the,

179
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,940
the shape she kept herself in,

180
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,640
considering her husband had jelly
beans all over the fucking place.

181
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:49,180
The fact that she could just say
no to those goddamn things, right.

182
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,470
Walking around. There's something
about being that skinny though.

183
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:56,260
After a while though, it's just
like you live for fucking ever,

184
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,120
but you just get like a bird person.

185
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,903
You know?

186
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,470
Like if she was my, uh, grandmother,

187
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,030
I would have built like a giant bird cage
that are hung from the ceiling I just

188
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,460
made. I'd make it go in there
and perch on it, you know,

189
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,850
I'm not opening the door unless you
tell me. I'm still in the, well Nancy.

190
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,250
All right. I guess I would say
grandma Reagan's Greg and um,

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,801
all right, this one, there's been,

192
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,780
this whole podcast has gone off the
fucking rails, so too goddamn distracted.

193
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,930
Him talking about putting dead first
ladies and birdcages. That's not right,

194
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,820
is it? He's such a weird fellow that
Reagan, some people you talked to,

195
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,080
he singlehandedly defeated
the Russians. Reality is,

196
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,440
didn't he come off the fucking bench
and he did. He hit the last three.

197
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,920
You know, he the dagger, he
put the game away. I would say,

198
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,900
you know,

199
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,990
by tricking them into thinking that we
were actually going to have shit up and

200
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:50,360
outer space to stop this
shit from coming over here.

201
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,413
You know,

202
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,040
that's a weird

203
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,070
thing about trying to bomb somebody from
the other side of the fucking world.

204
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,520
If you're too lazy to fly over, you
got to start. You got to shoot him.

205
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,760
Remember Robert Parishes foul
shot. You remember the rainbow.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,960
That's how you got to do it.

207
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,820
You actually got to send it in
because of the curvature of the earth.

208
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,660
You got to send it fucking up
and over. You know what I mean?

209
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,610
It's like when you're sitting on the
couch and you got a Napkin and you want to

210
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,370
throw it into a barrel, but your
fucking office chair was right there.

211
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,690
You got to go up and over.

212
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,500
You know they do that with missiles.

213
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,470
Somebody actually figured
that out sometimes.

214
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:29,230
Some super fucking intelligent
scientist guy, right.

215
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,070
As opposed to the really dumb ones that
they put in the nuclear programs. Right.

216
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:38,020
Bill, this guy had just sit
there and like figure that out.

217
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,213
You know,

218
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,320
out of our airspace ended the
troposphere up into the stratosphere.

219
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,190
Whoever the fuck it goes
right out to outer space.

220
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,230
Reedus the atmosphere without
blowing up right on the White House.

221
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,260
Nothing but president. Right. They're
just sitting there talking shit,

222
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,050
what a fucking job. You know,

223
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,830
and there's some other psycho, you
know, they got cameras in spaces,

224
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,610
some shit or somebody flying around with
that direct TV satellite on the back of

225
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:14,590
his plane just falling around.

226
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,380
Brezhnev and Gorbachev trying
to figure out where they're at.

227
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,820
So they always have the exact
coordinates. That's what it,

228
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,550
that's the level of stress like
Obama has and all these guys.

229
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:28,840
That's why they age like 90 years.
Cause they know the other team, right?

230
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,940
They go and Billy Belicheck on a,
you know they got cameras on you,

231
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:35,350
right on the top of your fucking
head, wherever you go. You know,

232
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,191
I'd be all parent.

233
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,940
I'd be doing fucking head fakes as I
was walking down the hall to the Oval

234
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,430
Office. Right. I wouldn't even
go in the Oval Office saying,

235
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,320
I'm not going in there. I
would have, I'd have a double,

236
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,080
I'd always be down in
the basement, you know.

237
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,530
Then years later after I died, you know,

238
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,590
all my staff would start fucking
coming out talking shit about me.

239
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,730
He's a very fearful man for all
the bravado during his speeches,

240
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:02,510
he spent the entire eight
years of his presidency in the,

241
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:05,500
the, well, we're not allowed
to say how far down it goes,

242
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:09,630
but let's just say there's one hell
of a basement under that house. Um,

243
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,500
do you even think he fucking lives there?
There's no fucking way he lives there.

244
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,460
He just lives there. You ever seen the
White House? It's just right there.

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,540
You know, he hasn't lived
there. I bet there's a fucking,

246
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,960
you take an elevator that's just like a,

247
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,490
and when Steve jobs used to make those
fucking speeches at those nerd fest,

248
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,160
right? They go down there, you know,

249
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,440
he come out and he's fucking jeans and
no belt and he just ah, look at Dan

250
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,930
[inaudible] and all the nerds
are like, oh God. Oh God.

251
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,020
I think that's what. Then he just
fucking Lee. Nobody knew where he lived.

252
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,430
Bye Bye.

253
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,430
What is Bill Gates have a
more reclusive fucking house.

254
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,550
Is The house reclusive bill? Does
it, does the house make the choice

255
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,220
to be introverted? Whatever. Yeah,
he has, he has a fucking house.

256
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:08,090
No one could get to.

257
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,700
I can't get anywhere fucking
near Bill Gates House. Right.

258
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,860
But the White House, you can
walk right up to the gate. Right?

259
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,380
You can come right up to it. Is
this going to put me on a list? Um,

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,380
I bet. What's his face? I Bet Bill Gates
has got a fucking, God damn, you know,

261
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:33,440
remember that stat star wars thing that
Reagan wanted to put up for fucking,

262
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:38,240
you know the Robert Parish nuclear warhead
rainbow shot from the Kremlin, right?

263
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,920
I bet he's got those for like
drones. I bet he hates drones.

264
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,140
He's all pissed off. How dare you
send my technology back there. Guy.

265
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,450
I think he's an evil motherfucker and
that's why it gives away all that money.

266
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,510
You know what I mean?
It's weird. He's like,

267
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,490
he's like the sociopath with a heart of
gold. He's kind of like Dexter. Right.

268
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,750
But if he was like in the laptop's
rather than just cutting up people,

269
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,400
but it's only the bad people. I was
never able to get past that. Look at you.

270
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,200
God Damn you look good. Really? Yeah.
Yeah. Oh yeah. What do you mean really?

271
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,260
You've got to hitch my wagon to a dog.

272
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,270
Fucking totally superficial. All right.

273
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,300
You look hot and you better keep looking
hard cause I'll tell you right now,

274
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:28,380
I'll go right down to the used car
lot and I'll start shopping. Oh yeah,

275
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,480
I'll trade gin. I'm not going to
trade you in and about. I don't know.

276
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,730
You're a classic though.

277
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,670
You're one of those those ones that's
going to last for awhile. You know,

278
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,713
I've been treating you well.

279
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,790
Changing the fluids every
3000 miles out is gross.

280
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,990
Disgusting. I'm well
thank you for saying that.

281
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:52,020
I think I feel like I went out to a show
last night and had some drinks and ate

282
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:57,790
some late night tacos. Yeah,
she did. It was so much fun.

283
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,110
Did you talk about the
show? Yeah. How about ag?

284
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Put confidence of Biggie pop going out.

285
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,580
This 68 has more swag
than all of you bitches.

286
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,060
Why are you checking the listeners?

287
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,300
I don't know cause it's funny cause
you're hung over and you don't, yeah,

288
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:16,420
I don't mean to attack the
listeners. I'm just saying. Yeah,

289
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:17,810
this wacky had out there.

290
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,510
It was the whole band and ag of course
is legendary. That was a great show.

291
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:23,890
I'm really glad I went. You know,

292
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:26,380
I wasn't feeling up to it but I'm
glad it's a great name for an album.

293
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,210
200 posts. The Post pop did a post
pop depression. Yeah, very good.

294
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,230
It was awesome.

295
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,510
And the band was all wearing custom
YSL for those of you who are in,

296
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,670
what is that? Designer clothing
YSL. Is he a San Laurel?

297
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,270
He Santa Raul. He's in Laurel. Yeah.
So they were all wearing custom YSL.

298
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,340
Even the roadies, like
the crew was wearing like,

299
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,400
like trousers and ties from
YSL, which is pretty dope.

300
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,740
Like Josh looked great in that suit,
didn't he? Whenever you say trousers,

301
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:02,090
I think of that Classic Classic Louis
C K joke when he used to talk about

302
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:06,140
whenever he does. Yeah.
When I would call phone sex,

303
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,160
he'd always get that 70 year old
woman. I'm taking off your trousers.

304
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,890
I think we need to bring Clios
water dish in here. Yeah,

305
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:19,820
cause she's laying in the sun.

306
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,370
Why don't you go do that cause or grab
another mic if you're going to be on

307
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:26,600
this. No I'm not. I just came
in today. Say Hi, I'm Jesus.

308
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:31,040
I have to go to the gym. That was one
of my favorite dumb jokes of all time.

309
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,210
What is it? Gay Horsey. Hey,

310
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,070
I'm sorry. Come on. You gotta admit
that's funny on some level. Um,

311
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,120
all right. So anyways, what
was I talking about? Oh,

312
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:50,190
I was talking about Bill
Gates Swat in a way.

313
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:55,191
The fucking drugs and having more
security than a old town there.

314
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,680
Oh, town in the fucking
a maze. Home blown. Yeah.

315
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,760
Polaroid of the sun.

316
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:04,820
Yeah,

317
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,000
she's done one hike and she's
done. It's already fucking hot out.

318
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:11,450
He had global warming Nini.
You're looking fucking good.

319
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,230
All right, Baden.

320
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,143
Oh,

321
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,530
go to the gym. Keep it looking
good. That's part of your contract.

322
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,180
Show me shut up. Um, all right.

323
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,890
I fucking hate this whole password
thing. You know, for the, I,

324
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,720
I figured out what the fuck was
wrong with my eye, my iTunes,

325
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,220
which is basically,

326
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:38,820
I can't listen to anything that I've
downloaded on my fucking laptop because I

327
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:42,300
have too many other devices that
have already been accepted by iTunes,

328
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:46,920
so I have to deactivate some other
shit. I finally figured that out.

329
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,030
I didn't figure it out. I just
went on. I went on the Internet.

330
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,210
I basically typed in, uh,
police. Give me the answer.

331
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,260
I went there looking at you to
go right back to the sun. Cleo,

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,260
she fucking loves the Sun. Um, all right.

333
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,430
What else did I want to talk about?

334
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,460
All the garage gym is becoming a reality.

335
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,670
It's be coming out

336
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,460
reality. Allie. Allie Audi.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,080
Um, no thanks to fucking rogue fitness.

338
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,850
Jesus Christ. What an arrogant
Goddamn company that is.

339
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I specifically asked that company as a
celebrity in my mind to send me a bunch

340
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:39,141
of free shit for my garage so that I
could then hype their company to my 40

341
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,950
listeners. And can you believe
this? I hope you're sitting down.

342
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:48,100
Can you believe they never
got back to me? All right.

343
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,220
Well because I'm fucking
immature. I got to go vengeance.

344
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:55,030
Now I have to add my vengeance on that
company. This is what I'm going to do.

345
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,960
I am going to buy all
of this shit from them.

346
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,640
That's what I'm going to do. And then
you know what? When they call me and say,

347
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:06,790
hey, thanks for using it, I'm not
going to take that phone call.

348
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,280
All they getting out of me is the price
they want for their fucking goods.

349
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,920
All right. Does that make any
sense? Yeah. I don't know.

350
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,740
I just throw it out there. They never
get back to me. I was half serious.

351
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:21,140
I don't like,

352
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,980
I don't like people giving me free shit
cause then they fucking own you on some

353
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:27,720
level anyways. You know. Hey, you know,

354
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,420
remember that time I gave you a chin up
bar? I mean what the fuck? All right,

355
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,850
I'll give you a ride to the airport.
Fuck you know, you just, you just,

356
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,970
you can't get out of it. You
can't get out of it. So anyways,

357
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,170
I am going to fucking do this thing up.
This is, this is, this is the game plan.

358
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,340
I'm getting that rogue fitness
thing that collapse. It, it,

359
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,820
you can fold back into the wall. I'm
getting a workout bench. You know,

360
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,660
I'm so excited for that cause I'm so
sick of going to the fucking gym and

361
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:54,490
there's always some, there's
always somebody on it.

362
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,790
I have somebody who's always
benching right. And uh,

363
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,490
I can also do squats and I'll be able
to do pull ups and then I got my atomic

364
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,740
holds and am I gonna put
those above where my truck is?

365
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,050
I'll just have to pull my truck
out, which I know kind of sucks,

366
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:12,520
but it gives a fuck. I'm going to
have an a poxy floor put in, right?

367
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,660
And then Nia wants an adjustable
speed bag over in the corner,

368
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:19,840
which is great cause all I'll have
to do is adjust it like twice.

369
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,260
And just like the bicycle I bought
her, she's never going to use it again.

370
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,960
Then I can just lock that
fucker into position. Right.

371
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,780
We'll get into dated a
boarded, a beaded above, right.

372
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,140
We're gonna have to put it in a corner.
I'm worried about the noise, you know,

373
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,500
banging on, you know, blowing out
my ear drums. Forget about that.

374
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,160
Annoying the shit out of my neighbors
because everybody out here lives on top of

375
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:40,810
one another. So, um,

376
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,790
I figured if I do that and then I'm gonna
have those interlocking rubber things

377
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:50,740
underneath all the gym area, I'll have
a place where I can skip rope. Right.

378
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,890
I can do my pull ups.

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,600
My only thing is I'm getting rid of my
pull up and dip station thing that I have

380
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,930
and I'll be able to do the pull ups
still, but I won't be able to do dips.

381
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:03,130
So if anybody knows of
an attachment that works.

382
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,160
I was thinking of just having the
handles coming out of the wall.

383
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:09,760
If they make something like that, which
would look really weird for some reason.

384
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:13,420
What are the, what is those
fucking Porto glory holes?

385
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:15,160
It's like the glory hole of fucking,

386
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,070
it's like the glory hole of
workout equipment to just
have like the dip fucking

387
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:30,540
things just coming out of the wall right
now. What have I got? A perverted mind.

388
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:34,110
What the fuck do you want from me? Uh,
how long into this fucking thing are we?

389
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:39,150
23 minutes, Michael Jordan. Alright,
here we go. Here we go. Let's, uh,

390
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,040
let's read a little bit of
advertising. All right. Oh fuck.

391
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,800
I didn't talk about self cars.

392
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:48,920
I got the biggest argument with
fucking forest shot today. Oh,

393
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:51,590
we will go and we never get an
arguments. We would just fucking eat it.

394
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,310
He's like a scientist and I'm a dope,
so that's just fucking right there.

395
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:58,490
That's just a recipe
for, to go off the rails.

396
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,790
I brought up forest
before and if you're, um,

397
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,613
okay.

398
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,220
Um, I think he's a Ted. He's
going to be in Nashville soon.

399
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,830
I'm sure he has a website.
He, uh, he actually,

400
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:13,930
he opens for Jim Jeffries all the
time. Um, he's fucking hilarious.

401
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,870
Like I would go hiking with somebody
who wasn't funny. You know what I mean?

402
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,780
It's bad enough when you get to work
with a comic that isn't that funny.

403
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:22,440
But if you're going to walk next to
him for like an hour and a half though,

404
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,700
I'll tell you that's a rough
one. You know. All right.

405
00:24:24,701 --> 00:24:28,820
Tracker or track are smart cars,

406
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:31,430
smart phones, smart homes.

407
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,700
Technology has made everything smart.

408
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,890
Abstract too, you know.
No, I like everybody says

409
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,303
okay.

410
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,070
Freddo all right.

411
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,270
But losing your stuff still makes
Matt feeble feel fucking stupid.

412
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,150
Tracker

413
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,710
makes losing things a thing of the
past tracker is a coin size device that

414
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:59,180
locates misplaced keys,
wallets, bags, computers,

415
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,860
anything in seconds. Just pair
tracker to your smartphone.

416
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,700
Attach it to anything. Put it on
your Dick. Where are my balls?

417
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:08,580
Right next to mine.

418
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,780
Yay. Thank you. Tracker. Yeah.

419
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,840
Um, you can find you get it. You get
what the fuck it is? Lose your phone.

420
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,970
Press a button. Can't
find your nuts there.

421
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:21,680
They are a with over 1.5 I hate
when they overexplain that thick.

422
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:22,820
It's like I get it. I got it.

423
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,840
The first two sentences with over 1.5
million devices tracker has the largest

424
00:25:28,271 --> 00:25:31,270
crowd gps network in the world,

425
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,760
so your last item shows up on
a map. Even if it's miles away,

426
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,450
never lose anything. Again with tracker,

430
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,820

I use brain when you got

446
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,610
technology, self-driving
fucking cars. Okay.

447
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,380
Self driving cars is so fucking stupid.

448
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:53,140
One of the great things about cars is
the amount of people that they kill every

449
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:54,910
year, which is great for the environment.

450
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,850
And then you can have these
fucking robots and it was, Ooh,

451
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,920
it's going to be great. I could stare
at my smartphone as I drive to work.

452
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,113
[inaudible]

453
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,840
gimme think all these fucking now
what are these robots? You know,

454
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:09,110
just decide one day that they're sick
of being the Goddamn Limo driver and

455
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:12,290
driving us around and they
kind of share a look, you know,

456
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,361
at a red light.

457
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:17,360
And that starts a revolution just like
in the Ukraine where it just took a

458
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:21,110
couple of jerk offs on Facebook. And
next thing you know, all Putin is going,

459
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,840
you know what? Maybe we need to
Robert Parish a little closer,

460
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,620
do a little fucking lay
up. Alright, trunk club,

461
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:32,550
everybody. If you're
anything like me, honey,

462
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,120
then you know exactly what you like and
how it is nap to the 12 down to the six

463
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:41,880
bitches, except when
you're in the wine aisle.

464
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,140
I thought that just said trannies probably
cause I was doing that fucking hacky

465
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:50,580
gay accent. Tannins and
terrors mean nothing to you.

466
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,460
It means nothing to me. I don't even
know what they are. Types of wine,

467
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:56,940
I'm guessing unless you
happen to be a fancy pants.

468
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,910
Professional sommeliers.

469
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,540
Okay.

470
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,480
I hate when people just make somebody
like your fancy pants because you

471
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:07,330
understand something that
takes a little bit of brains.

472
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,990
I respect anybody that understands why
and I like those people. They look at it,

473
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:15,220
they swirl it around, they shoved their
fucking honker in there, you know,

474
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,760
put it in their mouth.
They lived swirl around.

475
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:23,080
Let the different flavors hit
him. You know, tasting the barrel,

476
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,910
tasting history. They let it go down
there. Suffocates it hit stick. Good.

477
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,360
Okay.

478
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
They live across the debt
woman half their age,

479
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,700
the pointed something flashy and they
slip it roofie in her drink. Right.

480
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,720
They finished the pudding
commercial. Sorry. All right.

481
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,430
Okay. Where am I? Here? Okay.

482

Please include all the falling
points during your read.

483

I'll do as many as I can. How about that?

nicknames. Send you wine.

490
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:16,210
They send you wine that you will love
drinking. That's because club Daddy,

491
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,960
I can speak Spanish. Easy. Six
question quiz figures out your pallets.

494
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Debbie got a ranch is re is leading
the grape to glass wine revolution.

495
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,830
They worked directly with the
vineyards to cut out the middlemen,

496
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,510
which saves you money. Oh yeah,

497
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,610
you're gonna pay those
immigrant workers anymore money.

498
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:43,150
Then you're going to send some
of that savings. They're away.

499
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,570
Maybe they can get a new
fucking hat club. Debbie,

be fun. Not Pretentious. Why?

505
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,300
Why does it have to take
all the fucking class?

506
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,840
So I think it should be a classy goddamn
thing and I think he should take the

507
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:18,100
time to learn about it.

508
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,000

Why don't you use club Debbie? I
was safe during my watch, right?

Why can't you use this
thing to educate yourself?

511
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,350
Why does it have to all be about taking
your hands off the fucking wheel and

512
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:37,180
letting some robot pick it out
for you? Oh my tree stump. Why?

Did anybody see that fucking hilarious.

546
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:46,010
Twitter back and forth between
Kanye West in a, a dead mouse,

547
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:49,730
a dead mouse, whoever the fuck
he says, name I guess card.

548
00:32:49,731 --> 00:32:53,540
You took a screenshot and in the
fucking screenshot allegedly there was

549
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:58,541
something up there that
showed some website where he
was pirating the software.

550
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:01,970
That fucking DJ guy. So,

551
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,463
Huh?

552
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,560
Oh fuck. I gotta pause this and it
says we might have a leak somewhere.

553
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,030
Yeah. Jeez Dan, that not too
bad. Just a little fucking leak.

554
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,040
The jade trap downstairs.

555
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,510
Yeah. Never fucking ends. Um, anyways,

556
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,790
so Kanye took a screenshot
and I guess his dead mouse.

557
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,780
Dead Mouse Demo five. How the
fuck he say his name? I'm old.

558
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,810
I should know how to say it. Um,

559
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,810
I guess he made this software
that helps you make an album.

560
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:46,050
And evidently Kanye allegedly had a
website open where you could illegally

561
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,860
downloaded. So he called him out. He goes,

562
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:51,370
you're not making enough money
to pay for this software.

563
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,450
You gotta fucking pirate my shit.
And he just wrote Dick on it.

564
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:00,540
So Kanye comes back with the barrage of
Shit just trashing this DJ talking about

565
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:06,340
his mouse head. They got a fan in
there. Mike, I'm bring my daughter.

566
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:11,110
She's a big fan of Minnie mouse, blah
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

567
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,890
Just like, just like a
corporation, you know, just,

568
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:18,190
just sending reams of paper
over, like on better call Saul,

569
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:21,880
trying to fucking delay
it. But nowhere in it did.

570
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:23,740
The man denied that he didn't fall.

571
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,220
They fucking didn't steal it as far as
I could tell. He just, he just, to me,

572
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,260
he immediately capitulation
just immediately switched
it from you stole my shit

573
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,780
to Da, which with your
fucking mouse head. Right.

574
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,223
Okay.

575
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,620
I actually wanted to fucking jump into
the middle of it to give the DJ help

576
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:44,480
because he kind of was fucking
taken the bait. It was just,

577
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,220
it's like what a check
does. You know what I mean?

578
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,440
They're so fucking good at
arguing that they fucking,

579
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:52,580
they spin you off like you got them
dead to rights and by the time you come

580
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:55,610
through the whole thing you're like, I
had a fuck did I lose that? Cause they,

581
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:59,900
they got, you never reacted that shit.
He should've just laid back, you know,

582
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,580
on the ropes. Let Kanye Punch himself out
and then just say yes. So like I said,

583
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:06,890
you stole my shit, you know,

584
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,520
and how's it go with the mouse head going
to take shifts from so many who wear a

585
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,680
leather miniskirt throughout
a whole fucking tour. I mean,

586
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,180
there was so much shit
he could've said back,

587
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,360
but he should have stayed in
the pocket. I was just like,

588
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,590
I was watching that the way I was
watching like a comedian and a Heckler,

589
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,920
you know? Then I was reading, I was
rooting for the, I was rooting for the DJ.

590
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,100
There's room for the DJ in that
one, provided if that the guy stole.

591
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,040
If he didn't, either way it was
fucking entertaining, you know,

592
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,220
nice Twitter battle then. Nice.

593
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,120
Is it funny how I'm not into robots
driving cars, but I like a, I like,

594
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,780
I like it. I like a good Twitter
back and forth. You know,

595
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,990
that's the Thursday afternoon, just
before Friday, Monday morning podcast.

596
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:52,020
I'm, you come some music once again.
We always post at the MM podcast.

597
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,640
A Twitter feed will always tell you
what the music is. Andrew always posted.

598
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,730
I don't know what it is. I
am an old man. I am just,

599
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:03,630
I am just now trying to update, um,

600
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,620
my music. Oh my God. I gotta tell you
what I was doing the other day. Holy Shit.

601
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,300
I was listening to a, I
downloaded all this shit, right?

602
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,680
Alabama shakes. Fucking love the new one.
That album that they have was to shit.

603
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,190
The weekend. I'll listen to
that. Actually liked that shit.

604
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,900
I got to tell you what was
funny though was Ah, fuck.

605
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,900
I already forgot his name.
Kendrick Lamar. I'm so fucking old.

606
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,430
Help me out here guys. I,

607
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,670
I don't know anything that's going on
with any of these people. Kendrick Lamar,

608
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,490
I'm sitting there, I have to admit,

609
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,430
I did have this old guy thought and
I was embarrassed that I had it.

610
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:42,900
I was listening to his album and I get
to this song and he just keeps going.

611
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,960
This dick ain't free. Right. And I'm just,

612
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,620
and all I could just kept
thinking was this one a grammy.

613
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,900
And I'm not saying it didn't deserve it,

614
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,990
but I don't know what
the people look like,

615
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,510
who fucking vote for the grammys.

616
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:04,080
But the way people complain about it and
now they're always giving it to white

617
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,550
people. Right. Like the Oscars,

618
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:10,551
I'm imagining it's a bunch of
white people in 50s and 60s right.

619
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,361
It takes a while.

620
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:16,590
I would think to establish yourself
enough to even be considered, you know,

621
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:17,550
to be on that shit.

622
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:21,150
And I'm just picturing all these fucking
50 and 60 year old white people just

623
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,780
sitting there and listening to
these dick ain't free. Right.

624
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,950
And they go like, you know, like they
can relate to that on some level going,

625
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,130
I had this like connects with me, I'm
going to vote with this. You know,

626
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,420
they probably just drive down the hood
and stand there for 20 minutes and count

627
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:42,040
how many times somebody drives by d eight,

628
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,380
three driving by and they are right.
There's enough people listened to it.

629
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,640
We've got to give it to
them. Um, so anyways,

630
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,010
but it is the embarrassing thing I
was in, I was, I listened to too.

631
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:00,180
I got to make sure I say his name
right. It's Ed. Is it Sheehan?

632
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,440
Uh, for fuck sakes belts. You don't
know any, I did call him with this guy.

633
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,360
He was fucking great. I think he's
great. I just don't fuck it. Sharon.

634
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,240
Sharon will go share it. And
I was listening to his album

635
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,700
and I was this, I was
listening to that song. One,

636
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,840
I was listening to Ed Sheeran, one in, uh,

637
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,430
in a Toyota Prius and I was sitting
there going, I am enjoying this.

638
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,860
Like what happened to me? I used to
be, I and I used to fucking listen.

639
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,723
I want to happen.

640
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:37,800
Okay.

641
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,560
But when I really look back at the
shit that I used to think was bad,

642
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:43,830
as some of it was bad as
stuff, a lot of it, you know,

643
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:48,030
say which people will say about a
sensitive fellow like this Ed Eddie here,

644
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:51,030
right. You know, he does dress like a man,

645
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,320
unlike the bands that I listened to in
the 80s where they came up just full on.

646
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,140
Not only did they dress like chicks,

647
00:38:58,141 --> 00:39:01,600
they dress like hot chicks
trying to hang on. They, they,

648
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,750
they were really like the first house,

649
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:08,550
a real housewives when you look back
at a lot of it, you know what I mean?

650
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,100
Um, I guess still they were still in
their prime in their twenties. Um,

651
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,210
I dunno. So whatever those are the
albums that I was listening to this week.

652
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,540
I literally went from 1970 82,

653
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,970
you know, I went from
like 19, I don't know,

654
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,010
late sixties to late eighties was what
the Fuck I've been listening to for the

655
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:35,250
last, I don't know how many since I
worked in a fucking warehouse in the 80s.

656
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,470
And then I immediately went
to like 2014, 2015, 2016.

657
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:42,690
And uh, I, I survived.

658
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,650
I somehow survived and I actually
enjoy the shit so it, um, I dunno,

659
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,720
I dunno if it's going to help me. I
don't know what the point of it is,

660
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,640
but all I know is it's, it's

661
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,150
okay.

662
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,740
I don't know. That's funny to me. This
deck eight free Lao of, of the year.

663
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,010
Um, I'll listen to it
more. I'll try to, I mean,

664
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:07,660
it's going into some really white ears
here though. It's probably actually a,

665
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,883
uh,

666
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,800
it probably says more about him
as an artist if I don't get it,

667
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,100
you know what I mean? Then if I get it,
he probably doesn't want me to get it.

668
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:21,150
Like, I don't want some 48 year
old white guy like in my shit.

669
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:27,300
Um, oh, maybe I'm wrong. The fuck
do I know. Anyways, fuck off.

670
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,100
I'll talk to you on Monday.

671
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,243
[inaudible] [inaudible]

672
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:27,400
[inaudible]

673
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,850
hey, what's going on? And spelt births
the Monday morning podcasts on Monday,

674
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,190
June 14th, 2010. How the hell

675
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,330
are you? Are you good? Did
you have a good weekend?

676
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,950
Did you, did you go down to that place
with the thing I heard it was nice.

677
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,400
What's it nice? It is
nice. All that's nice.

678
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,040
My son,

679
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,940
he had a recital this weekend
and we were so nervous.

680
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,600
He was all a flustered and more suburban.

681
00:41:56,601 --> 00:42:01,100
Talk about shit that nobody cares about
because frank was in the back with the

682
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,080
garden hose. It froze up over the wedding.

683
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,720
So we have to buy a new
one of those. So you know,

684
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,070
Frank Corsi goes on the Internet and he
just starts researching all about those

685
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,740
holos houses. Okay. All
right. Yeah. I don't know.

686
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:21,460
Can you imagine just these sitting there
at the end of a culdesac like that is

687
00:42:21,461 --> 00:42:26,050
your fucking reality. Rather
than having a wine cellar,

688
00:42:26,051 --> 00:42:30,220
I would just have a secret room of
fucking porn with Kleenex for me.

689
00:42:30,221 --> 00:42:34,660
The rub one out or just sit there
crying at what became of my life.

690
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,410
I need, can you go out
and fix his bicycle? No.

691
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,300
Why doesn't he go climb a fucking tree?

692
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,360
Yeah.

693
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,270
Jesus Christ. What? What did they
do in the 18 hundreds you want to?

694
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:48,760
Why the environment so fucked
up? That's it right there buddy.

695
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:54,130
You just don't want to go out. It'd be
a part of your kids' lives. I don't.

696
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,480
That's why I told you I enjoyed
condoms. I didn't enjoy condoms.

697
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,530
I just didn't want to bust one in
you without one on and now I did.

698
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,580
And now look at it. Look at my face
sweetheart. Can't you see the misery?

699
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,063
Fuck them.

700
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,310
Well, he half looks like, Yo, you go
fix this fucking bike. I'm not yelling.

701
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,510
I'm no, I'm not

702
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,243

703
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,633
first testicle.

704

[inaudible] somewhat tunic and
dangle master the forest with the

705
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,820
[inaudible]. I can show you the trade
case files to these guys, to his cohorts,

706
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:46,654
asleep in the chair.

707
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:02,960
[inaudible]

708
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,080
twice. Don't take shit from
anybody. Question Mark, Bill.

709
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:09,380
Sometimes you end your podcast with go
fuck yourselves and don't take shit from

710
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:13,610
anyone. Well, let me tell you
my story. Back in November,

711
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,880
a cop pulled me over, roughed me up,

712
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,040
was a huge asshole and wrote up
every rinky dinky ticket he could.

713
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,970
Okay, now wait a minute. What happened?

714
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,450
You were just driving down the street
and this guy just pulled you over.

715
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,120
I need a little bit of the backstory.
Here was this guy, did you know,

716
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:37,320
did he get into a big fight with his wife
and then took it out on you or we did

717
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:41,030
you say something wise to the
guy and he said, all right,

718
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,520
I'm not in the fucking mood anyways,
let's see if we can figure it out here.

719
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,190
At the end of the
altercation, I shook his hand,

720
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:50,490
look him straight in the eyes
and gave him that look that says,

721
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,230
I will see you in court, asshole.

722
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,110
I showed up in court this
Monday to defend myself.

723
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,000
My plan was to stand before that asshole
and having him explain his actions to

724
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:02,200
me in a court of law. And Dude,

725
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,540
this ain't gonna workout unless she
had a witness. I wanted to ask him.

726
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,770
Even then, that doesn't work out.

727
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,420
I wanted to ask them if twisting my arm
so much that I couldn't use it for a few

728
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,380
days was justified. I wanted to ask
him why he decided that me five,

729
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,810
six 175 pounds was a threat to him.

730
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,050
Six foot to six foot three 250
that he need to hit me from behind.

731
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,510
Um, don't call me an Asshole, but
I'm not 100% by in this story.

732
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,550
Cause you didn't say what
happened before this.

733
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,200
This guy just did this. Is this guy
like the fucking worst cop ever?

734
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,630
I don't know. Here we go. I wanted to,

735
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,740
I wanted to know why he needed to demean
me while I was handcuffed in the back

736
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:47,730
of the patty wagon.

737
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,620
I then wanted to ask him
how many excessive force
complaints he had against him.

738
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,590
The answer is four of
shit. So I'm wrong here.

739
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,230
I wanted to ask him
how his marriage ended.

740
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:02,380
His ex wife has a restraining
order against him for
domestic violence. Alright,

741
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,220
I tap out. You're right.
You're right. Sorry. Uh,

742
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,940
I wanted to ask him what part of
protect and serve did he not understand?

743
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:12,510
I wanted to end the questioning with him
explaining how he got caught on a cell

744
00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:14,880
phone camera. Assaulting a motorist.

745
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,020
You can look up the video on
youtube under Milwaukee police.

746
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:24,480
Lambeau driver, l a m B o driver.
Here's what sucks in Milwaukee.

747
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,100
If the cop that wrote you the ticket,
this doesn't show up in court,

748
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,090
your case is dismissed and you don't
have to pay anything. Well, guess,

749
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:37,150
guess why I told you that the piece
of shit didn't show up in court. Ah,

750
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,420
that's awful. I need advice.

751
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:44,320
Do I let this all be water under the
bridge or do I take this fucker down?

752
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:47,350
I really want justice, but I don't
want to be beaten by other cops.

753
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:50,650
What should I do? Um,

754
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:56,950
well I think you just shed some light.
Milwaukee police, Lambeau driver.

755
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,940
All my listeners will probably
look up and watch that. Um,

756
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,320
no, this guy sounds like a dangerous guy.

757
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,480
Look, you know, this is,

758
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:12,990
this is what I would do if I was
going to try to take this dude down.

759
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:16,140
What I would do is, you know what
the local news loves doing now.

760
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:21,350
They love showing like youtube videos
and they love talking about Twitter and

761
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:24,810
all that type of stuff because they're
desperately trying to get the kids in

762
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:29,680
people cause they're losing all this
viewership to a, to the Internet.

763
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:30,310
So the fact

764
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,010
that you, you have this
controversial thing,

765
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,510
you have this fucked up law and you
have a youtube video of this guy,

766
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,330
um, that makes, that's like one of
those perfect little pieces, you know,

767
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,530
coming up next Milwaukee police
officer a little out of line,

768
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,370
check out the youtube video that
everybody's been talking about,

769
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:56,640
all the lower that you could go that
way. Uh, but yeah, I mean you're,

770
00:47:56,641 --> 00:48:00,110
you're taking a a, you're definitely
going to take a fucking risk.

771
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,593
Um,

772
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,441
you know, so you know,

773
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:08,160
Rodney King died this week and that
brought up that whole video and all that

774
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:11,400
type of shit. And I know, you
know, the guy just pulled over.

775
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,420
That's what you supposed to
do. I know. I mean, look,

776
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,450
whose kid knew Rodney King was going to
get beat down no matter what. I mean,

777
00:48:18,451 --> 00:48:21,390
if you've run from the fucking cops,
I don't give a fuck who you are.

778
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,310
You've got to get beat down.
But if you get back up,

779
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:26,730
you charge him a couple of times
absent fucking loosely. But you know,

780
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,600
there's gotta be a way to take a guy
down without giving them 12 fucking skull

781
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:35,520
fractures. You know what I'm saying?
It's, I don't know. It's, it's, it's,

782
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,400
it's a fucking fabulous job and then
it's a really dangerous job. If,

783
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:46,840
if the wrong kind of person
gets, uh, gets the job,

784
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:51,650
why didn't my phone just
go off? Oh, that's right. I
gotta do that Shit. So, um,

785
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,950
I don't know. Personally, I can't,

786
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,060
I can't ever watch that
Rodney King thing again.

787
00:48:56,061 --> 00:49:00,470
That's like fucking most brutal thing
ever. And actually when you watch that,

788
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,750
now you go, thank God they got fucking a,

789
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,390
what do you call those things? Taser.
What do you call? What do you Cleo,

790
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,980
what do you call those things? What
do they call those things that you,

791
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:14,680
they just, uh, they zap you.
Do you guys ever see that one?

792
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,150
Um, that one where they, the cop.

793
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,160
What the fuck do you call those
things? He got tased. He got fucking,

794
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:28,400
is it a taser? Cleo? Why am I so dumb?

795
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,390
Ah, fucking love this dog.

796
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,410
You know that Cleo? MMM.

797
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:42,110
Underrated. Having a dog. It's the
best fucking thing ever. Anyways, this,

798
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,790
this I got, I got to get you this
youtube video. Now that I brought it up.

799
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:47,820
It's a, it's basically,

800
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,450
they're doing a demonstration
of one of those fucking things.

801
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:53,520
Whatever the fuck you call
them. That I just can't think,

802
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,210
why do I keep saying it's a taser?
I know. It's not a, is it a taser?

803
00:49:57,211 --> 00:50:01,320
He got tazed. I don't care.
Fuck it. My brain is mush.

804
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,370
So anyways, there's one cop
gonna Zap another cop to a,

805
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,870
the demonstrate it to
the class and look, man,

806
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,880
I don't give a fuck how
much of a man you are.

807
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:14,910
You get fucking Zap with electricity.
You're going to make a noise.

808
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,540
Most guys go like all raw and
they fucking go down a, um,

809
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,750
this guy fucking shoots it at the guy.

810
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:27,120
And this dude sounds like he's
like ending an opera. He gets,

811
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,243
he's like

812
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,170
just fucking drunk. He does literally

813
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,950
something like that and drops.

814
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,630
And I just love how the cop who shoots
them tries to act like he just didn't

815
00:50:40,631 --> 00:50:44,710
scream out like a little fucking
girl. Man. It's hilarious. But uh,

816
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,800
but getting back to that, yeah,
dude, that's, that's a serious, um,

817
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,910
that's a serious thing.
And you and you, you know,

818
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,060
if this guy really is
as bad as you're saying,

819
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,913
you know,

820
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,780
the right thing is not to let it go.

821
00:50:58,781 --> 00:51:01,600
The right thing is to try and shed some
light on it and hopefully that they can

822
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:05,320
get this guy off the force because
he's given decent cops a bad name.

823
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,840
There you go. So, but your,
your worries are definitely a,

824
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,160
you know, valid.

825
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,700
I mean, considering none of those
cops during the Rodney King,

826
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:23,330
none of them got fucking, they got,
they got off. He can get off doing that.

827
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:26,820
I mean, Jesus Christ, you know,

828
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:30,330
that dude who shot that kid on that
platform and in Oakland that was fucking

829
00:51:30,331 --> 00:51:33,900
brutal. He's like, oh, I thought
it was my a was my house keys.

830
00:51:33,901 --> 00:51:37,050
I didn't realize it was my gun.
And he fucking got away with that.

831
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,910
I'm not trashing cops, I'm just saying,
I'm not saying they're all fucking bad,

832
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:45,630
but I'm just saying it's a, it's
practically fucking impossible.

833
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,433
Um,

834
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,550
it literally, even if you have video,

835
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:55,410
I think you have to have the combination
of having video and then you have to

836
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:56,244
be,

837
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,240
you have to be a certain level of a
wealth and influence because if you're

838
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:07,380
broke, you know, I don't think
that they're, that, you know, you,

839
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,850
there's no way they're just going
to be like, yeah, go fuck yourself.

840
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,730
You'd done, you know, and then when
you add racism into it, I mean,

841
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:14,770
you're pretty much, it's
pretty much game set match,

842
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:17,930
which is fucking unfortunate.
So, um, I don't know.

843
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,550
I'm talking about society way
beyond my fucking intellect,

844
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:23,290
so I'm going to tap out here.

845
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:24,860
Yeah.

846
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,600
Alrighty. Trash. Fucking hair metal.
And I'm gonna have fucking angry, uh,

847
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:28,980
psycho cops.

848
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,913
I don't really

849
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,660
[inaudible].

850
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:01,090
Um, all right. Lights, camera dumped bill.

851
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,860
I'm a 29 year old guy and recently
broke up with a funny attractive and all

852
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:10,840
around Greg girl. Oh Gee. Why
Sir would you do that? You ask.

853
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:11,674
All right.

854
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,273
Um,

855
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:13,971
two things.

856
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:18,971
Her Dad was born without teeth and you're
worried your baby will [inaudible] if

857
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:20,600
you braid with her or,

858
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,483
or a,

859
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,460
she has got something going
on in the vaginal area,

860
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,170
some sort of odor stinky pussy. I
don't know. Well, here we go. Well,

861
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,033
let me tell you,

862
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,250
this girl and I had been dating for about
three months and we had a great thing

863
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:39,390
going. She's half Afro Cuban,
half Puerto Rican and really sexy.

864
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,710
She had a rough upbringing, but I
didn't care because she's honest,

865
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:47,700
easy going and not bitchy. Like so many
girls I've dated. She was a bit needy,

866
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:50,500
but I didn't mind. Um,

867
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:53,680
we were out at a bar one night having
a few drinks and I was feeling pretty

868
00:53:53,681 --> 00:53:54,340
good.

869
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,460
I was looking at a couple of floozies
at the end of the bar and I asked her if

870
00:53:57,461 --> 00:54:01,660
she's ever been with another woman.
She coyly looked at me and said, yes,

871
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,980
good stuff. I thought, yeah, dude,
this is a fucking fantasy right here.

872
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,840
Fucking red shoe diaries.
And then I proceeded with,

873
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:15,470
have you ever been in a threesome
with two girls and a guy again?

874
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:20,320
She answered yes. Okay. Kind
of slutty, but I'm no saint.

875
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,380
While I couldn't stop the, Oh God,

876
00:54:23,381 --> 00:54:28,060
you're going to go for the rotisserie
question. What's in the box?

877
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,980
Ah, here we go. Here we go. Strap
yourselves in for this one. Well,

878
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:37,240
I couldn't stop there, so I asked, have
you ever had a threesome with two guys?

879
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,130
She looked down at the ground
and she looked up a bit ashamed,

880
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,420
Lee and said yes. Wow. Skank alert.

881
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:51,480
I thought I then asked
her one more question.

882
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,270
I knew this one could back for
where the fuck do you go from here?

883
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,400
Like throwing the high heat to Albert
Albert pool host. I finally asked,

884
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,000
wait, have you ever been in a porn?

885
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,560
She then blushed and look me
in the eye and said, yeah,

886
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,790
I looked at her calmly and was
like, oh, but inside I was like,

887
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:17,850
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes. Well, you should,

888
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,920
you know those first couple. I mean,

889
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,430
you can look at it. Let, let's, let's
break this down here. All right.

890
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,030
She's been with a,

891
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,910
she's had a threesome with another
girl and a guy who gets that.

892
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:35,370
That's who gives a fuck
right there. All right.

893
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:39,270
You're already knew she banged
another guy. All right? But, uh,

894
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,540
the fact that she also did it with
another girl, that takes a little fucking,

895
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:46,740
uh, that tones down his dick in her pussy.
Right? This is how guys think. Women,

896
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:51,720
I'm sorry. All right. That's something
that, that's something in the, uh,

897
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,520
the credit. Is it the credit bill? Why,
why, why do you try to talk accounting?

898
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,310
Shit. You're too dumb. All right, that
one's all right. The two guys thing.

899
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:09,030
Now you can look the other way on that.
Maybe if if it was in another state,

900
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,950
but it can't be in the same state because
if you run into one of the two guys

901
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:17,880
that fucking, you know, we're high
fiving is they fucking banged our,

902
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:22,560
that mean I d I dunno about that one.
But then the third one she did a porno.

903
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:26,870
I mean, yeah, no, that's a,
you've got to walk away from that

904
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,730
or are you have to go to NASA to get
tested for the latest fucking STDs,

905
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:37,920
I would think. And then also
God knows what's going on. Uh,

906
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,570
mentally that you would do that.

907
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,303
Yeah.

908
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,670
What? I just like sex. No, no,
no. There's something going on.

909
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:49,340
Who doesn't like sex? I don't
know. Anyways, plowing ahead. See,

910
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:53,880
so she egos. So basically she had moved
down to Los Angeles when she was 20.

911
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,330
She's now 25 and after a
short stint in the military,

912
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,510
somehow she got into the porn
industry for eight months.

913
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:05,400
She did everything [inaudible].
Fox sucked the whole Shebang.

914
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:07,560
I asked her if I could see her video,

915
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,050
but she wouldn't tell
me her performer name.

916
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,670
It said vehemently that it would be
impossible to find her body of work.

917
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,780
I asked her why she got
into porn and she replies

918
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,880
because I wanted some feeling in
my life and then he rides down.

919
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,790
G is, yeah, dude. Ah, this poor
girl. Something happened to her.

920
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,190
The thing was she was clean,

921
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,050
had a good job and I really liked her
and the sex was great. Yeah. Obviously,

922
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:37,531
you know, it was funny,

923
00:57:37,531 --> 00:57:39,740
there was something you
wrote the beginning where I
just thought she was going

924
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:44,160
to be good. 29 year old guy,
attractive all around Greg girl.

925
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,920
Oh, the fact that you said she
had a rough brain upbringing,

926
00:57:49,921 --> 00:57:53,250
but she was easygoing and honest and
not bitchy right there. I was like,

927
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:58,170
that girl's good in bed. It just
seemed like a kind of free open person.

928
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,130
I don't know. I didn't know if she was
going to be that open. Oh Geez. Um,

929
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:06,830
anyways, the thing was she
was clean and I have a bla.

930
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,641
The sex was great,

931
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:12,641
but I couldn't stop picturing her in some
sleazy porno that was probably filmed

932
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:14,630
in some junkyard on labrea.

933
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:18,380
So I went to ask for a friend's advice.

934
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:23,470
Most of my guys were telling me to dumper
my gay friends told me it was fabulous

935
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:26,270
and that I should overlook it.

936
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,260
I didn't even bother asking my girlfriends
because they would automatically

937
00:58:30,261 --> 00:58:34,040
reject her and assume I had aids.
There you go. Keep your options open.

938
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,500
So regretfully I dumped her.

939
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:43,150
I felt terrible and obviously didn't tell
her it was because she was a porn star

940
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,980
because she would have been
ashamed for the rest of her life.

941
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:50,630
And I was happy that she was honest with
me. I've done my fair share of sleeves,

942
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:54,920
but this was too much. My question
bill was, Bill, my question bill,

943
00:58:54,921 --> 00:58:58,430
was it wrong for me to dump or for
some decisions she made years ago?

944
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:03,320
Should I have stayed with her?
What would have you done? Um,

945
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,880
oh, you don't want to know what I
would've done. I'm a fucking degenerate.

946
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,200
So let's you, you seem
like a good person. Um,

947
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,503
dude,

948
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,510
when you're trying to find the person
you're going to spend the rest of your

949
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:20,990
life with, you have to have a
list of criteria. All right.

950
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:25,070
Sound like you're still young, so there's
no reason to compromise. All right?

951
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:26,780
I mean,

952
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:29,740
when you get with somebody like that and
you're going to live with them and you

953
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:33,170
will, you get with anybody, you're
taking on all of their fucking baggage.

954
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:38,910
All right? You're only three
months in and you know,

955
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:42,300
people who go into the porn
industry, they're, you know,

956
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,940
it's like people would come, comedians
were not healthy individuals. Okay.

957
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,870
And that is like a specific
area that I just, I just,

958
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:55,560
this is just my own personal nonmedical
feeling that you're just not a healthy

959
00:59:55,561 --> 01:00:00,510
person. Something awful happened and that
line, I just wanted to feel something.

960
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,980
I mean, something bad happened to
her, caused her to wall herself off.

961
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,700
I don't even want to try to
guess what, but you know,

962
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,460
there's nothing wrong with anything
that she did personally, you know,

963
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,950
technically, and she was honest with it.

964
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:21,030
It all comes down to whether or not
you want to deal with it. All right?

965
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,590
And if you feel that you know,

966
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:25,950
you want to deal with it and that there
was this sort of connection that you

967
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:28,080
just had, this girl
had to be in your life,

968
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,040
then you're going to have to learn
to live with it and get past it.

969
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:35,923
Um,

970
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,040
but I would be definitely,

971
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,990
I would definitely be concerned with, uh,

972
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:51,750
certain mental issues,
um, now like she's insane.

973
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,340
And then I would also
be concerned with, uh,

974
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:00,570
sexual boundaries, you know?

975
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:01,950
Okay.

976
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,660
Like would she have any,

977
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:08,910
and could she remain faithful after a
while and when you settle into the seven

978
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:10,170
year itch or whatever,

979
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:15,890
and you really start needing to work at
the relationship and it's feeling boring

980
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,210
and she needs to feel something
again, is she going to go back to that

981
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,220
leather couch from that
show? Martin my n, you know,

982
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:28,340
down on fucking the valley and get
banged again. I mean, I don't know.

983
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:35,230
I don't know. That is a,
a, that is, you know what,

984
01:01:35,231 --> 01:01:37,780
that is beyond my skills. I don't
know how to tame that horse.

985
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:41,260
I could tell you that right fucking
now. I don't, I have no fucking clue.

986
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,800
That's a a, you know what,
that's a Dr drew question.

987
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:49,000
That is a classic Dr Drew
Question. And that guy,

988
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:53,320
within two seconds we'll get right
to the core of it. I would call,

989
01:01:53,321 --> 01:01:57,100
I would call in love line, man, if you're
out here, call him up. Cause that's a,

990
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,170
that's a great one. Um,

991
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:04,730
yeah, I guess you'd have
to figure out is, is,

992
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,880
has she worked through whatever the fuck
she was working through and now she's

993
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:12,220
ready to, I mean, I dunno. Hey,

994
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:14,260
those are some good looking
girls down there. And she's like,

995
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:18,010
yeah they are or whatever. Like, I mean,
if you kept steering in that direction,

996
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:22,170
you'd probably get fucking
threesome right there. Um,

997
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,410
so there's that, there's that option.

998
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,590
The option that you have is if you're
with her, like I think that that's,

999
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:33,620
that's a selfish fucking and a shallow
reason to stay with somebody longterm.

1000
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,970
Uh, yeah. Jesus. I don't know.

1001
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,733
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1002
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,560
red fish markets to police in the
corner gun and Phil, you, yes,

1003
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:16,510
photos he did for like a breath for
the shooter said please don't do that.

1004
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,290
[inaudible].

1005
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:37,370
Um, all right. Beef curtain advice.
And for those of you in the states,

1006
01:03:37,371 --> 01:03:41,210
that's a slang for the
WHO, Huh? Beef curtains.

1007
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,650
Do the math. Think about it. All
right, you ready? Okay, here we go.

1008
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:50,370
Here's the situation. I have a
wonderful girl in my life. Uh,

1009
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:53,120
what in one she doesn't know how
to fuck. That's what I'm guessing.

1010
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,460
I'm guessing this is where it's going.
I have wonderful girl in my life.

1011
01:03:55,461 --> 01:04:00,080
Great attitude, humor, big tits, nice ass
and a good family. Jesus Christ. Dude,

1012
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:04,190
marry this girl. Sure. It seems
good for now. But I have one issue.

1013
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:09,260
She also has some mean beef curtains
and he put in parentheses, Pussy Lips.

1014
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:12,650
Just in case I didn't know
a, that kind of bugged me.

1015
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:17,630
Bug the ever living shit
out of me. Whenever we get
down to the dirty business.

1016
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,080
So much a,

1017
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:24,080
so to the point I looked up some cosmetic
surgery that basically gives the beef

1018
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:28,820
curtains a trim job and
beauties the vagina.

1019
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,580
Wow. Dude. Why? All right. Now,
before I read the rest of this,

1020
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,030
if you're going to fucking ask
me how to have this conversation,

1021
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:43,640
like listen, love, I love you, I love
you, I love you family. I love you,

1022
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,840
your heart, everything. But is there
any way you can trim your beef curtains?

1023
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,960
Maybe you can get away with it cause
you've got that cool accent. I don't know.

1024
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,390
But she has it too, so she's
not going to give a fuck.

1025
01:04:56,391 --> 01:05:00,920
You can maybe pull this off with
some foreign chick anyways. Um,

1026
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:04,730
so he looks up cosmetic surgery
to try on a beautiful vagina.

1027
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,770
Now I know by now I must sound like a
douchebag focusing on the little things.

1028
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:14,940
No, cause women do that too. Women
focus on little things like that,

1029
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:20,680
that that's a serious issue. Dude. Sex
is a big fucking thing. But anyways,

1030
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:24,040
he says what my thinking is I'm
truly gonna pull the trigger.

1031
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,140
He spelt it that way and keep this woman
all the myself for the rest of my life.

1032
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,440
RNI entitled to have a great looking
Vage to look at for as long as our bodies

1033
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,740
don't wrinkle away. Wow.

1034
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:43,480
I know there's a lot of women are fucking
annoyed by this one. Yeah. Went by.

1035
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,850
She a fucking Dick in your wrinkled balls.

1036
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,600
Why don't you get a face lift
for your sack there buddy.

1037
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:51,250
I know they're all say that I'm,

1038
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,620
how can I ever bring this
option up to her without,

1039
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,850
I knew he's going to ask me
without completely destroying
her feelings or making

1040
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:01,930
her hate me for being so pussy
conscious. Thanks for the read.

1041
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:05,740
Now go fuck yourself. All right.
This is a simple one, dude.

1042
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,200
There is no fucking way

1043
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:14,140
you can bring that up to her without
absolutely completely destroying her

1044
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:17,410
feelings. So you either need
to accept this or you have to,

1045
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:22,240
you have to let her go.
That's it. That's it.

1046
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,810
I mean, I would think that if you
actually truly cared about this girl,

1047
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,700
now all the chicks are
going to be like, oh,

1048
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:31,470
I know he had a heart
underneath all those c words.

1049
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:36,820
Um, if you truly care about this girl, uh,

1050
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:40,750
I would think that that wouldn't matter.
You know and if she looks the way she,

1051
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,370
she's saying you saying that she looks,
I mean what, what are we talking here?

1052
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:49,270
Like how far down these things
hanging isn't like you know,

1053
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:57,010
I mean if she got him both of them
piers could you like do like a,

1054
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:01,210
could you like a better, let's say,
could you be like the like that Olympic,

1055
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,400
the fuck is that thing
who you're on the rings.

1056
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,220
Could you do that and still swing your
feet up and not hit her pussy and we

1057
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:07,270
talking like it's that bad.

1058
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,430
You know if you did the iron cross
would your head be in her pussy?

1059
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,770
Like how far these things
hanging down? Hey now

1060
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:16,670
what's the deal with deep gardens?

1061
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,360
All right dude, there's no way there's,

1062
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,850
there's no fucking way and don't don't
do that to her cause she can't do

1063
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:25,661
anything about that.

1064
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:30,610
If she had a problem with her fucking
vaginal area you would have known by now

1065
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:33,730
because she would have been self conscious
and she would have brought it up the

1066
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:33,851
way.

1067
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:37,990
Sometimes girls do about parts of their
bodies and they are super self conscious

1068
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:42,070
about their bodies because we're
so fucking visual. All right.

1069
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,410
I told you one time when the
first girls I ever hooked up with,

1070
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:45,990
when I got her shirt off and her bra off,

1071
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:49,780
she rolled her eyes and I thought she
was thinking that. I was like, oh my God.

1072
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:53,500
Like I'm not doing it for like she's
rolling her eyes. Like this guy's lame.

1073
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:57,520
And I found out later she was self
conscious about the size of her breasts.

1074
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,250
So I totally took it
the wrong fucking way.

1075
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:03,540
I made it all about me cause I'm
self involved. So a Duh. Yeah,

1076
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,550
don't do that to her. All
right. Either you can.

1077
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,530
That's when you just
suddenly have in your head.

1078
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:10,390
Either you accept that
shit or you move on,

1079
01:08:10,391 --> 01:08:14,860
but there's no reason to hurt this person
because you're a shallow Kent like me.

1080
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,363
All right.

1081
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,410
All right. Cheers mate.

1082
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,273
[inaudible]

1083
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:34,120
