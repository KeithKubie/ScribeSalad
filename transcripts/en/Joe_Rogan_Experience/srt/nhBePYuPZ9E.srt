1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:06,310
Boom, boom, boom. What's happening
brother? Let's do it, man. What's crack?

2
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:08,930
It's good to be back. Good to be back.
Good. It's always amazing. It's like,

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,630
it's like a little, it's a,

4
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:14,530
it's a bit of an amusement park
almost now with stuff to see and the,

5
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:15,970
and the gym equipment and everything.

6
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:19,330
I keep thinking I should just bring my
gear over and work out before the show or

7
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:22,480
after the show, but they lose, I
don't want to embarrass myself,

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,140
so I'm going to embarrass you. Say I'm
not going to watch or watch your workout.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,070
And he would like Jamie's,
that kind of guy. Yeah,

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,850
I've seen him give me side-eye he
would give me, but no, it's, yeah,

11
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,190
it's all good. Everything's, everything's
good. I've been traveling a lot,

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,590
having to, we just talked
before we started about Idaho.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,610
Haven't had a chance to get back there,
but, uh, yeah. All good. All good.

14
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:46,180
So you're around for a television show,
is that what you're doing? Um, yeah,

15
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,880
this is, this is a, there's, there's
several meetings going on here,

16
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:52,720
but we just finished,
uh, uh, filming a show,

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,600
a reality show, um, for, uh,

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,100
can I say the network they Kinda Hinky
on until we get closer to the hair day,

19
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:04,390
which is October. Uh, but it's for the
discovery network and it's gonna be,

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,440
it's gonna be a great show that I,
that I'm hosting. Well, you know what,

21
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:11,600
that's what I always said.
I always thought free
publicity is a good thing. Um,

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,450
but they're very tight on the marketing
protocols and so they want to make sure

23
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,910
they've got it all buttoned up. And I
get that right. They spend, you know,

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,680
a lot of money on these things and
fucking so freaks. Yeah. And so, anyway,

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,910
but it's going to be a
great, uh, a great show.

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,800
We spent the past three or four months,
um, filming it around the country,

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,550
a really good production team.
And the stories are fantastic.

28
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,940
It's basically looking at, I guess I'm
talking about it, I'm not supposed to,

29
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:40,210
but w we're looking at, um, uh,

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,740
military government organizations that
are typically in the shadows, right?

31
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,360
We're not releasing any
sources and methods.

32
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,310
We're not disclosing classified secrets,

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,360
but we're talking about elements
and units, operational activity, um,

34
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,400
events that, uh,

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,210
before now I've pretty much been in
the shadows and some incredible people.

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
That's one of the best parts about this
thing that's been going out there and

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,730
meet some of these guys that are doing
some of this high-speed shit. And it's,

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,620
it's pretty amazing. And when, when
they do release things like long,

39
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:13,450
long after, like I was reading something,
uh, I forget what the case was about,

40
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,790
but it was something about how the,

41
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,570
the files won't be released under the
freedom of Information Act until 2080.

42
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,080
Well, how do you, yeah, I know. What are
they, how do they make that decision?

43
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,650
Like that was the thing with the
Kennedy assassination, right?

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,720
And sometimes they roll it over
and it's not even then. Right?

45
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:32,410
So sometimes they extend that,
um, other times they don't.

46
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:36,820
And so some information comes
to light periodically. Um,

47
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,820
and so this does look at this, this
show we'll be looking at some historic,

48
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:43,570
but a lot of current things that are
going on and, and where the money goes,

49
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:43,751
right.

50
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:46,270
What are we spending on money on when
it comes to this high speed operations

51
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,870
that the special forces and others
are involved in? Um, so it'll be,

52
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:54,360
it'll be very good. I was, I was lucky
to be able to work with again, you know,

53
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,080
some really great people
on the production side,

54
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:59,700
but just also going out there and meeting
some of these cats. They're just, the,

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,360
the, the shit that they do is, is,
it's even after being around a while,

56
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,840
cause I have, um, it just amazes me. Well,

57
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,620
it's gotta be constantly
accelerating too. Right? There's,

58
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,230
they're constantly coming up with new
and spectacular things that nobody knows

59
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,480
about until they employ
them. Right, exactly.

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,550
And sometimes that shit stays on the
shelf. Right. You know, it was like the,

61
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:23,500
the running joke at the agency
at the, at the CIA was, you know,

62
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,630
we have a fantastic s and t group,

63
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,990
a science and technology group and
another one's responsible like cue from,

64
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,890
from bond, right. They're
the ones responsible for
developing all the gear, uh,

65
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,470
responding to specific
operational requirements.

66
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,880
How are we going to do
this particular thing?

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,730
Well it's develop a piece of kit
that's going to allow us to do it. Um,

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
but the running joke is
always that, you know,

69
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,040
they'll develop it and they'll
show it to you before an operation,

70
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,960
but then they'll put it back on the
shelf cause they don't want that shit

71
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,210
getting out there. Right. And people
finding out that they've got it.

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,440
So they'll give you like a,

73
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,580
a 20 year old piece of kit to use instead
and you'll be walking around with like

74
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,510
a phone the size of a brick. Um,

75
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,600
knowing that they've got
something high speed on the shelf.

76
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,490
Well that's what everybody always thinks.

77
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:04,300
Like when you talk to the average Joe
on the street about technology and the

78
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:04,960
government,

79
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,930
there was like dudes and stuff they have
that they probably don't tell us about

80
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,190
how much of that is real. Yeah.
Um, it's, it's pretty real.

81
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:17,170
Have you seen some stuff that made you
go, Holy Shit, yes. You can do that. Yes.

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,830
Really? Yeah. And how much
can you tell us? Um, well,

83
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,680
you know what one thing that
they're doing and, and there's, I,

84
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,190
this is actually something I wanted
to talk about today because it's gonna

85
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:27,940
affect everybody.

86
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,560
It's not just something that is going
to affect people in the military or else

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
in the intelligence community,

88
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,090
but one of the things that they've been
working on is imagine you've got gotta,

89
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,060
you've got to rock up on it
on a target and your butt,

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,750
your before you do that before you,

91
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,230
you get the customers on site
and you're gonna, you know,

92
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,650
hopefully obtain some high value,
uh, targets there at that location.

93
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,570
Before you do that, you gotta, you gotta
can euphemisms, Oh, I'm sorry. Before,

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,690
before you can go in there, loteria
listen to another dimension.

95
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,640
But sometimes you know, you're okay.

96
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,130
Actually I was going to say sometimes
you want to actually capture them and get

97
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:01,870
their intelligence. We've
gotten past that, right?

98
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:05,670
Because the years where we were getting
our ass kicked for holding onto people

99
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:08,730
in, in detention facilities,
um, you know what that did that,

100
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,370
that pretty much convinced everybody
that was involved in this to just just

101
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,890
whack them. Right? Because then you
don't have to deal with the aftermath.

102
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,060
You don't have to worry about, oh,

103
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,510
you're going to get in
trouble for interrogating
somebody. Right. Exactly. So,

104
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,300
so that actually increasingly
[inaudible] of operations,

105
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:24,880
you started painting targets and just
blowing the shit out of there rather than

106
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,520
trying to grab the target
and get their intel.

107
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,820
That's a problem because in the pipeline
dries up for the Intel. But anyway,

108
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,550
so imagine you've got
this, you got this site,

109
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,440
the first thing you gotta do is
determine if your target's there. Right.

110
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,391
Then it's not like that. You know,

111
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:41,170
the Tom Clancy movies where you're
looking through walls and all this shit.

112
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,540
It's it, you know, that that technology
night vision devices and, and,

113
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,370
and that ability and low
light conditions to, uh,

114
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:53,020
to monitor and do identify
specific individuals, um,

115
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,190
has always been a problem.

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,070
They've made great strides on
it to the point now where in no

117
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,060
light conditions, right, with the,
with the right stack database,

118
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,670
with the right information and that
database meaning the right amount of,

119
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,460
of information about individuals, right?

120
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,630
You just constantly populating this
database with new faces or with new

121
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:14,610
photographs of individuals
that you're going after, um,

122
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,670
with enough of that to sift through.

123
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,660
They're getting to the point now with
no light conditions that they can, uh,

124
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,730
identify positively the targets in that
room are the targets in that facility or

125
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:29,240
in that building, whatever it might
be. And that's pretty incredible.

126
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,820
I'd rather they can identify people
by their heart rate [inaudible]

127
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,410
with w well not just their heart. Right.
But I mean other, other bio-data right.

128
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:38,240
I mean other than other,

129
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,870
but they can literally with
video somehow or another,

130
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,140
they can zoom in on you with some
scanner and recognize that this is a

131
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,210
particular individual because
of their heart rate. This is,

132
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,390
there was an article that was written
about it and I know that there's a

133
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:57,200
company, do you know what
Hex is? Hecs. It's um,

134
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,750
it's a company that's been used, uh,

135
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,190
pretty extensively by
scuba diving community. Um,

136
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,380
and now, uh,

137
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,190
by the hunting community as well because
it blocks the electrical signal hecs.

138
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,950
It blocks the electrical signal
that your body gives off. Okay. Yup.

139
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,943
That makes sense.

140
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,810
And I think they're doing work with the
military as well to develop suits that

141
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,590
will somehow know another stop someone
from being able to recognize your

142
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,270
particular heart rate.

143
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,240
Right. And it does a lot of work on,

144
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,280
on what they call this sort of the
universe and their goals. Here.

145
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,060
Pentagon is a lady that I can
identify people from a distance,

146
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,710
other heartbeat. Yeah. It helps. It helps
if you have other data points. Right.

147
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:42,180
If you had, but um, this is all part
of it to some degree. What, you know,

148
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,190
they refer to as a universal
soldier, right? They, the,

149
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,370
the fighter of tomorrow and [inaudible].
Yeah, but they got shit. That's right.

150
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,300
Who doesn't remember [inaudible]
although he's all in with grin.

151
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,800
He's doing like chip commercials now.

152
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,670
I'm sure you haven't seen him at
[inaudible]. He knows or whatever. Dude,

153
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,610
70th trill. The splits. Yeah. Well ops,

154
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,020
I don't know when that becomes useful
though. Really the splits, I mean,

155
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,050
I've never actually felt that
that was something I need to do,

156
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,980
accomplish in any given moment from an
operational [inaudible] movies where you

157
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:17,030
have to do this. It's still
very important. But so the,

158
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,520
the universal soldier thing
where you, you, you, your,

159
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,920
you know, it's an
Exoskeleton, it's a soft suit.

160
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,160
It's all the data that you can
acquire for that war fighter.

161
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,690
How do you create the perfect environment
on that individual as he's moving

162
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:37,020
through an environment to, to, you
know, be a more efficient, effective,

163
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,310
lethal fighter and you know, things
like that. Identifying target,

164
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,330
whether it's with a laser,

165
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,900
whether it's with low light or no
light conditions where you can,

166
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,650
as you're rocking up on the target,
you can do all these things, you know,

167
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,930
the ability to, to carry more gear,
right? Hump it, another extra, you know,

168
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,220
10 kilometers, whatever

169
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,230
it might be. Uh, it's, it's pretty
incredible what they're doing and it's,

170
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,580
it's a joint. It's not just the military.
They're working with, uh, you know,

171
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,050
companies like hacks or they're working
with the, with the commercial sector,

172
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,940
um, and academics too. But anyway, and
I disappeared down a rabbit hole. Uh,

173
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,500
the, these like the, the idea of
like this universal soldier thing.

174
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,670
Have you been paying attention to this
Elon Musk neurolink thing that he's

175
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,504
coming out with,

176
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
whether they're going to somehow or
another insert fibers into your brain and

177
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:30,540
then have a Bluetooth enabled device that
you wear that's going to allow you to

178
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,830
somehow or another interface with
data at a much higher bandwidth?

179
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:37,350
I don't know what the fuck any
of those words mean. I just said,

180
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,380
but that was good though. That was
good. It sounded like you understood it.

181
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,030
That's my trick. So yeah, I,
you know, that comes up point.

182
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,410
Um, if you're talking
about, I mean that's,

183
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,930
that's going into a different area
that's going into civilian applications.

184
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,310
And by the way, the military
application would be great for that too.

185
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,950
Everyone could synchronize data. You
could give them navigation in their head.

186
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,810
Like if there's some sort
of augmented reality,

187
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,720
we could literally see the
targets in front of you.

188
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,700
Like if you had a map, say like the,

189
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,870
if the Pentagon really does have this
laser beam that could identify specific

190
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:14,340
individuals and you have a map of a
building that's in your head and they can

191
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:17,130
identify the very location,

192
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,820
absolute perfect location of each
individual person in that room.

193
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,270
And you could see that as you're
running into this building,

194
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:27,600
you're seeing like a three d grid in
front of you and you know, I mean,

195
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,960
you could shoot them right through
a fucking wall, right? And there's,

196
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,970
but there's, there, there does become a
problem, then that becomes a problem of,

197
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:37,560
of information overload. And when
you get into that situation, right,

198
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:39,880
everything starts to close
down a little bit. Right? And,

199
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,680
and so you've got to start
pushing some of that away.

200
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,010
And now what you end up doing is
you get the offsite, you know,

201
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,670
command center a relaying some
of that information as needed.

202
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,460
But that guy that's about to,
to breach that door, you know,

203
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,730
he doesn't want a lot of data points
anymore. Now having said that,

204
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:57,930
knowing where, you know,

205
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:59,760
knowing where the hostiles are
and the other side of that door,

206
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:03,000
that is key information, that's
not rocket science but so there,

207
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,290
but there's a lot that's going on.

208
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,170
It's also the ability to monitor the
health of the individual. You know,

209
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,370
soldiers are out there,
uh, through the, the,

210
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,830
the gear that they would then be wearing.
Um, it's an, it's an incredible, uh,

211
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,980
effort that has been going on
and, and so to answer your point,

212
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,700
long rambling answer, uh, yeah, I've
seen some things that are pretty amazing.

213
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,700
You can't talk about it
though. No, no. Some of this,

214
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,530
some of the shit actually we'll,

215
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:28,320
we'll get into with the new show
that's coming up sometime in fall.

216
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,040
I don't have a really state, and again,
I'm prescribed from talking about,

217
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,570
so I won't do that because
some I pay attention.

218
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,170
Some of the things that you saw
you'll be able to talk about. Yes.

219
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,050
So how does the government do that?
They just decide, well listen,

220
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,610
it's not a bad thing if you tell
people about this something,

221
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,990
I'll give you this. Right? Well, I
think this, there's an element of,

222
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,230
some of it's not what you
would refer to as classified.

223
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:52,860
It's just not readily available public
information and it's not out there in

224
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,130
the, because people aren't

225
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,850
aware of it or searching for it. Um,
some of it does. I think you're right.

226
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,610
Some of it is, look, the
military wants to say at times,

227
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,310
look what we're able to
do or we're doing this.

228
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,790
And oftentimes it's because it's
in a sort of a private public

229
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,920
cooperation and, and so
that encourages other, uh,

230
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,080
companies with innovative
technologies to step forward and,

231
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,540
and get involved in some of this. Um,

232
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,600
and I guess that opens up
all sorts of other, you know,

233
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,110
some people are out there saying,
well they shouldn't be working

234
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,870
and with the military.
Well you know, fuck,

235
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,920
well that's a question that I had the,

236
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,960
this brings me to a point that I think
is kind of important where people always

237
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:34,500
talk about the military budget and how
high the military budget is and you know,

238
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:37,740
we need to take some of that money and
put it in other places. And you know,

239
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,770
maybe some of that military money is
not being used to the best for the best

240
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:45,810
good of the human race or
maybe maybe some of it.

241
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,670
But in order to be able to develop stuff
that keeps people safer in order to

242
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,810
develop all this stuff that you're talking
about that could potentially save the

243
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:59,811
lives of soldiers and even
innocent civilians because
you're going to be able to

244
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:04,860
target the correct people. Like all
this stuff seems pretty critical. Right,

245
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,760
right. And it's also,
there is a, you know,

246
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,340
there's an upside if you want to get
more listic about the whole thing to

247
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:15,240
developing advanced technologies,
you can be more surgical, right?

248
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,440
[inaudible] the drone capability
as an example gives you a,

249
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,560
a much better understanding
of your target. You can
avoid the collateral damage,

250
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:25,310
you know, the deaths of
civilians on site, um,

251
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,830
through the use of proper technology.
And that creates that environment.

252
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:32,570
And so it's a good thing.
And, and again, I mean, CIA,

253
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,530
their s and t group over the years,

254
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:39,180
the shit that they've developed
for operational purposes
that then made its way

255
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:43,200
into the commercial sector and planet
fitted people. What battery technology,

256
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,250
anybody walking around with a
pacemaker or defibrillator, you know,

257
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:49,530
in part can thank the the agency
because what were they doing? They were,

258
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:52,560
they were working, they continue
to work on, on battery technology,

259
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:54,450
shrinking those batteries
as a power source.

260
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,200
What initially operational purposes.
So you could, uh, you know, uh,

261
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,640
it put a transmitter out some site,
you know, and, and, um, you know,

262
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,830
so what are you doing?
You're eavesdropping on a,

263
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:08,820
on a hostile target or you know,
gathering intelligence, but then that,

264
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
that effort,

265
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,110
all that work that was done then that
later on benefits the general public drone

266
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,680
technology. Same thing, right?

267
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:20,040
I mean the agency was front and
center on developing drone capability.

268
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,320
Now what are you doing? You're
doing that to, to, you know,

269
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:27,180
for environmental concerns? Um,
you know, for mining, uh, it's,

270
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,720
I'm a little concerned
about drone technology.

271
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,870
My old house that I used to live at this
motherfucker that lived down the street

272
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:36,050
from ace to hover a drone
over my house and film.

273
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,380
He like f like I know he's
like looking at me like,

274
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:41,480
what are you doing to ask me
swimming? You fucking Weirdo.

275
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,240
Did you ever go over and
talk to him? No. Ah, no.

276
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,410
Should've sent a drone over his house.
Yeah, I was thinking of shooting it down.

277
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:52,010
But it's hard to aim up. No,

278
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,880
you can now update the bow and Arrow.
I know that'd be a hell of a shot.

279
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:58,880
You have a good boat. Like, see, the way,

280
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:05,090
the way you calculate accuracy
with archery is you have
a range finder and that

281
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:11,321
range finder has a built in adjustments
for angle this angle compensation for up

282
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:15,110
or for down. But I don't know if it has
it for straight up in the air. Like,

283
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,380
cause you got to think the way you,

284
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:21,381
you're judging how much an arrow is going
to drop over the course of the flight.

285
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,950
Right, right, right. The same as the
bottles too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

286
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,790
But with a bullet, obviously it's less
compensation because it's much faster.

287
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,230
But, um, there's a video that's
hilarious of this guy, uh,

288
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,230
got tired of this block party in Brazil,

289
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,940
so he loaded up a drone
filled with fireworks and uh,

290
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:45,941
he hovered it over the block party and
started launching bottle rockets down on

291
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:50,420
these guys that are, uh, make it too
much noise. That's excellent though.

292
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,520
I mean, if you think, but that sounds
like something one of my boys would do.

293
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,060
And then I'm sure there'll be listening
to this at some point. So they, um,

294
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,230
did they tell you're going
to do this? Yes. Scooter.

295
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:01,850
Sluggo and Mugsy but it's when you have
a kid named sluggo or Mugsy or scooter

296
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,910
guaranteed, they're gonna do, they're
gonna do something like that. Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,870
[inaudible] when you're naming your kids,
I didn't know, it didn't occur to me.

298
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,870
It didn't occur to me, although I
wanted to get Eugene or something.

299
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,190
I wanted Eugene, Eugene, I wanted
to give him flattops. Right.

300
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:18,430
Every summer I want to have the
same discussion with, with, uh,

301
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,810
with my wife who's the
world's greatest person. Uh,

302
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:24,000
I wanted to give them a flat tops
and she always says, look, uh,

303
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,050
with names like scooter slug and Mugsy,
you give them a flat top as well,

304
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:31,880
then that's it. You a database. Exactly.
They're going somewhere. But, uh,

305
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:34,670
it's, you know, the best way to
take down a drone, uh, is, uh,

306
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,650
is just blanketed jam it and
drop it up well yet it's like a,

307
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,190
you know, it's like the old days of
jamming a radio signal basically. Right.

308
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,270
When you're, you're interrupting,

309
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,150
you're blanketing it and
you're interrupting the, the,

310
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:50,780
the data communication from the
controller to the drone. And, um,

311
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,460
like the drone that was taken down in
the Iranian drone that we took down,

312
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,800
I think you'll see USS boxer was involved
in that out there in the, uh, the,

313
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,770
the street. That's how they do it. They
don't fire a missile at it anymore,

314
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,320
you know, it's just,
it's much more effective.

315
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,000
Something on it that disrupts the
signal. Right. Yeah. It's just a,

316
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,880
it's essentially again, and not
to oversimplify, just jamming,

317
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,700
but is that jamming technology
available to civilians?

318
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,840
Um, to really, really smart civilians?
I guess it could. It could be. Yeah.

319
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,670
Really smart civilians would probably
be able to figure that stuff out. Jamie,

320
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,620
you know anybody that's work on that,
I'm looking to find some real, Jamie,

321
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,170
can you meet? Uh, so, uh, yeah.

322
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:33,690
Scooter to technology scooters
just out at a west point. Uh,

323
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,970
he wants to go to west point when he's,

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,200
when he's old enough and so he went out
there for a lacrosse program and I'd

325
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,730
forgotten. Have you been to west point?
No. You got, you got to go at some it's,

326
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,910
I know it's a ways away from here.
It's not a day trip, but it's this,

327
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,770
it's a beautiful campus
and forgotten about that.

328
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,930
Obviously it's got to cause that where
Jody foster wills and sounds of the limbs

329
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,560
and west point, it doesn't
sound right. I don't think so.

330
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,450
The drone kill gun.
Wow. That's crazy. Three

331
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,510
[inaudible] lightweight compact drone
counter-measure drone gun, 3000.

332
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,070
Jamie ordered me one of those
immediately. Yeah. Amazon please. Yeah.

333
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,550
That would have taken, that would
have taken care of this guy. Um, yeah,

334
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:21,090
but the problem is it's not as
satisfying as a bow and arrow. Yes.

335
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,720
That's a good point. That's
a good point. Uh, so, uh,

336
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,440
one of the things I wanted, I didn't
know how it's not as smooth segue,

337
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,310
but we were talking a bit about
technology technology, um,

338
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,670
is particularly with a 2020 election
coming up is this idea of deep fakes.

339
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,370
Yes. Fantastic stuff. Um,

340
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,770
and the technology to create this
nowadays to create a deep fake up,

341
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,070
which essentially just means
you're doctoring a photo
or video and making it do

342
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:56,520
what you want it to do to try to
convince people of whatever it is. Um,

343
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,110
technology is, is, is advancing
and it's stunning what can be done.

344
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,450
Kyle Dunnigan is Kyle
Dunnigan. I should know,

345
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,610
I should know hilarious standup comedian,

346
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:10,320
but he shines in doing deep fakes
and he's working with this other guy.

347
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:14,160
I think the guy's called Dr
Fagan's. Time for the faking. Yeah.

348
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,990
Two separate guys. But yeah, one of
those guys. But go to go to his, uh,

349
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,390
Instagram and see the new one that he
did with the Elon Musk. He was doing,

350
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,650
I'm really kind of crudely with like face
with, you know, um, face swap or face,

351
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,800
that's like a little filter that you get
from snapchat or something like that or

352
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,221
Instagram.

353
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:33,870
But now he's moved from that to
doing this really high end stuff.

354
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:38,130
Go to the Elan Musk one. Look at this,
play this vacancy into this. Yeah. Okay.

355
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,670
Uh, I just [inaudible] I Tessa labs,
which is pretty cool. It's pretty cool.

356
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,590
But, but, but we had a little snafu edit.

357
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,260
It looks like time is slowing down and
we'll eventually start going backwards at

358
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:51,310
an increasing rate.

359
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:56,311
So pretty soon you will become a baby
again and be sucked back into your

360
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:58,510
mother's vagina. Yeah.

361
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,480
Okay. Now pause.

362
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,160
Now go to another Kyle Donagen video so
he can tell what cow really looks like.

363
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,560
That's him to the right of that.
This is what he really looks like,

364
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,330
which is fucking madness. Yeah,

365
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,520
the guy's hilarious by the
way. He's awesome guy too.

366
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,410
And he's got a great Instagram page,
but his Instagram page is mostly him,

367
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:21,200
like the gold boom. So the gold
one was chip click on that.

368
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,280
Cause that's a normal one.

369
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,220
This is what he did with the
filters without doctor fake Stein.

370
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,940
Look at the seals of creepy face.
Yeah, yeah, but play that. So

371
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,410
Ellen did genesis sore ass a seems
friendly Blackson bud. But no,

372
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,410
don't get too close to her and
she'll bite your fucking head off.

373
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,750
Just ask the uh, Porsche Raptor
as he has. He has, he has,

374
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:43,584
he asks.

375
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,200
And that's really Yoda. Gotcha.
Railroad is always smoking. Yeah.

376
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,790
Although we gave it up, I, you remember,

377
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,920
but in the videos he's always
smoking the look. It's,

378
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,750
it's bad enough that it's
extra hilarious cause it's bad.

379
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,640
But the new one that he did with
Elon Musk is not bad. It's not bad.

380
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,040
But Caitlyn Jenner one go to the
Caitlin Jenner one on the far right.

381
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,930
That's fucking genius. Click on this one

382
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,720
carefully. Kylie. I have
shopping. Sherry has Chicago.

383
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,350
When you had your shared right here
is your go. I buried your old fasion,

384
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:20,280
a Pecha and Metairie by accident and I'm
sure, I'm just saying it's back. Yeah.

385
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,513
Yeah.

386
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,510
Okay. But those, those are my favorites.

387
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,130
He has the Kardashians, the elite.
That's the only way they talk.

388
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:36,210
They just say yum, yum. And then
he knows what they're saying.

389
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,060
Sort of like Groot in
guardians of the galaxy.

390
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,240
I don't know. I don't know
how I miss these things.

391
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:45,610
I clearly watching the wrong
shit on the Internet. Oh,

392
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:48,090
you're a former CIA
guy. I should know this.

393
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,750
The important thing is I don't have
time for college. Okay, well but this,

394
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,290
but what you just showed, I mean,
people look at that and I go, okay,

395
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,810
but you're right. The Ilan Mustang is
getting closer to creepy that Bobby,

396
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,450
a real guy. But you could have someone
like that say, give me $1 million or oh,

397
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,090
bull your house up or just come on. Yeah.
And imagine if he gave, um, you know,

398
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:12,600
some off the cuff, um, financial data on,

399
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,270
on Tesla now talks about it as if,

400
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,370
as if he'd just come out of a shareholder
call and now he was releasing some

401
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,990
information. Let me think
about what that means to the,

402
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,260
all of a sudden the stock price of, of a
company, if that, if that happens. But,

403
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,290
um, the quality is,

404
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,830
is so far beyond even that
now that we can be done by,

405
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:31,380
and we're talking mostly state
actors like, like Russia.

406
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,210
And so the problem we're facing now is
it's not just everybody's kind of kind of

407
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:39,600
aware of, you know, the, the sort
of, the tweet averse or whatever,

408
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,580
the Twitter and, um,

409
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,270
the trolls that exist on there and the
bots and all of that. But it's the video,

410
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:47,670
the ability to do the
video they released. One,

411
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,750
one was done not too long ago
with Nancy Pelosi. And it,

412
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,320
all it did was slow down
her speech just slightly,

413
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,980
but just enough to make it sound
as if she was slurring her words.

414
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,700
Maybe she'd had a couple of drinks and
that thing was blasted all over social

415
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:05,580
media and people to this day still think
and they still talk about it. Like,

416
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:09,060
you know, she's kind of losing it a
little bit and right. And that like,

417
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,800
or more by the way, if she did that, yeah,

418
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,510
I think she might make
a little more sense.

419
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,670
Get a little lightened up lady worth
$100 million and no one knows why you

420
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,840
should have be out there partying. I'm
sure it was all, oh, so legit. Yeah.

421
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,440
She earned that $100 million. Sure.

422
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,310
There's definitely no
shenanigans, no shenanigans, no,

423
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:34,050
there's nothing like that happening up
on Capitol Hill. Um, but it's, so this,

424
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:36,390
this is a, it's something
that people should watch.

425
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,670
It's something that people should,
you know, read up on a little bit,

426
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:39,504
look at it,

427
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,990
because the technology is advancing so
quickly that the effort to combat it,

428
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:43,950
the effort would detect it.

429
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:47,290
And there's some companies out there and
certainly the, the, the government is,

430
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,300
is working to do that. DARPA
and some others are working,

431
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:55,070
but the effort to try to
identify doctored videos,

432
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,240
right, and particularly when you're
talking about elections campaigns, um,

433
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,910
is, is it's going to be a,

434
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:05,990
an increasing problem that
we're not really discussing
that much and congress is

435
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:10,400
paying a little bit of attention
to it right now. Um, but it's, uh,

436
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,100
it's really problematic and
there's, there's things that,

437
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,670
that you used to be
able to look for, right?

438
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:21,320
Lighting and noise and just sort
of the movements of the face, uh,

439
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,160
what they call micro heartbeats and,
and all the little things is the,

440
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:27,770
is the subject in the video
blinking for instance,

441
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:31,130
when your doctor at sometimes they'd the
blinking wouldn't be there and that was

442
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:34,100
a tell. But the, the people
involved in all of this,

443
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,000
in creating these deep fakes
are working, um, you know,

444
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:42,320
at such a pace that they're getting
ahead of that. So, uh, it's, I mean,

445
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,840
it's fascinating anyway, they're coming
up with ways to try to counter it.

446
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:46,430
But I guess the, the biggest point is,

447
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:50,210
it sounds like a public
service announcement is
people need to be aware of it

448
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,960
and they need to be smart about
it. Of course they won't be,

449
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,240
everybody goes to the Internet and they,

450
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,250
they lose their minds and they believe
whatever it is that they read that agrees

451
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:02,540
with their opinion and there is no
bothering of checking, you know, uh,

452
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,490
whether anything is actually
legit anymore or not.

453
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,960
But if that would be my one piece of
advice going into 2020 starting now,

454
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,450
pay attention. Don't believe
anything you see until you prove it.

455
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,780
And that's part of the problem too, right?
If we stop believing anything we see.

456
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,030
But if I was a skeptical person, right,
if I was a conspiracy minded individual,

457
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:23,480
I'd say,

458
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,170
but you're not this guy who used to
work for the CIA is telling us not to

459
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:29,600
believe the news. Wait,
I see what you're saying.

460
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,350
What I'm saying is you
are setting us up. Okay,

461
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:36,080
well it's time for me to go look at that.

462
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,000
Wouldn't normal skeptical person want
to think like why is he danced? I guess?

463
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,030
I guess I'm saying I'm saying it wrong
cause you're right. I don't mean to say,

464
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:48,890
I don't mean to imply, I guess what
I'm saying is trust but verify,

465
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:49,371
right? When,

466
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:52,640
when when you're looking at a video of a
candidate or you're looking at anything

467
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:56,960
really on the Internet now just
be aware of the capabilities.

468
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,960
Maybe that's a better way of putting
all of this because you're right,

469
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:01,280
you don't want that part of the problem.

470
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:03,030
And one of the things
that Russia does and,

471
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:06,680
and others who are involved in
this whole propaganda effort, um,

472
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,620
one of the things they do want to do is
undermine our confidence obviously in

473
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,830
media. So, you know, by me saying
don't believe what you see,

474
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm kind of feeding into that.
So you're right, I shouldn't,

475
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:18,860
I shouldn't go that route. Be
Aware of what the capabilities are,

476
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,760
pay attention.

477
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,460
Everybody should just be a little
bit smarter about what they're doing.

478
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,820
That's all I'm saying. So, and
also what we're looking at now,

479
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,950
it's so much more powerful than
what we had three or four years ago.

480
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,370
Three or four years ago, this technology
was not available for the consumer,

481
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,560
but now it is. Well, there was, I mean,
you think about it not to get too deep,

482
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,070
but if you think about the, the
photography, how long has photography been

483
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,380
around? There have been efforts to
manipulate photography, right? So the,

484
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,090
so altering photographs has been
around almost as long as the, the,

485
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:52,500
the medium itself. Um,

486
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,040
you go to a photo shop, um,

487
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,480
that kind of put it all in the
hands of the consumer, you know, um,

488
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,030
what you were talking about face swap,
uh, the new face app to age people.

489
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,900
Yeah. Um,

490
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,840
all these things make it easier for
whoever's got a smart phone to try to do

491
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:12,240
this. But what you really,
and that's a problem as well,

492
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,920
but one of the things that you really
have to worry about is against what are

493
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:17,250
the state actors like a Russia, I mean,

494
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,910
Russia was behind the faces
swamp thing. Well, yeah,

495
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:25,140
and that's a good first step, right?
There are Russian companies that are, uh,

496
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,380
pushing this technology out there. And
what are they doing every, you know,

497
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,130
every time you do that, it's recording
data about you. Well, not only that,

498
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:35,070
you have to give your name and your email,

499
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,150
right to get that application and then
they have a photo of your face that

500
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:40,950
correlates with your name and your email.

501
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,160
So what they've done is they've gathered
up more than 150 million emails and

502
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:51,420
faces and they have data
on people. Yeah, that is,

503
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,170
that's pretty powerful stuff. Like if
you think about what Facebook has done,

504
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:55,411
right?

505
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:59,340
What Facebook has made billions and
billions of dollars by essentially mining

506
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:02,190
data, right? That's what they're
about, right? Google's the same thing.

507
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,080
They're mining data. Well,

508
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,890
Russia managed to do that with
150 million people in a very,

509
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:11,010
very short amount of time just
by making something cute. Oh,

510
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:12,930
let's see what I look like.
What am I a hundred men now?

511
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:14,480
What do you think they're
doing with that data there?

512
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:17,370
They're slicing and dicing this, trying
to understand the American electorate,

513
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,293
right? They're going to,

514
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,120
they're not going to stop doing what
they did and they've been doing this

515
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:24,470
forever. We talked about this before,
they'd been doing this since 1940s. Right.

516
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,890
Busy trying to keep the US out of world
war two before they broke up with the

517
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:33,450
Nazis. It was as it was a serious breakup,
a, but when they were still aligned,

518
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:36,870
they were busy paying off journalists
and buying trade unions and all the rest

519
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:38,280
of it. So they're not,

520
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,280
they're never gonna stop what they do
because it's worked for them and it's just

521
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,030
kind of in their DNA. But isn't that
also what the United States does as well?

522
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,380
And there's gotta be some sort of

523
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,840
counter-intelligence stuff that we do
that is sort of shading. Shoot. Well,

524
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:56,350
I don't know about shade. Justifiably
shady. How about that? Gee,

525
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,800
I like that. Okay. That's a good
term. Yeah, of course there is.

526
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,470
And people always do that. [inaudible]
you know, when I, when I'm talking about,

527
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:04,990
if I, if I'm giving a talk about,
uh, uh, Chinese government, uh,

528
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,590
constant theft of
intellectual property, um,

529
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,740
somebody inevitably will
come up afterwards and they
will kind of roll their

530
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:14,070
eyes and go, well, we do it.
It's not like it's just them.

531
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:17,520
The U S is guilty of it too. What you
damn well better hope we are. Right.

532
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,910
Because if we backed off and said,
you know what, just you know,

533
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:22,740
for the sake of being
of righteous individual,

534
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,090
we're not gonna do any of this shit.

535
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,990
You would have to be with
willfully ignorant, naive,

536
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,510
or just fucking stupid to
think that Russia, China,

537
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:33,240
these other actors out there
are gonna stop also. Right.

538
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,000
And we're all gonna hold hands and
Unicorns going to flying out of our ass.

539
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,250
It's not gonna happen. So yeah,

540
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,980
I mean I guess the answer to that
is always the same, which is yeah,

541
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,570
better hope we do it and we've
been to hope we do it well. Yeah.

542
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:45,490
But people are nervous about that, right?

543
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,650
Like this is my point
about the military budget.

544
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,080
Like if you just cut the
military entirely, well,

545
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:53,530
we're all going to start speaking Chinese
because some shit's going to go down.

546
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,140
Like you can't just cut the military
budget. You just, you can't, I mean,

547
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,070
just cut it out. One. No, no military at
all. We're going to focus on ourselves.

548
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:05,380
Yeah, we'll got fucking luck
with that. That doesn't work.

549
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:08,170
So the question is like how much money
should you spend on the military?

550
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:10,500
How much money should you
spend on counter-intelligence?

551
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,390
How much money should
you spend on propaganda?

552
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,230
I mean there should be some money
spent on propaganda overseas, right?

553
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:17,861
Cause we're,

554
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,590
we're trying to manipulate them the
way they're trying to manipulate us.

555
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,300
The idea though is that where America
we're nice where the good guys,

556
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,260
we're doing it the right way supposedly.
Yeah. Well there is that right?

557
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,200
There is that and there's, and you know
what, honestly, I'll be honest with you,

558
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,800
I'd, I've always, you know, like
maybe I'm naive or whatever,

559
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,650
but that was always my thought process.

560
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,330
When we're out there in the operational
world and you think, you know what,

561
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,640
okay so doing this, but we're
doing it for the right reason.

562
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,210
And people laugh at that
or whatever. But you know,

563
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,720
this is my phone so I'll look at that,
see that flag dad long may a wave.

564
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,180
That's how I am.

565
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:55,360
I open up my phone to flag waves
that may have got a flag behind me.

566
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,440
I'm a hundred percent pro America.
I got, I opened up my phone,

567
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,480
we like to throw it. I got, I
got, I got nothing. I got nothing.

568
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:05,590
I got I over the phone too. Is that
some sort of like hack free? Yeah.

569
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:08,730
Phone from the 60s. This is
actually a windup. A phone.

570
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,520
It's a phone. Yeah, I do have a flip.
The government can't, oh, there you go.

571
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,970
Yeah. And you know what I've got,

572
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,070
I've got a collection of phones going all
the way back to the cinderblock phone.

573
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,461
Remember that one?

574
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:25,450
I bet you guys fantastic Saudi Arabian
numbers on them and shit letters.

575
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,590
I assumed everybody does, but yeah,

576
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,720
that I think do this is your phones that
like are like hack proof until you this

577
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,100
phones that you can't use? Well, yeah,
you certainly know that, you know,

578
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,600
from an operational perspective, um,
you know, phones are not a good idea.

579
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,140
Now the problem is they're ubiquitous
and everybody uses them and it, you know,

580
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,570
it's made life very easy and it's also
even made life a little bit less secure.

581
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:56,260
Obviously. I know a guy
that is a, let's just say,

582
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,400
done some very unusual journalism and, uh,

583
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,060
he still has a phone that you
can take the batteries out. Yes.

584
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,330
He said there's some places where you go
where they will not let you in the room

585
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,730
if you have a phone. And so the,

586
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,590
the work around is he has an older Samsung
phone where you can pop the back off

587
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,390
and remove the battery. And that's the
only way. Yeah. I mean, that's, um,

588
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,190
you know, I, I would still argue there's,
there's workarounds on that one, so.

589
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,180
Yeah. But, um, Eh, yeah. You
know, that's why when you,

590
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:30,850
when you go into a government facility,
you know, they go at a skiff, you know,

591
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,760
you got to leave your phones outside,
you know, the lead box. Right, right.

592
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:36,880
So you don't tell, you don't carry your
phones in, you know, unless you're,

593
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,290
what was her name that was
doing that and walking into, oh,

594
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,570
the fucking chick from the
apprentice. Yeah, that's Amarosa.

595
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,450
That's how hilarious is that by the way.
I know her. I did fear factor with her.

596
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,330
She was on Fairfax. She told me I was
drunk because I was making fun of her.

597
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,460
It's like you're drunk. I'm like, no, I'm
not. I'm just making fun of you. Yeah.

598
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:58,490
Why wouldn't you? But, but
she's, she's an unusual person.

599
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,940
The fact that she thought it was okay
to do what is a basically treasonous,

600
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,250
she was recording these conversations
inside the White House and then releasing

601
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:14,180
them to the press. How is she not
in jail? How does that work? Yeah.

602
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm not quite sure. I didn't
quite understand how you,
how you get around that,

603
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:19,760
right? Because you've got
obligations, you signed paperwork,

604
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:21,800
you do all these things and say,
I'm going to do the right thing.

605
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,850
And if you run foul of that, then you're
supposed to suffer the consequences.

606
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:29,990
And occasionally it seems like people
aren't, uh, want to know what I think,

607
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,870
what, I think she saw some shit and they
pulled her aside and they said, listen,

608
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,251
I'm real,

609
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:38,150
so I know that you're some sort of a
social climb or whatever you're trying to

610
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,490
do here. And listen what you did.

611
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,490
We'll literally get you locked in
jail for the rest of your life.

612
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:45,110
So how bout this?

613
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,970
How about you just shut your pie
hole and we'll just let this slide.

614
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,400
Yeah. I don't know that she's,
I don't think anybody would,

615
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,490
I mean from a county intelligence
perspective and she'd be one of the last

616
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,100
people you would trust to actually keep
her mouth shut up already period of

617
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:01,940
time. So I'm saying, um, yeah, that's,
that's a tough one. But that was,

618
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,140
that's it. That's also part of
the, the, the issue of, of of, uh,

619
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,230
leaks as an example, right? I mean,

620
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,750
the issue of choices that you make
for your cabinet as well. Right.

621
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,040
Well that's true. Yeah. [inaudible]
closed circle around you. And that's,

622
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,820
you know, again, you
can argue, I mean, we,

623
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,670
I don't want to get into
a political discussion.

624
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:23,780
Trump is an unusual character and you
know, they certainly, they, I know. Wow.

625
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,880
Wow. That's going to be
the, that'll be headlines.

626
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,780
How about that fellow that's from England
that looks like the divorce judge.

627
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,600
Yeah. The boy John Trump. I was
just there last week when, uh,

628
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:35,210
when he went over to Buckingham
Palace and, and you know, uh,

629
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,810
was asked by the queen to form the new
government and he accepted. And so,

630
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,210
you know, he's, he's an
interesting character.

631
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,390
He went to eat and he went
to Oxford. Um, he's, uh,

632
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,190
he's proven himself to be
extremely adept at getting, uh,

633
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,420
getting elected and most importantly,
he looks like Trump's baby brother.

634
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,760
Yeah. Yeah. You know
what? I suck is fucked up.

635
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,560
Like Trump's dad went over to England
and bang some waitress and, uh, Bam.

636
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,160
Next thing you know, look at
the two of them together. Oh,

637
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,150
get the fuck outta here.
This is mine. This is,

638
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,160
I got a buddy of mine sent me this one

639
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,070
that's a south park one. It's
him with a bike helmet on.

640
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,540
That's the best side by side. I've
seen so far better. This one's better.

641
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,370
Oh yeah. I mean,

642
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:24,371
it literally looks like a young Trump
cousin or a brother or something like

643
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:26,440
that, but he's promised, you
know, he's promised their,

644
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,470
they're out as far as Brexit goes by,
you know, Halloween by 31 October.

645
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,230
They're done. And they're done with
the whole European Union. Yeah.

646
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,560
Well that's what, that's
what they're saying.

647
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,000
And basically now what they're
concerned about, of course, is that

648
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,890
it's a, it's a hard, uh,
hard exit, right. No deal.

649
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,020
But he's saying it doesn't
matter. If that's the case,

650
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:46,210
then that's what we've got to do. And
there's a lot of people, it's, it's,

651
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,020
it's interesting, the dynamic is a
little bit like here in the u s right.

652
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,080
If you're in the northeast corridor and
Washington, New York, whatever, Boston,

653
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,260
or you're out here on the
west coast and you, you,

654
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,790
you tend to view the world
differently than everything else,

655
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,530
the rest of the mass
of the country. Right.

656
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,690
Which is why people lost their
minds and they thought, you know,

657
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:08,190
how could Trump possibly get elected?
The UK is a little bit like that,

658
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:11,460
that Brexit vote came around and everybody
in London was convinced that we're,

659
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,010
you know, it's gonna be 95%.
You know, we're not leaving.

660
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,350
And so when it came time and they'd
voted to leave in 2001, it was 16, uh,

661
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,900
the people in London lost their
minds. They couldn't believe it,

662
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:25,290
and they still to this day, uh, think
everybody else is just an idiot. Right?

663
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,510
So there's a similarity say, which is
I think why in part Trump, you know,

664
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,030
feels sort of that this kinship with
Boris Johnson. Um, but yeah, so he's,

665
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,580
Boris Johnson has said, but that's
it. We're out of here. You know,

666
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,040
maybe we can get a deal if we can't,
it doesn't matter. We're still leaving.

667
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,440
And it'll be interesting to see what
happens. But, uh, you know, he's not, uh,

668
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,280
he's not unpopular. Um, what's
the argument for them leaving?

669
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,440
What's the pro Brexit argument? Do
you really want to have your country,

670
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,340
your sovereign nation,

671
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:58,341
run by a bunch of faceless technocrats
living in Brussels who have really zero

672
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:02,400
interest in your sovereign nation.
Right? Uh, that's at the heart of it.

673
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,760
It's not an economic decision.
And people always make that,

674
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:07,710
that problem with Brexit, they always
say, well, from an economic perspective,

675
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:12,210
this is not a good thing. Well, the
deal at heart isn't an economic concern.

676
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,090
It's a, it's the issue of, of serenity.

677
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,630
It's the issue of being run
again by Brussels W W and, and,

678
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,490
and sort of the morass of, of
regulations that they've imposed. Um,

679
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:27,720
the inability for the UK to make
their own decisions about trade. Um,

680
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,520
and so there's a, you know, there,

681
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,820
there's a good argument in that regard.

682
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,210
Is it going to be a financial problem for
them? It's not going to be a disaster.

683
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,910
Like some people, you know, throw out
there and say, oh my God, this is gonna.

684
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,780
You know, the UK is going down the toilet
fast. That won't happen. But it'll be,

685
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:46,440
there'll be an upheaval if they, if
they, you know, leave without a deal,

686
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,290
but they'll adjust. Cause everybody, you
know, people want to do deals, right?

687
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:52,020
They want to do trade. It's
not like Germany and France,

688
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,620
which are the only two partners in
the EU that really matter. You know,

689
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,760
how dare you, I know I had, I can't
believe I just said that. What's the, um,

690
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,970
what's the, staying in the
European Union argument, um,

691
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,490
show everybody not racist at you.
Yeah. Global globalism, you know, it's,

692
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,880
we're all working together and isn't
this a wonderful thing and look at,

693
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,540
you know, all the benefits of it free
movement and you know, that free movement,

694
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,700
you know, didn't really
work that well from,

695
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,740
from France and Germany's
perspective, you know,

696
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:23,670
they don't like to talk about that anymore
for women is basically what we enjoy

697
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,050
in the United States
though, isn't it? I mean,

698
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:28,200
if you look at the United States
relative size in comparison to Europe,

699
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,620
we're basically commensurate, right? Yeah.

700
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,300
In terms of the contiguous United
States. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

701
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,160
And we all speak

702
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,050
the same language, but I'm talking about,

703
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:39,310
I'm talking about immigration policies.

704
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:42,070
I'm not talking about movement within
the EU. No, no, I understand. But I mean,

705
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,960
yeah, even in immigration, right?

706
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:47,560
Like the size of these countries in
comparison to the size of states,

707
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,790
like Texas is basically bigger than a
lot of fucking European nations, right?

708
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,720
Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, it is, um,

709
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,930
that arguments, what are
the immigration argument?

710
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,990
Much like some of the other arguments
that comes down from the UK is perspective

711
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:05,860
on don't tell us what to
do. Right. And you know,

712
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:08,800
maybe there's still an element of,
look, we, you know, we, we're an empire.

713
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,130
They control most of the planet for
awhile. You know, we'd like to, you know,

714
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,400
have a little bit more say in
what we're doing. So there,

715
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:15,400
there's an independent streak.

716
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:19,360
The problem is from [inaudible]
perspective is if they
do leave and it's not a

717
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:22,470
disaster, then other countries
are going to line up, right.

718
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,600
And Italy maybe would be the next one.

719
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,590
So it'll be interesting to
see what happens. But yeah.
Boggio as they call them.

720
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:35,020
Um, is an interesting cat, not unlike
our, our president in this country.

721
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:38,740
We don't pay attention to other countries.
So when we see that we see that guy,

722
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:43,180
like who is that guy? This new guy,
where did he come from? Is this real?

723
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,970
It's like a new character on a show
that you don't watch. Right, right.

724
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,320
You know what season that he come
in better call Saul season four.

725
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,260
Like who the fuck is that guy? The
new bad guy. Ah, I didn't watch, uh,

726
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,740
haven't been watching. I just
uh, I finished rewatching,

727
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:58,330
I do that instead of watching new shows.

728
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:01,480
I ended up re watching shows that I
really liked and I've watched before and

729
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:04,300
it's been a while. So I re watched the
first season of breaking bad again.

730
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,320
God damn good show. Holy Shit. That
was so well done. Yeah. And that,

731
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,400
just that first season,

732
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,710
if that's all people watch and they
haven't seen it before, it's so good.

733
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,540
But uh, yeah. And then I just,

734
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,690
I just binge watched the first
season of the sopranos again.

735
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,590
That's a great show. That was the
first show that really in my mind,

736
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:25,830
it created the first real anti-hero
that everybody actually appreciated on

737
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:29,140
television. Everybody loved Tony
Soprano. He's a fucking murderer,

738
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,340
constantly cheated on his wife,
strangled his best friend. He's like, oh,

739
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,650
I'd like them. Yeah. He's like,
he's an interesting cat. Yeah.

740
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,500
Well it was at dynamic with
his mother, right? That was,

741
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:41,650
that's what the hook was. And that
certainly that first season was just that,

742
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,260
that was fascinating to
people and still, you know,

743
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:45,960
still is speaking of deep fakes,

744
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,360
remember when they tried to bring
them on back after she died? No.

745
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,410
Liked the Shitty CGI. Yeah.

746
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,140
That's what shows you like in 2005
CGI was goddamn terrible. Well,

747
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,720
if you think about when
Photoshop, Photoshop was out
in what the early nineties,

748
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,410
I guess, late eighties,
early nineties, um,

749
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,440
you think about where we've come
since then, um, not to, not,

750
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,360
again, not to go back into the, sort of,
the, this whole thing with deep fakes,

751
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,380
but it is when people talk about, um,

752
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,610
Russia collusion and they talk about,
we kind of lost our way. Right.

753
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,560
And you know, everybody's
Kinda guilty of it,

754
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,210
whether it's Mueller and
his investigative team,

755
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,310
or whether it's congress or whether
it's just the general public.

756
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:28,030
We all kind of lost our way over the past
couple of years imagining somehow that

757
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,680
the big story here was, uh,
Trump's collusion, right? Well,

758
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:33,680
that was a political

759
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,970
dodge, right? That was a shell game
that was being played on us. It was,

760
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,380
the big story is what did
Russia specifically do? Right?

761
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:46,280
What exactly did they do? How did
they do it? How successful were they?

762
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,430
Show us some case studies
of, of specific examples.

763
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,670
That's what an investigative team
should have been doing for two years.

764
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,560
And then deliver that information and
keep throwing it out at the public and

765
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:02,250
keep talking to the public about it.
A guarantee of the, the GRU and, and,

766
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:06,980
and others, uh, the FSU at the, in, in
the Intel services in the, in Russia,

767
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,890
they're happy that we didn't
do that, right. Because again,

768
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:13,130
they've been in advancing, they've been
improving their, their capabilities.

769
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,430
They're gonna do it again. So I guess
that's why I keep beating on this as that.

770
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,190
I don't think we,

771
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,450
we really focused our attention to where
we needed to because we all get lost in

772
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:23,930
this political bullshit. And while I feel,

773
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:28,070
I feel like this is the most easily
manipulated we've ever been as a,

774
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,113
as a culture,

775
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:34,510
like I think it's so easy to spin these
narratives and to get people upset about

776
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:38,840
anything. Right. And there I th I feel
like a lot of these are test cases,

777
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,740
like they're trying to see like what
happens when we spin up this story? How,

778
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,490
how outrage do they get at that
story? We'll look at and look at this,

779
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,070
look at the issue of racism. You
know, look at, look at, I mean,

780
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,910
th that thing gets thrown out there now
to the point where it's, it's, you know,

781
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,210
yeah, I hate to say it, but it's, it's
almost losing its meaning in a sense.

782
00:42:56,211 --> 00:43:00,170
Right? They just keep hammering
away anybody they disagree with.

783
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:04,310
And I'm talking about the, the, the
hard left. Progressive. You're a racist,

784
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,400
right? It's not possible that you
could possibly disagree on policy.

785
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:12,370
I like that. Whatever. That's a squad,
you know, AOC and her competitors.

786
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,200
I don't give a shit about,
you know, where they're from.

787
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,200
I care about the fact that their
policies from my perspective,

788
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:20,030
other people I'm sure love 'em, you know,

789
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:24,440
a screwed up and screwed up
about their policies. Well, um,

790
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,180
I'm not a democratic
socialist, right? So, um, I,

791
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,220
I have a problem with everything from,
you look at the, the green new deal,

792
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:34,581
right?

793
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:39,170
And this idea that we're gonna roll
this out and fuck the economic impact we

794
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:42,980
know or I know about the economic impact.

795
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:45,310
I think what they're doing is
they're just, they're playing to the,

796
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:50,080
they're a base and they're doing it
successfully and people hear about it and

797
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,430
everybody wants to be righteous.
Everybody wants to think, sure,

798
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:55,130
if I care about the environment,
let's get rid of emissions.

799
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,090
That'll be a great idea.

800
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,460
And whether it's that or open borders
and the idea that somehow we're,

801
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,140
you know, do I think we're running
concentration camps down south? No,

802
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,480
I don't think that that gets
fucked up that we would,

803
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,460
that's the terminology that we
would have, right. For detainments,

804
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:16,040
for detainment centers. And
you know what, you want to,

805
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,380
you want to make it
better, we'll great. Let's,

806
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:21,770
let's actually do what your job is.
Let's make some changes to the, to the,

807
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:24,770
to the, uh, immigration
rules and to, to asylum laws.

808
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:28,370
Let's put some more money down there, um,

809
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,920
and make conditions a little bit
better. There's things that we could,

810
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,000
in terms of concrete steps, but we
don't, we don't seem to want to do that.

811
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:40,920
We seem to want to just throw shit
around at each other. And, and I, and,

812
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,230
but the open border thing is,
is, is, uh, is, is worrisome.

813
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,810
There's a guy named John
Norris who was just on, um, uh,

814
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:51,020
my friend Steve Grinnell's podcast.
It's called the mediator podcast.

815
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,200
And he's a, a a warden.
He's a game warden.

816
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,530
And one of the things that they had to
deal with somewhere along the line was

817
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:00,980
they had to become enforcers
for illegal drug, uh,

818
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,680
drug marijuana growing, um,

819
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:09,320
these establishments in public
lands in national parks.

820
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,970
So these guys that were supposed to be
just catching people with too many trout

821
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:18,020
on the stringer are now being
forced to stop illegal grow ops.

822
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,910
And it's all cartel members.

823
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,180
And what he's saying is that 80 to 90%
of all of the marijuana that gets sold

824
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,280
illegally in this country, in the Midwest,

825
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:31,760
and all the different places where it's
illegal is coming out of these grow ups.

826
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,080
And a lot of it is tainted with dangerous
pesticides because these guys are

827
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:36,914
trying to,

828
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,250
they're actually using poisons to keep
animals from eating the marijuana.

829
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,430
But so these kids that are, or
whoever the fuck is buying it,

830
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:47,540
they're buying this pot from these illegal
places. No one's testing this stuff.

831
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:48,680
You don't know what the
fuck you're getting.

832
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:51,620
And you very well could be
smoking pot that's poisoning you.

833
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:56,170
Yeah. This, uh, a guy that I know, really
good guy, so he's a huge land owner,

834
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,030
uh, here in California, uh,

835
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:01,720
to the point where you can spend all day
on an ATV and, and still not, you know,

836
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,810
get to the end of one of his plots of
land. And I'd be call it a plot of land.

837
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,870
And anyway, he's had those, uh,
incidents, right. He's had where they,

838
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:14,980
it's such a massive piece
of property that, uh,

839
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,240
ate a small element from a cartel will
set up a gross spot there and you know,

840
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,110
they'll camouflage it. It's
very well done. Uh, they,

841
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,020
you bring in the piping for the water
cause it w pot uses a huge amount of

842
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:29,270
water. I was talking about
one that they brought in,

843
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,190
they had a pipe that went
for three miles. Yeah.

844
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,380
These kids carried it on their
back. Yeah. That's what they,

845
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:35,390
that's what these guys do. And
then, and then eventually, you know,

846
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,120
you got to go in there and busted up,

847
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:40,730
but it's people that stumble
across it that, you know, it,

848
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,810
they're just out there doing their
regular ranching job and it's, it's,

849
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:49,420
it is fascinating. I look, I, um, I
feel like we should take those guys,

850
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,380
reprogram them.

851
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,010
You get a guy who's willing to carry a
hundred pounds of piping on his back and

852
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,970
walk eight miles into the backwoods.
That's a fucking industrious individual.

853
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:01,320
You got to, you got to lure them away
from the cartel with a better deal. Yeah.

854
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:05,590
If that guy worked for a competing
corporation, he'd be like, look,

855
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:06,970
I like the way you do business.

856
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,500
Right. Give them a job
on the ranch. You know,

857
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,520
give him a check on this guy and he was
working for Verizon. They'd be like,

858
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:13,500
Hey, come on over here, man.

859
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,780
Put in the time these guys carry
on three miles of hose on his back.

860
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:21,280
That's work. That's what
we call [inaudible]. Yeah.

861
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:25,230
So you said you use your power for good,
not evil. That's what I tell my boys.

862
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,490
It's hard though because evil's fun.

863
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:30,400
I think it's a way within the short
term it could be more lucrative.

864
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,260
Yeah. From their
perspective, there is that.

865
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,160
And they have a record and probably
murderer reasons. All right,

866
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,190
so maybe we're not talking about somebody
you're going to hire as a landscape or

867
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,690
they're your home, but uh,

868
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,550
but your point is open board is not a
good idea and borders not a good idea.

869
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,700
It's a lot of bad people that are
getting in already. And it's not,

870
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:49,630
it's not a stretch.

871
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:52,990
This is not if anybody who imagined this
to be a stretcher or it's going to take

872
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:56,170
offense at this. Every
nation maintains borders.

873
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,400
Every nation maintain some element
of, of immigration controls and,

874
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,390
and borders, uh, protection. Um,
the idea that we shouldn't have,

875
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:08,950
that we should somehow feel exceptionally
bad about it is I don't quite

876
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:10,960
understand that mentality. Uh,

877
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,460
we should feel bad when we see someone
who's just a poor mother who's trying to

878
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:18,880
come over to America to get a better job
cause she's stuck in Guatemala and it

879
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:22,790
sucks over there and there's
no opportunity whatsoever
for her to excel, right?

880
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,210
That's a different animal than
someone who is a, a member of a,

881
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,110
some fucking terrible
cartel gang that comes over.

882
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,700
The question is how do we differentiate
and how do we make it so that that woman

883
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:37,210
who's a mom can come over here, right?
How do we make it so it's legal?

884
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,580
That's the real question.
And that's when I wish that,

885
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,500
but that's not what they're
addressing, right? Well,

886
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,040
how many decades now have we, you know,

887
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,960
heard about immigration controls and
immigration process and regulations and

888
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:51,570
policy and then nothing ever
gets done. And so maybe,

889
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,660
and again, I think one of the things
that's interesting about Trump, um,

890
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,130
is as, as strange as as
it is the environment.

891
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:04,900
I mean maybe the fact
that he is disruptive and
sometimes it doesn't seem to

892
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,710
give a shit.

893
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,320
Maybe that's a good thing because it
gets us talking and gets us talking in

894
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:11,440
areas that we haven't before and
in ways that we haven't before.

895
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,210
So maybe that results in something,
maybe like the Chinese, Eh,

896
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,580
the public's just going to wait for
him to go and then we'll get back to

897
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,490
business as usual. That may
happen in business as usual.

898
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,510
The concern is like if it,

899
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,820
how do you differentiate between someone
who's coming in illegally because they

900
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:31,120
want a better life versus someone who's
coming in illegally because they're

901
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:36,100
literally going to commit murder and
sell fentanyl and deal, you know,

902
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,000
incredible harm to whatever
community they wind up in.

903
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:43,630
And they were a member of ms 13 and
they're going to hear there's both things

904
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:46,090
that are going on at the same time and
you're a heartless person if you don't

905
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:49,330
want that lady with a child from Guatemala
to come over here and do better and

906
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:51,190
she's probably gonna work as hard,

907
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:54,940
if not harder than any good old fashioned
red blooded American that's over here

908
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,610
trying to make their way through this
world and why should we be able to have

909
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,640
this opportunity when they can? Yeah. One
of the beautiful things about America,

910
00:50:00,641 --> 00:50:00,890
right,

911
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,420
is that like if you're a poor person
and you live in Baltimore or you can get

912
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:08,680
your shit together and get out and you
can move to maybe silicon valley or you

913
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:10,540
can move somewhere where
there's more prosperity,

914
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:13,720
there's more opportunity and you can
get some other poor people in Baltimore.

915
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:17,470
I heard there are, okay, I heard
there's, I'm going to pay attention.

916
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:21,640
Some sort of a, there's a word, what
does the word he used? Infestation.

917
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,500
Infestation of rat infestation.

918
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,710
You can't use infestation when you're
talking about certain neighborhoods.

919
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:28,370
People get mad, even
though he said infested

920
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,890
with crime and rats, you
still, you're racist.

921
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,220
It doesn't matter. The,
the, the, the key here is,

922
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,860
and it's a democratic talking
point, right? I mean this is the,

923
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,610
this is a strategy and that's fine.
Both parties used different strategies,

924
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:40,871
you know, but the,

925
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,830
the Dems have obviously decided in this
period of time because it's so intense.

926
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:49,570
There was clearly discussions within
wherever the DNC or elsewhere that this is

927
00:50:49,571 --> 00:50:52,150
our policy. We are going
to push this and we just,

928
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:56,020
you just keep hammering that word,
racist, racist, racist, no matter what.

929
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,380
And it's gonna stick. And it
does because you just, you,

930
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,670
you get hit by that hammer and you
kinda, you're staring into the light,

931
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:06,610
you don't know how to respond.
Right? So, and you think, oh my God,

932
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:08,710
I'm not a racist. But then,
you know, you're like, senator,

933
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:11,920
you're still beating your wife. And so
it's, it's one of those things you can't,

934
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,840
you can't answer. Um,

935
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,960
but I think it's bullshit because it's
like calling everybody a Nazi. It's,

936
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,820
you know, it loses its, its importance
and its meaning. And, and you know,

937
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,890
um, anyway, it's, it's a strange, strange
time, but I, I think you can do both.

938
00:51:26,891 --> 00:51:30,230
You can, you can take care of that,
that woman with the kid or kids and,

939
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:35,500
and you can also, um, you know, look
at the issue of border security,

940
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:40,510
right? And enhance your ability to
understand who's coming across the border.

941
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:45,790
It costs money and it, and it requires
effort, but you can do, you can do both.

942
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,960
I don't think you can do

943
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:50,680
both, but the, I think the real
big picture, the real big picture,

944
00:51:50,681 --> 00:51:53,110
like if you had to look at
the solution objectively,

945
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:58,260
the real problem is Mexico has like real
economic situations that we don't have

946
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:02,290
here in America. They're it, they're
far worse off than a lot of the areas.

947
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:06,160
And as is Guatemala, as is
the neighbor, El Salvador,

948
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:11,340
neighboring countries are economically
devastated until they are not until they

949
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:14,230
come up and until they
experience prosperity.

950
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,900
You're always going to have people that
are committing crime because they're

951
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,160
wanting to try to get by.

952
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,680
And you're always going to have people
that didn't want to gonna want to try to

953
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:23,380
get to America because it's a place
where there's more opportunity.

954
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,470
That's the real issue. The real issue
is that it's so much better over.

955
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,290
Right. And that's, and that makes sense.

956
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:31,730
And you get the same thing with
immigration and movement of, of, uh,

957
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:35,640
of people over in Europe coming up from,
from wherever, which is the mascot,

958
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,650
which is the Brexit
argument in part. I mean,

959
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:41,580
it's not just based on immigration, but
it's more control of your own nation's,

960
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,790
uh, security and destiny, et
cetera. But I think that that's,

961
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:49,530
you could argue that national security,
um, from a US perspective, uh,

962
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,140
would warrant, um,

963
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,970
improving your ability to impact
nations like Wa Tamala, El Salvador,

964
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,380
uh, wherever, uh,

965
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,580
and working with Mexico to not
just improve sort of the security,

966
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:05,970
the liaison that goes on and improving
that. But you're right, I mean,

967
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:09,900
working conditions, uh, criminal, you
know, uh, or crime and, and instability.

968
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,200
Um, that's in our national security
panel. People get, you know,

969
00:53:13,201 --> 00:53:15,460
they get very upset. I said, why
should we give countries money? Right?

970
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,740
Well in part, you're right. I mean,

971
00:53:16,741 --> 00:53:18,990
sometimes you give them money and it
just goes down some shit hole and it

972
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:20,760
doesn't, you know, and I don't mean to
tell, I'm not talking about the country,

973
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:23,190
I'm just talking literally it goes
into a hole and it never goes back.

974
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:27,110
It's in corruption and they, it, and at
the highest levels of government. Yeah.

975
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,630
So there's no, there's no controls over
how that money is spent. This note,

976
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:33,120
there's no metrics to say whether it's
spent wisely at the end of the day.

977
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,990
So you can [inaudible] but I would
argue that, yeah, I agree. I mean,

978
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:41,700
it's in our national security interest
when we're talking about, um, uh,

979
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:46,750
border security immigration to view
that as sort of the top line issue.

980
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,480
Why are they, why are they on the
move? Right. Well, like you said,

981
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:55,530
they're on the move because they want a
better life because where they're at and

982
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:59,120
good. Yes. How do you work with
them? And that's, you know, that's,

983
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,560
I think people sometimes
look at that and think, well,

984
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:03,630
that's pushing a rock up a hill.
It's never going to happen.

985
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:06,930
And so maybe they just
stop. Right. But, um,

986
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:11,640
we've ignored Latin America, Central
America, South America for decades. Right.

987
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:15,690
Which is how we ended up in part with,
with Chavez and Maduro have to follow.

988
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,300
And, and some of the Horse Shit that
went on down there, uh, because we,

989
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:22,590
we ignored it. We didn't
give it to resources. We
didn't give it the attention.

990
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:26,730
We didn't treat it seriously
as a national security concern.

991
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,470
We were all focused on wherever,

992
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:33,000
improving relations in Southeast
Asia or elsewhere. So, yeah,

993
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:36,300
we need to refocus. And I think
ultimately, do we see it immediately? No,

994
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:38,250
but I think you're so
anyway, it's, you know,

995
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,820
I think for people that are really
like a foreign policy, it is. Yeah.

996
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,500
With at least one dude who doesn't
know Jack Shit about foreign policy.

997
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:49,550
That would be me. That'd be a good
show though. But I, yeah, maybe, but I,

998
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:51,680
I really think in the
interest of national security,

999
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:56,681
legalizing marijuana federally would
stop the profitability of these gang

1000
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:59,510
members because you'd be
able to have legal marijuana,

1001
00:54:59,511 --> 00:55:00,560
you wouldn't have to be able to,

1002
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,900
you wouldn't need to buy
it in these other places.

1003
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:07,190
You'd be able to grow it yourself and
the price would drop through the fucking

1004
00:55:07,191 --> 00:55:12,191
floor and it would be not profitable for
these guys to haul three miles of pipe

1005
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:15,860
on their back and into the back country
and use someone else's land to make

1006
00:55:15,861 --> 00:55:18,020
these grow ops. And one of the
reasons why they're doing this,

1007
00:55:18,021 --> 00:55:19,940
particularly in California, I found out,

1008
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,460
is that when marijuana
became legal in California,

1009
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:26,530
these illegal grow ops became a
misdemeanor rather than a felony. So they,

1010
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:30,830
they do them over here instead of doing
it in Ohio or somewhere else where it's

1011
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:34,670
illegal. They do. And also, you know,
you could basically grow year round here.

1012
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:36,230
I was going to say from a
logistical point of view,

1013
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:40,430
if they'd just made it legal federally,
this cut the shit. We're all grownups.

1014
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:40,730
Yeah.

1015
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,880
Yeah. And there's a tremendous number
of issues related to the fact that,

1016
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,650
you know, the state and the
federal laws don't match up. Right.

1017
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,280
And from a law enforcement perspective,
it's a nightmare in a sense. Yeah.

1018
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,180
So nightmare. Yeah, I agree. You know
what, I, I know what will happen is,

1019
00:55:53,181 --> 00:55:55,650
I don't imagine that
the, it makes the, uh,

1020
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,930
cartel activity any different that sucking
sound that that is the revenues from,

1021
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,570
uh, from weed leaving
their, their accounts

1022
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,340
[inaudible] will be replaced by
something else. Who for sure.

1023
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,790
Whether it's get into the weed business
or admit. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean,

1024
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:12,300
although these pharmaceutical companies
that are fighting against it as well as

1025
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:16,440
these prison guard unions, which is really
crazy, that's the darkest one to me.

1026
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:18,660
It's like the pharmaceutical
companies, look, I get it.

1027
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:22,110
They're just creeps that are looking at
their bottom line that every business

1028
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:24,160
wants to constantly have new growth

1029
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,040
every year. They want to constantly
be making more money. I get it.

1030
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:31,270
It's like this universal eternal
growth model that they operate under,

1031
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,100
but the prison guard unions,

1032
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,090
when you find out that they lobby against
the legalization of marijuana is so

1033
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:38,740
insane. What to settle. I didn't know.

1034
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,370
They just want more people in
jail so that they have jobs.

1035
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,850
That's the idea behind it. It's, it's
the most un-american thing possible.

1036
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,690
You want more people in jail so that
you could have a job looking over those

1037
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:53,510
people. You basically, it's,
it's sickening. Yeah. That's a,

1038
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:57,730
that's a new one to me. I had, I had
no idea. The, the guard unions. Yeah,

1039
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,400
yeah, yeah. [inaudible] prisons in a
nutshell are called fucking crabs. Yeah.

1040
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:06,040
Private prisons. Is, is something that,
you know, and there have been, I mean,

1041
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:09,250
again, I'm, I'm with this current
administration, you know, there's,

1042
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,950
there's been some prison reform issues
that have been making their way through.

1043
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,470
Right. They've been actually
focused on it to some degree.

1044
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:15,940
Maybe thanks to Kim Kardashian.

1045
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,150
She said she's just looking at
fucking champion. She's a champion of,

1046
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,010
of people that are wrongly
incarcerated. She really is.

1047
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,430
I want to show you something. I'm like,
shout out to Kim K. I'm like one of the,

1048
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:31,780
and I'm like, you crazy. A crazy grandpa
that clips newspaper articles out. Um,

1049
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,580
but in preparation for the show,

1050
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:37,630
I know most people think I did no
preparation whatsoever. I know those guys.

1051
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:41,020
I still do to the newspaper. I do
as well. Look, you look at this,

1052
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,210
college has offered degree in courses in
the pot business. Oh, good move. Yeah.

1053
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:49,270
Yeah. So this is pop to now. Did you
know that podcast is a teaching podcast?

1054
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,780
Have two people that have gone back
to school for that, for product,

1055
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,620
not enough for pot. Pot. Yeah. It's
crazy. University of Maryland and Cornell,

1056
00:57:56,621 --> 00:57:59,170
that's the two that this
article talks about. Uh,

1057
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,200
well the biggest sponsorship that the
UFC has ever gotten ever is this Aurora

1058
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:08,650
company in Canada that grows
weed, CBD and marijuana.

1059
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,580
They have football fields
fill with weed and you know,

1060
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:16,960
the highest possible standards,
the best quality, no pesticides,

1061
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:20,530
herbicides, no bullshit.
Yeah, super pure. And the CBD,

1062
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:22,990
which is fantastic for
everybody's health. And I just,

1063
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,510
I'm back when I first
started working for the UFC,

1064
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,190
they were people that
worked for the organization,

1065
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,950
organizations that didn't like it,
that I smoked pot. They were like,

1066
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:34,880
why is he smoking? What's he doing?
It's going to sound pod company. Well,

1067
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:38,920
I mean, that's it. I will tell you
this as a apropos of nothing. I got,

1068
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:40,150
I've gotten calls,

1069
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,020
a couple of calls from people
in the industry who was saying,

1070
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,880
and the only reason they're
calling me is they're saying,

1071
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:49,120
can you hook hook me up with Joe is
like, we hang out together all the time.

1072
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,530
Of course. Right. Because we're always,

1073
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:54,160
we're always hanging out in
the pool together. Uh, Joe
and I, but so I said, no,

1074
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:57,310
look, dude, that's not my, that's not my
job. They want where they want from me.

1075
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:58,451
Um, you know what?

1076
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:02,310
I think they just want to pitch you on
business and bring some spokes in here.

1077
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,730
Fucking case. That joint.

1078
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,940
That's the one I do know that
people in the potty business.

1079
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,690
People in the pot business. Yeah.
Yeah. Amen. See, I got the SCIA calls.

1080
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,420
Great words. Yes. Spooks.

1081
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,920
We gotta be careful using that word
though cause people think you're racist.

1082
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,030
That was a racist term in the
70s. Well we did a black folks.

1083
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:23,750
I worked on a show for in the UK,
uh, an espionage drama show that ran,

1084
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:27,530
ran for eight or nine seasons and it was
called in the UK. It was called spooks.

1085
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,210
It was about, uh, their, uh, Intel
operation and it ran for a long time,

1086
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,171
but then they sold,

1087
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,690
they brought it over here to the
states and I think it was on an awesome

1088
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,940
channel. And um, but they had to change
the name. They changed to [inaudible],

1089
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,100
which is the name for the domestic
security service because they were worried

1090
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:46,520
about the term exactly. Spooks. It's
always been around. I mean it's,

1091
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,330
it's always been around the ideas that
the sneaky people that are doing creepy

1092
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:53,330
shit. There was no,

1093
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,990
there is no creepy shit being
done. You see what I mean?

1094
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,500
I'm here to tell you right now,
and you can write this down.

1095
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:04,840
I'm going to write it down, right.
There is no, no creepy shit going on.

1096
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,500
What's going on with a,

1097
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:11,000
a ram caught a bunch of people that they
are claiming our CIA performance and

1098
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:14,990
they may execute them. Yeah, yeah. They've
done this before. They've made this

1099
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,260
before. Um, and look, Iran is a, hey the,

1100
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,710
a couple of parts of this, um,

1101
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,430
that's one of the heaviest lifts in the
business has been intel collection on

1102
01:00:25,431 --> 01:00:27,890
Iran over the years. I'm not
talking about just recently,

1103
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,740
but over the years it's been,
it's been very difficult. Um,

1104
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:34,270
they are extremely buttoned up
over there and they have, uh,

1105
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:39,200
an incredible level of control over
their population, uh, and that, which is,

1106
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:41,030
you know, at some point
you would think, well,

1107
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:43,430
maybe the population is going
to object to this, but you know,

1108
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,320
it hasn't happened yet. Um,

1109
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,190
so part of it is they
came out with this, uh,

1110
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,330
I think 17 individuals that they claim
were cooperating with the CIA in some

1111
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:55,160
fashion or another, and they, you know,

1112
01:00:55,161 --> 01:00:58,370
they claimed that they were
fairly high level individuals. Um,

1113
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:03,560
I have a, uh, I don't believe anything
that comes out of their mouths.

1114
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,320
I don't believe that at all. I
think they've, they've got a long,

1115
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:10,850
long track record of, of lying about
a variety of things. And so, you know,

1116
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:13,640
why would they come out
with this? Um, you know,

1117
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:17,120
perhaps they're cracking down and
it, it doesn't hurt to come out.

1118
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:20,890
And if you're going after some of these
individuals anyway, why not put them,

1119
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,710
put the paintbrush on them that they're
working for the CIA and that will

1120
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:28,820
appease some of the population
there. Um, so, I dunno, I'm, again,

1121
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:30,290
I'm not buying it. Um,

1122
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,090
it has been a difficult intel task
and collecting intelligence on,

1123
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:37,430
on their efforts with, uh,
with their ballistic missiles,

1124
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:41,270
their nuke program as well, uh, has
always been as always been problematic.

1125
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,841
But again,

1126
01:01:41,841 --> 01:01:45,230
they've done this before where they've
talked about how we've wrapped up a CIA

1127
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:49,940
spying network and it's, it's kind of
horse shit. It has their propaganda.

1128
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:53,470
I though, well, yeah, I mean,
you know, uh, yeah, I that,

1129
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,670
that would be my take on it. I
don't know what I mean, I'm not,

1130
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,780
I'm not internal. I'm not inside. And
so, you know, is it possible? Sure.

1131
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:03,650
We've had, uh, we've had networks wrapped
up before by other countries, Cuba,

1132
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,860
the Cuban Intel service years ago. Right.

1133
01:02:06,861 --> 01:02:10,010
Which was completely built by the
Russians, by the way, by the old KGB.

1134
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:14,420
They owned and operated the Cuban Intel
service for a long time. Still do.

1135
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,060
Um, they at one point wrapped up
pretty much everybody we had on. Right.

1136
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:25,700
Um, and, and elsewhere people did. We
have over there, um, I have three. Uh, no,

1137
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,860
we, we had, uh, you know, I don't, I
don't remember the numbers, but it was,

1138
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,990
it was a few. Yeah, let's just say it
was, it was, it was not good. And they,

1139
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,470
they, they had done a
very good, it was from a,

1140
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:38,010
from a counterintelligence perspective,
it was a pretty impressive effort.

1141
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:41,100
So it's happened, uh,
Russia's, you know, uh,

1142
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,920
done the same when we've
usually, when with Russia,

1143
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:47,460
usually when we've got a trade or a mole,
you know, somebody like Robert Hanson,

1144
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:52,710
um, uh, Jim Nicholson and Lee
Howard, the Americans. Oh yeah.

1145
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,270
From what I understand, it's a good show.

1146
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:57,360
And it was a show based on the idea
that at one point in time there was a

1147
01:02:57,361 --> 01:03:02,010
Russian family that had come over here
and infiltrated and became American

1148
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:05,430
citizens and seem like, you know,
Joe and Mary next door. Right.

1149
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:08,570
But really they were Russian spies. You
don't had an aunt and uncle named Joan.

1150
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,750
Mary. It's weird that you would say that.

1151
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:13,350
I literally had an uncle named Joe and
Mary Gunselman tell, telling you, buddy,

1152
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:19,020
I'm trying to look at it and
it's time to go. Um, yeah, I,

1153
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,730
uh, there was, you know, there was a
story, the reason that the Americans was,

1154
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,730
was created was written as do a lot of
things do based on some smart writer who

1155
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:30,840
sees an opportunity because he reads
a newspaper, um, years back, uh,

1156
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,980
2011, I think it was, we had a, uh,

1157
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,050
a sleeper herself that
we wrapped up in Jersey.

1158
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,540
I remember there was there
just takes place. Right.

1159
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:43,020
And there was that one that the hot one
remember? Um, oh, that's right. Yeah,

1160
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,920
the hot, broad, the hot bang
and everybody got operation.

1161
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,250
And so bring them over and then you
look at anything they had hat. Well,

1162
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,400
I mean we could, I think she's a,
I forgetting what her name was.

1163
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:58,250
A fat Danna soccer on your lawn
and she walks over store. Yeah.

1164
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,700
Got High heels on. Yeah. She looks
literally nothing. But that's all.

1165
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,600
Not so much. There's
something about her took a,

1166
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:10,270
I know that there's some better knows.
Do you integration ever knows. Yeah, no,

1167
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,120
she's hot. You don't think that
lady looks hot? Not there. No.

1168
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:18,870
That's not a good picture. So you can
picture mugshot one, any makeup now.

1169
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,330
That's true. That's all her up. Yeah.

1170
01:04:21,331 --> 01:04:24,420
Put a little tighter up p and
g blue eye line around her.

1171
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:27,570
She'd be a chick catches you with a
couple of Jack Daniels and you've got

1172
01:04:27,571 --> 01:04:29,700
trouble. Okay. She walks across
when you're mowing the lawn.

1173
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:34,050
So she and a bunch of other people
lived in Jersey, in the suburbs.

1174
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:39,060
And their whole reason for being with
just a spot people, right? It was,

1175
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:42,030
it wasn't, they were not, you know,
these were not the heads of the,

1176
01:04:42,031 --> 01:04:45,750
of the organization. Right. So their
job is spot. People live there,

1177
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,440
be social meet people
that might be of interest.

1178
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:52,620
Maybe it turns out that somebody in
the PTA where your kids go to school,

1179
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:55,650
maybe somebody who's working for Raytheon
or they're working for some, you know,

1180
01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:57,930
interesting company. That's what
they do. So that's their job.

1181
01:04:57,931 --> 01:04:59,370
Their job was basically to spot.

1182
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:03,880
And then you've got other people
in that chain of, of events, uh,

1183
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:06,480
who are a little bit higher up the
food chain who then assess, right.

1184
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:09,840
And we'll look at that person and go,
yeah, there's maybe there's something,

1185
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:12,850
there is person works for whatever
company and you know, that'd be it.

1186
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,820
It could be, it doesn't matter what the
company is, by the way. It could be.

1187
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,250
Qualcomm could be, you know, think
of one, cause the application

1188
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,330
could be, Corning could be any.

1189
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,040
And there's all sorts of
companies out there that,

1190
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:24,610
that have applications that may be of
interest from an Intel perspective for a

1191
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:26,680
hostile state. So then, you know,

1192
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,860
they'd do a little assessment and maybe
they come away and go, yeah, yeah,

1193
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:33,010
that person's interesting.
Jobless developed a little
relationship there. Now,

1194
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,220
maybe one of those individuals will work
on that relationship and maybe somebody

1195
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:40,700
else will come in, you know, within
this, uh, there's this group, um,

1196
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,990
and they'll develop a
relationship and then, you know,

1197
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,280
maybe they'll task the person.

1198
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:49,900
So maybe say the guy works at
a tech company and you know,

1199
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:52,600
you're going to think, okay, I want to
see if this person has any weaknesses.

1200
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:57,580
You know, how can I leverage anything
here? And so what you'll say is a,

1201
01:05:57,581 --> 01:06:01,510
you know, a how I kid, you know, I was
doing this school paper and it's on,

1202
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:05,380
you know, something and Ah,
okay, I can't, you know, I, they,

1203
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:08,470
they just not getting it or they're not
doing the research or whatever. Hey,

1204
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,350
do you have anything? You know, and
you're not asking for anything classified,

1205
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:14,200
you're just saying, look, you, you
work in a tech company, you know,

1206
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:16,540
don't you have something that
would be of interest? You know,

1207
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:18,190
my kids gotta write the stupid paper and,

1208
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,100
and you're not looking for
anything of, of Intel value.

1209
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:24,010
You're looking to see whether
they'll accommodate you, right.

1210
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:26,470
Will they actually come back and
go, yeah, well you know what,

1211
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:28,570
we got this and it's Kinda
interesting and it's just, you know,

1212
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:31,210
research paper that's, you know, been
out in the press for a long time.

1213
01:06:31,211 --> 01:06:33,820
But yeah, it's interesting. Hey, you
know, hands it over and well now you,

1214
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:36,820
maybe you got something right now you've
got something that you can see that

1215
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,180
they're responded to a
little task and then you'd,

1216
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,880
so you set the hook a little bit and
then you just keep on working on that.

1217
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,910
So in the meantime, they're
calling back to the KGB and saying,

1218
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:49,600
we have guys who work at Raytheon,
right, knows information just,

1219
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:52,270
and they say it just like
that, with that very accent.

1220
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:56,110
They keep jobs and everything. So they
work, they go to work, go to work.

1221
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:59,740
Maybe they don't, maybe their spouse,
you know, I'm a stay at home spouse,

1222
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:00,311
but what do they do?

1223
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:03,290
They hang out with other state owned
spouses and create friendships because of

1224
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,270
kids. And the next thing you know,

1225
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,240
you all haven't dinners with
each other and you know, you,

1226
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:09,460
if you like that rush and broad,
she's banging everybody, right? No,

1227
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:10,001
you wouldn't do that.

1228
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:12,300
That would be a very disruptive
thing to do in that community. Right.

1229
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,960
And so the premise of the Americans and
seem to show, but I watched on banks,

1230
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:17,794
people I watched,

1231
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:24,100
I watched about half an hour of the
first episode and then I'd get angry. No,

1232
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,710
I just sit there and I go, I'm a very
hard person to watch shows like that with.

1233
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:29,530
And so, so my wife was like,
I just, I know you can't,

1234
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,530
you can't sit here cause it's like
Intel and I'm going like [inaudible].

1235
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:35,320
But it was, I, you know,

1236
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:38,380
for to understand it was a good show
with a show where people play pool.

1237
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,670
No people really play pool.
I'm like fuck yeah. Yeah I was,

1238
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,090
I was just in the UK and
boy, I'll tell you what,

1239
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,990
I turned on the TV and there's a snooker
match on. Yeah, I'm in there sneaker,

1240
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:53,190
I'm in there, right. I'll just sit and
sit and watch snooker tunes in there.

1241
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:54,580
Oh my God. But it's also,

1242
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:58,090
it's one of those things where either
you can sit and watch it or you like golf

1243
01:07:58,091 --> 01:07:59,140
or you can't. And I just haven't,

1244
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,440
for some reason I've got some defect that
allows me to sit and watch a billiard

1245
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:07,340
match. Have you ever played? It's
tough. It's hard. Yeah. Yeah. I, I,

1246
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:11,960
we have a pool table at home. The boys
have become pretty damn good at, uh,

1247
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,160
which is a skill of life skill.
Uh, but yeah. Billiards. Is

1248
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:20,050
it, is it [inaudible] is a different
new crews way harder. Yeah.

1249
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,490
It's way harder. They, they
excel in American pool.

1250
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:26,610
I don't think any American player has
ever gone over there and excelled and

1251
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,050
sneaker. I don't, I don't
believe so. Yeah. Yeah.

1252
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,840
That'd be something for
you guys have tried,

1253
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,840
but I don't think anybody's succeeded.

1254
01:08:35,841 --> 01:08:40,160
But there's been a ton of
guys from England that have
come over here and they do

1255
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:43,720
very well on the American pool tour.
But you know what we do better on is,

1256
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,630
is bowling. We do, we kicked the shit
out of them when it comes to bowling.

1257
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,840
Yeah, but that's an American thing.
Well, yeah. There you go. Did they bowl,

1258
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:53,930
come over here and bowl? I don't think
so. I don't know. I don't think so.

1259
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:56,290
I don't think I'm advanced, but
it's been that migration this way.

1260
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,950
Equally stupid sport. Yeah.

1261
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:02,300
And they get really mad when I say
I've got all these texts. You Fuck No,

1262
01:09:02,301 --> 01:09:06,350
I'm not rolling a ball at these things
and you have to pick them back up again.

1263
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,600
Have you ever bowled sober? I don't
think I've ever bowled. So, yeah,

1264
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:10,430
both my kids always sober.

1265
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:14,480
My kids love bowling and they put up the
little bumper thing so it doesn't go in

1266
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:15,590
the gutter. So you cheating,

1267
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,730
so you can just basically
whip that fucking thing down
there a hundred miles an

1268
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:24,670
hour. That's what I do. My thrill
is to hear the [inaudible] ball.

1269
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:28,560
Yeah. If it's up for that, what's
up for me? I'm going to sit up.

1270
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,760
I give them an edge. No, you
know, don't even let them,

1271
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,730
would you let your kids on the floor,
do you let your kids win and things?

1272
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,380
All the time. Yeah, all the time.

1273
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,680
But I did get a hamstring injury because
I didn't let my kid beat me in a race.

1274
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,150
I will. She's 11. Okay. I
was rough. I was running.

1275
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:46,490
I knew something was going on.
I'm like, who cares? Push through.

1276
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,620
She's not winning my fucking
hamstrings hurt my middle boy.

1277
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:55,410
A sluggo plays basketball. That's
all he wants to do day and night. Uh,

1278
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,550
and he's, he's a bit like a, the sorta
like the rain man of basketball too.

1279
01:09:58,551 --> 01:10:00,440
So in terms of facts, figures,
characters, and you know,

1280
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,290
he can go back to Jerry West and, and,

1281
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,550
and he'll tell you about bill
Russell's career and I think,

1282
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:07,560
but he loves basketball and he want to
play professionally. Yes, he does. Yeah.

1283
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:11,960
So I'll tell you, uh, you know,
it doesn't look like it, but in a,

1284
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:16,070
in a deep fake video, I look about six
foot 10, but what are you like six, six,

1285
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:19,970
one that's quite six one. Yeah. Get
that kid on growth hormones. Yeah.

1286
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:24,530
Well he already left. Yes. Stretch
them out and put it in his burgers,

1287
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:27,080
hanging up by his ankles.
But he, that's all he does.

1288
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:30,260
He plays and he just constantly, and
he just, all he wants to do is play.

1289
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:33,290
And so he's got to the point where,
you know, for a long time I would just,

1290
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:36,950
we'd go out, we got to court at home
and I, I'd, I'd play and, and uh,

1291
01:10:36,951 --> 01:10:38,860
I kinda let him, you know, as I say,

1292
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,570
and then it gets to the point
where I can't really beat him.

1293
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:46,520
I've got hide on him. Right. But
his handles are extremely good now.

1294
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:49,340
And so, and I'm not the fastest
kid on the block anymore.

1295
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,600
And so it's gotten to the point now where
he's legitimately beat me a handful of

1296
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:57,650
times and it's very embarrassing because
he doesn't really have an edit button,

1297
01:10:57,770 --> 01:11:01,670
so he, he just rubs that shit out.
Right. And it's like, it's like a,

1298
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:05,150
it's like the lion king when scar wants
to take over. Right. And he's just like,

1299
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,150
oh, that was pretty good, wasn't
it? The lion king reference.

1300
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,950
It's a good reference, eh. So anyway,
yeah, to let them do that though.

1301
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:13,200
It's an exercise for you and
patients. So when he's talking shit,

1302
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,410
that's how I look at it. And my kids
talk shit. If they beat me, I just go,

1303
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:19,800
okay, go ahead and talk to them.
Shit. And that's like, you can't,

1304
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,050
can't let it be personal. No, no.

1305
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,560
You had to treat it like almost
like an Internet heckler. Well,

1306
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,220
kids are allowed to hit
me full blast. So my,

1307
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,940
my kids take martial arts and I
let them, well not the oldest one,

1308
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:35,460
the oldest one's 22. She'll fuck me
up. Yeah. But the, uh, the young ones,

1309
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:37,470
I let them tee off on me. They, they,

1310
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,150
they're allowed to full blast leg kicked
me. They can hurt me, they'll hurt you.

1311
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:46,320
But I want them to be able to feel what
it feels like to actually hit a person.

1312
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,540
Cause when you're sparring
in martial arts class,

1313
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:51,510
you're not allowed to like hit people
full blast. You just kinda touch them,

1314
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:52,570
you know?

1315
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:57,360
And so I let them just fucking slam shins
into my thighs and I teach them how to

1316
01:11:57,361 --> 01:12:02,340
turn it over and dig the, really dig that
bone into the sauce bar. That's good.

1317
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,240
That's, that's actually really good
fucking hurt sometimes though. But uh,

1318
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,440
it's good when we had the same problem
with my, with my boys, because they have,

1319
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:13,500
they're fairly competitive in there.
They're aggressive and, you know,

1320
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:15,060
I keep telling them, I said, look,

1321
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:19,230
getting punched in the face isn't good
and you know, until you actually do well,

1322
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:23,100
you know, they've gotten into some, into
some, uh, I was going to say 50 cups.

1323
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:24,960
Uh, I don't know if you could
say that. [inaudible] okay.

1324
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,640
You're allowed to say fisticuffs
I guess 50 coaches are dying.

1325
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,570
We're continuing to talk over there and
he's, uh, has a hard time with water,

1326
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,310
but it's hard to teach
your kids, you know, uh,

1327
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,210
what that's like. Right. And you know,
at some point, you know, maybe they,

1328
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:46,020
they, uh, they go through that. They're
the youngest one, uh, broke his nose,

1329
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,770
a courtesy of the older, the oldest one.
So mugs, he got his nose broke in a,

1330
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:54,510
in a contest with, uh, with the older
one, the oldest one scooter and uh,

1331
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,000
and he found out that's no
fun. The thing is though,

1332
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,770
that kid's going to be
the tough one. Yeah.

1333
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,940
The kid that it's always the youngest
ones like you see in the UFC when there's

1334
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:04,350
older brothers and younger brothers,

1335
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:08,070
the older brothers genuine generally
pick on the younger brothers and the

1336
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:09,660
younger brothers, once
they reach adulthood,

1337
01:13:09,661 --> 01:13:13,650
almost always can fuck up the older
brothers. Yeah. It's really weird. Yeah.

1338
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:14,161
Yeah. I was,

1339
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:18,030
I took a lot of beatings
when I was younger cause I'm
the youngest of four boys

1340
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:23,010
and so, um, yeah, but it's,
yeah, it's good. It's good stuff.

1341
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,670
And Oh my God, it's, there's this, it's
constant and attainment. All right.

1342
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:29,160
I mean, you know what it's like, you
know, with kids there's always something,

1343
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,930
and I'm sure right now
people are going, oh my God,

1344
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:33,270
he's gonna start talking about
his kids again at length and they,

1345
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:36,720
I'm not going to do that cause the kids
names are so cartoonish. Yeah, I know.

1346
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:40,020
Well that's part of the reason why they
get mad. Yeah. As they are. But, uh,

1347
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,820
anyways, so, uh, we talked about
oceans. Yeah. Okay. Like I like,

1348
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,370
I'm like Uncle Joe here.
I've, I've cut out some,

1349
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:52,210
some shit to talk about deep fakes.
We talked about that. Okay. Okay. Uh,

1350
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:55,670
I wrote down some notes to my
God. I was prepared for it.

1351
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:58,320
I've never been prepared for
your show before. And, you know,

1352
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:00,900
why did you decide to get prepared
this time? You know, why? Because,

1353
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:06,470
because you've got, you've got
some really, uh, great, uh, uh,

1354
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,680
guests, uh, well, no, not really,
but viewers and listeners, I mean,

1355
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:12,040
I was to think the people that

1356
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,140
follow this show, um,

1357
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,910
I find to be a really fascinating,
I get a lot of of, uh,

1358
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:22,840
feedback and I feel
like, you know, I, yeah,

1359
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:24,250
I should pay attention than I should.

1360
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:29,251
I should prepare a little bit
because there's a lot of interest,

1361
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:32,380
right. And some of these things
that we talk about and you know,

1362
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:35,410
so while sometimes I go out
and I wing it, you know,

1363
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:39,100
and to be fair on new segments,
I just make shit up now. I don't,

1364
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,970
I don't do that. Uh, I
know you want to talk

1365
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:44,150
about Huawei. Well, I'll Huawei,

1366
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,340
which I think is a really
fascinating subject to me. Um,

1367
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:52,430
and a lot of people that are tech inclined
because they are at the tip of the

1368
01:14:52,741 --> 01:14:56,160
spear when it comes to technological
innovation in the cell phone space.

1369
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:58,350
And I know that they're
doing that with, in,

1370
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:01,050
in regards to modems and a
bunch of other things as well,

1371
01:15:01,051 --> 01:15:02,460
but it appears at least,

1372
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,900
and a lot of companies are exclusively
using their 5g modems as 5g rolls out.

1373
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:07,620
Oh yeah. Yeah.

1374
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:11,130
But it appears there they are involved
in some serious shenanigans and they have

1375
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:12,690
deep roots with the Chinese government.

1376
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,570
They do, they claim they don't,
they claim, look, we're independent.

1377
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:17,730
We would never do whatever
the Chinese authorities say.

1378
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,930
Think about that sentence.

1379
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:24,230
Think about a company with a global
reach of Huawei of that importance to the

1380
01:15:24,901 --> 01:15:28,620
Chinese state and think about them saying,
trying to say with a straight face,

1381
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,900
we wouldn't, we wouldn't do, you know,

1382
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:35,340
things that the Chinese government
might ask us to do it alone to show real

1383
01:15:35,341 --> 01:15:38,520
Chinese company. And you said that you
meant it, they would shut. Yeah, yeah,

1384
01:15:38,521 --> 01:15:40,140
exactly. Yeah. Like you won't, yeah.

1385
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:43,770
You would not be in business for that
long or there would be a change in the

1386
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,600
senior management of the business.
Um, so, and Huawei's been caught out,

1387
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:51,370
they've been caught out in Europe, uh,

1388
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:57,110
to the degree where at a certain point
you think Germany and others that are

1389
01:15:58,050 --> 01:16:02,400
deeply involved with Huawei now in terms
of the 5g infrastructure where they've

1390
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:03,870
just made this decision, look,

1391
01:16:03,871 --> 01:16:08,610
it's financially better for us to work
with wowway and we can set aside the

1392
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:11,860
security risks. They literally
made that decision that it's

1393
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,050
an article about that very recently,

1394
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:18,160
that they've just decided to
have some sort of a risk, uh,

1395
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,320
to reward conversation. And
the, the, the risk is worth

1396
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,810
a reward. Right. Right.
And so, you know, that's,

1397
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,460
that's their calculation
from a US perspective because
we are, you know, look,

1398
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:33,170
there's, there's two essentially two
superpowers now, right? I mean, China's,

1399
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:36,360
you know, um, advancing and, and, uh,

1400
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,450
we're not the lone superpower
on the stage anymore.

1401
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:43,740
And so we are the number one
target. Um, and you know,

1402
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:45,480
our calculation has to be different.

1403
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,540
So we've been going at it and I
know everybody, I think it's been,

1404
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,030
it's been pretty well covered. It
didn't used to be covered very well,

1405
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,340
but it's been pretty well covered
over the past couple of months.

1406
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,900
And now what's happening is we've been
in these trade negotiations with China

1407
01:16:57,901 --> 01:17:01,800
and I think, unfortunately, I
think the current administration,

1408
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:04,260
the Trump administration
is going to blink.

1409
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:08,880
And I think that because Huawei is such
a huge issue for the Chinese and the,

1410
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,540
that we would prevent, um,

1411
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,600
our companies from selling
into or purchasing from or
dealing with and that we

1412
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,050
were, have sanctions on other
countries that, that do. Um,

1413
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,440
they view that as such a threat to their
own interests and their own future,

1414
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:32,090
um, that Huawei is front and center
with any trade deal. So they're looking,

1415
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:34,760
they're not doing any trade deal
unless we make concessions on Huawei.

1416
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:37,550
And I have a feeling the
Trump administration is going
to make those concessions

1417
01:17:37,551 --> 01:17:38,384
because

1418
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,830
from a political perspective,
they want a trade deal. Right.

1419
01:17:40,831 --> 01:17:45,090
And so far they've actually said to
Google that Google is going to stop using

1420
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,910
the android operating system
for the, for the Chinese phones,

1421
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,840
for walways phones, at least they're
going to not let them license out the,

1422
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:56,870
so Walway has actually been at least
rumored to be in production of their own

1423
01:17:57,301 --> 01:18:00,300
operating system, which would mean
they would have to have their own,

1424
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:03,570
not just operating system, but they,
they'd have to have their own ecosystems.

1425
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,250
So they'd have to have an app
store, they'd have to have all the,

1426
01:18:06,251 --> 01:18:09,630
all the jazz that we have today.
When you, if you sign up for,

1427
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,390
you buy an android phone, you have
access to the Google play market,

1428
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:17,220
which is this huge resource
of applications. And as
soon as you take that away,

1429
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,450
you've got to kind of rebuild that whole
thing from scratch. Right? Right. Well,

1430
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,800
Huawei doesn't lack anything in resources,
you know, there'll be fine, you know,

1431
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:29,250
because the state will provide and
ensure that they have the resources they

1432
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:33,120
need. They also, you know, we're
the outlier here, right? I mean,

1433
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:36,690
we've been working with New Zealand
and Canada and the UK to some degree,

1434
01:18:36,691 --> 01:18:37,680
but the UK has been, you know,

1435
01:18:37,681 --> 01:18:40,050
they've been kind of pushing back a little
bit on this idea that we're going to

1436
01:18:40,051 --> 01:18:40,660
isolate

1437
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:42,240
well, way I, I don't think
that's going to happen.

1438
01:18:42,241 --> 01:18:46,500
And so they're using Walway devices.
Um, the, they, to some degree, yes. Uh,

1439
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:50,670
they've been slower to adopt [inaudible]
and kind of mesh their infrastructure

1440
01:18:50,671 --> 01:18:54,510
with while ways for people
here, for people don't know
what we're talking about.

1441
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,090
Could you please just lay
out what's the concern?

1442
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:00,420
What do they think that
we're always doing? Um,

1443
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:04,400
Huawei is essentially, um,

1444
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,490
what's the, the, the way
to put this would be, uh,

1445
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,070
imagine a communications network
that spans the globe and,

1446
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:18,710
um, Huawei builds and provides, uh,

1447
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,500
gear and certainly going into 5g. Um,

1448
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,730
there are leading provider
and Sir and financially they,

1449
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:29,360
they can offer countries a much better
deals than, than other providers,

1450
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:34,280
but they are a, an intricate
part of that communications web.

1451
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:40,090
So if you imagine that walkway is a state
sponsored entity and will respond to

1452
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:46,550
Chinese authorities requests for
information or intelligence that's passing

1453
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:51,350
through this communications
web around the globe, our, uh,

1454
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:54,890
our business communications,
our military communications, um,

1455
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:58,730
intelligence communications, that that
all kind of go through at some point.

1456
01:19:58,731 --> 01:20:00,650
This interconnected system, uh,

1457
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:05,780
that's the problem because they're
essentially building back doors into that

1458
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:10,781
system that allow them to
suck a communications out
of that network and use it

1459
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:15,570
for their own purposes. It's a
great intelligence tool, right?

1460
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:18,940
So if you think about it in a way,
basically that's a, it's a, uh,

1461
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,080
it's an advancement on the idea that you
are wire tapping somebody or you know,

1462
01:20:24,811 --> 01:20:28,050
you've, you've created ability to
intercept some communications, right?

1463
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,750
They link themselves with
the EU. What happens,

1464
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:33,000
we've got military communications,
right? With the EU,

1465
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:37,590
our military talks to the military and
we've got NATO concerns and everything.

1466
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:38,220
So if,

1467
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:42,660
if there's an element in
that infrastructure that
touches in and has a door that

1468
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:47,010
opens to some walkway gear, right?
Then the danger here is, and they've,

1469
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:50,520
they've had back doors discovered in the
past and then while we put your hands

1470
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:52,800
up and go, oh, well we didn't know
that was there. We'll correct it.

1471
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:55,710
And then it turns out they don't
correct it. And then, you know, oh,

1472
01:20:55,711 --> 01:20:58,650
sorry about that. You know, they, they,
they honestly don't give a shit. They,

1473
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:02,700
I, when I say how aggressive they are
in terms of sucking up information,

1474
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:06,940
I can't overstate it. Right? And so this,

1475
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:10,590
that's why it's a problem for
us is because, you know, if we,

1476
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:15,570
if we convince, uh, Australia
and, and you know, the five eyes,

1477
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:20,310
nations new is [inaudible] and in others
not to work with wowway and then say

1478
01:21:20,311 --> 01:21:23,850
Canada, you know, which is
willing to do a deal. Well,

1479
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:26,310
we've got seamless communications
infrastructure with Canada.

1480
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:30,380
So all of a sudden, the fact that
they're doing business with Weiwei,

1481
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,790
but we're not, we're still at risk.

1482
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:35,700
We're still in jeopardy
because that information is
still flowing to some degree

1483
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:40,560
where it's accessible to, to Huawei and
their ability to get. So I, you know,

1484
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:43,020
again, I know, and I know people
listen to that and they go, ah,

1485
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,210
why is that of any concern? Well,

1486
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:49,340
it's a concern because it used to be in
the old days it was a, a, you know, uh,

1487
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:54,150
it was us in the Russians.
So Union Russia's,

1488
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,580
you know, they got the GDP of
a small EU nation. China is,

1489
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,570
is on the march. They, they, they
view themselves in a certain fashion.

1490
01:22:03,571 --> 01:22:05,250
That's why they're pushing
down the south China Sea.

1491
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:06,570
They've been building up their military.

1492
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,250
They've been doing deals all over the
world, uh, for rare earth minerals to,

1493
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,730
you know, to Labor, dosage,
uh, uh, access to enable ports.

1494
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:15,613
It doesn't matter what it is,

1495
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,750
they've been busy doing that because they
view themselves at the top of the food

1496
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:22,680
chain. Now I guess we
could say, wow, okay fine.

1497
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:26,460
Maybe it's their turn or something,
but I, that's not how I view the world.

1498
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:28,950
Right? I mean, we can either be
on top of it, we can, you know,

1499
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:32,430
be sucking wind and, and
so he goes back to that,

1500
01:22:32,431 --> 01:22:34,920
one of those early questions you asked
is how much did we spend on defense?

1501
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,760
How much do we spend on, on Intel? How
much do we spend on whatever it may be?

1502
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:41,220
And I think the answer is that's
where intelligence comes in.

1503
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:44,040
You have to know what the opposite,
what the hostile nation is doing.

1504
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,860
You have to know what the competitor's
doing. It's just like in business.

1505
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,830
Then you have to spend enough
to stay ahead of that, right?

1506
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:52,780
Even if it's a small amount, you gotta
stay ahead, you gotta and it's it,

1507
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:57,450
it behooves us not to fall behind.
Um, that's never a good thing.

1508
01:22:57,451 --> 01:23:01,800
I know we don't always do things
right, but as a nation, um,

1509
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,770
the world is much better off with us.

1510
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:09,550
I'm sort of at the end of, this is
going to sound wrong to a lot of people,

1511
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,100
they're going to think, oh my God,
that's terrible. But with us at the top,

1512
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,730
we're, we're more altruistic. Uh,

1513
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,200
maybe that is the Ed and that's the word
not, but I think word. Yeah. So anyway,

1514
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:22,800
so I, that's, that's my
view. A lot of people say

1515
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:26,750
bullshit, but you know, everyone's got
different experiences, you know. Well,

1516
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:31,760
is there a way to detect,
like when they released,

1517
01:23:31,761 --> 01:23:35,510
say if they release a Walway
phone and which is a really rich,

1518
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,310
really interesting that
just a few years ago,

1519
01:23:37,311 --> 01:23:40,340
Walway was not even a major player
by any stretch of the imagination.

1520
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,940
Now it's the number two cell
phone provider in the world,

1521
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,740
a past apple,

1522
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,630
which is incredible when you consider
the fact that they barely have a foothold

1523
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,600
in the American market.

1524
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:54,050
They very few people buy their phones
and if they do buy their phones,

1525
01:23:54,051 --> 01:23:58,370
they buy unlocked phones from overseas.
Yeah. It's really kind of crazy. Um,

1526
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,930
but is there a way where they could detect
whether or not there is a backdoor in

1527
01:24:02,931 --> 01:24:03,870
these phones? I mean,

1528
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:08,000
or is it something where they could
develop it to the point where you really

1529
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:08,900
would have no idea?

1530
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:12,070
Um, no, we can, we, we stay pretty well,

1531
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:18,790
you know, that your, your, yeah, it's a
good, it, it's a good question. But I,

1532
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:20,300
I would say that, uh,

1533
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:24,300
as long as we continue what
we're doing in terms of, uh,

1534
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,840
counterintelligence and, and,
uh, tech advances and efforts in,

1535
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:33,700
in cyberspace and elsewhere and certainly
in communications hardware to stay

1536
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:37,510
ahead of potential hostile activity.
I think we're, we're OK. We, we, we,

1537
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:42,040
we're good at detecting problems. We're
good at identifying weaknesses in,

1538
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:45,880
in the systems. Um, the problem is, again,

1539
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:50,380
it's a global community. We can't isolate
ourselves in terms of communications.

1540
01:24:50,381 --> 01:24:52,810
Infrastructure just
doesn't work. So you know,

1541
01:24:52,811 --> 01:24:56,740
it's like a chain and a
weak link. Okay. Yeah.

1542
01:24:56,741 --> 01:25:00,200
See I gave that analogy. Yeah, good.
Yeah. Thank you. I am [inaudible]

1543
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:01,550
you are the weakest link.

1544
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:08,020
So yeah, it's, I mean, anyway, but that's
Huawei and I, and I do think that it's

1545
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,550
the interesting part will be what does
the administration do in their desire to

1546
01:25:12,551 --> 01:25:13,900
get a trade deal?

1547
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:16,990
Are they willing to blink on this
because they put their foot down, right?

1548
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,290
And now because we're so dysfunctional
here in the states from a political

1549
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,070
perspective,

1550
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:23,980
now you've got people like Chuck
Schumer going, well you know,

1551
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,790
Trump better not blink
on this. This is boy.

1552
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:29,980
So suddenly Chuck Schumer is a hawk on
his heart are protecting us from, from,

1553
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:32,830
you know, Chinese espionage. Right?
And, but simply because, you know,

1554
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:35,130
he sees it as a political
opening here. You know, if,

1555
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:38,680
if Trump backtracks on Huawei now, hey,
good, from the democratic perspective,

1556
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:41,590
they can use that to bang on
him, you know? And so it's all,

1557
01:25:41,591 --> 01:25:43,860
it all comes down to politics. But,

1558
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:48,010
but this is something that people didn't
even understand was an issue like good

1559
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:48,940
nationally.

1560
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:51,700
This is something that no one was
even aware of until a few months ago.

1561
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:53,410
And when I started reading about it,

1562
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,810
one of the first things that I
was reading about was, you know,

1563
01:25:55,811 --> 01:26:00,310
I'm kind of a technology nerd and so I
was fascinated by some of their newest

1564
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:04,070
phones, which were really
far advanced to what you're

1565
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,780
getting offered in the United
States. Yeah. And a lot of that, uh,

1566
01:26:08,781 --> 01:26:12,830
ability to, to create in record time, um,

1567
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:17,630
comes from [inaudible] property.
Yeah. And that's how they,

1568
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,100
over the years, again, that was a,

1569
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:21,920
that was a collective decision by
the authorities there that just,

1570
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:24,520
this is how we're going to
advance. Right. And we, we,

1571
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:27,920
they looked and they make a calculation
that says we can't afford to wait

1572
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,770
decades while we do our own research
and development, you know, well, let's,

1573
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:32,960
let's just take it.

1574
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:37,380
And Weiwei is not the only
Chinese phone manufacturer.

1575
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:39,500
There's quite a few
different ones over there,

1576
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:42,440
but they're the only one that seems
to be band. What's that other one?

1577
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:45,050
Zomy where there's, there's
quite a few there are,

1578
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:47,960
but Huawei has been because of their size,

1579
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,720
their in their connection
to the government. Um,

1580
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:54,380
and because of the resources that
the government's been willing to, um,

1581
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:58,280
to provide to them the
advantage that they have, um,

1582
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:02,660
and the speed with which they were able
to kind of embed themselves into other

1583
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:06,380
nations, a telecommunications
infrastructure. That's
why they're so important.

1584
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:10,010
Right. But the general, yeah. You know,
are there other companies we, well,

1585
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:10,610
of course, yeah.

1586
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:13,040
I mean there's a variety of companies
we should be worried about from that

1587
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:14,540
perspective. And it's
not like that'd be fair.

1588
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,810
I spent some time on China
because it's just, you know,

1589
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,060
they're the number one state, you know,

1590
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,310
sponsored perpetrator of theft of
intellectual property. But you know,

1591
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:25,460
there's just other countries involved
in it. So I'll copy entire cities,

1592
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,940
which is really insane. You've seen
that they have a fake Paris over there.

1593
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,340
Yeah. Yeah. I know. Well, you know,

1594
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:34,520
they've got you go some of these places
I went and looked at and in Chinese

1595
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:36,290
history, culture is fantastic. Right?

1596
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:39,890
And I've been over there and times and
I've just like marveled at how, how,

1597
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,580
you know, how interesting the people
are, how friendly they are, how,

1598
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:45,350
I mean they look this, there's a
lot of wonderful things about China,

1599
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:50,090
but I'm just saying the authorities,
right? The government policy of um,

1600
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,180
no rule of law, of, of,

1601
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:54,980
of the no protection when it
comes to intellectual property,

1602
01:27:54,981 --> 01:27:57,980
all these things and their aggressiveness
and stealing information and that's

1603
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:02,420
the problem. Um, but China as a
country is, is a fascinating place. So,

1604
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:05,330
uh, that was, I don't know
why I said that. That's my,

1605
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:10,760
it is a fascinating place. It's
very, very, very, very, very old,

1606
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:14,570
which is something that we don't totally
understand. That was like five varies.

1607
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:20,270
Like when you look at the history of
China, it's really, it's amazing. Yeah.

1608
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,430
It goes back so far. When
you look at this country,

1609
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:23,930
it's a couple of hundred
years and that's it. Oh,

1610
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:25,220
I know that we come across a house,

1611
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,100
it's a hundred years old and someone
slaps a historic thing on there and you

1612
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:30,950
can't stop me, can't do anything to it.
And we've, we've faced that in the past.

1613
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:32,360
When you guys got a house,

1614
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:36,290
it was built in the 20s and they
have a historic thing then 19,

1615
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:39,980
27 it'll be soon. It'll be
the architecture of the 60s
that we want to protect.

1616
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:43,550
Yeah. Probably plastic over couches.
Remember that? Oh, that was,

1617
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,960
that was a good thing. Right. You know,

1618
01:28:44,961 --> 01:28:46,520
and nobody wanted to sit
on those in the summer,

1619
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:49,970
but what do you think is going to
happen when you really think that the

1620
01:28:49,971 --> 01:28:54,650
government's going to cave and they're
going to give into a I think so because I

1621
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:58,730
think they really, they, they definitely
want a trade deal in some capacity.

1622
01:28:58,731 --> 01:29:01,770
And China's not going to
blink on this, right. They'll,

1623
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,180
they'll figure out how to,

1624
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,950
how to kind of bear the burden of the
tariffs and make things work on that,

1625
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,170
you know, for them to screen. Much
gets built over the too. I mean,

1626
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,600
all the apple stuff's
getting built over there now.

1627
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,100
And there was just a recent story, uh,

1628
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,110
where Tim Cook was trying to get Trump
to back down off of some tariffs because

1629
01:29:19,111 --> 01:29:19,880
you know,

1630
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,950
we're going to have a 25% tariff on some
apple products that they're building in

1631
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:27,360
China. Yeah. Yeah. And it's the idea that,
look, it's not the idea that you can,

1632
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:32,210
yeah. Rob Huawei Revenue Jumps
23% despite us crackdown. Yeah.

1633
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:37,470
Because look over at C's, their phones
are gigantic. They figured out, you know,

1634
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:42,630
Samsung made a huge, disastrous
mistake with their galaxy fold.

1635
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,090
I don't know if you know,
but the foldable phone, well,

1636
01:29:45,091 --> 01:29:48,960
they have a mate x that apparently
is way better than the galaxy fold.

1637
01:29:48,961 --> 01:29:52,140
It's a better design and
it's viable works. Yeah.

1638
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:55,760
Samsung's an incredible company and
it's, it's got an amazing history of,

1639
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:58,620
of innovation and technology, but, but
you're right, they have had a couple of,

1640
01:29:58,621 --> 01:29:59,700
they've had a couple of missteps.

1641
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:02,880
A fold wasn't the only one that they
had a misstep on. Seven, the blow up.

1642
01:30:02,881 --> 01:30:05,460
Right. That's a problem, right? When
you get on the phone that explodes.

1643
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,160
That's not necessarily what you
want in a communications device.

1644
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:13,500
What are you pointing out? The y
way made x is not as good as I said.

1645
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:17,990
It says design changed just a few
weeks before the release. Well,

1646
01:30:17,991 --> 01:30:22,440
what's wrong even come out yet. It just
does not change the, I don't know. Yeah,

1647
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:26,010
but it doesn't mean it's not better.
Why you saying it means it's not better?

1648
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:27,990
The people that have tried
it, if you said it's better,

1649
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:29,280
it's just saying it's last minute.

1650
01:30:29,281 --> 01:30:32,100
Tweaks have been made to the devices
ahead of the anticipated release in

1651
01:30:32,101 --> 01:30:35,340
September as an additional sensor appears
had been added to the phone's camera

1652
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:37,470
module. That's to find out
where you live. Exactly.

1653
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,810
I mean that doesn't mean it's
not better, Jamie. I thought yet.

1654
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:44,910
So how would anybody know the
people that have reviewed it?

1655
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:47,950
There's people that are reviewed
it. All the tech sites I've written,

1656
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,410
they just changed it. You
just don't like, yeah.

1657
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,870
Well they just tweet the sensor.
You just talking shit over there,

1658
01:30:51,871 --> 01:30:56,350
but he wants to go back to coffin on
water. Are you anti hawala? No, no.

1659
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:03,210
They did use the Lichen name to like I
little, I licensed it for their camera.

1660
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:05,850
I don't think that they're using
like, like a cameras and other Nara.

1661
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:09,660
It's like a, I've used it, I use
it at ces like three years ago.

1662
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,230
I thought they used liker cameras
for the pro or whatever it is.

1663
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,410
They use the name, but I don't
believe that it's, it's not,

1664
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:20,210
I mean it might be a like a sensor, but
it's like a very, it's a micro chip.

1665
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:24,210
It's compared to the one I have in
this camera that's very expensive.

1666
01:31:24,211 --> 01:31:26,070
It's not definitely it's
been at all the camera,

1667
01:31:26,071 --> 01:31:30,330
but I mean I think they use Leica
lenses. Right. Or like a something good.

1668
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,630
Can we get to the bottom of
this? When I was there lot,

1669
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:35,250
so I was super interested in it and I
was trying to tell, I was like, what?

1670
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:36,660
What are they using about this name?

1671
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:39,870
There's a photographer I followed
that was promoting it and I was like,

1672
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,000
just seems like they're
using the name is all.

1673
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:44,300
I couldn't tell that it was a
better photo. I couldn't tell.

1674
01:31:44,301 --> 01:31:47,830
You don't even have [inaudible] my age,
but that's all I couldn't tell at all.

1675
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,480
No, they're not. Right. Again,
I'm just saying I couldn't tell,

1676
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:54,810
but as a photographer I couldn't. I
could like all you're using is the name.

1677
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:57,870
This isn't a better photo. It's
not, doesn't have the value.

1678
01:31:57,871 --> 01:31:59,980
With the like what I was
getting have some pretty

1679
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,510
spectacular cameras though. To me,

1680
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:05,230
I mean they had the very best
ever night vision camera,

1681
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,180
not night vision but night sight.

1682
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:12,210
Like the ability to take photographs at
night and it looks like pull up a Huawei

1683
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:19,540
night photograph examples cause Google
Pixel three is the second best one,

1684
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,080
but the last one is
supposedly the Walway one.

1685
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:25,240
Zoom came out a couple months ago and
people were saying that that was bullshit,

1686
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:26,370
which put us out.

1687
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:29,040
It was like I had a super zoom
technology lens that people were at.

1688
01:32:29,041 --> 01:32:32,140
Someone was far as like,
there's no way that that's real.

1689
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:35,740
But who said it's no way that that's
real photographers, photographers,

1690
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:38,180
reviewers, people that are
using this stuff and said,

1691
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:42,000
but they weren't using this though.
Just one thing improved. Okay.

1692
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:46,570
One thing has been proven that Weiwei
has taken some photographs and said they

1693
01:32:46,571 --> 01:32:50,470
were taken out of Weiwei phone and they
were actually taken on a very high end

1694
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:53,060
or something like, yeah,
very high end camera. Oh.

1695
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:58,200
Also Weiwei posted some stuff
on Instagram from iPhones,

1696
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:01,600
caught a couple of times, cut
a couple times doing that,

1697
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:05,800
which is also quite hilarious.
But, um, yeah, it's a,

1698
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:09,520
it's a sneaky business and if, if
that's how they're going to do it,

1699
01:33:09,521 --> 01:33:12,880
they're going to get in through the back
door and get information through phones

1700
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:13,750
and modems and,

1701
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,540
and it may not be, you know, it, it,

1702
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:19,110
it may not be something that they
worry about now in terms of access.

1703
01:33:19,111 --> 01:33:20,730
And when people say, well, why
did they want the access now?

1704
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,530
They just want to know
that they can, I mean,

1705
01:33:22,531 --> 01:33:25,740
imagine a conflict in the future
where they have that ability, right.

1706
01:33:25,741 --> 01:33:29,640
Either to a realtime monitor
communications through
this network that they've

1707
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:33,180
been able to build trapdoors
into, um, you know,

1708
01:33:33,181 --> 01:33:37,830
or to impact the flow of communication
more aggressively, more proactively to,

1709
01:33:37,831 --> 01:33:40,560
to do things. Uh, it's, you
know, it's, it's like, um,

1710
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:43,860
it's like mapping out our
infrastructure, right? Um, the testing,

1711
01:33:43,861 --> 01:33:48,090
the probing that goes on of our, um,
of our electrical grid as an example.

1712
01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:50,860
I mean, that's just planning
for the future in, in,

1713
01:33:50,861 --> 01:33:52,890
in the event that something
bad's going to happen.

1714
01:33:52,891 --> 01:33:56,520
If there's going to be a conflict, you
know, they, they want to know as do we,

1715
01:33:56,521 --> 01:33:58,230
I mean, again, to your
point that, you know,

1716
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,770
hopefully we're doing the
same stuff and, and um,

1717
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:03,390
so yeah,

1718
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,380
it's something else interesting when
you're talking about China though, is,

1719
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:10,050
and you think about, okay,
what should we be watching?

1720
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:14,520
And we touched on Russia a little bit is
the alliance between possible alliance

1721
01:34:14,521 --> 01:34:18,840
between Russia and China. And it's
an interesting dynamic. You know,

1722
01:34:18,841 --> 01:34:21,720
traditionally Russia, China
haven't been together. Um,

1723
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:26,070
they've always been some areas
of concern. Um, you know, um,

1724
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:30,990
uh, distrust. Uh, but if there are signs,

1725
01:34:30,991 --> 01:34:34,740
there are things happening that appear
as if China and Russia have made a

1726
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:37,200
strategic decision to
align themselves closer.

1727
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:41,190
And that would be because they've made
that determination that somehow it's in

1728
01:34:41,191 --> 01:34:43,150
their best interest of, you know,

1729
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,170
and not necessarily that it's going to
be that way for any long period of time,

1730
01:34:46,171 --> 01:34:50,790
but right now in the current
environment, um, you see Russia, um,

1731
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,110
acting as if what they want
is a stronger alliance,

1732
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:58,220
military alliance and political
alliance, economic alliance

1733
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,660
with China. Um, and it's, it's,

1734
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:05,000
it's an interesting dynamic
that we need to be watching,

1735
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:08,500
we need to be aware of. Um, and,
and part of that is, you know,

1736
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:11,710
people again this, this idea that,
you know, there was this Russia, uh,

1737
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:16,040
Trump collusion. And I'm
thinking, okay, well that's good,

1738
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:19,670
except our relations with Russia
have been this bad in a long time.

1739
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:24,910
So maybe it's all a very clever mind
game that they're playing because they're

1740
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:30,640
closely aligned. But I don't think
so. So we've actually, um, um,

1741
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:34,640
laid on more, uh, significant
sanctions on Russia. Uh,

1742
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:39,170
we've attacked them from
an energy perspective in
terms of our ability to, um,

1743
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,180
create our independence,
you know, particularly from,
from, uh, natural gas, um,

1744
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:46,490
that has damaged Russia's abilities.

1745
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,880
So I think there's reasons why they're
gravitating towards China right now.

1746
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:54,310
But this idea that somehow Trump is
super friendly and as a useful idea of

1747
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,640
Putin, it doesn't,

1748
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:59,600
it doesn't play out when you look at
the reality of the relationship, uh,

1749
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,710
between the two countries.

1750
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:06,070
That whole Russian collusion thing is a
very confusing there because on one hand

1751
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:09,980
you have the Democrats who are saying
without doubt there's Russian collusion.

1752
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:15,220
And then the other side you have the
Republicans and say the Mueller report

1753
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:19,310
essentially exonerated Trump from being
a part of any sort of Russian collusion.

1754
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:21,500
I don't think either
one is totally accurate.

1755
01:36:21,501 --> 01:36:26,280
I think there's a lot of like weird
gray. Yeah, well both narratives. I think

1756
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,360
the Democrat narrative
is easier to understand.

1757
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,960
It just makes sense from their
perspective. Right. Why wouldn't,

1758
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:34,850
why wouldn't we push that? Um,

1759
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,540
to this day they're just still
amazed that they, they lost.

1760
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:41,510
And so there must be
some grander reason why,

1761
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,060
because we just clearly we couldn't
lose to this guy. Right. So, and,

1762
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:47,200
and it was also a talking
point, much like, you know,

1763
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:48,980
let's hit everybody
with the racist hammer.

1764
01:36:48,981 --> 01:36:51,440
It's a talking point and it's
worked for them over there.

1765
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,760
The police the first couple of years,

1766
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:58,540
um, on the, on the, on the,
on the Republican side, um,

1767
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:00,040
look, the Russians

1768
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:01,910
knew what they were doing, right?

1769
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:04,370
They were fucking with the election
on several different levels.

1770
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,550
And it wasn't just trolling through
the Internet. It wasn't, you know,

1771
01:37:07,551 --> 01:37:10,850
just placing stories that they could,
it wasn't just trying to foam it,

1772
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,100
you know, a divisiveness and discontent.

1773
01:37:13,101 --> 01:37:16,250
It was also doing these little dangle
things, you know, where they're, you know,

1774
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:18,560
they're looking to see what are they
going to bite and what are they gonna do.

1775
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:18,941
You know what I mean?

1776
01:37:18,941 --> 01:37:22,700
You think about that Christopher Steele
dossier and it was a piece of shit.

1777
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:26,000
I mean, if we saw that in the
commercial side of things, you know,

1778
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,750
I've got a business in global intelligence
and, and, and research and security.

1779
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:34,460
Um, that thing was just, there was
nothing. It was shot full of holes. Right.

1780
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:36,830
And so you think, well, what's
somebody should have asked,

1781
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:41,060
tell me about your sources. You know,
why are your sources talking? What,

1782
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:45,050
what was, you know, you've
got gotta anytime you've
got a piece of intelligence,

1783
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,750
right, you've gotta do a few basic
things, you know, where'd it come from?

1784
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:50,780
Cause you explained to people with the
Steele dossier was all about, yeah,

1785
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:53,390
it was basically just looked, they
were going after opposition research,

1786
01:37:53,391 --> 01:37:57,540
political opposition research, right?
So a Christopher Steele who was a,

1787
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,890
you know, a paid a hired consultant, he
used to be with British intelligence,

1788
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:06,210
not, you know, not a James Bond type.
Um, but you know, a decent enough,

1789
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:08,910
by all accounts, a decent enough guy. Um,

1790
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:13,500
but he entered the world of private
sector information gathering, right?

1791
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:17,970
And I've got a company, that's what we
do all around the world. And, and you,

1792
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,110
um,

1793
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:23,250
you can't relax your standards
just because you're now
in the commercial sector,

1794
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,020
right? When you get a
piece of information,

1795
01:38:25,021 --> 01:38:27,240
you need to test that
piece of information.

1796
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:30,960
And one of the first things you need to
do is understand what's the sourcing for

1797
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:34,800
it and why did, why did they have
access, you know, how credible are they,

1798
01:38:34,801 --> 01:38:36,480
what's their track record
and why, by the way,

1799
01:38:36,481 --> 01:38:39,790
are they providing this information
and how did it eventually, you know,

1800
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:41,370
make its way to this report.

1801
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:44,940
And those are the sort of simple things
that whether you're a a corporation

1802
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,480
that's gathering intelligence about
a market that you may enter with, uh,

1803
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:50,590
you know, an investment, um,

1804
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:54,780
or whether you're still in the business
and you're an intel officer and you're,

1805
01:38:54,781 --> 01:38:58,050
you know, talking to a source that works
in some foreign ministry somewhere,

1806
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,860
you've gotta be able to, you know,
stress test the intelligence and,

1807
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:05,850
and Shit wasn't done. People,
people liked what they saw,

1808
01:39:05,851 --> 01:39:07,810
they saw negative
information about the, the,

1809
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:12,390
the candidate and just run with that
shit. Right. And the more times you,

1810
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:12,661
it's like,

1811
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:15,960
it's like the old WMD reporting that
came out of the early days in Iraq.

1812
01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:16,830
The more you repeat it,

1813
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:19,590
even if it's one source and
that sources is a piece of shit.

1814
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:23,700
And what you repeated, people are going
to buy it. Right? So Russian collusion,

1815
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:26,760
Russian collusion, you just keep repeating
that and that it's going to happen.

1816
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:30,030
At some point it will
happen. But, um, anyway, so,

1817
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:35,520
but it seems like Russia definitely likes
to disrupt our democracy. Absolutely.

1818
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:40,460
And they would still benefit of
that. Well, a part of it is, um, in,

1819
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:44,700
in the old days, it was sort of a struggle
for supremacy in the world, right?

1820
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:49,050
I mean, that was, that's Kinda at its
core. That's what it was. Right. Um,

1821
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:54,140
and their ability to chip away and faith
in democratic institutions was at the

1822
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:59,250
core of a lot of the crap that they
pulled. And it still is. I mean,

1823
01:39:59,251 --> 01:40:02,970
so that's all the, when you're talking
about a propaganda effort, like the, uh,

1824
01:40:02,971 --> 01:40:05,760
the screwing with the last election, um,

1825
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:09,270
what's their goal when the goal isn't
necessarily that, that's where they, they,

1826
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:12,810
you know, do they care whether one
candidate or another wins? Well, maybe,

1827
01:40:12,811 --> 01:40:17,070
maybe they do. Right. But you'd be
hard pressed to argue that, you know,

1828
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,610
they were working against, uh, Hillary
Clinton who had said, you know,

1829
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:23,230
we want to have a reset
and, you know, and,

1830
01:40:23,231 --> 01:40:26,310
and have a new relationship with
Russia and work with them. I mean,

1831
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:28,230
maybe they looked at
Trump and thought, yeah,

1832
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:31,200
that's the guy we want to
work with. But over that,

1833
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:35,670
the more important issue was in just
chipping away at, at, at, at Americans,

1834
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:39,720
belief in democratic institutions
get us all so that we questioned the

1835
01:40:39,721 --> 01:40:41,850
credibility of, of a democracy.

1836
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And that's been the fundamental belief
for propaganda efforts within the old KGB

1837
01:40:48,151 --> 01:40:51,570
and now the FSU. And, and
so it's, it's, you know,

1838
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:55,900
it's as simple as that in a way. Um,
and it worked. I mean, look at this,

1839
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:56,111
you know,

1840
01:40:56,111 --> 01:40:59,380
we spent years now just bitching at
each other and yelling and screaming and

1841
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:03,340
complaining. And we bought into it because
we all, like we talked about before,

1842
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:07,120
we all, you know, we're easily duped and,

1843
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:10,120
and I don't know how you get around that.
I don't know how he walked that back.

1844
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:11,740
Maybe we don't. But, um,

1845
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:15,670
I think it's an informed public that that
helps to battle this. But we haven't,

1846
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:18,740
we lost sight of what was
important here. And that is,

1847
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:23,500
and so I think the public needs, it's
their responsibility. You like this. Yeah.

1848
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:27,220
You like where you live, then you gotta
make an effort to try to keep it right.

1849
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:27,430
And,

1850
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:31,180
and part of that is being an informed
public and understanding what the hostile

1851
01:41:31,181 --> 01:41:33,910
elements may be out there. You
know, without being paranoid,

1852
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:37,450
but just understand why they're doing
things in the way that the world operates.

1853
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,530
You know? And you'll always have
that group of people that, you know,

1854
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:42,760
don't buy into any of that
bullshit and think it's all just,

1855
01:41:42,761 --> 01:41:46,750
we should all be holding
hands. Yeah. That's a, that's,

1856
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:51,790
that's a fun one. That's, that's a
fun narrative. It's a good narrative.

1857
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:53,290
It's a happy narrative. Yeah. Right.

1858
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:57,730
When you've talked to people that have
seen terrible things that take place all

1859
01:41:57,731 --> 01:42:00,130
around the world, that
narrative is hard to swallow.

1860
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,880
When you read about these gang members
that are coming in and growing pot and

1861
01:42:03,881 --> 01:42:08,470
fucking shooting at people and they've
got these high level task force just to

1862
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:12,610
deal with these cartel members that have
grown weed. Right. And this is right.

1863
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,800
And that's just one part of
what they're doing. Right.

1864
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:17,650
That's just tends to human trafficking
and everything else that they get

1865
01:42:17,651 --> 01:42:21,400
involved in extortion to know, which is
probably the scariest shit. Yeah. Yeah.

1866
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:23,600
And that's it. And that's, that's
what you have to worry about if you,

1867
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:26,590
if you have pushed them out of the
market because you legalize everything,

1868
01:42:26,591 --> 01:42:30,130
which, you know, I assume that's kind
of the direction we're going. Um,

1869
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:34,180
then do they fill that gap again from
a revenue perspective with fentanyl or

1870
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:36,370
something else? Whatever
the next to choice is,

1871
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,160
how do you stop the infiltration?

1872
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:42,280
How do you stop the gang members
were coming in here. I mean,

1873
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:46,690
how do you do that other than eliminating
them other than having some sort of a

1874
01:42:46,691 --> 01:42:49,060
tactical devastation? Well,

1875
01:42:49,061 --> 01:42:53,320
that seems like the only operation that
would make any sense in my mind. Yeah.

1876
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:55,780
Well, it's like jihadism, you can't
kill your way out of it, right?

1877
01:42:55,781 --> 01:42:59,260
It doesn't mean you shouldn't make a
good faith effort, but, um, it's, uh,

1878
01:42:59,620 --> 01:43:03,340
for the, for the, for the drug control,
uh, for the narcotics counter narcotics,

1879
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:07,570
um, part of it is what we talked about
also about working with the other

1880
01:43:07,571 --> 01:43:08,560
governments, right?

1881
01:43:08,561 --> 01:43:11,680
We've had some success in doing
that where you work with the Mexican

1882
01:43:11,681 --> 01:43:16,090
authorities, you work with the Colombians
or Allen, Southeast Asia, you know,

1883
01:43:16,091 --> 01:43:20,230
to try to, you know, uh, push on
the back on the heroin trade. Um,

1884
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:24,250
and so you work through them to some
degree, but that's tough, right?

1885
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:27,510
That's corruption. There's so much
corruption and that's, and that's,

1886
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:28,630
that's the problem. And it's,

1887
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:32,290
and it's unsatisfying because you don't
see an immediate return sometimes,

1888
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:36,730
and it's, and it's also, it's, uh,
sometimes seems like it's just a big,

1889
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:40,540
you know, a bottomless pit where
you're tossing money, right?

1890
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:43,360
And effort and resources, but it's
something that has to be done.

1891
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:47,440
Doesn't mean you shouldn't still
do it. Um, but it is, I mean,

1892
01:43:47,441 --> 01:43:49,960
corruption in a place like Mexico, right?

1893
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:52,670
Where the people just don't have any
faith in the institutions, right.

1894
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:58,480
Because they've lived in this system
for so long where all the officials in

1895
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:02,320
their minds anyway are corrupted.
The police are corrupted,

1896
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,010
federal is a corrupt, um, you know,
the, the marines down in Mexico,

1897
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:08,320
probably the most trusted institution. Um,

1898
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:11,600
because they're not viewed in the same
vein. They're not viewed as corrupt,

1899
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:15,740
but only the marines. Well, yeah, pretty
much. I mean, that's a, which it's odd,

1900
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:16,341
but it's a, it's a,

1901
01:44:16,341 --> 01:44:20,810
that's a large organization and they've
been able to kind of stay above the fray

1902
01:44:20,811 --> 01:44:24,800
to some degree, which is interesting.
I have no idea. But it's, um,

1903
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:28,520
it's been the perception and just
for the most part, it's, it's true.

1904
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,160
When you work down there often
enough, you do get that impression,

1905
01:44:31,161 --> 01:44:35,960
but it's how you get rid of that
endemic corruption in that society.

1906
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:40,550
Um, and turn that public
perception around, you know,

1907
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:44,300
because that will impact. But I
mean, look what happened, you know,

1908
01:44:44,301 --> 01:44:47,930
previous administration when they, they
seriously went after cartel members.

1909
01:44:47,931 --> 01:44:50,390
Right? Remember that spree of
violence that, that kicked off.

1910
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:55,190
It was in part because the Mexican
authorities were going after cartels in a

1911
01:44:55,191 --> 01:44:56,420
more serious manner, right.

1912
01:44:56,421 --> 01:44:59,690
They previous to that they were managing
the problem. So they said, okay, look,

1913
01:44:59,691 --> 01:45:02,960
let's manage down the violence everybody
and we'll let you keep doing your

1914
01:45:02,961 --> 01:45:06,380
business. It's going to happen so you
guys do your business, but just, you know,

1915
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:09,330
let's keep sort of public
order, you know, as,

1916
01:45:09,331 --> 01:45:11,900
as something that we want to
demonstrate that we're capable of.

1917
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:15,710
And when you have to, when they went after
the cartels in a more serious manner,

1918
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:20,810
um, that's when that real parse spree
of violence kicked off. And you know,

1919
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:23,510
there was more head room. So these,
you know, these various members were,

1920
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:24,403
you know, they,

1921
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:27,830
they were combating each other and
they were going after the public.

1922
01:45:27,831 --> 01:45:31,220
They understood that they had to, you
know, basically wear down the public,

1923
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:33,890
which is what happened. The public
said after a while they said, fuck it,

1924
01:45:33,891 --> 01:45:36,500
we can't deal with this. The
violence is too much. It's awful.

1925
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:40,820
And so government, you know, eventually
went back to managing the problem.

1926
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:42,110
Drug trade didn't go away.

1927
01:45:42,111 --> 01:45:45,620
Of course when they just went back to
the old waves of doing things so that the

1928
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:49,580
violence is just so intense
that the public eventually
just said, we can't know.

1929
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,880
And, and I think the cartels knew
that they understood that. Right.

1930
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:56,560
And so they were willing
to do it. Um, well, the,

1931
01:45:56,570 --> 01:46:01,010
the most ridiculous aspect was that fat
fast and the furious deal where they

1932
01:46:01,011 --> 01:46:05,030
were literally selling drugs to the
cartels so they could track them.

1933
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:09,770
And those drugs we use to eventually
kill some US officers. Right? Yeah.

1934
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:14,580
I mean it was, yes, I say it
was drugs, drugs, weapons,

1935
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:18,710
drugs. Yeah. Yeah. Conflating things.
Yeah. Those guns that they used,

1936
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:21,500
they did kill officers, right?
Yeah. There was, there was a,

1937
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:25,700
an officer in particular was that was
killed and, and the, the fast and furious,

1938
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:30,200
anytime you talk about
time, you talk about, uh,

1939
01:46:30,201 --> 01:46:34,070
as part of a intelligence
collection effort, right. Um,

1940
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:38,330
or law enforcement effort that you're
going to supply the hostile meant with

1941
01:46:38,331 --> 01:46:42,560
weapons or whatever it may
be. Um, Eh, it's going to go,

1942
01:46:42,561 --> 01:46:44,640
it's probably going to go sideways. Right.

1943
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:48,890
Seems like a great way to cover the
fact that you were selling guns.

1944
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:53,250
I mean, if I was really skeptical, I
would say, well, what are you going to do?

1945
01:46:53,251 --> 01:46:56,160
We're going to sell them guns. How the
fuck are you gonna sell them guns? Well,

1946
01:46:56,161 --> 01:47:00,480
we're going to say that it's an
intelligence gathering thing. Sound guns.

1947
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:03,960
Yeah. We have some really cynical,
which a lot of people aren't.

1948
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:06,660
A lot of people are. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. No, I mean, I think it was,

1949
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:09,370
it was a fucked up operation.
There's no doubt about it. And I,

1950
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,990
I'm not a fan of, you know, it's,

1951
01:47:10,991 --> 01:47:13,320
it's sort of like the same in the
gray arms marketing, you know,

1952
01:47:13,321 --> 01:47:16,680
sort of on a global basis. When you
talk about, you know, like, you know,

1953
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:17,940
because you're getting,
what are you looking to do?

1954
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:20,410
You're looking to create movement,
track, you know, movement of, of,

1955
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:25,380
of gear or money or resources or personnel
the way there's ways you can do that

1956
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:30,330
without creating a potential for a
complete goat rope. And unfortunately,

1957
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:33,450
fast and furious did that
and had to be a goat rope.

1958
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,070
You're giving people the ability to
kill people. You giving them guns. Yeah.

1959
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:39,870
Like why do they have chips on the guns?

1960
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:44,820
Like how they even tracking these goddamn
guns. Yeah. It sources method shit.

1961
01:47:44,821 --> 01:47:49,440
But um, it's, yeah, I
going back to Mexico.

1962
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:53,520
And how do you, you know, how do you
resolve that? Because that impacts, again,

1963
01:47:53,521 --> 01:47:56,970
that impacts us. It impacts our
national security. Right. And so, well,

1964
01:47:56,971 --> 01:48:00,720
they're literally connected to us. We're
so concerned with Afghanistan and Iraq,

1965
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:04,050
they're nowhere near us and we've
got this thing connected to us that's

1966
01:48:04,051 --> 01:48:08,580
literally filling this country
with illegal drugs. They sell Meth,

1967
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:12,540
they sell fentanyl. Dan Afghanistan,
fuck that. Coming up on another election,

1968
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:17,120
presidential election in mid, I
think mid September, you gotta run,

1969
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,450
you're not thinking about it.

1970
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:22,380
I'm thinking about moving the family
over there and thinking of Afghanistan.

1971
01:48:22,381 --> 01:48:27,330
Yeah. I could, me and Boris Johnson
and Trump would get together, but uh,

1972
01:48:27,331 --> 01:48:29,670
yeah, no, they've had an
increase in bombings, you know,

1973
01:48:29,671 --> 01:48:33,990
Taliban stepping it back out or,
and I mean, we don't think about it.

1974
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:36,840
Nobody wants to think about that shit
anymore. You think about how many years,

1975
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:40,890
you know, we've been digging in and it
always comes back to the same thing,

1976
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:44,220
the Taliban, and what do we
think was going to happen?

1977
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,110
They got no place else to go. Right.

1978
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:49,260
And so difficult to track them down
the mountains and they, and they,

1979
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:53,070
they will just wait it out. Right.
And so here they're back again.

1980
01:48:53,071 --> 01:48:54,810
They're increasing bombings.
They want to take, you know,

1981
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:59,760
they want to take over again. And it's
just so you're right in a sense. Um, we,

1982
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:04,050
did we take her off the
ball? Yeah, we did. Yeah.

1983
01:49:04,051 --> 01:49:07,680
And were there other issues that we
should have been more focused on? Yeah,

1984
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:10,260
yeah, sure. But, you know,

1985
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:12,930
then you're conflicted because you think
of all those people that fought and

1986
01:49:12,931 --> 01:49:16,170
died over there and the effort that
other people that came back and you know,

1987
01:49:16,171 --> 01:49:20,130
with, with, you know, horrible wounds
and, and the trauma of all of that. And,

1988
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:24,000
you know, I feel somewhat conflicted
because then you talk about, you know,

1989
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:27,570
I don't, you don't want to, you
don't want to minimize their,

1990
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:33,450
what they did right for the country.
Um, but you also have a, an obligation,

1991
01:49:33,451 --> 01:49:37,080
I think they look at policy and what
did we do and what was the purpose of it

1992
01:49:37,081 --> 01:49:41,250
was the point of that exercise. Um, and
I don't think we still to this day, no,

1993
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,140
right? I mean, what are we
gonna create some pseudo state,

1994
01:49:43,141 --> 01:49:47,950
federal government there that's going to
be a bastion of democracy and it's not

1995
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:48,120
going

1996
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,240
to happen. So anyway,

1997
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:51,400
I don't want it disappeared on
the Afghanistan rabbit hole,

1998
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:54,640
but we'd like to think that we could
turn that into another America.

1999
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,730
That's what we like to think when
we think about nation building,

2000
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:01,690
that we think that we can go in there
and establish democracy and these people

2001
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:04,150
are going to be better and they're gonna
be able to go to school and it's going

2002
01:50:04,151 --> 01:50:05,590
to change the whole environment.

2003
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:08,760
Yeah. Yeah. I guess. And that is true.
And we talked about Iraq that way.

2004
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:10,890
If we just make a rock
a bastion of democracy,

2005
01:50:10,891 --> 01:50:14,710
then maybe it'll help to turn the tide
in the Middle East and suddenly it will

2006
01:50:14,711 --> 01:50:17,580
have more of a respect for individual
liberties and rights and all the rest of

2007
01:50:17,581 --> 01:50:21,090
that and how that worked out. You know,
I, I'm, I'm still looking into it. It's,

2008
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:23,820
um, I'll come back again
and I'll give you my report.

2009
01:50:23,821 --> 01:50:27,720
I think it's going to be
negative. 1 million people
have done. Yeah. It's, yeah.

2010
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:31,000
It's not good. Right? It's, that's
typically never good when you get,

2011
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:35,500
you get to those numbers. A large
number. Yeah. Um, but again, look at it.

2012
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:38,100
I mean, the, the shit that we
don't want to talk about it. Look,

2013
01:50:38,101 --> 01:50:39,880
we don't tell them about Syria, right.

2014
01:50:39,881 --> 01:50:43,380
Nobody wants to talk about Syria
and that and you know, Assad,

2015
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:45,810
you know his butcher, he's still in
charge. Why is he charged with it?

2016
01:50:45,811 --> 01:50:50,090
Because Russia propped him up and want
to Russia proper along with Iran. Right.

2017
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:54,480
As there's a, there's a nasty piece of
work there. And as an access goes, um,

2018
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,360
you know, Russia had no
intention of letting Assad go.

2019
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:00,350
[inaudible] we should have been
able to figure that one out. Right.

2020
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:05,190
But we didn't, in part because we have
these, these, these impulses that say,

2021
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:06,330
well, we're gonna do better.

2022
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:10,170
And because we're gonna create this
ability for people to, you know, uh,

2023
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:15,270
create their own democracy.
So, um, yeah. So anyway,

2024
01:51:15,271 --> 01:51:18,150
we, uh, we, Syria is again,

2025
01:51:18,151 --> 01:51:21,630
one of those places that nobody
really wants to discuss or talk about.

2026
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,970
And we've got, we've got
attention deficit disorder.

2027
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,290
Nobody talks about North Korea anymore.

2028
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:29,010
I remember we were all going to get
blown up by Kim Jong Un. Yeah. Eh,

2029
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:32,110
well, there's pictures of Trump shaking
his hands. So we're, we're buddies now.

2030
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:35,620
Go home. We're all good. All good. I mean,

2031
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:39,550
the last article I read about North Korea
was about how did Kim Jong Un get his

2032
01:51:39,551 --> 01:51:44,490
Mercedes since there's some
sort of a, she's a boycott or a,

2033
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:45,490
you know, embargo.

2034
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:50,230
Yeah. Well, and that's, you know,
that's another part of it is, is uh, um,

2035
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,570
although we have been, we've, we've
been more successful, I will say this,

2036
01:51:53,571 --> 01:51:55,970
we've been more successful
than, than in the past.

2037
01:51:55,971 --> 01:52:00,290
And part of that is a technology issue.
We've gotten better at imposing and,

2038
01:52:01,310 --> 01:52:05,390
um, enforcing sanctions than we used
to be. And part of that is because our,

2039
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:10,100
our abilities to understand a movement
of money, uh, tracking transactions,

2040
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,740
um, is better than it used to be.

2041
01:52:12,741 --> 01:52:17,190
So the sanctions as an example
we put on around, um, this, yeah,

2042
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:22,210
this is the most difficult time that
this regime has faced in Iran since the

2043
01:52:22,311 --> 01:52:23,840
fall of, of the shawl.

2044
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:29,280
And it's because we've gotten
better at looking at, uh,

2045
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,920
Russia, China in particular,

2046
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:33,920
that have traditionally always
kind of circumvented the sanctions.

2047
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:37,190
We're better at enforcing
that and were better at,

2048
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:42,200
at working with the EU and pressuring
them. Right. I mean, so that's,

2049
01:52:42,230 --> 01:52:46,100
that's a good thing. Um, but I don't
know where that's, you know, I mean,

2050
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:49,520
Iran is kind of flailing a bound a little
bit. They seized the tanker, you know,

2051
01:52:49,521 --> 01:52:53,670
British tank or they actually used a
couple, but they're holding onto one. Um,

2052
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:55,040
in response to,

2053
01:52:55,041 --> 01:52:59,750
they were trying to ship a bunch of oil
over to Syria and against sanctions that

2054
01:52:59,751 --> 01:53:00,710
exist. Right. So,

2055
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:03,710
so they had a tanker that was taken
2 million barrels or whatever,

2056
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:06,650
of oil over to Syria. And the British, um,

2057
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:11,640
in the territorial waters of Gibraltar,
uh, intercepted that ship now, uh,

2058
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:15,680
beginning of July and in response, um,

2059
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:17,780
the Iranians have done a
number of things right?

2060
01:53:17,781 --> 01:53:21,200
But the most recent thing that they've
done was they seized a British flag

2061
01:53:21,201 --> 01:53:24,890
tanker and they're still
holding the crew. And, um,

2062
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:29,540
that's sort of an example of their, I
don't wanna say they're desperate, right?

2063
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:32,150
Because they've got an ability,
I think to withstand in a,

2064
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:36,950
their control over the Po population
is so strong, but it's an example,

2065
01:53:36,951 --> 01:53:38,100
I think to some degree of,

2066
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:41,150
of them flailing a bit and trying to
figure out what are they going to do,

2067
01:53:41,151 --> 01:53:44,390
what's their next move. And,
uh, I know people say, well,

2068
01:53:44,391 --> 01:53:46,340
we shouldn't have gotten out of the
deal and we shouldn't, you know,

2069
01:53:46,341 --> 01:53:48,140
we shouldn't have this issue
anyway because we, you know,

2070
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:53,210
it's Trump's fault for getting out
of the deal. Um, but you know, they,

2071
01:53:53,810 --> 01:53:57,230
again, I don't have a lot of
confidence in, in, in them, uh,

2072
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:58,190
sticking to the terms.

2073
01:53:58,191 --> 01:54:00,860
And agreements of any deal because
they've never done in the past and there's

2074
01:54:00,861 --> 01:54:03,670
always been an effort and they've
always broken the agreement.

2075
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:07,400
So I don't know why suddenly they would
change their tune if we can keep the

2076
01:54:07,401 --> 01:54:09,800
sanctions on hard enough
and force them to the table.

2077
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:11,450
The only thing they care
about is staying in power.

2078
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:13,460
If they think they're going
to lose that grip on power,

2079
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,320
they'll come to the table
and then make a better deal.

2080
01:54:15,321 --> 01:54:19,100
And that deal would include us being
able to access their military facilities.

2081
01:54:19,130 --> 01:54:21,200
And for inspections we couldn't,

2082
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:25,340
we had no access to any other military
sites in that country because now we

2083
01:54:25,341 --> 01:54:28,850
didn't make it a condition of the deal.
Right? So we basically said, sure,

2084
01:54:28,851 --> 01:54:32,170
we want verification that you are
following the agreements. And they said,

2085
01:54:32,171 --> 01:54:33,010
well fuck you. This is the,

2086
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:36,400
these are the places that we agreed
to let you look at that. That was the,

2087
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:40,880
I don't want to oversimplify, but that
was the terms of the deal. And so we, we,

2088
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:43,880
any deal that we do with them in the
future needs to be able to say, no,

2089
01:54:43,881 --> 01:54:46,490
we want a hundred percent verification.
Because as John Kerry said,

2090
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:47,830
that's what you want. You
wanna be able to verify.

2091
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:49,280
So when we heard about it,

2092
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:52,490
what we're hearing in the news from the
people that are opposed to the deal is

2093
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:57,491
that Trump broke this deal and he was
foolhardy to do so that Obama had put in

2094
01:54:57,501 --> 01:54:59,960
place this deal and that Trump had broken.

2095
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:03,170
And it sort of leaves us in
this terrible quagmire. Right?

2096
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:07,820
But what you're saying is that the
deal was terrible and that they,

2097
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:11,330
it didn't really give us
access to understand exactly
what their nuclear program

2098
01:55:11,331 --> 01:55:14,480
was with their military program was.
So it wasn't a good deal. It wasn't,

2099
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,780
it wasn't wise to keep keep

2100
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:17,880
it if you're, if you're, um, if,

2101
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,890
if the way that you judge the
of the value of a deal and they,

2102
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:24,510
this is what the previous administration,
the Obama ministration did,

2103
01:55:24,511 --> 01:55:25,920
was to talk about how, you know,

2104
01:55:25,921 --> 01:55:29,670
it's important that we verify and
we've got verification. Well, yeah,

2105
01:55:29,671 --> 01:55:32,790
you've got verification of the sites that
the Iranians agreed to let us look at

2106
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:37,590
that. And so yeah, it was a
deal. Was it a good deal? No,

2107
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:41,310
they wanted this, they wanted to sign
this deal in. The Iranians knew it.

2108
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,560
And so, um, yeah,

2109
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:48,390
I think that that justified saying, no,

2110
01:55:48,391 --> 01:55:51,750
we're going to redraw this. And even
the EU, which has been clinging to the,

2111
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:56,460
the old agreement, even the EU says,
well yeah, we, we could improve it.

2112
01:55:56,670 --> 01:56:00,240
We could make it better, but there's no,
if you just keep things as they were,

2113
01:56:00,241 --> 01:56:02,340
there's no incentive for
the Iranian regime to,

2114
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,390
to make any concessions or improve
it. So the point being is we're going,

2115
01:56:06,391 --> 01:56:09,870
we're trying to force them back to
the negotiating table and again,

2116
01:56:09,871 --> 01:56:14,790
given that their self interest is to
stay in power and remain in charge,

2117
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:19,440
then you know, if with the economy in
the condition that it's in currently,

2118
01:56:19,441 --> 01:56:22,930
if it gets much worse than they feel as
if they're losing a grip on, on, on the,

2119
01:56:22,931 --> 01:56:25,620
the population, then I
suspect they will come there.

2120
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:27,840
They're not going to lash
out, that Iran doesn't want a,

2121
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:30,570
nobody wants a military conflict. We
don't want it. They don't want it, Yada,

2122
01:56:30,571 --> 01:56:34,110
Yada. Can they close the Strait of
Hormuz, you know, where, you know,

2123
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:35,250
depending on who you're talking to,

2124
01:56:35,251 --> 01:56:39,090
a fifth of the world's oil
passes through or, um, yeah,

2125
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:41,250
they could close the temporarily
or cause some friction,

2126
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,410
but they don't have the ability
to shut it down for any,

2127
01:56:43,411 --> 01:56:48,180
any real period of time. Um,
we've just got too much, uh,

2128
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:53,130
in terms of leverage over there and
our assets. And so, yeah, I, you know,

2129
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:56,070
who knows, but I, I, I'm one of
those people that says, you know, we,

2130
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:59,990
we shouldn't have done that deal until
we got it right. And just saying,

2131
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:02,730
we've got to deal for the
sake of it because you had

2132
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:05,760
partial verification doesn't
give you anything. We've,

2133
01:57:05,761 --> 01:57:09,270
we've had partial verification of
their programs for decades. Um,

2134
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:11,220
and they just keep
advancing their program.

2135
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:14,310
So do you think this criticism of backing
out of the deal that you're hearing

2136
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:18,570
from Democrats is basically
just a criticism of Trump
to show an opportunity to,

2137
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:21,900
yeah. Everything's a Curtis, I think
everything is a criticism of Trump.

2138
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:22,800
Is that a problem?

2139
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:28,390
[inaudible] because Trump has such a
polemic figure because he's so many people

2140
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:34,910
just hate him that any opportunity to
have some sort of political talking point

2141
01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:37,590
against him sort of, uh,

2142
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:40,530
confuses what the actual issue is itself.

2143
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:43,260
Yeah. I mean, I think there's
no doubt he's, he, yeah.

2144
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:48,530
I think what happens
is both sides we lose,

2145
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:53,370
uh, in this one because the
Democrats sort of blindly, you know,

2146
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:56,610
accuse him of a, everything's bad,
right? And no matter what he's doing,

2147
01:57:56,611 --> 01:57:59,100
no matter what policy is,
it's all bad, right? And so,

2148
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:02,340
so that's not what you want to be.
And on the Republican side, you know,

2149
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:07,060
you tend to think that that's
the case. And so, you know,

2150
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:09,900
you don't have an honest, um,

2151
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:15,560
intelligent discussion about the policy
landscape. Right? And so you again,

2152
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:18,300
it was sitting in trenches,
throwing hand grenades together.

2153
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:19,610
It's like World War One, right?

2154
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:23,360
And nobody's going to get out and venture
into no man's land in the center and

2155
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:27,750
nobody's living in the center anymore.
So I just think, um, everybody,

2156
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:29,700
it's a disservice to everybody. But yes,

2157
01:58:29,701 --> 01:58:33,210
I think almost things that have come out
of Capitol Hill right now is based on,

2158
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:39,360
um, on, uh, you know, look, here's,
here's an example. My daughter went, um,

2159
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:42,940
she just got out of Grad school and
she's done a number of internships.

2160
01:58:42,941 --> 01:58:45,570
She's worked over in Asia. She's
been in China on, on, on, uh,

2161
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:49,870
internships and she's, you know,
smart kid. I'm subjective, smart kid,

2162
01:58:49,871 --> 01:58:53,380
but she went for a job up in Capitol
Hill and it was not a direct hire,

2163
01:58:53,381 --> 01:58:57,280
meaning they'd office had to go
through the, um, the, the, uh,

2164
01:58:57,310 --> 01:59:01,210
other offices to get approval to hire
an individual to fill this position.

2165
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:06,220
And because the house is
controlled by Democrats now,

2166
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:11,200
uh, she was, uh, it, everybody looked
and said, yeah, she's a top candidate.

2167
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:13,870
We want to offer the job. Well,

2168
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:18,910
what happened was they
submitted her details.

2169
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:23,890
So we want to hire this person to this
office within the Capitol Hill controlled

2170
01:59:23,891 --> 01:59:25,660
by the Democrats now because
it's the House majority.

2171
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:29,290
And they came back and said,
no, because you know why?

2172
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:33,820
Because she did an internship in
the current administration, right?

2173
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,600
So young person wanting to work in DC, uh,

2174
01:59:37,601 --> 01:59:42,601
in policy and security studies and
elsewhere doing a variety of internships

2175
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:45,940
around the globe, does an
internship at the White House.

2176
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:48,850
Normally you would think that's a good
thing, right? But so they said, no,

2177
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:51,070
because she did this internship
with the White House.

2178
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:54,640
We're not going to approve the
hiring. And then it turns out, well,

2179
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:57,370
she did an internship and build
the Blasio's office too. Right.

2180
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:01,470
And so they said that, and the response
was, well, we don't like him either. So,

2181
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:04,140
which I think was that actually
provided some humor, right.

2182
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:07,130
To the whole situation. But
it shows you not, I mean that,

2183
02:00:07,410 --> 02:00:09,130
that's a little tiny thing and
it's a personal issue, but,

2184
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:14,190
but it shows you Washington
d C is possibly the most
dysfunctional location in

2185
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:19,930
all of North America. Um, that's
terrible. Yeah. And it's, and it's, uh,

2186
02:00:19,931 --> 02:00:23,170
and it's not the way it should be. We
should be able to have policy discussions.

2187
02:00:23,171 --> 02:00:26,290
We should be able to make
decisions. You may not like Trump,

2188
02:00:26,291 --> 02:00:29,710
you may not have liked the previous
president, but you know, again,

2189
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,420
w we gotta stop this bullshit
where everybody's a racist.

2190
02:00:34,421 --> 02:00:36,150
Everybody's a sexist.
Everybody's like you, you,

2191
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:40,570
it's not the way this country's
supposed to work. And people, you know,

2192
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:41,690
you can't even get away from,

2193
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:44,240
okay, well who's at fault?
Everybody's at fault, right? Well,

2194
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:48,060
does the left are all guilty of, of
creating this divisiveness? What is this,

2195
02:00:48,120 --> 02:00:50,850
the cure to outrage culture? I
mean, how do you get past this?

2196
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:53,160
That's the real question,
right? I mean, what is the,

2197
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:58,170
I don't see a map and I was going to ask
you this about foreign policy because

2198
02:00:58,171 --> 02:01:02,760
as a guy who has been involved in the
CIA for as long as you have and has seen

2199
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:07,510
all the inner workings of government
and all the conflict and d,

2200
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:08,453
do you ever feel like you just,

2201
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:14,220
we're just running up a 70 degrees sand
dune that you're never going to get to

2202
02:01:14,221 --> 02:01:18,030
the top of? You know what I mean? It
just seems like it never ends. I mean,

2203
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:21,240
you're just basically trying to like,
oh, there's another hole in the dike.

2204
02:01:21,241 --> 02:01:24,060
Let me put my finger on this one.
Oh, water's coming out of this one.

2205
02:01:24,061 --> 02:01:28,430
Let me get my finger in this one. And
it never ends running up the sand Dune.

2206
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,800
That's a good, that's a
good, uh, analogy, right?

2207
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:35,010
It seems like a million mile
high sand dune and it is,

2208
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:37,980
I think it's always looked at.
DC has always been divisive.

2209
02:01:37,981 --> 02:01:39,920
Politics have always created the division.

2210
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,960
The press has always been biased
in one way or another. You know,

2211
02:01:42,961 --> 02:01:44,780
these things aren't new, but,

2212
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:47,050
and we always tend to think it's the
worst we've ever seen. It looked,

2213
02:01:47,051 --> 02:01:50,270
the civil war was pretty bad. That
was pretty divisive. So, yeah.

2214
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:53,420
So when you have a politician, like, like
I think it was Joe Biden, right? That,

2215
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:57,800
that said that the president is,
is the most, um, you know, uh,

2216
02:01:57,830 --> 02:02:02,780
racist, you know, president we've ever
had. And you think, well, I don't know.

2217
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:06,020
That's an own slaves. Exactly.
12 presidents own slaves.

2218
02:02:06,021 --> 02:02:09,860
I think that might've been a
problem, but, yeah. So, so, and,

2219
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:13,060
or the race relations are the worst
they've ever been. And you think, yeah.

2220
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:17,150
How about the 60s? That was pretty
bad, right? And the civil war.

2221
02:02:17,151 --> 02:02:21,370
And I think so every, every
time is, yeah, I know. And,

2222
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:23,760
but I guess my point being
is that, you know, you can,

2223
02:02:23,761 --> 02:02:27,900
you can fall into that trap where you
think it's as bad as it's ever been. Um,

2224
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:28,700
it's,

2225
02:02:28,700 --> 02:02:33,700
I think it's fair to say that it is more
polarizing now than in recent times.

2226
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:35,330
And how do we walk it back?

2227
02:02:35,331 --> 02:02:38,570
How do we dial it down a little bit
and how do we actually focus on what's

2228
02:02:38,571 --> 02:02:40,430
important for the general population?

2229
02:02:40,431 --> 02:02:42,770
There's a lot of big issues we should
be solving, right? I mean, but,

2230
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:47,090
but look at the insanity of, of when we
talk about healthcare, right? It's like,

2231
02:02:47,091 --> 02:02:49,190
oh, it's gotta be all this,
or it's gotta be all that.

2232
02:02:49,191 --> 02:02:50,750
Nobody's over in the middle
saying, well, you know,

2233
02:02:50,751 --> 02:02:53,540
you could take a little bit
of this and that. And again,

2234
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:56,210
how do you walk that back?
It's way above my pay grade.

2235
02:02:56,211 --> 02:03:00,230
I hunkered down in Idaho and I'd, I'd
go fishing and I don't think about it.

2236
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:05,360
I don't see any solution that
anybody has that makes any sense.

2237
02:03:05,361 --> 02:03:07,010
And that's one of the
things that terrifies me.

2238
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:08,990
And I don't want to just step away.

2239
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:11,450
I don't want to be that
guy that moves to fucking

2240
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:17,330
Idaho. Yeah. I'd love to see
Alberta. Oh, there you go.

2241
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:21,960
[inaudible] the North
Saskatoon, Edmonton New Zealand.

2242
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:25,880
[inaudible] oh yeah, it is. I
love Edmonton. Yeah. But I mean,

2243
02:03:25,881 --> 02:03:30,110
it's like what we're doing in
Edmonton, UFC. Oh, okay. On a show. Oh,

2244
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:30,944
you did river creek.

2245
02:03:30,970 --> 02:03:32,620
So, you know, yeah. It's, um,

2246
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:37,570
I just feel like there's
no real general solution,

2247
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:42,460
nor is there a map of a potential
solution. And in La, I mean,

2248
02:03:42,610 --> 02:03:45,830
and if we get a Democrat in the
White House, it's not gonna end.

2249
02:03:45,930 --> 02:03:47,470
Do Remember when Obama was in office,

2250
02:03:47,471 --> 02:03:50,860
they were mad that he wore a gray
suit or a Tan suit, a Tan suit,

2251
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:55,050
making fun of his suit. Like the fuck.
Do you care? This is all you care.

2252
02:03:55,180 --> 02:03:57,130
But it's like this polarization,

2253
02:03:57,131 --> 02:04:02,131
the Fox News versus MSNBC polarization
that doesn't help anybody.

2254
02:04:02,410 --> 02:04:03,830
And it's, fuck,

2255
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:07,140
it's so bananas that if you have
a podcast like mine and I have a,

2256
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:11,560
a left wing person on, I'm a sell
out. If I have a right wing person on,

2257
02:04:11,561 --> 02:04:14,230
I'm a Nazi and it just
goes back and forth.

2258
02:04:14,231 --> 02:04:16,330
You can't even talk to
people anymore, which is

2259
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:20,670
no, no, it does, it comes down to you
can't have policy differences anymore.

2260
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:24,420
Right. It's gotta be some personal
animus that you've got towards that other

2261
02:04:24,421 --> 02:04:29,140
individual, which is, it's again,
his, his, uh, his, his horseshit.

2262
02:04:29,180 --> 02:04:33,510
You can have policy differences
with, with people. Um,

2263
02:04:34,380 --> 02:04:37,980
and that doesn't make you a bad person.

2264
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,420
It doesn't make you a,
you know, they share,

2265
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:42,210
those are the races that the question
fricking races out there. Right.

2266
02:04:42,211 --> 02:04:42,780
But that's,

2267
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:46,500
we've lost the meaning of the term when
you just start hurling that around at

2268
02:04:46,501 --> 02:04:50,460
anybody you disagree with. Right. Or
when people say, well, if you like Trump,

2269
02:04:50,461 --> 02:04:52,950
you're a racist. Right?
Well, congratulations.

2270
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:56,850
You're probably driving those people
to definitely vote for him in 2020.

2271
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,420
So that's one thing that I
completely agree with you on that.

2272
02:05:00,421 --> 02:05:05,421
I think that this idea that everybody
who supports Trump is racist.

2273
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:10,080
It makes those people so angry that they
just want to go, okay, I'm going to,

2274
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:13,110
well, you're obviously nuts. I
can't, I can't be on your side.

2275
02:05:13,111 --> 02:05:13,801
You people are crazy.

2276
02:05:13,801 --> 02:05:16,800
You want to open up the borders and
you want to take all the money from the

2277
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:18,990
everybody that's a hardworking American,

2278
02:05:18,991 --> 02:05:20,910
give it to all the poor
people and fuck you.

2279
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:24,990
And it's like the arguments just get
so confused. Yeah. I not on the words.

2280
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:28,080
I mean, if you think about
who, who might win, you know,

2281
02:05:28,081 --> 02:05:30,750
I don't think Joe Biden's gonna last.
I think they're going to eat him alive.

2282
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,840
It's not, yeah, he's not going
make it. It's going to be,

2283
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:37,140
I think Bernie and Carmela
Harris and um, Tulsi Gabbert,

2284
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:39,840
those are the only ones that
makes Kelsey makes sense to me.

2285
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:42,750
She's a veteran
congresswoman for six years.

2286
02:05:42,990 --> 02:05:47,040
She seems incredibly honest and to her
morals and our ethics are on point.

2287
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:50,890
I like her. She's my
favorite. But, um, if the,

2288
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:53,250
the left is going to have someone,

2289
02:05:53,490 --> 02:05:56,610
they're going to have to be able
to deal with Trump's insults.

2290
02:05:56,760 --> 02:06:00,420
You're going to be able to debate him
and that's where they all fall apart

2291
02:06:00,421 --> 02:06:00,811
because they,

2292
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:05,400
they're trying to use that old model
of politics and he's not doing that.

2293
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,600
He's a showman.

2294
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:10,290
And I think what's happening is that the
pope looked at the people that count in

2295
02:06:10,291 --> 02:06:14,940
this in the primary or you know, that's
a completely different bag right there.

2296
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:17,130
Then what goes on in the general,

2297
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:21,060
and I think the people that
are in the primary right now,

2298
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:22,620
all those people are going
to be voting in the primary.

2299
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:26,790
They're watching like these debates as
an example or they're just watching the

2300
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:29,460
daily Twitter, Twitter feed from
these people, the candidates,

2301
02:06:29,461 --> 02:06:32,790
and they're thinking, can I see
this person debating Trump? Right?

2302
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:38,090
And so the not only are the policies
that these candidates are spouting are

2303
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:41,130
moving further and further to the left,

2304
02:06:41,131 --> 02:06:43,800
which is going to make it harder when the
general election comes to shift to the

2305
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:45,510
center and not gonna
be able to do it right.

2306
02:06:45,511 --> 02:06:49,320
That center is now shifted further to
left if they even make the effort to get

2307
02:06:49,321 --> 02:06:53,640
back there. But you know, you're,
you're getting sort of like the worst,

2308
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:57,030
um, instincts coming off from these
candidates because they think, well,

2309
02:06:57,031 --> 02:07:00,480
I got to show that I can throw a fire
bomb here because they're looking at me

2310
02:07:00,650 --> 02:07:03,320
as, you know, can I debate Trump?
Right? And so you're gonna,

2311
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:05,070
you're gonna get somebody who's not.

2312
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:08,160
So I don't think Tulsa Gavin's gonna make
it because I think they're gonna make

2313
02:07:08,161 --> 02:07:10,470
that calculation. I think that they've
probably going to look in there.

2314
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:11,340
You're gonna end up with,

2315
02:07:11,341 --> 02:07:15,470
with Harris or maybe Warren Warren
is not gonna make it. I don't know.

2316
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:18,480
Amanda American thing's gonna say,
cause you would think so, right?

2317
02:07:18,481 --> 02:07:19,314
You would think so.

2318
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:22,950
Harvard actually touted her and some of
their literature when they were talking

2319
02:07:22,951 --> 02:07:24,930
about their diversity
efforts over the years,

2320
02:07:24,931 --> 02:07:27,550
there's actually documents where
Harvard was saying, you know, hey,

2321
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:29,760
and we hired, you know, at
first native American, you know,

2322
02:07:29,761 --> 02:07:31,380
professor and you're thinking,

2323
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:35,920
that's a statistic I am 200 times
more African than is native American.

2324
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:40,840
How bout that? Basically
African, uh, are Ya? Yeah.

2325
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:44,980
I didn't know that 1.6%.
1.6%. Yeah. From where

2326
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:51,580
we know 23andme, I did one of
them [inaudible] place today.

2327
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:55,270
It's a whole continent. Someone from that
continent fucked one of my ancestors.

2328
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:58,280
What did you find out in South Africa
though, Dan? It's not quite as, yeah.

2329
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:01,020
Yeah. It's not quite, it's interesting,
but yeah. Well that's a Dutch, right?

2330
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:05,380
Yeah. You get Dutch jabs. Boar Board.
Yeah. Um, yeah, I haven't done that.

2331
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:09,220
You know, my daughter did it and,
um, I have not done that. I had,

2332
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:12,040
I actually had a conversation the other
day about this whole thing about the

2333
02:08:12,041 --> 02:08:16,290
desire to know your ancestry and
everything. And I, my dad, uh, uh,

2334
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:20,950
came over, uh, never talked about his
background, ever talked about his family.

2335
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:26,140
Um, CIA dad, yeah. Put this in there
to keep his mouth shut. But uh,

2336
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:29,560
and so he never, he never demonstrated
that interest. Right. And so therefore,

2337
02:08:29,561 --> 02:08:33,250
I don't think I've ever been, I've
never just been that focused on it. Um,

2338
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:36,190
everything was in there that I
knew was in there. Mostly Italian,

2339
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:39,880
a little bit of Irish, but
some weird shit, like 1% Asian.

2340
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:42,520
I thought that was odd
to any Scottish. Nope.

2341
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:46,160
It's always a little Scottish floating
around out there like to fuck. Yeah,

2342
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:51,100
yeah, that's right. They get
out. They get out bout. Um,

2343
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:54,490
yeah. Uh, yeah. I Dunno. I'm
the where it's all going.

2344
02:08:54,491 --> 02:08:59,050
But I do think that Warren, it
could be viewed. I don't, I don't,

2345
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,570
I don't like her, but
I think that she will,

2346
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:04,810
I think the base looks at her and
thinks, yeah, she could be a firebrand.

2347
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:07,060
You can do this. After that
whole native American thing,

2348
02:09:07,061 --> 02:09:11,140
she built her career on a lie. They
don't care. They, that base doesn't care.

2349
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:15,220
That's the problem. America cares.
You can't look past at the same way.

2350
02:09:15,221 --> 02:09:16,930
You couldn't look past
Hillary being a liar.

2351
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:21,610
Hillary tried to say that her
name came from Edmund Hillary,

2352
02:09:21,611 --> 02:09:23,050
the guy who climbed Mount Everest.

2353
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:28,400
He climbed Mount Everest three years
after she was born. But you know,

2354
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:31,300
when he was still quite the
character before, so, you know,

2355
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:35,220
it was still throwing that
name around. Uh, yeah. But, uh,

2356
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:38,140
more than three years. Yeah.
Yeah. Um, after she was born.

2357
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:41,560
It might've been seven years,
but you think it won't be,

2358
02:09:41,561 --> 02:09:42,520
I don't think it'll be Bernie.

2359
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:47,020
I don't think you know John
Democratic Socialism. Well,

2360
02:09:47,090 --> 02:09:47,861
I'll tell you so much.

2361
02:09:47,861 --> 02:09:51,230
You go up to Vermont and look around for
Mont and see what kind of job Bernie's

2362
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:54,880
done in. How about Pete? Did you
do a judge Judy? Judge, he treated,

2363
02:09:54,910 --> 02:09:57,370
they fucking hate him in
his own city. Mayor Pete,

2364
02:09:57,371 --> 02:09:59,140
they're pissed at him in south bend.

2365
02:09:59,310 --> 02:10:00,760
They wouldn't call him a
ticket with the blast. You,

2366
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:03,250
that'd be a powerful
mayoral ticket right there.

2367
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:05,500
There's no one person that stands out.

2368
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:08,410
There's no one person that like stands
out as someone who's kind of when,

2369
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:11,860
you know, everyone's like,
Ooh, could this person make it?

2370
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:14,860
Could that person make it?
And then there's people that
want to challenge Trump,

2371
02:10:14,861 --> 02:10:16,780
which is hilarious. Well, I
think there's going to be,

2372
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:19,340
we're going to lose a lot of these
folks after this next round of the,

2373
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:22,290
which I guess tonight, tomorrow
night is, um, I think there's a,

2374
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:25,870
it's not an a and a B card, but there's
two nights, two nights of debates.

2375
02:10:25,871 --> 02:10:29,290
Cause there's so many of them. There's
bouts, bouts. Did you see the pack fight?

2376
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:32,340
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I always see.
Great man. I got to tell you,

2377
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:37,070
I drop Sturman in the first round.
They know Thurman's a beast too, man.

2378
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:40,430
That's crazy. It was a, it was, that
was a great moment. And then it was a,

2379
02:10:40,431 --> 02:10:42,470
it was an interesting fight and I thought,

2380
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:46,070
I wasn't quite sure at the end where
it was going to go, but I liked,

2381
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:48,270
I've watched pack you'll
over the years. And I did.

2382
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:50,270
There was kind of that typical, you know,

2383
02:10:50,271 --> 02:10:52,880
you get older and you're kind of
rooting for the old guy. Right?

2384
02:10:52,881 --> 02:10:56,900
He's 40 years old. He's the oldest man
to ever capture the welterweight title.

2385
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:59,840
And particularly when you consider
those lighter weight classes,

2386
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:04,160
like foreman won the heavyweight title
at 46, which was crazy. Yeah. But pack.

2387
02:11:04,161 --> 02:11:04,341
Yeah.

2388
02:11:04,341 --> 02:11:08,720
Winning the welterweight title at forties
fucking bunny working their ass off.

2389
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:11,240
I mean, it was just, it was, it
was, it was a good, good fight.

2390
02:11:11,241 --> 02:11:12,051
I really enjoyed that.

2391
02:11:12,051 --> 02:11:16,190
That was first time I really watched
a fight that I really enjoyed, right.

2392
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:19,660
Beginning to end. And uh, and I
was with some folks who were, were,

2393
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:23,420
who were not for Paki and I kept looking
at, I'm thinking, how do you not like,

2394
02:11:23,590 --> 02:11:26,280
he's the old guy. He's been doing
this forever. He's a senator. Yeah.

2395
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:28,130
Think about that. That's crazy.

2396
02:11:28,131 --> 02:11:30,860
Going back to work on a budget issues
in the Philippines after the fight.

2397
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:34,910
That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. I think he
made 10 million on that, I think. Yeah.

2398
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:39,740
Good. Yeah. Good for him. Yeah. Yeah.
Keith Thurman too. He made two and a half.

2399
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:44,300
It's got some chatter now. Key
College boy. I love it. It May,

2400
02:11:44,301 --> 02:11:47,930
whether it was in the audience. Yeah.
Yeah. Well that would be fantastic if the,

2401
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:50,000
I mean, now's the time to do it if
Mayweather really wants to do it,

2402
02:11:50,001 --> 02:11:52,220
but may with a metal, watch
that fight and go. Yeah.

2403
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:55,800
Because the first time they fought pack
y'all at a blown out shoulder and then

2404
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:57,320
that was a lot of people were angry.

2405
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:01,720
There was actually even talk of a class
action lawsuit against Pacquiao bef uh,

2406
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:06,560
after the fight because people had bet
on him and his shoulder was fucked up

2407
02:12:06,561 --> 02:12:08,470
going, he'd heard it
in training and tried,

2408
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:11,210
I think he got a cortisone shot and
said, I'm just going to try to fight on.

2409
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:16,220
And then he wound up getting shoulder
surgery and then from then on after Rehab

2410
02:12:16,221 --> 02:12:19,340
looks fantastic. That's really interesting
though, the concept of could you,

2411
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:24,230
could you push through a class action
lawsuit with an athlete who is in that

2412
02:12:24,231 --> 02:12:28,400
position? I mean, yeah. Where does that
go? I mean then if you're playing hurt,

2413
02:12:28,430 --> 02:12:31,280
I mean, you're in the NFL and you're
playing hurt. Right, right. Um,

2414
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:34,400
do you have any obligation? No. I
mean, I mean it's interesting. Well,

2415
02:12:34,401 --> 02:12:36,620
UFC fighters fight hurt all the time.

2416
02:12:36,621 --> 02:12:40,910
I know for a fact guys fight with blown
out hcls and torn hamstrings and they

2417
02:12:40,911 --> 02:12:44,060
just listen. They get to that
point, they think I can still win.

2418
02:12:44,061 --> 02:12:45,680
And some of them still went,
Kamara will lose Monde,

2419
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,330
won the title with a broken foot. He
broke his foot in training and he,

2420
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:54,770
he was literally on crutches the week of
the fight and then the guy gets to the

2421
02:12:54,771 --> 02:12:59,420
fight and he's such a fucking
animal and so tough that he fought.

2422
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:01,160
Like there was nothing wrong with him.

2423
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,420
And then afterwards revealed that he had
broken his foot. It's fucking bananas.

2424
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:08,570
The mental toughness that you have to
have to be able to do that for a living

2425
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:13,220
and then you, you, and when you lose
to somebody with a broken foot. Yeah.

2426
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:17,690
That's, and yeah, yeah, yeah. It was,
yeah. Dominated, dominated Tyron Woodley,

2427
02:13:17,691 --> 02:13:20,930
which is even crazier, but then Woodley
wins that fight injured as well. I mean,

2428
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,580
it's just the nature of the beast.

2429
02:13:22,581 --> 02:13:25,460
If your job is to hurt people
and break their bodies,

2430
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:28,840
you're going to have to practice breaking
bodies along the way and you're going

2431
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:31,190
to have to practice it with people
that are trying to break your body

2432
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:31,980
occasionally that they

2433
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,570
succeed. Yeah. Yeah. Rough business.
Yeah. You got to come, come to an event.

2434
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:38,040
I actually, I would like to do that.

2435
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:40,500
I just want an Anaheim in a couple of
weeks. You should come to that one.

2436
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:43,470
It's a big one. Daniel Cormier is
fighting steep Emile church. Okay.

2437
02:13:43,471 --> 02:13:47,310
For the heavyweight title in a couple of
weeks. Yup. Nate Diaz is fighting, uh,

2438
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:52,000
Anthony Pettis. That's a crazy fight.
And Paulo Kosta is fighting UL Romero.

2439
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:56,710
The two or three rather epic
fights in rain and Anaheim.

2440
02:13:56,900 --> 02:14:00,880
Graying. No one gets injured. [inaudible]
Jesus. Uh, yeah. You know what?

2441
02:14:00,881 --> 02:14:04,590
I can bring scooter. Scooter likes rings.
Yeah. He likes that. Come on down man.

2442
02:14:04,591 --> 02:14:07,370
Yeah, set it up. You know what?
I'll follow up on that. I will do.

2443
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:09,960
All right and tell me when your
show comes out so I could let the,

2444
02:14:09,961 --> 02:14:11,790
let the people know. Maybe you
can come back on again when,

2445
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:12,511
whenever it actually,

2446
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:15,810
if you wouldn't mind once they give
me the go ahead because apparently I'm

2447
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:17,940
prescribed, I'm talking about it,
but when they give me the go ahead,

2448
02:14:17,950 --> 02:14:20,160
you won't be able to just shut
up. Alright. Just keep talking.

2449
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:22,740
Well thank you Joe. We'll do that. Thank
you sir. Thank you man. Good Times.

2450
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:23,760
All right. Bye Buddy.

2451
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:27,603
Okay.

2452
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:31,970
Fun Time Style, man. Yeah. Thank you, man.
