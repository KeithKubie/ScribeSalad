If you've been following
our iOS news lately,

00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:04.810
you've probably heard that
we're now using CocoaPods

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.590
as our primary way of
delivering our libraries to iOS

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.470
developers.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.307
Hooray!

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:11.640
But you might have also noticed
that there are sometimes

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.370
a bunch of different
CocoaPods that all

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.950
refer to the same library.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.390
For example, for
Google Analytics,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.980
there's Google Analytics
iOS-SKD, GoogleAnalytics,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.999
and Google/Analytics.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.790
So what's the deal?

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.836
Are these any different and, if
so, which one should you use?

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:27.460
Find out the answers
to these questions

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.260
and many more of
life's mysteries

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.998
on this episode of Route 85.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.866
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.240
Hi, there.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.840
I'm Todd Kerpelman
and let's go ahead

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.370
and review these three Google
Analytics CocoaPods, shall we?

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.340
So this first one,
GoogleAnalytics iOS-SDK

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.010
was created by a couple of
loyal fans on the internet

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.630
back before Google start
building its own CocoaPods.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.300
Since then, it's been deprecated
in favor of the Google one.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000
So I wouldn't use
it if I were you,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.780
unless you like deprecation
warnings, I guess.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.722
Weirdo.

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:01.430
That said, if you've
got a project that's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.440
been around awhile or are
watching an older YouTube

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.310
tutorial, you might
see this one mentioned,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.670
so it's good to know what it is.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.170
But you know what?

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.128
Let's remove this one
from the running for now.

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:09.884
See ya.

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:12.716
[SCREAMING] [CRASH] That
was unnecessarily violent.

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:14.090
So, as for these
next two, you're

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.548
going to see this
pattern happening

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:17.742
a lot in the CocoaPods
that Google provides.

00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:19.200
You're going to
see GoogleAnalytics

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870
and Google/Analytics.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.900
Similarly, there's
GoogleSignIn and Google/SignIn,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.500
GoogleCloudMessaging and
Google/CloudMessaging,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.570
and so on and so forth.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.796
You get the idea.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:30.420
So what's the difference
between these?

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.260
The short answer is that
the Google/CocoaPods include

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.850
everything these other
ones do, plus some utility

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.970
files to make your
life a little easier.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.727
Let me explain.

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:41.060
See, around the same time we
introduced CocoaPod support

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.799
for iOS, we also announced this
cool new configuration tool

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.840
designed to get you up
and running really quickly

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.219
on a bunch of Google services.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.510
Here, you can see it in action.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.227
I'm creating a new
iOS project and I'm

00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.060
going to enable a number
of services for it,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.550
using this new
configuration tool.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.900
Here you can see that
I'm enabling GoogleSignIn

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.550
and it's automatically setting
up an OAuth client ID for me,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.330
using sensible defaults
for everything.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.470
I can also create a new
GoogleAnalytics property

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.880
without having to jump to
the GoogleAnalytics page,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.100
enable app invites for my
app, and get some test ad

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.800
units from AdMob, without
having to the AdMob site.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.600
So on and so forth.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.850
Normally, I'd have to visit
like two or three consoles

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.225
to get all this
work done but now

00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:17.059
I can do it all in one
place, which is nice.

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.974
And then you can see
that, when I'm done here,

00:02:18.974 --> 00:02:20.740
I have a p-list file
that I can download.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.149
What's that all about, you ask?

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.940
I'm glad you asked.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.937
Good question.

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:25.770
See, this file contains
a bunch of constants

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.440
I can use to configure these
services that I'm setting up,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.200
things like my GoogleAnalytics
tracking ID, my OAuth client

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.330
ID, AdMob test IDs,
and so on and so forth.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.634
In the past, you had to copy
and paste these constants

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.300
for all these various
developer consoles

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.650
into your code, which left an
awful lot of room for error.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.829
But now, thanks to a nice little
utility library we've created,

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.870
you can tackle a lot of
these configuration steps

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.590
with one single configure
with error call.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.030
When you call this
method, Google

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.760
will find p-list file that
you've added to your project,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.250
grab the constants from there,
and configure your Google

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.600
libraries for you,
using these constants.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.690
But this only works if you
have the Google/Analytics

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.150
pod installed.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.010
You see, the
Google/Analytics pod

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.620
is a superset of the
GoogleAnalytics pod.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.334
It contains
GoogleAnalytics along

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:10.750
with some of the
utility libraries

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.510
you need to do things like
read in that p-list file.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.470
If you were to just
use the GoogleAnalytics

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.435
CocoaPod, the version
without the slash,

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:19.060
it would give you
GoogleAnalytics

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.250
without any of the
utility libraries.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.370
Now, that would still
work too, as long

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.660
as you set up your tracker
the old-fashioned way,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.940
which means calling GAI
sharedInstance tracker

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.310
with tracking ID and
copying and pasting

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.910
that constant from the
GoogleAnalytics console.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.840
So which one should you use?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.370
Well if you've got an existing
project and you're just

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.410
looking to replace the
old GoogleAnalytics

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.220
iOS-SDK CocoaPod with
the official one,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.540
you can probably get away
with using GoogleAnalytics,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.420
the version without all
the helper libraries,

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.920
because you're already setting
the tracker ID manually.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.750
Now, granted, using the
Google/Analytics CocoaPod

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.600
will also work.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.240
It'll just give
you a few libraries

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.880
you don't necessarily need.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.900
Go on, get out of
there, you crazy kids.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.150
Now, on the other hand, if
you're creating an app from

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.010
scratch, I would recommend
using the Google/ version

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.970
of the CocoaPod and configuring
everything up using the new

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.610
configuration flow.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.630
So there you go,
folks, mystery solved.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.950
Give these new CocoaPods a
try and, more importantly,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.320
give this new setup flow a try.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.459
It is the most fun you'll
have all day configuring

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.550
API libraries.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.640
And I will see you
soon on Route 85.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.290
