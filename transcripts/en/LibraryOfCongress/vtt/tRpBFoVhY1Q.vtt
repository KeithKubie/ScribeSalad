[ Applause ]

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.370
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Very nice.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.070
[ Applause ]

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.610
[ Applause ]

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.910
You ever thought of running?

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.210
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.950
On behalf of the Library of
Congress, it's my privilege

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.330
to introduce one of the nation's
leading philanthropists,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.430
a tireless advocate for
reading and literacy,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.730
and the co-chairman

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:46.730
of the National Book
Festival, David Rubenstein.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.030
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Thank you.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.330
So I guess -- so, thank you.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.630
So I can call you Madeleine.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.440
We worked together in the White
House many, many years ago.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.100
So Madeleine, you just came

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.460
from the funeral service
for Senator McCain.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.610
Could you talk a
little bit about that

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.570
and your relationship with him?

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.870
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yes.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.170
Well, first of all, I'm
delighted to be here

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.060
and delighted to
be with you, David.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.070
We have known each other for --

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.440
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: A while.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.740
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.770
many years, before you were
who you are and were settled.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.290
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: My
hair was dark then, but --

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.590
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.040
But it was really a very moving
service, because it had so many

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.840
of the themes that Senator
McCain has really been

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.150
identified with in terms
of service to country,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.410
both in a military way and
also a civilian, and his time,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.180
and the tributes
really spoke to that.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.660
It was incredibly well-planned,
but what was so fascinating was

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.560
that obviously Senator
McCain planned all this,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.620
but he had asked President
W. Bush and President Obama

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.200
to be the speakers, two
people who defeated him,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.060
and they made comments about
the fact, isn't it interesting

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.260
that they were asked, and they
talked about what that meant,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.340
and it just was a very,
very moving service

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.340
in so many different ways, and
the music, and everybody cried

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.600
to "Danny Boy" when
Renee Fleming sang it,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.460
and so many different things.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.550
My relationship with Senator
McCain was one that was based

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.050
on not just our friendship
but our value system.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.250
He has been -- first of all,
I'm chairman of the board

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.630
of an organization called the
National Democratic Institute,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.890
and he's chairman of the
National Republican Institute,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.170
and what happened was
these are organizations

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.310
that were started
by Ronald Reagan.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.390
In the early 80s, he had
gone to speak in England

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.240
at the Parliament and said that
democracies were not real good

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.700
about defending themselves

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.210
or explaining themselves vis a
vis communism, so he came back

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.180
and started the Endowment
for Democracy

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.080
with these two organizations.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.160
So the first time
that Senator McCain

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.940
and I did something together
actually was in June of 1990.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.690
I was born in Czechoslovakia,
and it was right

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.860
after the Velvet Revolution,
and it was the first elections

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.530
that were held, and we were
there as election observers,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.560
and really, it was my -- so
much fun was the main word,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.920
in terms of showing a great
senator my hometown of Prague,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.800
and Paul Simon sang,
and I took him --

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.130
I took Senator McCain on
Madeleine's tour of Prague,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.770
but basically, we then
discovered how much we both

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.020
cared about supporting
democracy --

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.320
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.620
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.920
in countries that had been
under totalitarianism,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.220
and that was something

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.450
that really was our major
source of working together.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So were you --

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.700
have you been surprised at the
enormous outpouring of sorrow

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.990
at his passing, or are
you not surprised at it?

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.970
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Both,
frankly, because knowing him

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.370
and knowing what a role he
played, I'm not surprised.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.180
What I am surprised
is how it has turned

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.030
into something much larger, and
I think that that is what came

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.420
through at the funeral also --

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.050
is that what Senator McCain
was representing was what many

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.840
of us have thought is
the best of America,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.510
which are people
that understand --

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.580
[ Applause ]

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.170
-- the importance of service,
the importance of serving

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.800
with honor, the importance of
caring about what people think,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.430
the importance of our diversity
and America's value system

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.060
and America's role in the world,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.040
and so all those things have
been reflected in his life,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.450
but also in a lot of
the celebrations --

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.050
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -- and
I think it was really strong,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.350
obviously, at the funeral,

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.630
but I think it is
larger than I expected.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.070
I expected a lot of honor
to a senator with that kind

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.960
of a record, but this
has now, I think,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.430
taken off in a much larger way.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.210
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So I
notice you've written a book

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.140
about pins that you wore

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.530
when you were secretary
of state, and --

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.830
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: -- I
notice you're wearing one now.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.430
What does that pin symbolize?

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.730
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.640
this is obviously the
American eagle, and I wanted

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.600
to wear something
patriotic for the funeral.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.970
I debated about an anchor
because of his Navy service,

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.720
but then I decided that
it was larger than just --

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.320
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- his Navy service,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.300
so this is my most
vibrant eagle.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.600
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.900
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
But I was going to --

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.640
what I have been doing, and I
decided not to do it today --

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.440
when I've been talking about my
books, I've been wearing a pin,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.920
and it's mercury,
because I'm trying

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.980
to deliver a message
about fascism.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.280
So you know, today it --

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.580
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.880
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.180
seemed more appropriate
to wear the eagle.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,
we're going to -- let's go on.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.650
Let's talk about fascism,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.260
and you've written a
new book on fascism.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.920
Why did you decide to
write a book about fascism?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.890
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
a number of different reasons.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.210
First of all, I think that
I felt that it is a term

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.510
that is just being thrown

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.370
around without people
understanding what it is.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.570
Anybody we disagree
with is a fascist.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.230
Then the teenage boy
who's not allowed

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.430
to drive the car calls
his father a fascist,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.660
and I was trying to figure
out how one defines something

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.220
that is raising its head
more and more internationally

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.980
and really trying to explain
what fascism is, and the reason

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.800
that I wanted to write it is
frankly because of my own story.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.790
I was born in Czechoslovakia
in 1937, and as a result

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.100
of agreements made in Munich in
1938 by the British and French

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.670
with the Germans and Italians,
the country I was born

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.340
in was sold down the river, and
in March '39, the Nazis marched

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.750
in and fascism took
over that country.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.300
My father was a Czechoslovak
diplomat, and we spent the war

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.650
in England because he with
the government in exile,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.570
but I could see what fascism
had done to Europe, and I wanted

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.580
to write about it from a
personal perspective as well

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.640
as from a warning, because
there are things going

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.330
on around the world where
there are elements of fascism

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.860
that I think people need to
understand what it's about,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.570
and it's not just an
epitaph to be thrown around.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.170
Well, let's go through this.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.870
In your book, you
talk about the person

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.930
who actually first used
the phrase fascism.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.230
That actually was
Mussolini, Benito Mussolini.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.130
Where did he get
the phrase fascism?

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.430
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yes.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
What does that mean?

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.030
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, first of all,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.840
I decided that what I wanted to
do about the book was to put it

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.350
into historical context so that
people could really understand

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.080
what it's about, and Mussolini
was the first fascist,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.480
and it really came from a term
of elm rods, which are kind

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.820
of sticks, and an axe,
which had been an emblem

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.160
that the Romans had used,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.980
and these elm rods are called
fasces, and so this group

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.500
of people around Mussolini
took it as their emblem,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.440
and it's the toughness
and going back to Caesar.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.160
Now as you point
out in your book,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.250
Mussolini came along
before Hitler,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.520
and Mussolini was a politician,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.890
but not all that
successful initially.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.190
He had some problems.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.590
Didn't come from a wealthy
family, particularly.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.730
How did he rise up to get to the
point where he could rule Italy?

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.660
Did he win an election that got
him to be the head of Italy?

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.470
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well, let
me go back a little bit on this,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.830
because I think that one of the
things that I wanted to look

00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:00.170
at was what is the environment
that produces fascism,

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.860
and without sounding like
a professor, which I am,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.170
is that really, the
historical context is

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:14.050
that there certainly have been
a lot of disruptions in society,

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:19.080
some in the late 19th
century, early 20th century,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.620
due to the Industrial Revolution
and people being displaced

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.560
in their jobs, and then
kind of a sense of division

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.250
in societies, the
haves and have-nots,

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.940
was arising in a number
of different countries,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.840
and then World War One also had
a real input into all of that,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.220
and Italy particularly.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.550
You know, we all make fun of
Italians, Italian governments,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.190
for a long time,
because they've had

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.140
so many different prime
ministers and party messes.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.810
They had it all along, and
Italy throughout the early 20th

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.040
century had a lot of
different governments,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.050
and then what happened
was they had actually --

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.280
-- fought on the side of the
Allies during World War One,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.340
but had not really benefitted
from it in any way in terms

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.420
of having alliances or
being treated with respect,

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.840
and so Mussolini was somebody
that came from a poor family,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.510
who was somebody that, from
everything that I read,

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.300
more and more about him,
actually very charismatic

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.890
and charming, but he was an
outsider, and all of a sudden,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.490
he in many ways fit in to
try to resolve the situation

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.470
of all these divisions that
were taking place in Italy.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.770
In Italy, he initially was a
leftist, and they were trying

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.370
to figure out how to deal with
their various social problems,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.360
and he got a group of people
around him that became more

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.630
and more politicized, and
he identified with them

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.250
as an outsider to be able
to bring some kind of order

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.650
to things, and so this group
of people surrounded him,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.930
and he was, as I said,
very charismatic.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.990
This is the part that
blew my mind, frankly.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.880
He came to power
constitutionally,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.370
because what happened was
King Emmanuel of Italy felt

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.480
that the coalition governments
there were not working together

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.930
well enough, that they needed
to solve some of the problems

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.470
that were coming out of World
War One, and he asked Mussolini

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.200
to take over the government,
and so that's the part.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.070
He didn't seize power
in that particular way,

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.700
but he was so interesting,
David,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:39.500
because he did say he needed
to drain the swamp in Italian.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.800
He's the first one
who said that.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.100
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.400
He said it in Italian,
though, right?

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.700
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
He said it in Italian.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.970
In a lot of the things I read,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.400
he thought he had all the
answers to everything,

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.090
that he was a stable
genius, and --

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.140
[ Applause ]

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.440
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.900
So what year did he
actually take over?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.200
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, he took over kind

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.470
of like in the early 30s.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Thirties, right.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.070
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Early 30s.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So actually,

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.880
when he was running the
government for a while,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.600
did he do things that
made him more popular

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.510
than he had been before
he even took office?

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.810
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Yes, he did.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.110
I mean he organized things well.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.950
He did make the trains run on
time, but he really did help

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.280
in terms of some
of the stability

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.450
that people felt was
necessary in Italy.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.490
He, however, ultimately overdid

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:42.320
and did not deliver,
and he was hung.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.810
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Ultimately, he was captured,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.110
and what happened to him?

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.750
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, he was seized,

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.050
and then they hung him.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.350
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
He and his mistress --

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.650
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yes.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.950
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
-- were hung up.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.250
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: But the
best quote in the whole book is

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.070
from Mussolini, and
he said something like

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.470
"if you pluck a chicken
one feather

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.610
at a time, nobody notices."

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.620
So in societies where a lot of
feather-plucking is going on --

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.040
those are two words that are
hard to say quickly together --

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.440
there often is not a notice --

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.040
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- of what is going on.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.340
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.950
So ultimately, he met his
demise, and let's talk

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.410
about somebody else who came
along a little bit later,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.710
Adolph Hitler.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.450
How did Hitler rise up to power?

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.880
Did he win an election
by majority vote?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.180
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: No,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.840
but what is interesting is
Hitler succeeds Mussolini,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.640
and there was a relation.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.780
Initially, from my reading, I
found that Hitler admired some

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.130
of the things that
Mussolini had been doing.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.910
Hitler came from also a family
that was kind of on the outside.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.980
He was from parents that were
kind of failed civil servants,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.460
and he also was somebody
that seemed

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.770
as if he could not get along
in the particular society.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.200
He tried to be an architect,
a number of different aspects.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.120
He also then, because
Germany was a country

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.950
after World War One
that was "punished,"

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.160
I think for good reason, but
with the Versailles Treaty

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.260
and reparations and not
treated with respect,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.480
and so there were a lot of
problems within Germany itself.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.840
They also suffered very
much from the Depression,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.420
and they had set up a democratic
republic called the Weimar

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.650
Republic, but they were
not capable also of dealing

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.770
with the various issues
that were out there,

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.530
and something similar happened.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:41.190
There was a very reputable and
well-known German statesman,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.120
von Hindenberg, who
all of a sudden --

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.490
also, the coalition
system wasn't working,

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:53.710
and he ultimately asked
Hitler to take over by --

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.930
the parliament there
ultimately agreed to it,

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.810
and I think that's the part.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.150
I mean, one of the great parts

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.210
about writing a book is the
research that one has to do

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.120
about it and learning a number
of things about how Mussolini

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.950
and Hitler came to power.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.810
In fact, just the way
you've asked the questions,

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.460
is there was not a revolution.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.020
They were asked by the
constitutional head of state,

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.620
King Emmanuel and
von Hindenberg,

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.840
to take over at a time when the
government itself was not able

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.630
to deal with the divisions --

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.930
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.860
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -- and
the dislocations and the anger

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.340
about how people were treated
after the end of World War One.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.320
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But King Victor Emmanuel

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.360
and von Hindenberg both
underestimated Mussolini

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.620
and Hitler's ability to change
the government and to do things

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.560
that were never anticipated;
is that correct?

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.960
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Absolutely, and also being able

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.440
to -- they were obviously
different,

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.090
and I think that what Mussolini
was able to do was to kind

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:02.040
of use drama and his
capability and his charisma

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.310
to motivate people
to follow him.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.610
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.090
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And
Hitler also used propaganda.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.900
There's a long history in
terms of the kinds of things

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.020
that he did, but Hitler added
one whole element to all

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.320
of this, which was
finding a group of people

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.650
that were scapegoats
for all of this.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.210
How had all this
happened in Germany?

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.620
Whose fault was it?

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.160
And it was the fault
of the Jews,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.950
which is where the
antisemitic part then leading

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.460
to the Holocaust was something.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.760
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.160
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Nobody
can be compared to Hitler,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.660
and Hitler took some of the
elements that Mussolini had put

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.760
into place and then added
this horrific aspect --

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.060
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.360
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.660
to it that made it not
just fascist but Nazis.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.960
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.180
let's talk about one
other person you write

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.280
about in your book, Franco,
who took over as more

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.950
or less a dictator in Spain.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.410
How did he come to power?

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.720
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
Spain also was having all kinds

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.220
of economic issues and
problems and agricultural issues

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.790
and how they dealt with some
of the colonies they had,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:12.370
and he was a military person,
and he also was kind of asked

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:16.670
to take over at a time that
things were not working properly

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.900
for the people, and then what
was interesting about Spain

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.500
that made it a little bit
different was the whole Spanish

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.530
Civil War, in terms of being
the theater where the fights

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.620
between the communists, the
left wing and the right wing,

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.420
took place, and Franco
was able also to benefit

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.630
from all the dislocation
that came from that.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.750
So I think the thing
all these people have

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:47.850
in common is they take advantage
of a economic situation

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.670
that is disruptive,
that creates a group

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.160
of haves versus the have-nots.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now
after the war, World War Two,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:01.910
is over, your father and your
family go back to Czechoslovakia

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.590
and think you're going
to live there now

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.030
because Hitler is gone.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.480
What happened in Czechoslovakia
after you got back?

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.560
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, the thing that --

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.470
I think just to add a variety
of complications to this,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.280
what happened -- Czechoslovakia
was a country that was founded

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.800
after 1918, and as a
result of World War One

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.460
and the Austro-Hungarian
Empire collapses,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.640
and Czechoslovakia was
founded in that way thanks to,

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.170
as the Czechs pronounce it,

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.140
Woodrow Wilson and
the 14 points.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.820
It was a country that was
based on national identity,

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.820
and I have to tell this,
because the first president

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.460
of Czechoslovakia was a man
called Tomas Garrigue Masaryk.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.020
He had married an American --

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.020
her name was Charlotte
Garrigue --

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.440
and at the end of
the 19th century,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.190
he took her maiden name
as his middle name.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.240
Not a lot of men do that.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.790
Then also the Czechoslovak
constitution was based

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:07.430
on the American constitution,
with one major difference.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.960
It had equal rights
language in it in 1918,

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:20.530
and so this small country in the
middle of Europe was in fact,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.560
and I say this with some
pride, the only real democracy

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.030
in central and eastern
Europe, but what happened was

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.610
that even though it was
founded on national identity,

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.560
it had a small German
minority in the north,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.740
and they were trying to figure
out how to deal with them

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.410
when that minority was energized
by a man called Konrad Henlein,

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.590
who was an apostle of or
a disciple of Hitler's.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:54.360
And so what happened was that
there were agreements made

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.910
that the west would
defend Czechoslovakia

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.210
if in fact the Germans
took over.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.510
The Russians, --

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.710
-- or the Soviet Union --

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.820
and by the way, Czechoslovakia
didn't have a problem

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.360
with Russians.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.460
Not like Poland, where the
borders were too close --

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.120
and what had happened was
that the Russians had promised

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.330
to come in and help
Czechoslovakia

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.920
if it were invaded
if the French lived

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.370
up to their obligations
to do so.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.160
The French didn't, and so the
Russians had an excuse, --

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.460
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.760
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- and so during the war,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.590
when the Nazis had taken over
and the government in exile was

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.680
in London, the Russians,
in the meanwhile --

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.200
and the communists were
really the fighters --

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.500
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.800
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- in Czechoslovakia.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.510
So after the war, and too
complicated to discuss all

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.470
of it, but what happened: In
the first Czechoslovak elections

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.090
in 1946, the communists actually
won, and so what happened

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.890
within a -- until February 1948,

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.880
there was a coalition
government,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.520
and there were going
to be new elections.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.780
The Russians were trying to
figure out how to take over all

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.220
of eastern Europe, and
they were going to do it

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.400
by elections in Czechoslovakia.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.540
They saw they were going to
lose, and so there was a coup.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.240
So what happened was
my father had come back

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.220
to Czechoslovakia after the war.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.190
He was made ambassador
to Yugoslavia.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.980
The little girl in the national
costume that gives flowers

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.560
at the airport -- that's
what I did for a living,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.370
and then he was about
to get a new assignment,

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.140
because he was a
professional diplomat,

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.730
to be Czechoslovakia's
representative

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.500
on a new commission to do
with India and Pakistan

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.570
over cashmere, and he was
looking forward to that

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.060
when the communists took over.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.340
He didn't want to work
for the communists.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.700
His best friends in
Belgrade were the British

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.490
and American ambassadors,
and they said,

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.160
"If your country's just
had a coup, if you resign,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.980
they'll name some communist
and nothing will get done,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.280
so why don't you report to us?"

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.200
and my father agreed to do that,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.390
and we came to the
United States --

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.690
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.990
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: As a
result of that assignment,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.250
my father defected and
asked for political asylum.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.060
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Was it
hard to get political asylum?

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.370
Were immigrants welcome then?

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.670
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Yes, they were.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.670
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And I do
have to say the following thing.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:19.600
My father used to say
this on a regular basis.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.650
He said when we were in
England during the war --

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.380
and by the way, I was
there all through the Blitz

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.440
and everything, and
so my father said,

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.740
"The British were very nice.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.640
They said, 'We're so sorry
your country's been taken

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.830
over by a terrible dictator.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.130
You're welcome here.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.990
What can we do to help you
and when are you going home?'"

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.240
When we came to the
United States, people said,

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.260
"We're so sorry your
country's been taken

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.180
over by a terrible system.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.480
You're welcome here.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.710
What can we do to help you and
when will you become a citizen?"

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.010
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Yeah.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.310
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.610
And my father said that's
what made America different --

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:51.910
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.710
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
from every other country.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:23:01.050
[ Applause ]

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.350
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
As a little girl,

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.650
I assume you spoke Czech.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.950
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: I did.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.250
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And you still speak it?

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.550
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
I do speak Czech.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.850
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But your English.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.330
You have no non-American accent,

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.630
so how did you get
this American --

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.930
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Oh, well, now let me --

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.050
so what happened is
I grew up bilingual,

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.660
and so I spoke Czech
and English.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.290
Then we went to Yugoslavia when
my father was the ambassador,

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.540
so I certainly could
understand --

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.840
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.140
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.440
Serbian, and then
because I had --

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.360
I had a governess because my
father didn't want me going

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.320
to school with communists,
so I got ahead of myself.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.920
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And
in Europe, you can't go

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.990
to the next level until you're
a certain age, so they decided

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.540
to send me to Switzerland
to learn French.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.820
I went to -- I didn't
speak any French.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.340
They wouldn't feed me unless I
asked for it in French, so --

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Jeez.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.940
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- I learned French.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.140
So then we came to the United
States on November 11th, 1948,

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.060
and we lived on Long
Island, and I went to school,

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.560
and it was about
to be Thanksgiving,

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.660
and I heard somebody -- you
know, we gather together,

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.200
et cetera -- "osking" [phonetic
spelling] for God's blessing,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.730
and I thought, "Who's osking?"

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.020
and I was osking, and
from then on, I asked.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.320
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.620
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
And so I have --

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.920
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
We got it.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.220
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- an American accent.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.520
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: But
your father eventually moved

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.820
to Denver.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.120
He became a professor at
the University of Denver.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.420
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.720
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And he
had a prized student who was --

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.020
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.320
Well, I have to -- this
story is so unbelievable.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.920
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.220
What happened was my father
did defect, and he asked

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.520
for political asylum,
and at that stage,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.360
the Rockefeller Foundation
was finding jobs

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.930
for central European
intellectuals or whatever,

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.460
so they found him a job at
the University of Denver,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.370
and we had no idea
where Denver was,

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.500
and my parents bought a car.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.790
We started driving across
America, and my mother said,

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.690
"They say Denver's the mile-high
city, but we're not going up,

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.320
so maybe we're going
the wrong direction."

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.240
Anyway, we end up in Denver,
and my father starts teaching

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.870
at the University of Denver,
and he became a pretty big deal.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.380
He wrote books and was
a popular professor.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.100
He died in 1977, and there were
lots of flowers and tributes,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.840
and among them was a ceramic
pot in the shape of a piano

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.550
with just some leaves in it.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.980
So I said to my mother,
"Where did this come from?"

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.300
and she said, "It's from your
father's favorite student,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.490
Condoleezza Rice," so.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.790
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:24.520
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Her
parents had an association --

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.820
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.120
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
with the University of Denver.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.830
She was a music major,
hence the piano,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.400
and she had to take an
international relations course

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.700
or distribution --

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.000
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.300
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- or something.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.690
She took one from my
father, and he persuaded her

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.510
to become an international
relations major.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.670
She then went to Notre Dame,
where she got her master's,

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.280
and she was working on her PhD
with my father when he died.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.430
So this African-American
music major

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.050
from Alabama wrote
her dissertation

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.680
on the Czechoslovak military.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.980
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Wow.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.260
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: So then
in 1987, when I was working

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.890
for my long list of losing
democratic presidential

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.900
candidates, I was working
for Michael Dukakis

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.020
and finding foreign
policy advisors.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.320
So I didn't know Condi,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.670
but I knew she was a
Soviet expert women taught

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.260
on the west coast,
so I called her up,

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.520
and I told her what I was doing,
that I was looking for experts,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.440
and she said, "Madeleine, I
don't know how to tell you this,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.520
but I'm a Republican," and I
said, "Condi, how could you be?

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.820
We have the same father."

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.590
But it is a remarkable story, --

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.890
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Wow.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.190
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.130
that this Czechoslovak refugee
diplomat basically trained two

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.430
secretaries of state.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Whatever happened to her?

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.030
Do you know?

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.330
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: ?No.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.630
We're very good friends.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So let's
go back to your life story.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.550
So you go to Wellesley,
graduate, and in those days,

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.630
when you graduated
from Wellesley,

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.540
most women were not
expected to be secretary

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.270
of state, I assume, right.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.580
Probably not.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.880
So what did you do?

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.290
What was your career/

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.590
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.220
let me just say I clearly
love foreign policy.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.420
We never had any choice at our
house talking about anything

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.990
but history, diplomatic
history, or foreign policy.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.730
I was going to be a
journalist, but the thing

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:12.280
that happened was our graduation
speaker was Neil McElroy,

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.870
who was the secretary
of defense,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.210
because his daughter
was in our class,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.760
and he gave the commencement
speech in which --

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.720
we all remember it
slightly differently,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.260
but it basically was your
main duty is to get married

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.050
and raise children,
preferably sons.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.000
The fact that we
didn't walk out --

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.300
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.600
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Anyway,
so I waited a really long time

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.470
to get married, two
days after graduation.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.880
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And I
did want to be a journalist.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.700
I'd been one of the
editors of my college paper,

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.780
and my husband, while he
was in the Army in Missouri,

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:49.150
I worked for a small paper in
Missouri, and then we go back

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.520
to Chicago, where he already had
a job, and we're having dinner

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.920
with his managing editor,
who looks at me and says,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.860
"So what are you
going to do, honey?"

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.960
I said, "I'm going to
work to be journalist,"

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.990
and he said, "I don't think so.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.370
You can't work on the
same paper as your husband

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.450
because of labor regulations,"

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.880
and even though there were
three other papers in Chicago

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.270
at the time, he said, "And
you wouldn't want to compete

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.500
with your husband, so go
find something else to do."

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:19.280
It was, you know,
1960, and I saluted,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.580
and I found another job.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.890
I went to work for
Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.590
which for the younger people
in the audience is a book.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: It
was the Wikipedia of its day.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.420
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah,
but what they did that was kind

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.770
of fun was every year, they
would choose a set of articles

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.930
to review, and that year, they
were geographical locations,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.230
and being a poli sci,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:45.050
they thought I could choose
the illustrations for that.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:47.390
So I did that, and then
it used to be newspapers,

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.030
when they had a little space
at the bottom of columns,

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.940
needed factoids, so I read
Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.220
and I still remember things
like ostriches are voiceless,

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.720
according to encyclopedia.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:03.870
But anyway, then what happened
was I was pregnant, and we moved

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.340
to Long Island, and this was
before sonograms and everything,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.670
and I got very fat, and
the doctors kept saying,

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:13.970
"You're fat.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.350
Do something," so I drank
horrible diet Metrecals

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.480
and things like that and walked
around Long Island a lot,

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.360
and I saw that somebody
was going --

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.550
that they were offering
a Russian course

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.480
at Hofstra University, and I
thought this will never work,

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.140
because I have to have the --

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.510
yeah, my child will
not be born yet.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.980
What happened was
I was having twins.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.410
They were born early.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.760
I had to leave them in the
hospital in the incubators,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.320
so I took Russian,
and that is how I kind

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.330
of got back into studying.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.460
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Well, you ultimately worked

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.790
on Capitol Hill for
Senator Muskie.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.090
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: I did.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.390
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: How
did you happen to get that job?

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:58.000
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
what happened was that I had --

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.350
my whole life is a
series of accidents --

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.160
-- that actually worked out.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.310
So what happened was that I
was asked to become chairman

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.610
of a school here in --

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.400
a chairman of the board of
a school here in Washington,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.890
and they put me in charge of
annual giving, and the person

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:20.340
that was my parent
partner in this knew

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.050
that I'd raised a lot of money.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.660
He was from the state of
Maine, and he was asked to put

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.630
on the biggest fund-raising
dinner ever in Washington.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.930
It was really, really expensive.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:35.880
You'll love this,
David -- $125 a seat.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:41.490
So he asked me to
chair it, which I did,

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.140
and that's how I got
to know Ed Muskie,

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:51.330
and then I did fund-raising for
Ed Muskie, and ultimately, --

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.630
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.930
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -- he
asked me to come on as staff.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.230
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right,
so you work on Muskie's staff,

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.830
and you did that for a
while, but ultimately,

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.550
Jimmy Carter became president
of the United States,

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.050
and Zbig Brzezinski became
his national security advisor,

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.220
and you knew him from Columbia,

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.690
because you had gotten
a degree at Columbia.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.990
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:10.290
He was my professor, yes.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.590
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So he asked you to come

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:12.890
on the White House
staff and serve

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.150
as the congressional liaison
for the national security staff.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.450
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:18.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: But
why would the national security

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.050
staff need a congressional
liaison?

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.350
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
It's all your fault.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.650
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:23.950
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.250
So the thing that happened --

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:26.550
Brzezinski had been my
professor, and he calls me

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.430
in January whatever, '80.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: '77.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.170
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: '77,
and he said, "Madeleine,

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.330
perhaps you've heard I've
been named national security

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.650
advisor," and I said, "Yes,
I have," and he said, "Well,

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.970
can you find me a
place to live?"

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.540
and said, "Jeez, Big, I
thought you were calling

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.950
to offer me a job," and he said,
"No, I'm calling to ask you

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.220
to find me a place to
live," which I did,

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:53.110
and then two years later, we
had become really good friends,

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:58.860
and he asked me to come and be a
congressional relations person.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.060
So thing that happened
-- I loved Ed Muskie,

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.890
and I loved everything about
him, but he wasn't very modern

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.590
in his language or his
comprehension of certain things.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:12.110
So I said I had this job
offer, and he said, "Madeleine,

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.260
you know, a woman can't do
congressional relations,"

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.660
which I thought was
very disappointing.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.140
Anyway, I went to do
congressional relations,

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.860
and I do have to
tell this story.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.700
Muskie was clearly embarrassed,

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.960
and we then have a huge going
away party he gives for me,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.600
and he says, "I'm looking
out at my staff now,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.950
and I see that I have a
lot of women on my staff,

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.810
but Madeleine was special
because she was the first one

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.510
to give sex to the office,"
and I said, "Gender, gender."

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:48.770
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.070
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Well, so.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.370
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
But I do want

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.670
to say what happened,
actually, --

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:57.480
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -- is
that the NSC is not supposed

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.670
to have a congressional
relations person,

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:03.440
and as you know, the White House
has a whole congressional group

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.720
to it, and one of the
things that was going

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.480
on was the whole issue
about the Panama Canal

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:14.270
and also a Middle East arms
sale, and Brzezinski felt

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:18.460
that some of the White House
congressional people were not

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.550
tuned enough into the national
security aspects of it,

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.210
and so he asked me to come on,
and it was a fantastic job.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.510
I loved it.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.530
I sat in on everyone meeting
that President Carter had

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:36.500
with members of Congress,
and I loved it, and I worked

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.800
on all kinds of issues.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.100
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.400
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And I was
known as somebody who knew less

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.380
about more subjects than
anybody else in the government.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.680
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Oh.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.980
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
You know, so I loved it.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.280
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So now in those days,

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.580
it was pretty well known
that Zbig Brzezinski,

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.600
the national security advisor,
and the secretary of state,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.690
Certainly Vance, didn't
get along, particularly

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.330
in terms of their philosophy.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:57.520
Then Vance resigned after the
failed hostage rescue effort,

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.260
and the next secretary of state
was a man named Edmund Muskie.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.560
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Right.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.860
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
you have your former boss

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.670
as secretary, your current boss
as national security advisor.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.160
They maybe didn't
get along so well,

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.790
so what was that job like then?

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.090
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, I have to tell you.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.720
It was very interesting, because
I really had stayed very,

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.000
very good friends with Muskie
and was close to Brzezinski.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.730
So this really did happen.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.290
Muskie calls me up, and he says,

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.860
"Your boss is just
such a show-off.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.160
It's so awful.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.630
Every time we're
in the Oval Office,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.720
he tells President Carter the
name of every tribe in Nigeria,"

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.430
and I said, "He's a professor.

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:35.830
That's what they do."

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.630
So then what happened was
Brzezinski called me up,

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.100
and he said, "Your
former boss is impossible

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.550
in principles meetings.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.400
All he does is ask questions,"
and I said, "He's a senator.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.080
That's what they do."

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.880
But something that
I could not get

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.680
over was Muskie finally calls
me and he says, "I have had it.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.270
Your boss acts as if he's
more Polish than I am."

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:58.620
I said, "He is.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.500
He has two Polish parents.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.800
He speaks Polish.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.340
You do not," and I thought
I could never have dealt

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.750
with a second term, ever.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.170
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,
you had those two bosses

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.890
that didn't get along, but
there was a third person

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.680
who was your boss, and at that
point, Jimmy Carter was seeking

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.470
to get the nomination
of the party again, --

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.770
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:21.500
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: --
1980, and Ed Muskie as secretary

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.340
of state is maybe
flirting with the idea

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.640
that he might get
the nomination.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.940
Wasn't that kind of complicated?

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.240
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
No, but the truth is

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.540
that Ed Muskie wasn't.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.670
It's just that you and
the Carter people --

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Oh.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.370
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
were suspicious of that,

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.900
because the thing that was
very interesting was --

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.330
I will never forget.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.020
I have to add one
other part to this.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.800
I had decided that my job,
going to the White House,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.060
they had never taken
Muskie very seriously

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.890
when I went there initially,
and I wanted everybody

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:54.360
to know what a really
loyal, good Democrat,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.180
and head of the budget committee

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.110
and the whole Panama
Canal thing,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.810
and I talked him
up an awful lot.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:03.250
So one time, we needed to
have a co-del go to China.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.550
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.850
Co-del being a congressional
delegation?

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.150
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: A
congressional delegation

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.660
to China, and Frank
Moore, who was in charge

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.700
of the whole congressional
aspect, went along,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.970
and Brzezinski asked me to go on
the trip, and so it was great,

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:22.060
and Frank got to know Ed Muskie.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:27.560
Anyway, we were then giving a
birthday party for Ed Muskie,

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.400
and all of a sudden,
Frank says, "Guess what?

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.720
President Carter's coming
to this birthday party,"

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.330
and I thought only
of myself, which was,

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.140
"Everybody in the Muskie office
thinks I went to the White House

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.570
to have a really important job,
and President Carter's going

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.580
to come in, and he
won't recognize me."

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.680
So anyway, he does come
in, he does recognize me,

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.810
and that all went to my head,
and so I said, "Mr. President,

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.500
can we have a picture of you
and me and Senator Muskie?"

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.200
He said sure, so
we're standing there,

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.260
and President Carter
actually said to Ed Muskie,

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.920
"If Madeleine loves me half
as much as she loves you,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.130
I'm glad she's working for me."

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:11.910
So then what happens is when
Muskie's announced as secretary

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:15.260
of state, we're in the
cabinet room, and I'm sitting

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.020
in the back, and President
Carter comes over to me,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.470
and he said, "Are you pleased?"

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.320
and I said, "Very
pleased," and I said,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.340
"Perhaps you don't
remember where I came from,"

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.890
and he said, "Of course I do.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.980
Don't you remember
the birthday party?"

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.820
But the bottom line was, we
were all in the cabinet room,

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.530
and Ed Muskie was in the press
room already beginning to talk,

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.790
and you could see the Carter
people getting slightly nervous

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.920
about that he had different
skills, and people did think

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.450
that he was, but I
think he was not --

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Wasn't?

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.050
Okay.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:46.350
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- trying to run.

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.650
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
we lost the election in 1980.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.950
You had to go back and
get a different living.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:50.250
You became a professor
at Georgetown.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.100
You got involved with a few
campaigns that didn't make it.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.400
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.700
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
then Bill Clinton gets elected

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.340
in 1992, and were you
close to Bill Clinton?

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.640
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.070
The interesting part was I
didn't know Bill Clinton until,

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.300
well, he was governor
of Arkansas and he came

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:11.000
up to Boston to help prepare
Michael Dukakis for the debates,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.280
and we then kind of sat around
for a while, and I discovered

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.230
about his Georgetown -- he
had been a Georgetown student,

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.250
and I kind of got to know him.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:22.730
The only campaign I never
worked in was Bill Clinton's,

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.640
because at that time, I was
also president of the Center

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.470
for National Policy,
which was a 501(c)(3),

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:33.920
and Bill Clinton had his
brain trust, and I didn't,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.590
but what happened was, and
this is the story of life,

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.340
is one of my students,
Nancy Soderbergh,

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.810
was doing the transition.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.660
She put my name in with a
bunch of other names of people

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.490
that could in fact be
in the administration.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.980
I have the memo.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.500
He checked my name off,
and then Sandy Berger,

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.130
who had been a very good friend,
asked me to run the transition

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.230
for the Clintons with the
National Security Council.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.530
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:02.830
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: So I
was the first Clinton person

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.940
to actually go back to the White
House, and then he asked me

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.810
to be ambassador to
the United Nations.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.090
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So you
became the ambassador to the UN.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.080
There had been a woman who
had had that position before.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.380
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Jean Kirkpatrick.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.680
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Jean Kirkpatrick,

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.990
but no woman had ever
been secretary of state.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.690
When Clinton is reelected,

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.120
Warren Christopher
says I'm going to step

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.640
down as secretary of state.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.430
So were you number-one choice?

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.000
Were you number-two choice?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.910
How did you get that position?

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.440
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
first of all, one of the things

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.000
that does happen when you're
ambassador at the UN --

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.420
I was a cabinet member as well
as on the principles committee,

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:43.720
and I also was on
TV some, and also,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.190
President Clinton was fantastic
in terms of the meetings

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:50.210
that we had in the Oval
or the cabinet room,

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:52.400
and he always was interested
in what I was doing.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:58.210
So all of a sudden, because
Christopher had said he wasn't

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.050
going to stay, the moment --

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.880
-- of the great mentioning went
on, and my name was on a list,

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.070
and so somebody said well, a
woman couldn't be secretary

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:11.440
of state because Arabs
wouldn't deal with a woman,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.120
but the Arab ambassadors at
the UN kind of got together

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.250
and said well, we've
had no problems dealing

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.640
with Ambassador Albright.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.850
We wouldn't have problems
dealing with Secretary Albright.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.780
So that went away, and then
somebody at the White House,

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.020
and I never want to
know who, said yes,

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.360
Madeleine's on the list,
but she's second-tier,

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.790
so I truly did not expect it.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:38.490
So what happens is I'm up
in New York on December 5th

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:42.240
and I get a call from Erskine
Bowles saying if the president

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.540
of the United States --

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.840
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
He was the chief of staff?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.140
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Chief of staff.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.440
He said if the president
of the United States were

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.960
to call you tomorrow,
would you take the call?

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.260
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Yes.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.120
You said what time?

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.420
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.720
Oh, yeah, and then he
said if the president

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.020
of the United States were
to ask you to be secretary

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.690
of state, would you say yes?

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.490
So I obviously said yes.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.390
He said well, go
back to Washington.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.890
The president will call
you in the morning.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:08.080
So I was so freaked out
that I asked Elaine Shocas,

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.830
who was my chief of
staff, to stay with me,

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:12.680
and then I forgot I was
dealing with President Clinton,

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.970
that the phone call
wouldn't come early,

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:18.080
but I'm sitting there
in my pink bathrobe.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.640
You know, no phone
call, no phone call.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.710
So finally, around 9:30, quarter
until 10:00, the phone rings,

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.100
and it's the White House
operator saying hold

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.450
for the president of the United
States, and then they put

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.750
on some horrible music,

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:34.830
and I was sure he had changed
his mind, but he hadn't.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: He
hadn't, so you got the job.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:37.470
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And so
I became secretary of state.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.280
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And as secretary of state

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.050
for four years, what
was the highlight

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.100
in your view of what you did?

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.730
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
first of all, I loved the job.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.440
I really and in every way, and
the people that I worked with

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.240
and every part of it,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:55.090
and I think the highlight was
being able to make a difference

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:59.390
in terms of how America used
its power, and one of the issues

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:02.120
that we were very,
very concerned

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.680
with was what was
happening in the Balkans,

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.170
and the weirdest part of my
life is that I actually --

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:12.980
just to go back, my father
had been ambassador there.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.790
I understand Serbian.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:18.710
I had been around all these
places, and all of a sudden,

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.870
I'm dealing with a
part of the world

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:25.110
that I really understood
very deeply, and to tie it

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.310
to what happened today,
I just saw Senator Dole,

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:32.390
and he is also one of the
people, and at that stage,

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.620
Senator Biden, that
had really cared

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.450
about what we were
doing in the Balkans.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:40.330
And so when people ask me
what I'm really proudest of,

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:44.600
I thought it took us too long to
do Bosnia, but I was secretary

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.740
when Kosovo happened, and we
were able to make a difference.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.040
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.440
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And
I think that being able

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.930
to understand what the US can
do in cooperation with others --

00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.230
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.530
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
makes a huge difference.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.940
That's why I'm so upset
about the way that this --

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.200
and again, to go back
to the funeral today,

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:10.170
and I think I do have this in
common with Senator McCain --

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.670
is understanding what
this country is about

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.640
and what our role in the world
can and should be and how

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.520
in partnership with others,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.730
American involvement
can make a difference

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.110
for most people in the world.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.410
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.210
So in your --

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:30.970
[ Applause ]

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:35.010
In your book -- in your book,
you talk about people that,

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:38.540
if not fascists, are
totalitarian leaders now.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.240
Let's go through some of
them that you've dealt with.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.270
Why don't we start
with North Korea?

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:48.070
You were, I think, the first
US secretary of state to go

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.670
to North Korea, and you
met with Kim Jong-Il, --

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:52.970
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -Il.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.980
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: -- who
was the father of Kim Jong-Un,

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.060
and what was that
experience like?

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.360
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, first of all,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.590
let me say that a Korean
problem, it's been going

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.050
since the end of World War Two,

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:07.160
and there is no peace
treaty after that was.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.460
I don't know.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.760
I think you've been

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.080
to the demilitarized zone,
and people here have.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.660
It's the weirdest
place in the world,

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.710
on the 38th parallel
dividing the two Koreas,

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:20.260
and the Clinton administration,
there were issues about Korea

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.320
from the very beginning.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.700
They were signatories of the
non-proliferation treaty.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.660
They were threatening
to pull out.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.330
We made a number of different
agreements with them.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.320
They didn't live up
to parts of them.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.630
We didn't deliver some

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.890
of the things we were
supposed to quickly enough.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:42.010
So in the summer of 2000,
there began to be an interest.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.460
President Clinton had
gotten very interested

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.760
in what was going on.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.810
He'd actually asked former
secretary of defense Bill Perry

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:52.440
to do a total review of
our North Korea policy,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.000
and Bill Perry had gone there
first and said this is kind

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.670
of fork-in-the-road time.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:02.300
You can either negotiate or
we will use force against you,

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.250
because they were threatening
with their ballistic missiles,

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.390
and they chose the negotiating.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.060
So the number-two guy, Vice
Marshall Cho, came over,

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.250
and we went over
to the Oval Office,

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.440
and just as what
happened recently,

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.210
Vice Marshall Cho gave an
invitation to President Clinton

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:22.380
to come to North Korea, and
President Clinton said well,

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.320
maybe at some point, but this
has to be prepared, so I'm going

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.220
to send the secretary of state.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.560
They weren't real
thrilled about that.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.360
Because we don't have
an embassy there,

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:35.420
I had no idea what was going to
happen, but I ended up having --

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:40.240
and by the way, we had a --
our intelligence was very,

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.320
very limited on North Korea.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.080
We were told that Kim Jong-Il
was crazy and a pervert.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.510
He was not crazy.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.700
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.830
And we were able to have --

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:57.540
and I didn't know what
I was going to do there.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.630
So I get there, and all of
a sudden, I get a message --

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.570
by the way, you stay in a guest
house that's completely --

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.650
they've got cameras, and
they're listening to you,

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.490
and even if you type on
a computer, they can tell

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:09.790
by the strokes what
you're doing.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.960
So we're sitting there, and I
get a message that I have to go

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.870
and pay my respects to his
embalmed father, so I go

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.620
and I do that, and it's more
complicated than meets the eye,

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.860
because if you bow too low,

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.250
then you're criticized
for being obsequious.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:28.680
If you don't bow low enough, you
haven't accomplished anything.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.290
So I must have had
the right angle, --

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:31.590
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:32.890
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
because all of a sudden,

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:36.300
we get there, and
I am called to say

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.070
that the Dear Leader would have
a press conference with me,

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:40.890
and I'm standing next to him,

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:44.030
and I see that we're the same
height, and I had on high heels

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:48.830
and so did he, and his
hair was poofier than mine,

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.790
but the bottom line is
that we've actually managed

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:53.090
to begin discussions --

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:54.390
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:55.690
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- about missile limits,

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.850
and then what happened
was the election of 2000,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:02.640
and Americans were confused
about the election of 2000.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.760
Certainly the North
Koreans were.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.230
And Colin Powell was prepared
to continue what we were doing,

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:11.180
and he got -- there was
a headline in the Post

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.910
that said Powell to continue
Clinton policies on North Korea.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.260
He gets hauled into the
Oval and told no way.

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.660
And so we've had these
ups and downs with them,

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.390
and they're dangerous,
and by the way,

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.860
according to my description
of what fascism is,

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.760
Kim Jong-Un is a fascist.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.000
What he has done is
use violence and force

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.740
against his own people.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:38.170
He has obviously
disrespected laws or any freedom

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.520
of the press, and so I am very
worried about where this --

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.820
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.120
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- is going.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.420
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.720
Let's talk about somebody
else you've dealt with

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.020
and you write about,
which is Putin.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.210
You think he'll be
there for life?

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:52.600
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
he's planned it that way.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:58.310
I think that the issue there
is that -- and again, if I --

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.820
one of the things that
I did in the '90s was

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.230
when I was a professor and it
was the end of the Cold War,

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.590
I went and I did a survey
across all of Europe

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:12.540
about how countries felt after
that, including Russia, Ukraine,

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:17.060
and Lithuania, and we had
very detailed questionnaires,

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.830
but also focus groups.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.620
And something I'll never
forget was a focus group

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.880
that we had outside of
Moscow, and this man stands up

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.020
and says I'm so embarrassed.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.830
We used to be a superpower,
and now we're Bangladesh

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:33.680
with missiles, and there
was this kind of sense

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.570
that they had lost their
identity completely.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:37.950
During the Clinton
administration,

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:41.330
we really did try to figure
out how to respect Russia

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:45.360
and bring them into the system
a number of different ways,

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.860
but what happened is that
Putin identified with that man

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:54.200
who felt that Russia had
lost its status and all that,

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.970
and so despite the fact that
their economy is not great,

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.130
he seems to be maintaining power

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:03.650
by in fact raising
this issue again --

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.950
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.250
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- of Russia's greatness.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:10.190
And so the thing that we can't
forget is Putin is a KGB agent,

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.350
and he has played a weak
hand very, very well,

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:17.850
and what he is doing is
systematically working

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:22.660
to separate us from our allies,
and part of the story then goes

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.500
to something I was
talking about in my book --

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.880
is the other example
of somebody that is

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.030
under his influence is Orban,
who is the Hungarian leader,

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.900
who also has fascist
tendencies and the polls,

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.730
and so he is trying to separate
us and undermine our democracy

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.750
and separate us from our allies.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.070
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Do you have any doubt

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.840
that they interfered
with our elections?

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.140
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: I
have no doubt about it.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.440
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.740
And do you think they might
be tempted to do it again?

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.360
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yes,
I do, which is why I think

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.480
that we need to be very
clear about how we deal

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.190
with all of this and, if I --

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.230
-- can say it this
way, separate it

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:05.960
as to whether President
Trump was elected or not.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.870
I mean the bottom line is the
Russians are doing something

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:13.190
here to undermine us.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:14.600
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.000
two other people
you write about.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.120
I want to cover them quickly
before we get to the conclusion.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:25.240
Erdogan of Turkey -- he's become
what you might call a dictator,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.540
a totalitarian dictator.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.840
I don't want to put
words in your mouth,

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.140
but what do you think
about him now?

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.440
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
I think the other thing,

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.460
and I really do think it's
important to go back and look

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:39.190
at again the context
of how these kinds

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.610
of leaders become
authoritarian and dictatorial,

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.150
and partially is that there are
conditions in these countries

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:50.480
that lead to divisions between
the haves and the have-nots,

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.060
and you either have a leader who
can try to find common ground

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.410
or a leader who then
exacerbates these divisions.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.730
Now what was interesting about
Turkey, and I have always kind

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.400
of seen myself as a Turkophile,
a fascinating country

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.690
that is located in an
incredible place --

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:10.080
by the way, I took my
grandchildren there several

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.660
years ago, and my granddaughter,
who was nine at the time,

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.510
said I understand Turkey
completely; we spent the night

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.400
in Europe and had lunch in
Asia, and that is definitely --

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.700
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.370
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -- a
very apt description of Turkey.

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.340
What had happened was
the country had been run

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.160
by elitists and/or
had military coups.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.460
Erdogan had actually the
first time been elected fair

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:38.080
and square because he
broadened the constituency

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.490
so that he was dealing with a
lot of people that had been left

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:44.150
out and he delivered
constituent --

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.450
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:46.750
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- services.

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.250
I think, you know, something
went to his head in terms

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:54.950
of taking overall power, and he
has now, I think, the tendencies

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.010
which are the kind
that are the --

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:58.310
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.610
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.020
chicken-plucking in terms
of really identifying

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.140
with one group, isolating
himself, and then he also --

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:08.170
the international aspect of
what the Turks are doing is

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.470
very dangerous.

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:10.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So you also write

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:12.330
about somebody who's
not with us any longer,

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.490
Chavez, but his successor is.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:15.790
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:18.250
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: How does
Venezuela stay afloat right now,

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.040
because there's so
many problems there?

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.090
How come the government
managed to stay in power,

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.940
and where does all
that oil revenue go?

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.690
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well, I
think one of the things again

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:29.280
that has to be looked
at, back at conditions.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.970
I went. When we were in office,

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.470
I'd go to Caracas
fairly frequently.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.720
The place was run by a
bunch of tired old men

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.780
that had absolutely
no relationship

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.430
with the indigenous peoples
or with the poorer people.

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:46.000
What happened was Chavez, who
had attempted a coup earlier

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.380
and was a charismatic figure,
all of a sudden takes over.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.780
He came to the United States.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.640
When President Clinton
and I first met with him,

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.470
he seemed like somebody
that cared about his people.

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.250
He was going to use
the oil revenue --

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.550
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.850
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:02.150
in order to create a
poor people's fund.

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.450
Then also something
went to his head

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:07.000
and he becomes this
authoritarian dictator.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.350
I don't know what happened
to the oil revenues.

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.230
I think that they are --
there's an incredible amount

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.530
of corruption.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.160
Chavez, I think there
was a lot of stealing,

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.920
and then Maduro now --

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.220
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.520
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- has kind of --

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.820
and watching the pictures
now in terms of the numbers

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:27.910
of people emigrating and out
into Central America is just --

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:30.040
I mean it's a disaster,
no question.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.100
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So we
talked about some of the people

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.580
that might not be,
you know, in your hall

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.280
of fame for great leaders.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.800
Who would you say of
the people you dealt

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.690
with when you were secretary
of state, UN ambassador,

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:43.810
or since then were the most
impressive foreign policy

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.420
leaders you've ever dealt with?

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.050
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, I think that I have

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:51.320
to say the Germans have been
very impressive political

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.300
leaders, certainly Kohl.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.800
What was interesting
was I met Angela Merkel

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.570
when she had just
taken the party over

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.830
and she seemed very quiet and
meek, and all of a sudden,

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.430
she's the chancellor,
and I think --

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:04.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.030
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
she is very impressive.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:08.690
I very much enjoyed my --

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.450
the people that I worked with
were a lot of foreign ministers,

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.620
and some of them were
truly remarkable, and we --

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.280
by the way, I invented
something really modern

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.580
when I was secretary of state.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:22.170
It was the international
telephone conference call,

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.470
and so --

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:26.070
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
during the war in Kosova,

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.030
every single day, I spoke to
what is known as the quin,

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:32.750
the British Robin Cooke, the
Germans' Joschka Fischer,

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.720
the French Hubert Vedrine,
the Italian Lamberto Dini

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.210
and I spoke every single
day, and when we left office,

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:42.760
all of us, what happened
was that I get a call

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.020
from Robin Cooke, who was
also out of the government

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.750
and had just become head
of the European Socialists,

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.900
and he said Madeleine,
they're saying terrible things

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.660
about the US; do something, and
then I got another phone call

00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.510
from another former foreign
minister saying you have

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:59.970
to do something, and I didn't
have any way of doing that,

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.000
so I needed a group cover,

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.310
and so it's under
the auspice of Aspen.

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:05.970
We have just met again.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:10.030
Its official name is the
Aspen Ministers Forum.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.630
It's unofficial name is
Madeline and her exes,

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:15.500
and we have now met --

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:16.800
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.100
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -- 20
times, and they are people

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:24.700
that understood how the regional
and multilateral system worked

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.810
in partnership, and really,
we cared about what was going

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:32.050
on in other parts of the
world, and so those are some

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.580
of the most impressive people --

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.550
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: -- I
ever met, and then there's some

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.390
that really -- you
know, Kim Dae-Jung,

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:40.100
who had been the president

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.460
of South Korea, was
very impressive.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.760
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Now you met with --

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.560
I wouldn't say impressive
or not impressive.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.010
What's your reaction or
relationship was to Arafat?

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.100
You met with Arafat,
negotiated with him.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:52.530
What was that like?

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:54.660
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well, I
have to say if I were to look

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.650
out at this audience,
hey, anybody wants to go

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:59.320
to Camp David, you'd
probably say yes.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.140
I can tell you after two weeks
in the rain with the Israelis

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.880
and Palestinians, I don't
care if I ever go back.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.180
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:10.310
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: But
I think that Arafat was --

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:12.480
I got to know him very
well, and I won't go

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.590
through all the stories, but
basically, he was somebody

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:22.820
that always saw himself as a
freedom fighter and not anybody

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:26.330
that could kind of -- and he
was feted all over the world,

00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:28.860
and it was certainly more
interesting than worrying

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.390
about the sewer system in Gaza,

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:35.660
and I think that while we came
very close at Camp David to --

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:36.960
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.260
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.560
decisions, I thought
he was incapable

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.860
of making the decision, so.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.160
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.850
So let's talk about your
book the time we have left.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:47.010
In the end of your
book, you're trying

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:49.050
to draw these various
strands together.

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:52.250
So the lessons that you
want people to take away

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.780
from all these people
that became fascists

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:58.460
or ran their country in an
authoritarian way is what?

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.130
What is the danger that you're
worried about in your book?

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:02.430
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
Well, first of all,

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:06.270
let me just say again to
this that, to just repeat,

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:07.580
societies are divided.

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.520
There's no question.

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.130
Now they are divided.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:12.890
By the way, I was going to
write this book no matter

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:15.970
who had gotten elected,
because I really did see

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:18.190
that there were divisions,

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:21.820
some caused by technological
revolution

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.820
and people losing their jobs and
a number of different aspects,

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.290
and that what was
needed was to figure

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:29.590
out how the social
contract really worked.

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:32.260
You know, who did -- what
were the responsibilities

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.560
of the government?

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.210
What were the responsibilities
of the citizens?

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:40.420
And so I felt that what
needed to be done is

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.840
to explain how we try to find
common ground and not divide up.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.410
So the thing that is common
to the fascists or those

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:51.340
that have -- by the way,
I don't call an awful lot

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.640
of people fascists.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.560
I say they are authoritarian
dictators

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.150
with certain tendencies,
and the way

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:01.190
to describe fascism is
it's not an ideology.

00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:04.830
It's a system for taking
over, and the simplest way

00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:10.120
to describe it, it is when the
leader decides to align himself

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:17.750
with -- it's a him, always --
with a tribal group, you know,

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:21.770
really this particular
group against the others,

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:25.250
so that it is favoritism
of one group and leaving

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.060
out the others, and
then the thing

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.790
that actually makes
somebody a fascist is

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:32.180
if you use violence
against the people.

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:36.380
So it's a bully with an
army, but what are the things

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:39.040
that I'm looking at are the
following or what are the steps

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.490
that lead to this, which
is one, majority rule

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:44.160
without minority rights.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.240
That is what Viktor Orban
calls illiberal democracy,

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:51.180
which is kind of real oxymoron.

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:52.780
And so there's that.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.040
There is no respect
for any institutions.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.850
There is no respect for
the role of the media,

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:02.350
which is required
in a democracy.

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:05.210
There is no sense about
how the law works.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:11.010
And so I am calling out what
some of the tendencies are,

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:14.530
and I think that it's
very important, --

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:15.830
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:17.130
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:18.430
and what the feathers are
that are being plucked,

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:21.500
and so I am -- some people
say my book is alarmist.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.440
It is supposed to be alarmist,
and so one of the things

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.530
that I'm doing now is, you know,
we have this thing that we say,

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:29.610
see something, say something.

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:32.620
I have added do something,
and I think we have to --

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:33.920
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.220
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
-- call out what it is.

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:36.520
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
All right.

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.730
So well, let's talk
about doing something.

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:43.500
You are a former
secretary of state.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.800
What do you do now?

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.100
Do you teach?

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.400
Are you writing books?

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.700
What are you doing at NDI?

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:50.630
What is your main
activities now?

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:51.930
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
A little bit of every --

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:53.350
you know, there are
people who think I'm crazy,

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:56.150
but the bottom line
is I do things

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:57.750
that I think fit together.

00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:59.050
I do teach.

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:00.350
I teach at Georgetown.

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:04.190
And I say foreign
policy is just trying

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.720
to get some country
to do what you want.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.020
That's all it is.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.320
So what are the tools?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.240
So my course is called the
National Security Toolbox.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.540
I am chairman of the board

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:14.340
of the National Democratic
Institute.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.570
That is, you can't
impose democracy.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:20.250
You have to support
it where you can.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.870
I do write books.

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:23.170
I give speeches.

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.470
I have a global consulting --

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:25.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:27.100
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
firm, and I try to kind of --

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.900
one thing leads to another.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.750
I do a variety of task
forces, and I try very hard

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.670
in everything I do to
do bipartisan activity.

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:39.440
I have spent a lot of time

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.690
with Steve Hadley doing a
big study on the Middle East.

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:46.400
We are doing something now
together at the US Institute

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.820
of Peace in terms of
looking at extremism.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:54.330
So I try to -- one thing informs
another, but my to-do list,

01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:57.800
and I am doing more and
more on my to-do list --

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.380
one is to make very clear
about the importance of respect

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.420
for our institutional
system and our constitution.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.720
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.810
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
To make clear

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:12.510
that nobody is above the law.

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:16.860
[ Applause ]

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.160
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.460
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Yeah.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.810
That the press is essential,
and then I am saying

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.400
that people need to
either run for office

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.760
or support those people
who are, and then something

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.670
that is actually really
difficult, which is to talk

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.830
with people that
I disagree with.

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:37.870
Now I'm sorry to
say to all of you

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:42.320
that are Washingtonians I listen
to right-wing radio as I drive

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.890
and do a lot of yelling
and hand gestures,

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:49.150
and so it may not be
safest to be around me,

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:52.540
but the bottom line is I
think we need to understand.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.440
I don't like the
word "tolerance."

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.740
That means put up with.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.520
I think we need to respect the
views of those that we disagree

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:08.040
with and talk about try to
figure out what it's about.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.340
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.640
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And
then every book or speech

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.940
that I've ever read
quotes Robert Frost,

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.850
and my favorite quote
is -- "The older I get,

01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:17.110
the younger are my
teachers" is what he said,

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:21.070
and I think we need to get
the young people mobilized,

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.750
those kids that marched after --

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.050
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Yeah.

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:25.350
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.650
Parkland, so that's
kind of my to-do list.

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:27.950
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Well, that's a lot of things.

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:29.250
So if you look back on
your incredible career,

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:32.470
if you could say the
two final questions.

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:33.890
One, what is the difference

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:36.400
between the way men
run countries

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.510
and women run countries?

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:40.980
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,
they are not a lot of women

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:44.260
that are running countries,
but the bottom line is I think

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:48.910
that actually men and women
do have different approaches,

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:51.410
I think in terms of I
think women are better

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:54.920
at peripheral vision,
because we have to multitask.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.180
I think men think kind of
more concentrated deeper.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.800
These are generalizations,
but --

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.730
and I think that there's
an attempt to kind

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:04.770
of find some compromise,

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:06.920
that compromise is not
a four-letter word,

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.980
but I honestly believe this.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.520
I don't think the world
should be run only by women,

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.350
and if you think that,
you've forgotten high school.

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:18.180
I think that what is
important is to get men

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.850
and women working together --

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:21.150
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.450
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:23.750
and using the various
skills that we have.

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.220
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
of all the things you've done

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.070
in your incredible career, what
would you say you're most proud

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.540
of your achievement,
having done?

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.690
Is it being secretary of state
and what you did as secretary

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:34.190
of state, as a teacher?

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.680
What would you say you're
most proud of having achieved?

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.980
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: Well,

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.820
I have to say obviously my
children and grandchildren.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.240
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
You have three daughters.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.540
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright:
I have three daughters

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.650
and six grandchildren, and
I do think that, you know,

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:51.720
we all kid that working hard
is kind of a family trait,

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.320
so I'm very proud of that, but
I think that what I'm proudest

01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.180
of is that I'm a
grateful American.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:04.710
I describe myself as a grateful
American, and I am proud

01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:09.160
when I'm able to kind of
be able to work with others

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.950
to show what America
can and should do.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:15.680
What I regret most of all is
that I never ran for office,

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.060
and so what I try to do is to
motivate people to do that.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:25.520
I love politics, I love our
system, and I really do think

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.690
that what I'm best at at the
moment is telling it like it is.

01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:33.980
I have had a very lucky life.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.520
I know you're not
supposed to say that,

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.090
but I have had a lucky life,

01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:41.010
and coming to America is
what made all the difference,

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.740
and I'm a refugee,
and one of the things

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.300
that I really am proud of
and I love to do is to go

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.800
and give naturalization
certificates

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.100
at the ceremonies, and --

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.400
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Well, speaking of --

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.560
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: --
the first time I did that was

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:02.310
on July 4th, 2000 at Monticello,
Thomas Jefferson's home,

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:04.470
and I figured since I had
his job, I could do that.

01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:05.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:07.940
&gt;&gt; Madeleine Albright: And so I
gave somebody a naturalization

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.240
certificate, and I all

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.690
of a sudden heard this man
say can you believe it?

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:15.100
I'm a refugee, and I just got
my naturalization certificate

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.560
from the secretary of
state, and I went up to him

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.860
and I said can you believe that
a refugee is secretary of state?

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.190
And that is what
America is about.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:23.990
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Well put.

01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:34.160
