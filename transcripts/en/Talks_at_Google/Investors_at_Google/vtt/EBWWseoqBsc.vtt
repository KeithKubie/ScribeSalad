00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.740
SAURABH MADAAN: Hello,
and welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.020
Today is a very, very
special event for us.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.920
We have two previous
Google author speakers

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.960
and famous value
investors with us.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.520
Let me introduce one of
them first, to begin with.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.170
Mohnish Pabrai is the managing
partner of Pabrai Funds.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.820
He's also the
founder of Dakshana,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.670
a nonprofit organization,
which has sent hundreds

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.610
of impoverished kids to the
IITs, which are the most

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.550
sought-after colleges in India.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.520
We are very pleased to
have you again with us.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.620
So welcome, Mohnish.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.090
And let's start with a brief
introductory remarks from you.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.549
MOHNISH PABRAI: Thank you.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:43.340
Thank you, Saurabh.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.030
It's a pleasure to be here and
pleasure to be back at Google.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.840
And now I'm our shareholder.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.010
So last time I came I was not
appropriately portfolioed,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.520
but now I'm
shareholder of Google,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.870
so it's great to look at
what my money is doing.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.459
And I'm bullish on the
prospect, if you will.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:12.630
So just very quickly before we
get into Q&amp;A, like many of you,

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.490
I'm an engineer.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.980
And I did my undergrad
in computer engineering.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.690
I actually never had looked
at the stock market or stocks

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.530
or went to business school.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.760
And in 1994, quite
by accident, I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.930
read a book, which is the
one you can see on the slide.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.130
It's by Roger Lowenstein.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.600
And it's a biography on
Buffett-- "Buffett-- the Making

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.240
of an American Capitalist."

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.050
And I was very lucky
because just at that time

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.200
the first couple of biographies
on Warren Buffett had come out.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.040
And when I read the book, it led
to a very significant epiphany,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.640
which eventually led me--
immediately, actually,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.880
almost immediately-- to start
spending something like about

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.970
20 hours a week on
investment research,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.420
and then about five years
after that to actually do a 180

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.140
and start an investment fund.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.620
And the thing that I found
very compelling about the book

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.930
was that Warren has
this saying that I'm

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.590
a better businessman
because I'm an investor,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.520
and I'm a better investor,
because I'm a businessman--

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.780
interplay between
running a business

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.920
and managing an
investment portfolio.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.620
And when I read
Buffett's biography

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.730
it dawned on me
that the tools you

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.730
use when you're
making investments

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.109
are almost identical
to the tools you use

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.400
when you're running a business.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.240
So for example, I
was at that time

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.420
running an IT services company.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.280
And I would probably
spend maybe 2% or 3%

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.530
of my time on strategy
and direction--

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.010
figuring out which
areas we would focus on

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.700
and those sorts of things.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.780
And then 97% of the time
was the heavy lifting,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.860
you know, the blocking,
tackling, and making

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.490
that strategy happen.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.850
And initially, when I was
doing this for first few years,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.250
it was very exciting, because
you basically have a hypothesis

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.590
and then you'd go out and try
to execute the hypotheses.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.030
And then you'd have
real-world results to look at.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.340
When I read Buffett's
biography, what dawned on me

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.090
is that that 3% of time
that I was spending

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.890
for someone like Warren
Buffett was like 80% of time,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.840
because what he was able to
do is apply the same analytics

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.430
towards understanding
which businesses

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.590
and industries and such
were great investments.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.380
And so the part of
the brain that you

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.790
use in figuring out business
strategy and direction

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.470
are pretty much almost
identical to the same parts

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.650
that you would use
as an investor.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.750
And I always found
that the 3% of time

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.950
were a lot more exciting
personally than the 97%.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.850
I mean, I enjoyed the 97%,
but nothing like the 3%.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.390
And so the idea of
blowing up the 3% to 80%

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.130
by letting someone else in
effect run the business,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.270
and you figure
out where you want

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.030
to allocate capital was
very exciting for me.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.120
And so that's what
led me to-- I had sold

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.730
a few assets in the business.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.860
For the first time I
had about $1 million,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.480
which I didn't
have any need for.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.940
And so I decided to
take the $1 million

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.120
and put it into
equity investments

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.080
as an experiment to see how far
I could take Buffett's model

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.390
and applying those same
analytics that I was using

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.650
and I'd try to blow it up.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.720
So basically, I immediately
got to spend about 20 hours

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.990
a week on what was normally
would have been just a week

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.500
or two in a year and then a
lot of time just executing.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.590
And so if you can go
to the next slide.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.730
And so one of the
first investments

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.880
I made-- this was in
'95-- and it actually

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.170
show the interplay
between the real world,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.320
if you can call it that,
and the investing world.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.390
So I was running this
IT services company.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.850
There was this company in
India, which was called

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.250
Satyam Computer Services.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.510
And Satyam was trying to expand
its business in the United

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.570
States.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.610
And their sales team had
visited me in Chicago.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.660
They wanted to see is we could
do some kind of relationship.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.730
And we never did any business,
but I liked them a lot.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.680
I liked the people.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.260
And I liked the way they were
going about their business

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.670
and how they were
positioning themselves.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.780
So then I decided to
study Satyam as a stock,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.300
because it was publicly
traded in India at the time.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.470
And when I studied it, I was
a novice investor at the time,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.860
but it blew my mind because
the market cap of Satyam

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.180
was less than what
you might have valued

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.880
their real estate in Hyderabad.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.150
So the stock was trading below
what would be just liquidation

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.680
value on real estate.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.960
And this was a IT
services company

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.070
that was growing something like
70% a year, very high margins.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.850
And I really couldn't see
the end of that runway.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.540
That runway was really big.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.210
And of course, investing in
India was really complicated,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.740
but I did it, but
I wasn't confident

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.100
now because we didn't
have electronic trading.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.224
There were these flimsy
stocks that [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:56.224 --> 00:06:58.140
And I didn't fully trust
the Indian government

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.106
on the ability to actually
get the money back

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.480
in dollars, even
though they said

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.604
the rules would allow that.

00:07:02.604 --> 00:07:07.240
So anyway, I made a $10,000
investment in Satyam.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.110
I bought three or
four different stocks.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.100
And Indian Satyam
was one of them.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.830
And I decided this is one of
those investments where you

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.850
just buy and forget about it.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.010
Never look at it again and
just let it run for 10 years.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.094
And I bought it at
40 rupees a share.

00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:29.510
And about five years later--
and this you know, of course,

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:35.260
we had the whole dot-com
boom in getting going--

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.440
and Satyam had spun off
one of these dot coms.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.220
The stock had gone
from 40 rupees

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.680
to in February or March
of 2007 7,000 rupees.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.660
So it had gone up
like 130-140 times.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.080
And currency had
moved again, we would

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.190
have still even with
the currency moment

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.810
it was more than 100x.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.970
And so I decided to stop
drinking the Kool Aid

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.210
and do analysis of the
financials at that time,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.857
but I basically never
looked at it after that.

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:12.190
And when I did the analysis,
it was creating at or north

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.340
of 100 times earnings.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.450
And they had all these dot coms
which I couldn't figure out

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.600
what they were worth.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.250
And I said, you know, I think
we've got more than a million

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.747
in Satyam stock from the 10,000.

00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:29.080
And I think we're going to
take our money off the table.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.700
The other thing I
was concerned with I

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.500
didn't know whether they
were allowed to put it back

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.190
from India, because
the government said

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.620
you could come in, give
us your foreign exchange,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.610
and when you sell it, no
long-term gain stocks,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.400
and you can pull the
whole thing back.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.530
And I didn't trust that.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.070
So I said let's test that.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.242
And so I sold.

00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:46.200
And didn't certificate.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.030
I didn't even know if
they were authentic.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.200
So it sold, and the money
got into my bank in India.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.650
And then I said wire it
to my bank in the US,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.250
and the next day
it was in the US.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.429
OK, so the whole thing
actually worked exactly

00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:01.220
they said it would.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.750
Then I said, well,
you know, I should've

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.000
trusted them a little bit more.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.791
So that was Satyam.

00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:06.050
We can go to the next slide.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.930
And so there was
this other company

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.250
in the mid '90s PeopleSoft.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.470
And one of the things
were the interplay

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.070
between investing and
running a business,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.420
so we were basically
doing system integration.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.020
So for example, we
had a team which

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.330
had expertise in
Sybase and Oracle, all

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.720
these different databases.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.230
And what I started doing when
I was looking at investing,

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.230
I started looking at all
the software companies,

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.130
because that was an
area I understood.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:41.310
And one of the companies I
found with a very high P/E ratio

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.122
was PeopleSoft.

00:09:42.122 --> 00:09:44.580
I think it was creating nearly
more than 50 times earnings.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.920
And PeopleSoft was
like SAP, basically,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.260
where they needed
system integrators

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.166
to go in and
implement the product.

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:52.540
So I said, well,
you know, what I

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.670
can do is I can't buy the
stock, because it's ridiculously

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.760
priced, but I can
do a back door.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.740
And the back door I
did, I said, well,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.160
the market is mostly efficient.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.850
So if it's a 50 times
earnings, the market

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.570
expects tremendous growth.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.810
And it looked to me like
it would grow a lot.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.180
So I said if we and
my company, TransTech,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.990
set up a PeopleSoft
practice, that would not

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.960
be buying at 50 times earnings.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.410
I would just be hiring people.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.160
And then I'd have them build out
of these different companies.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.580
And it would be pretty
spectacular margins

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.440
because it was so
new and growing.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.760
So I decided we would set
up a PeopleSoft practice.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.070
And I still remember the
economics were just incredible

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.061
because I hired this guy who was
probably the most expensive guy

00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:47.310
we'd ever hired at that times.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.320
This was '96 or
something, I think.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.040
He was a PeopleSoft
practice leader.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.740
And I think he cost us maybe
quarter million a year.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:01.390
And when we hired him, we didn't
know what we would do with him.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.199
But I just said, OK, I need to
have some horsepower coming in,

00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:06.240
so we can then figure out,
because this guy knows

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.720
what he's doing.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.400
I said, once he comes in, then
we'll sit down and figure out

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.900
what to do.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:15.060
So he comes in to work the first
day and he says, by the way,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.830
are you looking for clients?

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.530
I said, yeah, we're
looking for clients.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.909
And he said, well, you know,
I've got these relationships,

00:11:22.909 --> 00:11:24.200
there are three or four places.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.900
And I can go in with
a team of 15 people.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.499
So I said, Paul, I don't
have the 15 people.

00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:32.290
Do know the people?

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.060
He said, yeah, I
know the people too.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.580
OK, so he helped us hire
these 15 buddies of his.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:46.540
And I don't think it was even
a day that he was non-billable.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.860
So in two days he's building
at multiples of the quarter

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.270
million that I'm paying him.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.350
And the team is going
in at 50% margins

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.290
after covering all expenses.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.190
And so when I looked at what
happened with PeopleSoft,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.200
our actual cash out
the door-- we're

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.050
kind of be like the Dell
model, where you ship the PC

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.830
and then you pay
your suppliers later.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.850
I hadn't even paid the
payroll on these people

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.890
before we raised
our first invoice.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.404
And the invoice was
at a huge margin

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.820
to what we were
going to pay them.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.580
So when I actually
calculated dollars

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.080
invested in the
PeopleSoft practice,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.250
I think it was a
negative number.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.780
And in the end, a lot of
the rest of our IT business

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.220
was kind of declining
because it was matured out

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.810
and getting competitive.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.000
This was very high margin.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.450
And so that's an
example of how I

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:45.400
used the stock market to drive--
I said, no, this is cool.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.320
I'll just keep looking at
companies that have 50, 60, 70,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.784
100 times earnings and
then go build a practice.

00:12:50.784 --> 00:12:52.200
And I know they're
going to go up.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.491
And so that worked really well.

00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:55.140
So we go to the next slide.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:05.330
And so we had Satyam and
stuff, which from '95 to '99,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.561
I think, I'd done like north of
70% a year on that $1 million

00:13:09.561 --> 00:13:10.310
we originally had.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.370
So things had gone really well.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:17.771
But then in '99, and this was
when Pabrai Funds had started,

00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:19.270
one of the first
investments we made

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:26.800
is I was seeing the big
bubble in the internet.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.360
And it was clear to me that the
internet was transformational.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.420
But also I was very skeptical
of the pets.coms, if you will.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.780
So there was a side of
me which said, yes, I

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.330
can see how this will
change people's lives.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.980
But I was having a hard
time aware what kind of bet

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.544
I can make, which
would be a safe bet.

00:13:48.544 --> 00:13:49.960
So then I find
this company, which

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.300
is headquartered not too far
from here, Silicon Valley Bank.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.510
And it's a very well-run bank.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.330
It wasn't trading at a
significant multiple to book.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.620
It's just a modest
premium to book.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.670
But what they did every
time they did deals

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.600
with these
venture-backed companies

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.090
where they did asset-backed
loans and all this stuff,

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.970
they got warrants.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.930
So every company that they
did a loan or leasing,

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.136
or different deals, they'd
collected warrants in addition

00:14:20.136 --> 00:14:24.160
to what they would get
from the loan spreads.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.420
And so they were sitting on
this basket of like 300 or 400

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.150
of their clients
with these warrants.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.930
And many of these were pre-IPO.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.405
And there was no disclosure.

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:35.780
There was no
disclosure that they

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.950
had made of-- OK, look,
here's a list of companies,

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.290
here are the ones we
own, and this and that.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.490
I just knew they are sitting on
this mass amount of warrants.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.190
And so I said, well,
if we buy the bank--

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.400
and it was publicly traded--
we're buying a well-run bank.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.895
And we have an automatic upside
if these warrants come in.

00:14:53.895 --> 00:14:56.020
And I don't know whether
they would come in or not,

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.039
but I said, its
kind of heads-- I

00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:00.330
win, tails-- I don't lose much.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.880
You might have
heard that before.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.740
And so we bought
Silicon Valley Bank.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.200
And I think within about six
months, we had a 4x on it,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.760
because then they started
reporting that, yeah, we

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.490
had this huge amount of
income, because these companies

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:20.682
and public we sold, and it was
dwarfing their interest rates.

00:15:20.682 --> 00:15:21.890
We can just go to next slide.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.910
And so now we come full circle
where about a year ago I

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.570
set up a company called
Dhandho Holdings.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.990
And so now it's
been about 16 years

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:37.954
that have been 80% time
doing strategy, if you will,

00:15:37.954 --> 00:15:39.620
which is great, and
getting paid for it.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.245
What a country!

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.170
But I found that the
Pabrai Funds is somewhat

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.010
limiting, because I'm
limited to public markets.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.070
I got rid of the
technology company,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.390
so I didn't have a way
to go into these kind

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.570
of roll-up-your-sleeves
type things.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:02.640
And so I set up Dhandho
Holdings about 18 months ago.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.670
And we raised 150
million and we just

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.360
bought an insurance company.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.630
And now this platform allows
me to buy any kind of asset.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.580
I can buy private companies,
public companies, real estate,

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.830
anything I want.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:22.790
And so it allows a little wider
playing field, if you will.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.900
And it allows for
the first time we

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.680
have insurance float, which I've
heard is a good thing to have.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.690
And so now I have-- which is
the part I was always interested

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:43.300
in-- is that if you can control
the business without really

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.170
meddling or running
the business,

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.790
and if you can
control the capital

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.810
allocation of the
business, that has

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.240
some superiority to just being a
passive public equity investor.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.980
And so we have some
elements of that in Dhandho.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.480
And so we'll see
how that plays out.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.580
So I just wanted to
give a little backdrop

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.030
on how an engineer
goes from what

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.587
I was doing to where I am now.

00:17:05.587 --> 00:17:06.920
SAURABH MADAAN: Thanks, Mohnish.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.044
It's a fascinating journey.

00:17:08.044 --> 00:17:09.230
Thank you very much.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:14.069
So our next guest is
also a previous Talks

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:15.440
at Google speaker.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.240
He wrote an investment book "The
Education of Value Investor",

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.079
a bestselling book.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.500
But unlike few
investment books, this

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.200
was also a book that
touched a lot of individuals

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.090
at a very, very personal level.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.420
He's the managing director
of Aquamarine Funds.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.734
And it's my great pleasure
to welcome Guy Spier.

00:17:34.734 --> 00:17:37.520
GUY SPIER: So thank you,
Mohnish, thank you, Saurabh.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.860
It's a pleasure to be
here with my family.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.290
And I think I'm going to
stand-- so I'll just go and take

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.690
a seat over here.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.490
And I won't take long.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.880
So what do the
rest of us do when

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.060
confronted with the brilliance
that we see over here?

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.500
And I would say that I
think that I was brought up

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.310
most of the time that I was
at school and university,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.040
I was in places
where I was probably

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.010
the smartest guy in the room.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.150
And then, as inevitably
happens in life,

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.660
you end up at Google,
where there is

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.910
a huge number of smart people.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.030
Or you in your own
profession, you

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.870
end up bumping into somebody
like Mohnish Pabrai.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.570
And I think a lot
of us who are smart

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.620
have a big problem when we hit
that, because it's kind of you

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.907
hit a wall.

00:18:24.907 --> 00:18:26.365
And it's a bit like
being perhaps--

00:18:26.365 --> 00:18:28.390
you know, there's
a very high suicide

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:33.470
rate at Cambridge
University math's subject,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.907
because you get all these super
bright mathematics students.

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:38.490
And they hit a wall
when they suddenly

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.090
realize that there
are people there

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.840
who are much more
brilliant than they are.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.590
So I hit Mohnish Pabrai.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.980
And I saw a guy who
can quote poetry

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.060
to me from the back
of a taxi, who's

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.260
incredibly good at playing
the game of investing, who

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.890
up close, I can see,
absorbs information

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.062
and analyzes it much
faster than I do.

00:19:00.062 --> 00:19:01.770
And so what I want to
tell the group here

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.320
is that there is life on
the other side of that.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.090
And just a couple of ideas.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.640
One is that I think
that something that's

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.690
been really remarkable for me
is to realize how we don't think

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.090
on our own as human beings.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.640
So I think Google
engineers understand that.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.350
Saurabh and I were
talking about how

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.130
effectively one of the
things that Google is doing

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.450
is that it's helping
us to delegate

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.390
a whole bunch of mental
functions out into the Cloud,

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.960
and we can focus on the
things that we do best.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.090
But that also happens
in smaller samples.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.810
So I've learned
that if you combine

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.255
that with not worrying
about who gets the credit

00:19:39.255 --> 00:19:42.100
and in certain way who
to be the bad boy for,

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.980
you can get a lot
more productive.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.620
I think that the
minute I stopped

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.820
trying to be the originators
of all original ideas--

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.570
so cloning is good is something
that I learned from Mohnish.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.510
And then I learned
not to worry about who

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.410
gets the credit
for something, you

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.750
can end up being
extraordinarily productive.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.612
And before we open
it up to questions,

00:20:02.612 --> 00:20:04.320
I'll just leave you
with this one thought

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.510
that I find just
extraordinary is that I

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.202
decided I was learning so much.

00:20:09.202 --> 00:20:10.660
First of all, there
were few things

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.141
I started doing right to get
into the presence of Mohnish

00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:13.640
Pabrai.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.860
That itself was
fascinating to me.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.600
I was so excited by
the things I learned,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.960
I decided to write
a book about it.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.450
If you take a look at
the book, I basically

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.824
start the book saying I am
not worthy, I'm nothing.

00:20:28.824 --> 00:20:30.490
Look at what I learned
from this person.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.205
Look at what I learned
from this person.

00:20:32.205 --> 00:20:33.580
Look at all these
ways in which I

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.400
failed until I learned from Tony
Robbins, Mohnish Pabrai, Warren

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.810
Buffett, Charlie Munger.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.680
It goes on and on, each
time to somebody else.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.600
And I find the world
an extraordinary place

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.183
that even when you
do that, you end up

00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:47.920
getting a huge amount of credit.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.990
And so I think the
secret for the rest of us

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.150
is to find people by
acting in the right way,

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.720
giving credit to other
people, and then just

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.740
being a part of the
meta thought process

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.370
that allows us to
benefit as well.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.080
And I think that when you
get into those ecosystems,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.480
it's a lollapalooza.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.020
Extraordinary things happen.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.490
And just going back
to the founding

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.100
stone for me and
Mohnish, I think

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.309
that's what we see at
Berkshire Hathaway.

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:14.850
You see a group of
people who learned

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.570
how to do that within a
web of dissolved trust.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.910
And with that, we can
open up to questions.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.410
SAURABH MADAAN:
Thank you very much.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.840
So I have questions
for both of you.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.630
And

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:25.470
MOHNISH PABRAI: Saurabh,
just [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.540
going to do one to two, do
you want to switch with Guy?

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.748
I think it's better this way.

00:21:28.748 --> 00:21:33.700
SAURABH MADAAN: Yeah, let's
have Guy sit closer to Mohnish.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.890
But yeah, I can face both of
you when I ask you questions.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.660
Let me start with you, Mohnish.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.230
This is a question, you
mentioned your journey

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.900
from technology to
investing, as it were.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.120
And I learned somewhere--
and fill in the gaps for us--

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.050
that you went to a retreat.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:55.250
And there was an
industrial psychologist,

00:21:55.250 --> 00:22:01.060
psychiatrist, help correct me
later, who did a 360 on you.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.140
And you were managing a company.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.810
And they said, Mohnish,
stop managing this company.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:11.764
And you would work best
in a team size of one.

00:22:11.764 --> 00:22:12.430
Is that correct?

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.888
MOHNISH PABRAI:
That's right, yeah.

00:22:13.888 --> 00:22:17.000
So I'm part of a group called
YPO-- Young Presidents'

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.850
Organization, which I
think is one of the best

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.240
nonprofit groups out there.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.900
It was set up to make
business leaders better--

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.600
better leaders, better husbands,
better fathers and mothers,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.060
and such, and so.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.250
It's been a great
group to be a part of.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.240
And so I've been
with YPO I think now

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.270
for about almost 18 years.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:45.770
In fact, I just left
because now I am too old.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.410
And so it was great 18 years.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.700
And as part of
YPO, we get set up

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.240
in forums, which are groups
of 8 to 10 individuals

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.630
who are in non-competing
businesses.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.060
And the forums meet once a month
in a very confidential setting

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.387
for about four hours.

00:23:02.387 --> 00:23:03.970
And then once a year
we go on retreat,

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:06.560
where we go into
deeper dives, where

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.926
we explore longer-term
goals, personal growth,

00:23:11.926 --> 00:23:13.050
and development, and so on.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.290
So one of the individuals
in the group suggested

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:22.080
that we have these
industrial psychologists

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.235
do a deep dive on us.

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:24.860
And so there were
these two individuals

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.330
and they had a company
called Conquest.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.350
And I was intrigued by the name.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.020
So they said that they
named it after Genghis Khan.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:39.070
And they said people think
that Genghis Khan was a tyrant.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.140
But they said that
Genghis Khan was

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.110
extremely effective at
getting to his objectives.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.630
And so they said that
in effect each of us

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.060
is wired a certain
way on the inside.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.510
So let's say, for example, that
this is your inner map, what

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:02.690
happens is the world expects
us to act a certain way.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.120
And so in many ways, as we
try to please the world,

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.950
and so we will have
an outer map and many,

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.800
many damages misaligned
from the inner map.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.310
And that inner map, according
to these Conquest guys was,

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.970
between your genetics
and the first five years

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.310
of your life experience
is hard coded.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.132
That inner map is
not going to change.

00:24:24.132 --> 00:24:25.715
Things that you like
or dislike, those

00:24:25.715 --> 00:24:29.870
are core parts of your
psychology and your makeup.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.270
And so their perspective
was that there's

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:38.040
no point for Genghis Khan to try
to be like Gandhi, because he'd

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.450
be completely ineffective
at it, because at the core

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.690
he is a tyrant.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.440
And so they said, if you
are a tyrant on the inside,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.945
be a tyrant on the outside.

00:24:45.945 --> 00:24:47.820
Because that's the best
thing for the tyrant.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.270
It may not be best for
the rest of humanity,

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.620
but they were focused
on the individual.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.800
So their take was
that each of us

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.400
is born without
an owner's manual.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.170
And what they told
us that they would

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:05.080
do for us at that retreat is
at the end of the retreat,

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.040
we would basically
have an owner's manual.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.670
And I got a 20-page document
which I re-read every year now,

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.570
re-read it.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.290
And so what they did was
they did the 360 interviews.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.290
So they talked to
all our spouses.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.590
If the kids were old enough,
they talked to the kids.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.965
If you had employees,
they talked

00:25:23.965 --> 00:25:25.830
to employees, your friends.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:29.439
Just a full 360, people if
you were reporting to someone,

00:25:29.439 --> 00:25:30.480
they'd talk to your boss.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.410
If you had people
reporting to you,

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.910
they talked to people under you.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.670
And then they had us
to do a bunch of tests.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.380
And based on all of
that, they got a map

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.300
of who they thought we were.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.484
And then they sat down
with us individually,

00:25:46.484 --> 00:25:48.150
not individually,
within a group setting

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:53.090
for three days at this retreat
and went through the finding,

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.320
went through the owner's
manual for each of us.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.240
And with me at the time I
was running this company

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.590
with 170 people, with these
PeopleSoft consultants and all

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.090
of that.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.630
And they said, don't even
know how you do that,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.690
because this is not you.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.960
So what they said
is with me, they

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.250
said something that was
very core to my psyche

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:17.830
is I like to play
games, but I like

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.200
to play certain types of games.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.100
So I like to play games
where the outcome depends

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.550
on my performance, it
doesn't depend on a team.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:33.909
So I wouldn't be a good guy
on a soccer team, for example.

00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:36.450
So they said that you like to
play games where the outcome is

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.820
heavily dependent on you.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.730
And you like to play games
where you think with whatever

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.250
you have to bring to
bear to that game,

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.740
you have a likelihood
of winning.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.810
And when you pair
yourself, they said,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.310
with this game where
it seems to match up

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:59.690
with the type of things you
like to do, then you'll kill it.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:07.310
So they said you need to focus
on driving that, feeding that.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.190
And this was just about two
or three months before Pabrai

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.180
Funds was launched.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.060
And I had the idea for it.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.750
So I would explain to them what
I was trying to do about it.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.854
And they said, yes,
Pabrai Funds-- perfect.

00:27:17.854 --> 00:27:19.270
That's what you
should need to do.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.280
And they looked at
my other company,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.560
they said, as
quickly as possible,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.160
sell it, find the CEO,
whatever you can do, exit.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.870
And I did that.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.680
Like for example, I
love to play bridge.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.860
I spend five or six hours
a week playing bridge.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.950
And I look forward to it.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:42.980
Like Saturday and Sunday
I played about five hours

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.490
of bridge.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.130
It was incredible.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.629
I loved it.

00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:49.762
Probably love it as much or
more than equity research.

00:27:49.762 --> 00:27:53.480
And you can see that.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.800
There's no reward
by playing bridge.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.100
But there is a reward
for me, because I only

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.860
like to play duplicate bridge,
because in duplicate bridge

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.140
we keep score.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.985
And if, for example, many of my
friends will say, hey, Mohnish,

00:28:04.985 --> 00:28:05.860
we're having a party.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.940
We're going to play
some social bridge.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.680
I have no interest
in social bridge.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.740
What's the point of
playing social bridge?

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.510
There's no scorekeeping.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:18.040
And so scorekeeping just in
my psyche is very important.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:24.420
And so just I would say
that this whole area doesn't

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.700
get covered in our
education system.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.990
I think universities ought
to pretty much give everyone

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.100
their owner's manual.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.224
In fact, I think you should
get your owner's manual

00:28:36.224 --> 00:28:38.470
when you're 10 years old.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:45.040
And so to the extent that
individuals able to do that--

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.460
and I think it's not very
hard to do it in the sense

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.304
that if it was a poor man's
version would be Myers Briggs.

00:28:51.304 --> 00:28:52.970
You could just pull
it off the internet.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:53.470
And do that.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.090
But I would say, even if
you just in the Yellow Pages

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:58.710
look for an industrial
psychologist or a psychologist

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.430
and just ask them
that this is what

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:04.952
you want them to do, I think
for maybe $1,000 or $2,000,

00:29:04.952 --> 00:29:08.360
maybe $3,000 you could
get quite a ways,

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.930
because the body of
work is so extensive.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:18.710
And I think the
rewards are priceless.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.860
SAURABH MADAAN: Thank you.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.299
And, Guy, this idea of--

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:22.590
MOHNISH PABRAI: And by the way.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.450
I just wanted to say that
I went through this in '99.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.790
And Guy is not part
of this other group,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.790
I'm part of Latticework.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.660
And I had the group go
through it last year.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.980
Actually, no, 2013.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.480
And Guy was part
of that as well.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.760
So he went through it as well.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.260
SAURABH MADAAN: I want to ask
you about your owner's manual,

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.530
but before I come
to that, this idea

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.250
of alignment and authenticity
also comes out strongly

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.440
in the book that you wrote.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.160
And it's been a while since the
book came out, since then it's

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.340
been on all sorts
of bestseller lists,

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.930
broken all sorts of records.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.080
I'm just curious, given the
months that have passed.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.340
And if you were to add an
afterward or a final chapter

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.830
now, where are the
things that you

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.140
might want to mention in there?

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.120
GUY SPIER: I would just
tell you that I think

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.790
it's too soon to add something.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.182
I feel like the book was
five years in the making.

00:30:20.182 --> 00:30:22.640
In fact, you could argue that
the book started when I first

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.600
met Mohnish, because he talked
to me about Mahatma Gandhi.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.950
And it was only because he
talked to me about Mahatma

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.130
Gandhi that I even read the
autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.010
and was inspired by it.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.480
I would say the only thing that
I'm struggling with right now

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.870
is that the book is
on the positive side

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.904
a great big active commitment
to consistency, which is good,

00:30:44.904 --> 00:30:46.570
because it commits
me to certain values.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.050
I think those are great
values to be committed to.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.390
But it also commits me to a
certain standard of behavior.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.880
And I have various members
of the planet showing up

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.124
in various ways in my
email inbox and in letters,

00:30:57.124 --> 00:30:58.790
and what have you,
and they're expecting

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.770
a certain past standard of
behavior, which is easy enough

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.200
to do when you have a relatively
small circle of friends,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.750
but when you have a large
group coming at you,

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.110
and so I'm struggling with
how to remain congruent

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.830
as more and more people come
into my life, which is not

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.017
an easy task.

00:31:14.017 --> 00:31:15.150
SAURABH MADAAN: Absolutely.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.850
Absolutely.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.000
And I guess which
is why you are you.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.330
So there's a question here
that we have from the audience.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:28.580
And I think you've probably
both seen this question

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.570
before several times.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.910
But it's an important
enough question to, I guess,

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.640
reflect upon for all of
the audience that you're

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.300
going to have here live,
as well as on YouTube.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.950
The question is simply what
was the most unexpected

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.240
surprising thing
that you guys felt

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.234
when you met with Warren Buffett
during your lunch with him?

00:31:52.234 --> 00:31:53.900
MOHNISH PABRAI: Do
you want to go first?

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.070
GUY SPIER: You know, one
of the things that really

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.242
got to me at the
time was when I asked

00:32:02.242 --> 00:32:03.450
him this question about envy.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:09.060
I had the courage
to ask about myself.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.010
So the question that
I asked him was,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.140
Warren, imagine I'm one of your
managers of your businesses,

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.890
an important business
that generates

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.955
a lot of cash for your office.

00:32:20.955 --> 00:32:23.080
And imagine that I come to
you and I say, you know,

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.660
I'm sort of grips with envy of
other people in my industry.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.460
And it's affecting
my performance.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.280
And I expected Warren
to come back to me

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.260
with some brilliant answer.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.246
And he just looked at me.

00:32:36.246 --> 00:32:37.620
And I said, so
what would you do?

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.170
And he just looked at me
and went, I don't know.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.050
I was both a little sort of
shocked and disappointed,

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.740
because I was
expecting some wisdom.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.350
And I think what
that did to me is

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.550
it made me struggle
with that afterwards

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:57.060
and forced me to come
up with my own answers.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.110
And I think it's a
testament to Warren Buffett

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.180
that he is so
congruent and aligned.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.640
I think that when you're
congruent and aligned

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.480
with yourself, when
you love what you do,

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.970
you don't get envious
of other people,

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.830
because you're happy
for them to be happy.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.750
And you love what you do.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.416
If Mohnish is playing
bridge, he doesn't

00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:17.510
care that some other guy is
driving a Formula One racing

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.130
car.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.250
And because Warren has
been so aligned for so long

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.720
the thought was just
utter anathema to him.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.200
And I think it made me
realize that the answer was

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.070
to drop all these things I
was doing, that was trying,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.840
in which I was
misaligned, basically.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.237
It's actually one
of the great clues

00:33:35.237 --> 00:33:37.320
that you're misaligned is
that you're feeling envy

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.870
with something else.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.060
Emotions are a call to action.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.594
And the emotion of envy says
there's something in my life

00:33:46.594 --> 00:33:47.510
that I need to change.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.520
And if you direct
yourself inwards, which I

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.650
by some miracle managed to do.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.080
There's one of the
many surprising things.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.301
SAURABH MADAAN: Thank you.

00:33:55.301 --> 00:33:55.800
Mohnish?

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.680
GUY SPIER: What I found, what
I've found very surprising

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.950
was that Warren's
got plenty going On.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.610
He's got more than
300,000 employees.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:07.360
Huge company.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.409
Obviously, he agreed to have
lunch as a charity lunch.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.620
But the thing that surprised
me is that he truly showed up.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.340
So his perspective when
he came for the lunch was

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.060
that these people who I don't
know very well, don't know

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.929
or at all, really, for
them, this is a big deal.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.239
He understood that really well.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:34.840
And he understood that he
was there to deliver value.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.270
And so he wanted to
make sure that we

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.179
felt like we got a bargain.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.230
And so whenever we
asked a question,

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:49.449
he converted the question
into a learning opportunity.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.199
And so I would just
ask him a question,

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.050
like, for example,
hey, Warren, there

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.670
was this third kind of pseudo
partner of Rick Guerin.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.762
And then after the '70s, he
kind of dropped off the radar.

00:35:01.762 --> 00:35:02.970
What happened to Rick Guerin?

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.540
And he took that
opportunity to give us

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.630
a lesson on leverage and
different things, which

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.310
was very powerful.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.330
And the other thing
I would say is

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:22.840
that in meeting him and
meeting Charlie Munger,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.870
both these individuals are
off-the-chart brilliant.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.550
I would say that they are
unworldly brilliant, because I

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:34.500
asked him questions that
I know he would have never

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.750
had any talk that I
want to ask and had

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.330
any prior of processing.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.380
But the way the answers came
out, and especially, many times

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.010
that I've done that for Charlie
Munger with these extremely

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:52.500
left-field questions, I would
say this that I have never

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.470
ever met a person
who is anywhere

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.900
close to the brilliance
of Charlie Munger.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.220
I would say he
surpasses Warren-- sorry

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.590
Warren-- he surpasses Warren
by quite some distance.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:09.230
And Warren himself
surpasses most of humanity

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.852
by quite some distance.

00:36:10.852 --> 00:36:12.560
So that was the thing
that a lot of thing

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.810
was you could just
see that there is just

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.815
horsepower coming out of their
ears, incredible horsepower.

00:36:17.815 --> 00:36:19.440
And they get output
out of that engine.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.160
A lot of people have horsepower,
they don't get output.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.140
These are Formula One Ferraris,
which are delivering output.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.100
GUY SPIER: Sorry,
just to riff on that.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.370
If we get asked, I get asked
all the time was it worth it.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.920
And I can't tell
you the feeding.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.314
So somebody, here's the
richest man on the planet

00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:41.480
or maybe he's the second
greatest, I don't remember.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:47.560
And he's determined to deliver
extreme amounts of value

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.440
to complete yo-yos, and
their wives, and children.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.130
And that almost makes you
want to jump out of your seat.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.330
It's not what you expect.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.300
And here's what I've learned.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.580
If Warren Buffett was
doing that for us,

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.870
you can be sure that he does
that for every single one

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:03.953
of the Berkshire managers.

00:37:03.953 --> 00:37:06.090
He does it for many,
many other people.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.230
And it made me
realize if you have

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.960
the sense that the richest
on the planet, most

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.660
successful businessman,
most successful investor,

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.620
he would not feel obliged to do.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.870
He'd feel like his
presence is sufficient.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.810
There's no other way,
I think, to really

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.450
have learned the
insight that we really

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.300
are here to serve other people.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.460
And we get success in life when
we take that very seriously

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.100
and we deliver with
enthusiasm value,

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.090
even two yo-yos who've
showed up for charity lunch.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.450
But I would even argue that so
we're at the end of the lunch,

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.291
and, of course, where our
attention is totally focused

00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:41.790
on him.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.446
There are many other things that
we would like to do and ask.

00:37:44.446 --> 00:37:45.570
And he says, wait a second.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.403
Let we just take care
of these waiters here.

00:37:47.403 --> 00:37:49.790
He went and personally
tipped at least one or more

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.010
of the waiters.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.940
So it wasn't just for us.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.269
It was for everybody who
made the occasion possible.

00:37:55.269 --> 00:37:56.810
I don't think there's
any way I could

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.920
have learned that lesson,
other than being at a lunch

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.641
like that.

00:38:01.641 --> 00:38:05.710
SAURABH MADAAN: Awesome,
thanks for sharing that.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.620
OK, there's a question
you should have expected.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.630
There's a question that asks
you about the stock market being

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.590
overvalued or not
currently in the context

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.520
of quantitative
easing and so on.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.350
I'm going to just sort of
rephrase that and put that

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:26.240
in the context of remarks that
I've heard come from you, guys.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.460
And correct me if
they're misattributed.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.720
There's this notion of what
Maggie Mahler has written

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.120
in her book of breaking the
stock market into 15 to 17 year

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.820
cycles.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:44.610
And with that notion,
2016 is supposed

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.660
to be closer to the start
of another blue market.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.700
But given the interest
rate environment

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.140
that we've seen in
the past few years,

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.900
not necessarily
the next 2-3 years,

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.525
but I'm just curious how
do you see things moving

00:38:57.525 --> 00:39:01.090
in the next decade or so?

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.644
GUY SPIER: I have no clue.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:10.590
And I believe if you continue
to do constant [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.040
you'll eventually get inflation.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.380
I think that
everything that I don't

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.570
want to be anywhere other
than stocks, because they

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.050
have unlimited upside.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.510
And just about every
other instrument does not.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.170
I want to be in stocks because
they're inflation protective.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.780
And this idea of going to cash
or some other instrument, what

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.910
are you going to do if
you do get inflation?

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.660
I think other than
that, is if we

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.740
look at the success
of Warren Buffett,

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.350
it's because he didn't waste
too many brain cells thinking

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.550
about Mary Mahler when the
next cycle is going to come,

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.160
and he just focused
on businesses.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.440
MOHNISH PABRAI:
Well, Guy is no fun.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.035
So let me try to do
a little bit better.

00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:49.910
SAURABH MADAAN: Thanks,
Mohnish, [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:50.887 --> 00:39:52.970
MOHNISH PABRAI: Well, I
think Maggie Mahler's book

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.290
is a great book to read.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.120
[INAUDIBLE] is a
fantastic book to read.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.920
And I think if you go back-- and
I was actually recently looking

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:06.420
at just the numbers-- if you go
back to late '99, early 2000,

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.530
and you look at companies
like Microsoft and GE,

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:14.120
and a lot of these high
flyers, they were sitting,

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.540
GE was sitting at
40 times earnings.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.334
And then 15 years later, they're
sitting at 14 times earnings.

00:40:20.334 --> 00:40:21.750
And your know, of
course, earnings

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.700
have grown, considerably
through them,

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.705
and the stock hasn't
done a whole lot.

00:40:26.705 --> 00:40:34.370
And so basically you definitely
see this pattern of in 1982

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.450
markets we very undervalued.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.040
Again, GE was in
single-digit piece.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.900
Coke was at nine times
earnings, or something.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.500
And again, in '99-2000,
Coke had 40 times earnings.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.820
And so we had this massive
bull run from '82 to '99.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.500
And we haven't had much happen
to equities from '99 to today.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.130
In fact, if you look at
it from the point of view

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:02.168
of the NASDAQ, it's almost
played out perfectly

00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:03.626
according to what
Maggie would have

00:41:03.626 --> 00:41:10.010
said, because the NASDAQ peaked
at 5,000 in first quarter 2000.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.700
And it just hit 5,000
first quarter 2015.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.700
So that was a
15-year end to end.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.950
Even the DOW and the SNP,
they haven't done a whole lot

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.830
of the last 15-16 years.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.860
But I would say that we
are not at the point which

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.600
is like 1982.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.410
And in the sense that we
are not at a point where

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.210
we have screaming bargains
all over the place.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.110
For the last couple
of years I have not

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:45.280
been able to find anything
meaningful to buy in the United

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.100
States.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.660
And it's not because things
are 40 times earnings.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.070
So they're not euphoric,
but they're not cheap.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:56.560
And I don't think that most
things are in bubble territory.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.643
I think some things, especially
in this part of the world,

00:41:59.643 --> 00:42:01.220
are in bubble territory.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.650
I don't think Google's
in bubble territory.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.590
But there are,
certainly, even in terms

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.730
of private valuations
of some of these venture

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.710
rounds and [INAUDIBLE], I think
those are in bubble territory.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:19.380
So we have some bubble-like
behavior in certain pockets.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.160
So history doesn't repeat
itself, but it does rhyme.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.290
So we don't know whether
2016 or 2017 are the low,

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:29.240
but I would say
that the odds are

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:35.420
high that when you get to
the 2030s-2035s and that type

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:42.754
of a time period that
the lessons of '99,

00:42:42.754 --> 00:42:44.420
that generation's
going to say this time

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.740
is different,
because it's so far.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.670
It's 35 years.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.260
And that's why we
have these cycles,

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.870
because one generation retires,
a new generation comes in.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:56.310
Nuke into the
block, and they say,

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.018
these guys don't know
what they're doing.

00:42:58.018 --> 00:42:58.840
We know.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.470
And so I think that it's good
to be cognizant of those cycles,

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.100
but I agree with Guy
that you're far better

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.470
off focusing on
individual businesses

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.880
and making the investment
based on the economics

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.017
of the business.

00:43:12.017 --> 00:43:13.100
SAURABH MADAAN: Thank you.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.380
So actually I'm not going to
let you go off that easily, Guy.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.860
So one of questions.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.500
Basically, the fact that
Mohnish gave nice examples--

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.880
Satyam, Silicon Valley Bank.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.540
But the thing with
those examples

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.750
is they're more than
a decade old now.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:32.250
So--

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.626
MOHNISH PABRAI:
That was on purpose.

00:43:34.626 --> 00:43:36.890
SAURABH MADAAN: Sure.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:38.650
So I'm just
wondering, Guy, if can

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.680
be a little more
sporty than Mohnish

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.070
and give us some examples, which
are maybe from this decade.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:47.260
And if not, from this year.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:52.440
GUY SPIER: I filed, I was forced
to file my first 13F this year.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.660
So you can look up
Mohnish's 13F or my 13F,

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.600
or a whole bunch of
other 13Fs, and see

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.420
exactly what he may have bought,
when he might have bought it.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.624
I think that he will have--
I have maybe 100 baggers.

00:44:07.624 --> 00:44:09.665
I don't know, I think, he
probably will have more

00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:11.490
100 baggers in his portfolio.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.070
I think it's very,
very dangerous

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.110
to speak about specific
stocks that you own,

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:19.990
especially when it's a
potentially influent audience,

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.029
because the commitment with
consistency issues is so high.

00:44:23.029 --> 00:44:24.570
I would just share
one thing with you

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:27.820
which is so what you
saw here is a guy who

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.980
loves to play games with odds.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.680
And so he can't help himself.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.250
When he's looking at Marry
Mahler's stock market

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.490
17-year cycles, he may
not know the answer,

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.811
but he's calculating
probabilities all the time,

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:43.310
mostly the probability that
this model of the world is true.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:45.920
And he has a very strong hunch
that that model of the world

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.790
is true.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.350
But let's say that
you're like me.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.210
And you're less into
playing games with odds.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.340
That's just fine.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:54.440
The fact is that if you
apply the right investing

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.470
philosophies, you can
do extraordinarily well.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:01.330
And I would actually argue that
for the vast majority of us

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.220
trying to get into
those kinds of questions

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.715
is actually going to mislead us.

00:45:04.715 --> 00:45:06.840
First of all because it's
hard to do, but also this

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.520
is just not the
way our minds work.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.420
There are very few
people in the world

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.460
who are wired to think
probabilistically,

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.000
the way Mohnish does and
the way some other people do

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.050
all the time.

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.870
What we have to do is
find a way of investing

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.380
in a way of implying these
value-investing tools that

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.770
is consistent with who we are.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.014
And it's totally fine to be
friends with other people

00:45:28.014 --> 00:45:28.930
who do it differently.

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.971
But to try and start
looking at the world the way

00:45:30.971 --> 00:45:33.681
Mohnish looks at it, I'm
going to get into trouble.

00:45:33.681 --> 00:45:35.680
MOHNISH PABRAI: You know,
one thing I would say,

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.870
Saurabh, is that I was
looking back recently at,

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.070
you brought up the 100 baggers.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.880
100 baggers are good
for your health.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.311
The problem is that they
don't come along that often.

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:48.810
I wish they'd come
along more often.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.226
It'd be even better
for my health.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:56.200
But the thing is I look
back, and they do come along.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.540
And in many cases, we
are too dumb to see them.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:04.060
So Satyam was one that
I was able to ride.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.935
Of course, it happened
at a time when

00:46:05.935 --> 00:46:07.310
I didn't have much
more net worth

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.140
and I had even
less of an appetite

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:14.090
for these non-computer traded
Indian stocks and such.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.900
But then after that,
I had another case

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:22.020
where I made an investment in
a shipping company Frontline.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.350
And it was undervalued,
distressed, and all this stuff.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:29.430
And I think I bought
at $7 I sold it $11.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.420
And because I was
just trying to play

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:35.471
that arbitrage between the price
of the ships and the net asset

00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:35.970
value.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:44.790
But that stock Frontline,
from $7 it went up to 150.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.120
And then it was issuing
dividends, which exceeded

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.880
what I had paid for the stock.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.020
And that holding played out
in about four or five years.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:57.140
And so that was at least
25 bagger that I missed it.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.180
There was another one.

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.630
And this one I should have
actually been more cognizant

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.250
of, it was complicated.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:07.440
So there was this company
which had Marty Whitman on the

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.904
and it had Sam Zell.

00:47:08.904 --> 00:47:10.320
And I don't know
if you guys know,

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.420
but Sam Zell is a grave
dancer, a great guy

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.530
to follow into
different investments.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:22.390
So these two individuals had
bought this dilapidated shell

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.800
of a company which had
huge amounts of NOLs.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.630
And it was an insurance
company that had gone under

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.050
and had a lot of NOLs.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:34.700
So they bought the public shell
because it had those NOLs.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:40.340
And then they bought some
barge company in Mississippi.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.890
Basically, the idea was to
marry a profitable business

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:50.240
to this NOL stream and make
money off the tax savings.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.217
And then the barge
company went under.

00:47:52.217 --> 00:47:53.050
They didn't do well.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.380
So they got more NOLs.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.650
So they got NOLs to
the power of NOLs.

00:48:00.215 --> 00:48:02.170
And I had not
invested in a while.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.790
And then they after that they
found a very unusual waste

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:06.660
strategy company.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:10.860
So this company basically
took waste and in this plant

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.200
basically converted
it to electricity.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.100
Almost everything was very
high temperatures and such.

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.065
And then they were
doing a rights offering

00:48:18.065 --> 00:48:18.940
and different things.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.070
And that's when I saw it.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:25.850
And I was too dumb, because I
couldn't, just like Satyam, I

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:29.872
couldn't believe the
significance of the upside.

00:48:29.872 --> 00:48:31.330
I thought I must
be doing something

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:36.050
wrong with the numbers, because
like John Malone's deal, just

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:37.470
very hard to figure out.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:41.060
And so I had, I think, a double
or a triple, and I moved out.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.540
And again, that was about
a 20 bagger from there.

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.880
And so the thing
is that there have

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.980
been a few of these that have
come along in the last 20

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.100
years.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.780
And I know that will come along.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.510
I hope the next time
I'm smart enough

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:01.790
to see it and ride it, and
put enough money behind it.

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:03.330
So there's still time.

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:05.610
We'll see if we can ride
one of those properly.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.401
SAURABH MADAAN: There's
hope for all of us.

00:49:07.401 --> 00:49:08.590
MOHNISH PABRAI: Yeah.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.380
But those are good
ones to study.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.499
And they do come along.

00:49:11.499 --> 00:49:12.290
And they've quirky.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.880
And they're special situations.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.902
But I think it's worth
looking at them, yeah.

00:49:16.902 --> 00:49:19.360
SAURABH MADAAN: Especially for
the small investor, I guess.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.850
MOHNISH PABRAI:
Absolutely, yeah.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.580
SAURABH MADAAN: So I know you
guys are on a tight schedule,

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.010
but one final question.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.710
And I have to ask
you, because I know

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:30.420
you're both engaged
in a lot of activities

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.530
outside investing as well.

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:37.170
And I recently read the
Dakshana annual report.

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:41.970
And I was blown away by how
data-driven, how quantitative,

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:44.720
and yet how inspiration
that whole report was.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.230
And it's one of the
best nonprofit reports

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:48.900
that I've ever come across.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:54.410
So I'm sure it must be a
conscious, deliberate effort

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.494
to do things in a
certain way for you?

00:49:56.494 --> 00:49:57.910
MOHNISH PABRAI:
Yeah, but Saurabh,

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:59.890
you know I like to play games.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:03.630
So I tried to explain to
the Dakshana team in India

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:05.550
that I'm not really
doing any good,

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.910
I'm just playing the game.

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:08.160
And it's a great game to play.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:14.410
And so one of the
things that is a fact

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:19.310
is that it's way more difficult
to give money effectively, give

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.140
away money effectively,
than to make it.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.240
As you can see from my
[INAUDIBLE] escapades,

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.090
you can just blunder
along and make some money.

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:31.332
But giving it away is harder.

00:50:31.332 --> 00:50:33.539
And the reason-- and I've
learned this from Warren--

00:50:33.539 --> 00:50:35.330
the reason that giving
away money is harder

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.950
is you're forced to confront
issues like poverty, health

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:42.550
care, environment, education.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:46.630
And these are issues
where government has

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:49.990
spend billions and trillions,
well-meaning individuals

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.640
have spend billions
and trillions,

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.360
and we still have
these problems.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.560
So it's not like these
people were stupid.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.470
And it's not like they
were all corrupt and such.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:02.030
Many well-meaning people
have had a tough time.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.900
And so my wife and I, we want
to recycle our assets back,

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.160
because it's a game.

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.980
We play the game
and recycle back.

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.660
But I don't want to
recycle back by writing

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.381
a check to Red Cross.

00:51:14.381 --> 00:51:16.380
Nothing wrong with writing
a check to Red Cross,

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.504
but I feel we can do a
little bit better than that.

00:51:18.504 --> 00:51:21.490
And so just like all
the other games I play,

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:27.530
I thought about, well, how would
we give away money effectively?

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.890
And so the way I answered the
question was the first way

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:34.620
was to not wait till
you're really old.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:38.840
We can't do a whole lot when
we are in our '70s and '80s.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.160
So I felt like I wanted to
start in my '40s, at least

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:53.630
on a small scale, so that
we could get some traction.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.500
And so I inverted the problem.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:00.300
And [INAUDIBLE] for Munger,
which is most things in charity

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.290
cannot be measured.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:06.460
So I rejected everything
that we could do where

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.110
measurement would be hard.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:11.190
And I focused on areas where
measurements would be easy,

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:14.910
because if you have an engine
where you can measure easily,

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:18.160
then you can kind of tweak
this ship and navigate.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:23.070
So Dakshana basically does
well because its entire model

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:26.450
is focused on easy measurements
by an independent third party,

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:28.139
which is the IIT entrance exam.

00:52:28.139 --> 00:52:29.680
And then all the
other metrics, which

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.638
is how much it costs us,
how poor the kids are,

00:52:31.638 --> 00:52:34.190
all these things, all
numbers we can look at.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:37.603
And which is why it works
out as well as it does.

00:52:37.603 --> 00:52:39.610
SAURABH MADAAN: Great,
Well, with that,

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.800
I know you guys have to
go to the next event.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.350
Thank you very much, Guy and
Mohnish for being with us

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:45.120
today.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:45.310
Thanks.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:46.643
MOHNISH PABRAI: Well, thank you.

00:52:46.643 --> 00:52:48.060
Thank you.
