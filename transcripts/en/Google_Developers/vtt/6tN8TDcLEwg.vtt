[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:07.770
There are a few
questions that come

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.890
to mind when I hear about
In-App Payment House Ads.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.960
One, how can we improve
our monetization strategy?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.360
Two, can we do it and keep
a smile on our users' faces?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.930
Three, how to serve the
right ad to the right user.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.680
Four, what is the best
beverage for the winter?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.180
All are valid problems.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.580
Today, we're going to focus
on solving the first three.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.220
Cool?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.540
You've got mountains
and mountains of data.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.830
Data that could change
your business, so much

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.840
data that it's overwhelming
and perhaps easier to ignore.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.700
But that's the
wrong thing to do.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.820
You don't want to
be like that dragon

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.040
sitting on a hoard of gold
but doing nothing with it.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.190
You wish to use a
monetization platform that

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.440
saves you leg works.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.550
We call it "audience aware."

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.260
It will automatically
predict likely spenders.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.820
In-App Payment House Ads help
you grow your overall revenue

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.970
and create new revenue streams.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.740
Imagine an app were only 3%
of the users make purchases.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.630
Those 3% are loyal and engaged.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.540
There may be items
in your game that

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.770
will help them progress
to the next level.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.370
But they don't know about it.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.580
You can create an
In-App Payment House Ads

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.740
and promote a particular
items to them.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.790
The smart thing is that
AdMob uses Google algorithms

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.270
and machine learning to
only show those ads to users

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.850
who are likely to buy.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.180
The good part is this for
the other 97% of users

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.370
who won't make any purchase,
you could show a regular ad,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.450
creating a new incremental
revenue stream for your game.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.260
Let's have a look
at the case study.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.060
We ran two experiments.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.570
On the first case, we
showed an arbitrary sample

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.360
of users an In-House
Payment offer wall.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.290
In our second experiment, we
showed the same offer wall,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.330
but this time only
showed it to users

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.720
that our algorithms predicted
that would be a spender.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.440
As you can see, the
results were great.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.580
What gets me excited
is what we could

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.940
do we do out there
139,000 of persons

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.030
that weren't exposed to the
In-App Payments offer wall.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.390
By leveraging AdMob,
ads would predict

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.008
a revenue increase or five
times over the first case.

00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:18.880
[CHEERING]

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.760
So this is the way to improve
your monetization strategy

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.340
and keep a smile on your users.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.400
We use In-App Payment
House Ads in order

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.240
to serve the right ad
to the right users.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.100
On our next episode,
we will see how

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.400
to get more users to your app.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.610
Cool?

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.910
Until next time,
eat your vegetables,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.700
create cool In-App Payments,
and listen to your partners.
