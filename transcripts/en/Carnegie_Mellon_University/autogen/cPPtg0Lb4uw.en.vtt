to see him you I really wanted to do
 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.000
to see him you I really wanted to do
something different application wise but

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
something different application wise but
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.220
something different application wise but
similar technology wise with my with my

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230
similar technology wise with my with my
 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.930
similar technology wise with my with my
skills with my background and so I

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940
skills with my background and so I
 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.870
skills with my background and so I
changed over from very expensive

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880
changed over from very expensive
 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.639

spacecraft to what does what do we need
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.139
spacecraft to what does what do we need
on this planet what's going to make a

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149
on this planet what's going to make a
 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.940
on this planet what's going to make a
real difference and so one of the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950
real difference and so one of the
 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.740
real difference and so one of the
projects I do is large-scale energy

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750
projects I do is large-scale energy
 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.719

solar and for developing countries and
 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.370
solar and for developing countries and
so I do a lot of work in that arena I

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380
so I do a lot of work in that arena I
 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.840
so I do a lot of work in that arena I
also do a fair amount of work on things

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850
also do a fair amount of work on things
 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.349
also do a fair amount of work on things
like do electric vehicles make sense how

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359
like do electric vehicles make sense how
 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.139
like do electric vehicles make sense how
to electric vehicles are they too

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149
to electric vehicles are they too
 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.969
to electric vehicles are they too
expensive or not will the batteries last

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979
expensive or not will the batteries last
 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.319
expensive or not will the batteries last
this is really about the technology

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329
this is really about the technology
 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.849
this is really about the technology
inside these vehicles and it's also

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859
inside these vehicles and it's also
 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.800
inside these vehicles and it's also
about consumers interest in buying them

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
about consumers interest in buying them
 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.599
about consumers interest in buying them
so I collaborate with a variety of CMU

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609
so I collaborate with a variety of CMU
 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.139
so I collaborate with a variety of CMU
folks to understand the meaning of

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149
folks to understand the meaning of
 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.340
folks to understand the meaning of
electrified transportation is it

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350
electrified transportation is it
 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.069

legitimate and why and I think it's CMU

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079
legitimate and why and I think it's CMU
 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.160
legitimate and why and I think it's CMU
we pride ourselves in being skeptical

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170
we pride ourselves in being skeptical
 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.349
we pride ourselves in being skeptical
and doing really strong analytical work

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359
and doing really strong analytical work
 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.319
and doing really strong analytical work
to support our our ideas about

to support our our ideas about
 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.149
to support our our ideas about
conclusions and one of the things that

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159
conclusions and one of the things that
 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.669
conclusions and one of the things that
that's been maybe most prominent of what

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.000
the first one is off grid or micro grids
these are in developing countries or

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
these are in developing countries or
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.979
these are in developing countries or
places where there's not a really well

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989
places where there's not a really well
 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.989

the other application is much larger and

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159
the other application is much larger and
 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.949
the other application is much larger and
it's going to take a bit longer for us

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959
it's going to take a bit longer for us
 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.080
it's going to take a bit longer for us
to be big enough to make things that are

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090
to be big enough to make things that are
 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910
to be big enough to make things that are
big enough to impact it and that's the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
big enough to impact it and that's the
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.470
big enough to impact it and that's the
North American power grid and there are

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480
North American power grid and there are
 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.629
North American power grid and there are
a lot of places where there are pinch

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639
a lot of places where there are pinch
 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.240
a lot of places where there are pinch
points where for whatever reason moving

electrons around the grid are very
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.319
electrons around the grid are very
expensive or not possible at the right

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329
expensive or not possible at the right
 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.209
expensive or not possible at the right
times a day and one way to relieve that

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219
times a day and one way to relieve that
 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.699
times a day and one way to relieve that
is to put a big thing that stores energy

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
is to put a big thing that stores energy
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.800
is to put a big thing that stores energy
it's a big block black box electrons in

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
it's a big block black box electrons in
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.559
it's a big block black box electrons in
and electrons out and a battery is

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569
and electrons out and a battery is
 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.819
and electrons out and a battery is
certainly one way to do it but we have

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829
certainly one way to do it but we have
 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.199
certainly one way to do it but we have
to get to the right cost point and the

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209
to get to the right cost point and the
 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.659
to get to the right cost point and the
right price point and we are on a very

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669
right price point and we are on a very
 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.369
right price point and we are on a very
good course to be there in a handful of

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379
good course to be there in a handful of
 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.650
good course to be there in a handful of
years
