Cambridge Mass Society when they have
 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.150
Cambridge Mass Society when they have
lectures about mathematics and they go

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160
lectures about mathematics and they go
 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.220

out socializing to the pub well the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
out socializing to the pub well the
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.709
out socializing to the pub well the
Society has this as their logo is a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
Society has this as their logo is a
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.710
Society has this as their logo is a
square made of other squares but all the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
square made of other squares but all the
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.990
square made of other squares but all the
squares of different sizes and so you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
squares of different sizes and so you
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.939
squares of different sizes and so you
see this one here with 50 well that

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
see this one here with 50 well that
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.400
see this one here with 50 well that
means it's a 50 unit by 50 unit square

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
means it's a 50 unit by 50 unit square
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.089
means it's a 50 unit by 50 unit square
this one here with the 35 is 35 by 35

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
this one here with the 35 is 35 by 35
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.070
this one here with the 35 is 35 by 35
all these squares are different sizes

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
all these squares are different sizes
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920
all these squares are different sizes
yet they fit together to make one big

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
yet they fit together to make one big
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.720
yet they fit together to make one big
square which is 112 by 112 so it's

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
square which is 112 by 112 so it's
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.880
square which is 112 by 112 so it's
called a squared square why have they

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890
called a squared square why have they
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220
called a squared square why have they
picked this as their logo for their

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
picked this as their logo for their
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.160
picked this as their logo for their
society their nerves well yeah and that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
society their nerves well yeah and that
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.959
society their nerves well yeah and that
and because it was Trinity math students

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
and because it was Trinity math students
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450
and because it was Trinity math students
that solved this this one is actually

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
that solved this this one is actually
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.869
that solved this this one is actually
the smallest possible squared square so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
the smallest possible squared square so
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180
the smallest possible squared square so
this is something that feels like it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
this is something that feels like it
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639
this is something that feels like it
would be done by the ancient Greeks or

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
would be done by the ancient Greeks or
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.170
would be done by the ancient Greeks or
something this feels like an old problem

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
something this feels like an old problem
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210
something this feels like an old problem
how can you make a square from other

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
how can you make a square from other
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.490
how can you make a square from other
squares of different sizes that feels

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
squares of different sizes that feels
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.380
squares of different sizes that feels
like a classic problem list and really

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
like a classic problem list and really
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.080
like a classic problem list and really
turn up until the 20th century which

surprises me we are integer squares

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540
surprises me we are integer squares
 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.149
surprises me we are integer squares
we're not using the same square twice or

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
we're not using the same square twice or
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.179
we're not using the same square twice or
if you do they're called imperfect so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
if you do they're called imperfect so
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.480
if you do they're called imperfect so
you can use that but I'd rather they're

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
you can use that but I'd rather they're
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.130
you can use that but I'd rather they're
all different sizes there were four

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
all different sizes there were four
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260
all different sizes there were four
students and the Trinity map society

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
students and the Trinity map society
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810
students and the Trinity map society
that really sold this problem they were

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
that really sold this problem they were
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.649

Brooks and built it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
Brooks and built it
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550
Brooks and built it
the first three were math students built

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
the first three were math students built
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289
the first three were math students built
it was actually a chemistry student but

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
it was actually a chemistry student but
 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.520
it was actually a chemistry student but
he was in the math society because we

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
he was in the math society because we
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.749
he was in the math society because we
like math so you don't have to be a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
like math so you don't have to be a
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.850
like math so you don't have to be a
mathematician to be in the math society

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
mathematician to be in the math society
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039
mathematician to be in the math society
and he was arthur stone who brought this

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
and he was arthur stone who brought this
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.719
and he was arthur stone who brought this
problem in who heard of this problem

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
problem in who heard of this problem
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370
problem in who heard of this problem
before the only thing that had been done

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
before the only thing that had been done
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.429
before the only thing that had been done
before was there were a couple of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
before was there were a couple of
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350
before was there were a couple of
rectangles that have been found made out

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
rectangles that have been found made out
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.380
rectangles that have been found made out
of squares not quite the same thing here

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
of squares not quite the same thing here
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090
of squares not quite the same thing here
they are just two there were just two

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
they are just two there were just two
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530
they are just two there were just two
rectangles I've been found

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
rectangles I've been found
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.929
rectangles I've been found
one of them uses nine squares the other

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
one of them uses nine squares the other
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.420
one of them uses nine squares the other
uses ten squares rectangles they are

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
uses ten squares rectangles they are
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.510
uses ten squares rectangles they are
easier than making squares but only two

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
easier than making squares but only two
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.270
easier than making squares but only two
have been found so far so the students

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
have been found so far so the students
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.770
have been found so far so the students
started to find more their methods were

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
started to find more their methods were
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.820
started to find more their methods were
a little bit add heart

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
a little bit add heart
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260
a little bit add heart
so they were trying to find these

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270
so they were trying to find these
 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.330
so they were trying to find these
rectangles we were hoping that they

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
rectangles we were hoping that they
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.690
rectangles we were hoping that they
would get lucky and find a square made

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
would get lucky and find a square made
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.760
would get lucky and find a square made
out of squares just by chance but it

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
out of squares just by chance but it
 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.510
out of squares just by chance but it
wasn't working

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520
wasn't working
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.790
wasn't working
they kept trying found rectangles but

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800
they kept trying found rectangles but
 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.650
they kept trying found rectangles but
they couldn't find a square we thought

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
they couldn't find a square we thought
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.000
they couldn't find a square we thought
right we're going to have to get more

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
right we're going to have to get more
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.830
right we're going to have to get more
systematic so when they started finding

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
systematic so when they started finding
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840
systematic so when they started finding
these rectangles made other squares

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850
these rectangles made other squares
 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.150
these rectangles made other squares
because okay let's do this

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160
because okay let's do this
 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.720
because okay let's do this
I started to extend the horizontal lines

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
I started to extend the horizontal lines
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.230
I started to extend the horizontal lines
like this you see this horizontal line

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240
like this you see this horizontal line
 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.770
like this you see this horizontal line
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu right

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu right
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.720
tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu right
once you've extended the lines we're

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730
once you've extended the lines we're
 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.610
once you've extended the lines we're
going to turn this rectangle into a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620
going to turn this rectangle into a
 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.070
going to turn this rectangle into a
network and what you do is you connect

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
network and what you do is you connect
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.370
network and what you do is you connect
two horizontal lines if the square are

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
two horizontal lines if the square are
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.890
two horizontal lines if the square are
touching so this one here 25 is touching

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
touching so this one here 25 is touching
 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.840
touching so this one here 25 is touching
these two horizontal lines that's the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850
these two horizontal lines that's the
 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.110
these two horizontal lines that's the
top of 25 and that's the bottom of 25 so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
top of 25 and that's the bottom of 25 so
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.060
top of 25 and that's the bottom of 25 so
I'm just going to connect them with a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070
I'm just going to connect them with a
 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.740
I'm just going to connect them with a
line I'm actually going to draw an arrow

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
line I'm actually going to draw an arrow
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.780
line I'm actually going to draw an arrow
here here to show top to bottom and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
here here to show top to bottom and
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.380
here here to show top to bottom and
markets that's the 25 square so I'm just

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390
markets that's the 25 square so I'm just
 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.760
markets that's the 25 square so I'm just
going to do the whole thing now with the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770
going to do the whole thing now with the
 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.550
going to do the whole thing now with the
networks so a 16 that's the top of 16 at

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560
networks so a 16 that's the top of 16 at
 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.900
networks so a 16 that's the top of 16 at
the bottom of 16 so let's connect those

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910
the bottom of 16 so let's connect those
 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.050
the bottom of 16 so let's connect those
with a line and I'll mark it with 16

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
with a line and I'll mark it with 16
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.520
with a line and I'll mark it with 16
after 16 line and then are keep going so

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530
after 16 line and then are keep going so
 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.790
after 16 line and then are keep going so
they turned it into a network and when

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800
they turned it into a network and when
 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.949
they turned it into a network and when
they did that they recognized it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
they did that they recognized it
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.500
they did that they recognized it
they went that seems familiar and why

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
they went that seems familiar and why
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.150
they went that seems familiar and why
they recognized it was because it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
they recognized it was because it
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.790
they recognized it was because it
reminded them of an electrical network

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800
reminded them of an electrical network
 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.120
reminded them of an electrical network
if you connect this to a battery and if

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
if you connect this to a battery and if
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.030
if you connect this to a battery and if
these were wires in a network and each

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040
these were wires in a network and each
 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.690
these were wires in a network and each
wire has one unit resistance and you

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700
wire has one unit resistance and you
 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.550
wire has one unit resistance and you
connect it to a battery which has the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560
connect it to a battery which has the
 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.790
connect it to a battery which has the
same potential as the height of the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800
same potential as the height of the
 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.640
same potential as the height of the
rectangle put all these numbers in these

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650
rectangle put all these numbers in these
 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.830

are the currents that flows through that

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840
are the currents that flows through that
 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.590
are the currents that flows through that
electrical network so suddenly they

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600
electrical network so suddenly they
 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.140
electrical network so suddenly they
realized that this was connected to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
realized that this was connected to
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.699
realized that this was connected to
electrical networks and they could use

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709
electrical networks and they could use
 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.680
electrical networks and they could use
all this maths that was already there

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690
all this maths that was already there
 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.710
all this maths that was already there
they could borrow it completely to solve

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720
they could borrow it completely to solve
 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.840
they could borrow it completely to solve
the squared squared problem in

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850
the squared squared problem in
 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.009
the squared squared problem in
particular these are called Kirchhoff's

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
particular these are called Kirchhoff's
 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.370
particular these are called Kirchhoff's
laws a couple of karakov laws are the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
laws a couple of karakov laws are the
 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.950
laws a couple of karakov laws are the
current flowing in to our point should

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960
current flowing in to our point should
 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.440
current flowing in to our point should
equal the current flowing out of a point

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450
equal the current flowing out of a point
 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.360
equal the current flowing out of a point
so let's look at the current flowing

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370
so let's look at the current flowing
 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.580
so let's look at the current flowing
into here

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590
into here
 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.680
into here
thirty-six is flowing in two is flowing

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690
thirty-six is flowing in two is flowing
 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.180
thirty-six is flowing in two is flowing
in so we've got thirty eight in total

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190
in so we've got thirty eight in total
 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.550
in so we've got thirty eight in total
flowing in and flowing out we've got

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560
flowing in and flowing out we've got
 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.580
flowing in and flowing out we've got
thirty three and a five so it they are

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
thirty three and a five so it they are
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.260
thirty three and a five so it they are
equal another thing you can learn from

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270
equal another thing you can learn from
 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.810

kerkhof laws if you've got a circuit

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820
kerkhof laws if you've got a circuit
 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.110
kerkhof laws if you've got a circuit
like this circuit here a circuit should

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
like this circuit here a circuit should
 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.810
like this circuit here a circuit should
make zero I'll show you what I mean

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820
make zero I'll show you what I mean
 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.020
make zero I'll show you what I mean
so from going from here we've got a nine

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030
so from going from here we've got a nine
 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.730
so from going from here we've got a nine
we've got a seven which makes sixteen

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740
we've got a seven which makes sixteen
 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.470
we've got a seven which makes sixteen
and then I go in the opposite direction

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480
and then I go in the opposite direction
 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.380
and then I go in the opposite direction
here so this is a minus sixteen so

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390
here so this is a minus sixteen so
 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.160
here so this is a minus sixteen so
altogether the whole circuit is a zero

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170
altogether the whole circuit is a zero
 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.750
altogether the whole circuit is a zero
yes all this maths suddenly you could

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760
yes all this maths suddenly you could
 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.540
yes all this maths suddenly you could
just follow and they could solve the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550
just follow and they could solve the
 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.790
just follow and they could solve the
squared squared problem couple of things

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800
squared squared problem couple of things
 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.340
squared squared problem couple of things
they solved on the way they showed that

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350
they solved on the way they showed that
 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.120
they solved on the way they showed that
the smallest squared rectangle just uses

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130
the smallest squared rectangle just uses
 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.580
the smallest squared rectangle just uses
nine squares and there's two of them

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590
nine squares and there's two of them
 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.160
nine squares and there's two of them
actually that's one of them that's the

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170
actually that's one of them that's the
 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.170
actually that's one of them that's the
smallest squared rectangle meaning it

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180
smallest squared rectangle meaning it
 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.600
smallest squared rectangle meaning it
just uses nine squares and the other one

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610
just uses nine squares and the other one
 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.270
just uses nine squares and the other one
was that one that was done before then

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280
was that one that was done before then
 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.190
was that one that was done before then
remember there were two that was done

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200
remember there were two that was done
 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.680
remember there were two that was done
previously one of those is a small

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690
previously one of those is a small
 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.230
previously one of those is a small
squared rectangle they showed that there

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240
squared rectangle they showed that there
 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.540
squared rectangle they showed that there
are no cubed cubes and that's kind of

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550
are no cubed cubes and that's kind of
 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.850
are no cubed cubes and that's kind of
disappointing you can't make a cube out

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860
disappointing you can't make a cube out
 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.000
disappointing you can't make a cube out
of cubes of different sizes so using

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010
of cubes of different sizes so using
 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.280
of cubes of different sizes so using
these networks they could find what made

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290
these networks they could find what made
 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.680
these networks they could find what made
valid squared rectangles and what are

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690
valid squared rectangles and what are
 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.570
valid squared rectangles and what are
not valid grade without having to draw

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580
not valid grade without having to draw
 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.550
not valid grade without having to draw
out the square rectangle so they started

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560
out the square rectangle so they started
 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.770
out the square rectangle so they started
build up a catalog one of the ideas was

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780
build up a catalog one of the ideas was
 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.290
build up a catalog one of the ideas was
if they could find a squared rectangle

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300
if they could find a squared rectangle
 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.930
if they could find a squared rectangle
and another squared rectangle that had

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940
and another squared rectangle that had
 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.240
and another squared rectangle that had
the same dimensions they could do it

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250
the same dimensions they could do it
 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.820
the same dimensions they could do it
like this a squared rectangle like that

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830
like this a squared rectangle like that
 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.600
like this a squared rectangle like that
and another one which have the same

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610
and another one which have the same
 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.400
and another one which have the same
dimensions but using completely

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410
dimensions but using completely
 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.740
dimensions but using completely
different squares inside so they're

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750
different squares inside so they're
 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.540
different squares inside so they're
mutually exclusive but they're the same

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550
mutually exclusive but they're the same
 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.910
mutually exclusive but they're the same
size then you could join them together

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920
size then you could join them together
 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.700
size then you could join them together
like this this would be a square up here

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710
like this this would be a square up here
 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.860
like this this would be a square up here
this would be a square here and it would

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870
this would be a square here and it would
 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.930
this would be a square here and it would
make a squared squared automatically or

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940
make a squared squared automatically or
 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.100
make a squared squared automatically or
if you can't do that wouldn't have you

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110
if you can't do that wouldn't have you
 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.630
if you can't do that wouldn't have you
so you want to avoid duplicates so you

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640
so you want to avoid duplicates so you
 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.670
so you want to avoid duplicates so you
want two squared rectangles which have

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680
want two squared rectangles which have
 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.460
want two squared rectangles which have
no squares in common that's what they

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470
no squares in common that's what they
 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.170
no squares in common that's what they
were looking for or maybe they could

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180
were looking for or maybe they could
 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.360
were looking for or maybe they could
have one square in common if it was a

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370
have one square in common if it was a
 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.940
have one square in common if it was a
corner square because you could do this

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950
corner square because you could do this
 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.379
corner square because you could do this
you can have a rectangle like this

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389
you can have a rectangle like this
 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:41.760
you can have a rectangle like this
another one that's meant to be exactly

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770
another one that's meant to be exactly
 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.279
another one that's meant to be exactly
the same dimension that just share one

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:44.289
the same dimension that just share one
 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:46.140
the same dimension that just share one
corner and that would make a squared

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150
corner and that would make a squared
 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.719
corner and that would make a squared
square as well so that was their plan

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729
square as well so that was their plan
 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.390
square as well so that was their plan
and it worked and they finally found one

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400
and it worked and they finally found one
 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.869
and it worked and they finally found one
the first squared square it was massive

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879
the first squared square it was massive
 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.270
the first squared square it was massive
the first one they found it used 55

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280
the first one they found it used 55
 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.640
the first one they found it used 55
squares and then he tried to improve it

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650
squares and then he tried to improve it
 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.170
squares and then he tried to improve it
they wanted to find smaller ones and

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180
they wanted to find smaller ones and
 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.110
they wanted to find smaller ones and
they found one that used 38 built it

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120
they found one that used 38 built it
 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.929
they found one that used 38 built it
found one used 26 and these were getting

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:06.939
found one used 26 and these were getting
 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:09.240
found one used 26 and these were getting
better and the question was what's the

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250
better and the question was what's the
 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.719
better and the question was what's the
smallest square square now that is

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729
smallest square square now that is
 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.629
smallest square square now that is
something they struggled with because it

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639
something they struggled with because it
 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.300
something they struggled with because it
became too hard a problem and this was a

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310
became too hard a problem and this was a
 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.149
became too hard a problem and this was a
problem that was then left open for

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:21.159
problem that was then left open for
 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:25.709
problem that was then left open for
another 38 years until the 1970s until

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:25.719
another 38 years until the 1970s until
 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:27.839
another 38 years until the 1970s until
computers came along and in using

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849
computers came along and in using
 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:30.300
computers came along and in using
computers they could use these students
