why why do we need the middleman just

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690
why why do we need the middleman just
 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.390
why why do we need the middleman just
tell us the reasons why it's wrong and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400
tell us the reasons why it's wrong and
 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.290
tell us the reasons why it's wrong and
okay and if it's just because God said

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300
okay and if it's just because God said
 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.630
okay and if it's just because God said
it what if he he didn't say murder was

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
it what if he he didn't say murder was
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.210
it what if he he didn't say murder was
wrong would that make it right no no it

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220
wrong would that make it right no no it
 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.370
wrong would that make it right no no it
would still be wrong so either way you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
would still be wrong so either way you
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990
would still be wrong so either way you
don't need God so here we are in our

well not quite that but they have
 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.020
well not quite that but they have
different variations on on how its it's

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030
different variations on on how its it's
 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.449
different variations on on how its it's
allowed or but just take anything you

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459
allowed or but just take anything you
 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.890
allowed or but just take anything you
know that so these are 50 different

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900
know that so these are 50 different
 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.470
know that so these are 50 different
experiments every Supreme Court justice

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480
experiments every Supreme Court justice
 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.660
experiments every Supreme Court justice
decision is an experiment ok let's see

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670
decision is an experiment ok let's see
 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.100
decision is an experiment ok let's see
what happens now that they decided this

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110
what happens now that they decided this
 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.100
what happens now that they decided this
let's measure the consequences of this

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110
let's measure the consequences of this
 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.979
let's measure the consequences of this
you know the the 19th amendment of

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989
you know the the 19th amendment of
 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.290
you know the the 19th amendment of
abolishing alcohol okay this was an

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300
abolishing alcohol okay this was an
 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.870
abolishing alcohol okay this was an
experiment a failed experiment so if the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880
experiment a failed experiment so if the
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.630
experiment a failed experiment so if the
if your goal is to reduce the amount of

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640
if your goal is to reduce the amount of
 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.180
if your goal is to reduce the amount of
drinking that didn't work so 21st

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190
drinking that didn't work so 21st
 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.620
drinking that didn't work so 21st
amendment abolished is the 19th

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630
amendment abolished is the 19th
 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.479
amendment abolished is the 19th
amendment those are all experiments so

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489
amendment those are all experiments so
 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.780
amendment those are all experiments so
this is what I'm talking about that is

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790
this is what I'm talking about that is
 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.640
this is what I'm talking about that is
this idea that David Hume put forth that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650
this idea that David Hume put forth that
 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.530
this idea that David Hume put forth that
you can't derive a naught from it is

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540
you can't derive a naught from it is
 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.480
you can't derive a naught from it is
this is a red herring this is a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490
this is a red herring this is a
 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.870
this is a red herring this is a
misdirection to that I say mr. Hume tear

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880
misdirection to that I say mr. Hume tear
 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.480
misdirection to that I say mr. Hume tear
down this wall

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490
down this wall
 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.339
down this wall
of course we can breach that wall of

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349
of course we can breach that wall of
 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.960
of course we can breach that wall of
course we can discover certain things

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970
course we can discover certain things
 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.939
course we can discover certain things
about what we ought to do based on the

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949
about what we ought to do based on the
 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.800
about what we ought to do based on the
nature of reality now here I'm not

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810
nature of reality now here I'm not
 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.480
nature of reality now here I'm not
talking about like because ants have

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490
talking about like because ants have
 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.290
talking about like because ants have
slavery or chimpanzees have war that we

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300
slavery or chimpanzees have war that we
 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.760
slavery or chimpanzees have war that we
should have slavery in war no I mean

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770
should have slavery in war no I mean
 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.760
should have slavery in war no I mean
what is the real nature of war and and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770
what is the real nature of war and and
 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.790
what is the real nature of war and and
how should we reduce it understanding it

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800
how should we reduce it understanding it
 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.920
how should we reduce it understanding it
through the scientific study of war is a

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930
through the scientific study of war is a
 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.499
through the scientific study of war is a
way to get to attenuating it that's all

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509
way to get to attenuating it that's all
 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.210
way to get to attenuating it that's all
I mean and the reason we want to

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220
I mean and the reason we want to
 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.860
I mean and the reason we want to
attenuate is because it's bad for

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870
attenuate is because it's bad for
 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.529
attenuate is because it's bad for
sentient beings it reduces the amount of

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539
sentient beings it reduces the amount of
 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.510
sentient beings it reduces the amount of
survival and flourishing so that's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520
survival and flourishing so that's
 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.430
survival and flourishing so that's
that's my argument for more real moral

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
that's my argument for more real moral
 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.570
that's my argument for more real moral
realism

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580
realism
 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.830
realism
