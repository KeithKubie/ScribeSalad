[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:12.270
GABY WOOD: I'm very pleased to
reintroduce you to Andy, who--

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.980
well, you don't
need more details--

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.390
but is a great friend of
mine, I'm very proud to say.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.340
He writes about all manner of
things, great essays and books,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.390
indeed, about missing persons,
about war, politics, fashion,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.110
the press.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.360
Jimmy Savile, he's written
about not so long ago,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.984
and the trappings of fame.

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:34.400
You've heard that he's the
author of numerous novels, five

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.180
novels, two works of
nonfiction, and many awards.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.910
But I want to say a little
bit about how he writes,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.295
not just what he writes about.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:43.670
There are a couple
of things I've

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.050
heard you say recently that made
me think of your own writing.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.890
One is that the world is
vastly under-described,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.860
and the other is to do
with beauty of thought.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.440
That's not something that is
much introduced in journalism

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.360
these days, but it's
something that is very

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.980
particular the way Andy writes.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.290
I mean, he's an
incredible investigator,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.260
you'll see from this book,
like an old fashioned gumshoe

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.820
or detective.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.950
Incredibly good at
marshaling the information

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.030
he gathers also, which is rare.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.020
But as well as
that, I think there

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.200
are some incredible
and incredibly elegant,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.070
frightening, if anything,
ideas in this book that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760
will alter your mind, perhaps,
even without the need for some

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.200
of the illegal drugs available
on the internet, which there

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.390
are also some instructions
about in here.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.170
So please do read it.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.835
And I know you each have a copy.

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:37.460
We'll talk a little
bit about it first.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.740
There are three essays in
the book, originally written

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.115
for the "London
Review of Books,"

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:43.820
very long pieces-- well,
two very long pieces,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.150
one about Julian Assange, as you
heard, one about Craig Wright,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.650
also known as Satoshi Nakamoto,
who is the founder of the cyber

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.092
currency Bitcoin.

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:54.925
And one about the
possibilities of inventing

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:57.786
a self over the internet.

00:01:57.786 --> 00:01:59.660
And Andrew will talk a
little bit about that.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.130
I mean, just to begin with,
these are linked pieces.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.690
Can you talk a
little bit about how

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.398
they evolved from each
other, or how they

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.580
were conceived at the start?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.400
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Funnily
enough, the one that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.110
wasn't part of an invitation--

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.170
I was invited by Julian
Assange and his representatives

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.060
to help him write his memoir.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.960
That's a whole story in itself.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.620
And I was approached by Craig
Wright, the purported inventor

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.540
of Bitcoin much later, not
to help him write a book,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.960
but to be the subject of
a book that I might write.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.200
So those two were, as it
were, offered up to me.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.760
I suppose offered
up not innocently,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.040
because I had
already established

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.400
an interest in questions of
selfhood and disappearance

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.320
in the age of the internet.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.660
The middle story, though,
was what really started them.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.140
I'd been carrying it in my head
for quite a long time, I think

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.070
for possibly, 12 or 13 years,
a notion that I would like

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.020
to write an extended
nonfiction piece where I took

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.930
the name of a dead child,
and fashioned a life

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.700
based on that name.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.910
Doing effectively, what
the Metropolitan Police had

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.320
famously or infamously
done in London

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.250
for many years, which
was to build legends

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.550
around these names they'd
found in graveyards.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.360
And using those
names, those legends,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.550
those false identities, they
would infiltrate left wing

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.509
groups around the country.

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.050
And they went a bit far, some
of those officers, in the sense

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.780
that they lived a
wholly second life.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.520
Married people, had children in
their second life whilst going

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.142
home, if you like, to
their first identity.

00:03:40.142 --> 00:03:41.600
So I was interested
in all of that.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600
And I felt that that
story, if I could write it,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.330
would tell you
something about a way

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.170
of having a self,
multiple selves possibly,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.130
in the age of internet.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.250
And that really was just
stating and growing in me

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.862
for a long time even before
I began the Assange project.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.320
But once I wrote
the Assange story,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.680
I knew that it was inevitable.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.230
I would write the life
of Ronnie Pinn, the story

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.970
of a invented identity.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.730
And that led-- because Bitcoin
comes up in that story--

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.320
I was alert to Bitcoin when
I finished the Ronnie Pinn.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.769
And it was at that point that
these Los Angeles lawyers

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.370
contacted me with the idea
that I might be furnished

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.270
with all the details of
this man, Craig Wright, who

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.699
claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.490
GABY WOOD: And that
was just a coincidence.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.150
I mean, you were
using Bitcoin currency

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.607
in order to buy things on
the internet as Ronnie Pinn.

00:04:31.607 --> 00:04:32.440
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yes.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.250
GABY WOOD: But then
they approached you,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.370
they had no idea
you'd been doing that.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.703
ANDREW O'HAGAN: No, they didn't.

00:04:35.703 --> 00:04:40.460
I mean, they felt, from
reading novels of mine,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.160
and nonfiction pieces,
that I might be

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.990
the right person for the job.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.460
I'm always a bit
curious as to why

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.590
they think I'm the right
person for those jobs.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.530
Because I have to
say, especially here

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.480
in the environs at Google--

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.130
I mean, I'm not
a natural techie.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.990
I'm not ultra-experienced
in these matters.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.500
I had to really make a journey.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.300
You often do, as you
know, as a writer

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.350
of fiction and nonfiction,
you sort of disappear

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.830
into the world beyond
your ignorance,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.830
if you know what I mean.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.030
You start off-- often the
best position, in fact,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.144
to be starting off is
to know very little.

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:19.330
I knew very little
about cryptocurrency

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.440
when I met Craig Wright.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.260
By the end, I think, I'd been
living with it for the best

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.602
part of a year, and was inside
the whole eccentric sort

00:05:27.602 --> 00:05:30.340
of worlds within
worlds that exist.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.090
I'm sure many of the listeners
will know about that world.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.300
And its very strange.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.000
Its almost like a
simulacrum of a society,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
a sort of society going
slightly wrong, I would argue.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.686
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:45.120
ANDREW O'HAGAN: It's unstable.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.180
And they're very unstable
about each other.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.150
It's not a natural
harmonious world

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.260
of learning and investigation,
the world of computer science.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.330
Sometimes-- certainly, when
it came to Craig Wright

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.790
and the question of Satoshi--

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.574
it was a giant sort of
school playground for me.

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:02.240
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240
Well, Google comes up in
that story, doesn't it?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.890
Because there's a
suggestion-- there's

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.380
a very interesting distinction
between the currency

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.690
and the idea for the currency.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.020
You know, could he be
prosecuted, for instance,

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.650
if guns were bought
with his currency?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.370
Which you do as Ronnie
Pinn, incidentally.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.150
Then could he be prosecuted?

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.110
But in fact, what was suggested
was that what could be sold

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.611
was the intellectual property,
which was the idea behind it.

00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:30.526
And perhaps that would
be sold even to Google.

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:32.310
I mean, the lawyer has
an idea about that.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.601
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Well, the
men in black, as I call them,

00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:37.110
which was the two, the
one from Vancouver,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.150
and the other man from Australia
who were joining forces

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.410
to repackage the purported
Satoshi's patents

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.990
and sell them to, as it
were, Google was certainly

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.979
in the frame at one point,
and being shown this material.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.770
And the figures were
very high, because you

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.470
were talking about pretty
advanced and quite excellent

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.010
patents, moving towards AI,
and developments linking

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.070
the blockchain to developments
in artificial intelligence

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.810
in a way that was pretty
pucker, and certainly fresh.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.800
And those patents-- many of
them have been established,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.250
or registered, anyway.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.190
And so there was big
money being suggested.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:26.100
And the muckiness of
Craig Wright's world,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.580
and his tax affairs, and the
question of prosecutions,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.050
which I have to say, I always
thought were ludicrous.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.970
I mean, to prosecute the people
who administer crypto currency

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.180
because it's used for
illicit purposes would

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.920
be a bit like prosecuting
the Bank of England

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.897
because there was a
suitcase of tenners

00:07:45.897 --> 00:07:48.480
found at King's Cross that were
going to be used to buy drugs.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.110
I mean, it's ludicrous.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.370
The currency is just a thing.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.580
GABY WOOD: Well, but it's
indicative of the fear.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.290
People don't really
know what this is.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.860
How would the law respond
to something so new?

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.550
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I think there's
a lot of fear in that way.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.133
I mean, I get a lot
of correspondence,

00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:04.820
and a lot of questions
coming from people who--

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.260
they're frightened
of cryptocurrency.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.230
I mean, people who have
mortgages, that is to say,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.920
most people who have mortgages
and who have pensions, and who

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.580
pay into funds of various
sorts, and insurances,

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.410
they worry that
the thing they've

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:24.810
been doing all their life is, as
it were, bogus or meaningless.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.643
And of course it is.

00:08:25.643 --> 00:08:26.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.560
And that's very hard
to take, if you've

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.160
been paying into a
pension for 40 years,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.730
to suddenly to
realize that it's just

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.780
a kind of a piece
of mathematics.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.650
And so what one of the things
that cryptocurrency does,

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.910
I think, is that makes
that absolutely explicit.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.870
When you get into
talking about currency,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.225
and you realize that in
certain parts of civilizations

00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:53.360
in the past, people used
shells, or they used feathers,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.770
or we use pieces of paper
with the Queen's face stamped

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.280
on them.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.120
It's all ludicrous.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.020
It's as ludicrous, or no
less so than lines of code,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.990
you might argue.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.460
But lines of code--

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.490
which, of course, is what all
our bank accounts are now--

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.290
cause people to have a
nervous breakdown, as opposed

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.150
to a suitcase of tenners,
which seems to mean something.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.650
I, mean--

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.790
GABY WOOD: Yeah,
because it's material

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.730
ANDREW O'HAGAN: --a child's eyes
would widen if you handed them

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.420
a bunch of 50 pound notes.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.520
If you said oh, I've just
installed on your computer, 20

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.940
Bitcoin, they might
go, well, show me

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.730
what I can do with that.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.030
But increasingly, of course--

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.660
GABY WOOD: Well,
though, the kids would--

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:30.850
ANDREW O'HAGAN: --generation--

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:31.830
GABY WOOD: --be more likely to--

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.690
ANDREW O'HAGAN: --they
are much more likely.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.130
GABY WOOD: --to appreciate it.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.755
ANDREW O'HAGAN: They
just need to check

00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:37.822
today's value of one
Bitcoin, and they know

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.030
that you were enriching them.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.190
But obviously, for
those of us who

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.999
grew up before digital
currency, we have trouble.

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:45.540
And some people are
frightened of it.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.373
But I don't see why.

00:09:46.373 --> 00:09:49.686
Now that I've worked with it,
I think it's wholly logical.

00:09:49.686 --> 00:09:51.642
GABY WOOD: Well, it is
actually sort of one

00:09:51.642 --> 00:09:53.850
of these ideas that shows
you what you've been living

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.020
with all along, I supposed.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.900
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yeah, it's sort
of turns it up to the light

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.190
that it's always been a
sort of invented thing.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.430
Money is a bit of a--

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.642
GABY WOOD: Mirage.

00:10:03.642 --> 00:10:05.058
ANDREW O'HAGAN:
--and the question

00:10:05.058 --> 00:10:10.960
of value isn't an actual, real,
touchable thing in the way

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.780
that I think we
imagine it is when

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.910
we see a stack of
paper in our wallet,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.130
we think, well,
that's what I'm worth.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.240
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.140
ANDREW O'HAGAN: The
question of what

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.710
you're worth is actually
behind all this.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.870
GABY WOOD: Well, exactly.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.820
That's what [INAUDIBLE] coming
to, the idea of being human.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.590
But do you want to
talk a little bit

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.144
about Assange, how you found
him to be in the first place?

00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:30.060
I'm sure you're very
interested in how he was.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.000
I mean, right at
the beginning, you

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.230
seem to have been
quite convinced

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.900
that he was a courageous
person, regardless

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.470
of how he was in his habits.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.660
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I was very
struck by the position

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.160
he was in when I
first met him, that

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.910
is to say a man wearing
an electronic ankle

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.660
bracelet, effectively under
house arrest in Ellingham

00:10:51.660 --> 00:11:00.480
Hall, a large country house
outside Bungay, of all places,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.340
in Norfolk.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.410
And I was invited there
to come and meet him.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.700
And I had followed
the Wikileaks case,

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.740
if you like, pretty
much from the beginning.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.990
I was fascinated by
what they were doing.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.600
I've always been fascinated
by both individuals

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.600
and institutions and
publications that speak truth

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.380
to power in that way,
and seek to undermine

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.050
the secret bonds that can
exist between governments

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.590
and the media, or the media and
certain individuals in society,

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:34.000
or big money issues and causes,
and the flow of information.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.590
The relationship between
marketing and publicity

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.480
and morality has
always interested me.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.100
So I thought there
it is, there's

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.970
an organization,
finally, that is not

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.040
allowing any of
these relationships

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.810
to be taken for granted.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.870
And the Afghan war
logs made it clear

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.280
that there had been a
rather corrupt relationship

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.570
between the Ministry of
Defense, for example,

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.580
or American military
authorities and news gatherers.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.150
The civilian casualties
after certain military raids

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.490
by the Americans
and the UK forces

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.420
were being actually
misrepresented.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.650
Or sometimes, if a rocket
was fired into a building,

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.670
you would see an actual log
that was published by Wikileaks

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:27.550
that 35 people had died in that
attack as collateral damage,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.410
or civilian casualties.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.180
That was reported in the
actual contemporaneous log

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.820
by a military officer.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.820
But then when you looked
at the news reports,

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.340
you saw that it
said three had died.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.945
And that was happening
all the time.

00:12:40.945 --> 00:12:43.070
And so I thought that was
a wonderful contribution.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.080
That's just one example.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.970
They were doing
enormously good work,

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.090
and still are certain
quarters, trying

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.250
to reveal how these
relationships are corrupt,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.510
and the information
is not to be trusted,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.400
and that bonds of secrecy
are, to some extent,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.382
self-serving for
those individuals.

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:04.465
So that was the good news.

00:13:04.465 --> 00:13:05.260
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.880
And then you were presented
with the individual [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.713
ANDREW O'HAGAN: And
then it becomes not just

00:13:08.713 --> 00:13:10.390
about an organization
doing good work,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.970
or struggling to introduce a
new idea of honesty, truth,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.130
and progress into
society, but it comes down

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.690
to a series of individuals.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.290
And the main individual, of
course, was Julian Assange.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.800
I got on very well with
him personally at the time.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.730
I find him to be quite brave.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:33.760
And he was in a situation
of threat at that time.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.830
The Americans had declared that
they wished to prosecute him

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.440
under the Espionage Act.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.024
There were other much
less clear threats to him.

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:47.190
There was the Swedish rape
allegations, for example.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.390
GABY WOOD: Well, what was
your position on that?

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.850
I mean, so you're
approaching this man.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.550
He's got on one hand,
he's courageous,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.110
he's exposing the US government.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.940
On the other hand, several
women are accusing him of rape.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.524
I mean, you're
going into his den.

00:13:58.524 --> 00:14:00.190
How do you feel about
that [INAUDIBLE]??

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.420
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Well,
I wanted them always

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.710
to be two separate issues.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.410
They are two separate issues.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.840
If, as it were--

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.950
let's just deal on a
fictitious possible executive

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.700
editor at a Boston newspaper.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.312
If he or she was
accused of rape,

00:14:19.312 --> 00:14:21.270
and you were making an
assessment of their work

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.728
at the Boston newspaper, they
would be two separate things.

00:14:23.728 --> 00:14:27.790
What's the newspaper doing, what
happened in his private life?

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.680
But Assange himself created
a disastrous conflation

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.770
between the two, in my opinion.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.860
And I was with him for really,
the best part of a year.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.420
When he moved out
of Ellingham Hall

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.180
into the Ecuadorian
embassy, I thought

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.990
that was a very ethically
dodgy move as well,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:52.000
to seek asylum
with a nation that

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.879
has no great record on
freedom of expression.

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:57.170
But that's a whole other issue.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.080
That's where he chose to go.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.660
He was there.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.600
I used to see him there.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.150
And at that point,
that conflation

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.610
I'm talking about between
the threat from the Americans

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.300
to close him down--

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.630
that's a First Amendment issue.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.220
He published the
same material that

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.730
was published by
"The New York Times"

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.049
and by "The Guardian,"
and by "Der Spiegel."

00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:20.090
And if you're going to
prosecute Julian Assange--

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.110
and I'd even say that today-- if
you're going to prosecute him,

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.590
you need to prosecute them.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.200
And of course, none of
them should be prosecuted.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.550
They did the work of
old-fashioned, truth-telling,

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.120
campaigning journalism,
speaking truth to power.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.970
And no matter how unsavory
or how unattractive

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.374
a defender of liberty Julian
Assange or any of them are,

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:42.790
I would stick up for the right
to do the work that they've

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:43.890
been doing.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.090
You've been asking
about this conflation.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.080
Suddenly, that need
to represent and fight

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.360
for truth was blended in
his account of his situation

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.610
with the Swedish allegations.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.220
Even the other day, I saw
him appearing in the balcony

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.180
with his fist raised at when
the Swedish allegations had

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.920
been dropped.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.270
Now that was not a
victory for liberty.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.090
He did not escape from
a false accusation.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.000
He simply didn't allow
himself to be questioned.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.060
Now he might have
come on to the balcony

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.640
and explained that
there had been

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.770
a disastrous misunderstanding.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.870
He could have expressed
empathy with the two

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.707
women who felt that they
had to make that accusation.

00:16:29.707 --> 00:16:31.290
He could have done
a number of things.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.840
But to position himself as
the victim in that case,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.550
and conflate it
in his description

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.800
of his situation
of being in forced

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.720
detention-- he's not
in forced detention.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.000
He could walk out today.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.080
And it's a bit like a child who
goes la, la, la, la and hopes

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.980
that the truth won't penetrate.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.350
And that's what I found to
be true again and again,

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.250
is that he was obfuscating and
dissembling to such an extent,

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.290
that if you're writing a book
with a person lying to you,

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.800
and it's a memoir, that's
incredibly hazardous.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.704
And that's the position
I find myself in.

00:17:07.704 --> 00:17:09.537
GABY WOOD: So interesting,
because actually,

00:17:09.537 --> 00:17:12.454
the whole book is about lies,
different kinds of lies,

00:17:12.454 --> 00:17:13.829
lies that you tell
yourself, lies

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:14.995
that people tell each other.

00:17:14.995 --> 00:17:17.050
Fiction-- is it a lie?

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.920
What kinds of invention?

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.140
And in that case,
you can understand

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.020
that he has created
a paranoid scenario,

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.019
or at least he's entered
a paranoid scenario,

00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:30.170
and perhaps created
exaggerations of that.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.770
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I
mean, I always felt,

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:37.250
and I still feel that
for any of us, if there's

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.300
an accusation of that sort, you
have to go and clear your name.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.680
That's not just a
sort of empty phrase.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.920
Clearing your name is a thing.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.550
I feel sorry for Julian now,
because of his own actions,

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:53.446
and the pressures upon him, some
of which have been unnatural.

00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:55.070
He's put himself in
a position of never

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.540
being able to clear
his name on that count.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.970
I told him at the
time, regardless

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.910
of all the threats of
extradition, all the threats--

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.340
and I know that's easy for us
to say, but if you're brave,

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.510
you're brave.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.220
You stand up for
what you published,

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.120
and you go and face whatever
these terrifying and awful

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.350
threats are.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.870
And if he had done
that, the entire world

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.896
community of freedom
fighters and people

00:18:19.896 --> 00:18:22.270
who believed in the First
Amendment in the United States,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.730
people who believed in
freedom of expression,

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.060
would have come around
him and supported him.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.890
He would have been
the hero of the age

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.660
in freedom of expression terms.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:37.710
Instead of which, he's left
with this absolutely unanswered

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.760
series of questions
about what happened

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.560
with the Swedish girls.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.200
And he's conflated it with
a precarious situation

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.570
he has in relation to
the American threat.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:52.360
And it's never going to be
solved unless he individually

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.470
takes each issue one at a
time, and deals with them.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:01.420
And at the time, I kept
saying appearing in America

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:07.210
before these people with their
bogus and unconstitutional

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.550
attempt to take
him down or silence

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.060
him would have made him a
great exemplar and a great hero

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.000
in this area.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.389
And I never understood
why he didn't do that.

00:19:19.389 --> 00:19:21.430
GABY WOOD: Yeah, it's
interesting that he didn't.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.299
I mean, let's talk about lying
generally, as a sort of--

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:25.840
there's an idea that
comes up in here

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.640
about lying as a
kind of signature.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.119
I mean, if you're a writer,
or if you're a coder,

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:33.160
it doesn't really matter.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.920
You're kind of writing
or doing as only you can,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:42.100
and so lying is your
medium in some way.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.320
I mean, the Ronnie
Pinn story is that.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.920
You've invented somebody.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.140
He is a lie.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.550
You're entering a fiction.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.870
I mean, it's a
nonfiction account.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.250
But essentially, it's a sort
of live version of what you

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.766
do when you're writing a novel.

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:56.890
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Absolutely.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:01.570
And I think as somebody
who's spent all my career now

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.355
writing fiction and
nonfiction, and walking

00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:07.229
the rather unstable borders
sometimes between the two--

00:20:07.229 --> 00:20:09.520
I mean, I've always been
interested in the relationship

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.730
between what is imagined
and what is real,

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.930
or what is fiction and
what is journalism.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.820
And the relationships
between all of them

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.860
have always been
slightly unstable for me,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.950
and I've been excited by that.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.960
And now I've got to
the position where

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.460
the whole idea of the
fictional nature of the times

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.620
has become a fascinating
subject to me.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.970
You only need to use
the words Donald Trump

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.040
and you begin to see that the
stable relationship that you

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:45.780
might wish to assume was reality
is quite a big assumption now.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.514
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:20:46.514 --> 00:20:48.180
ANDREW O'HAGAN: In
the era of fake news,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:54.570
and the era of a purported
leader of the free world

00:20:54.570 --> 00:21:02.800
who can use his handheld
device to promulgate lies,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.410
and fictions, and
false statements,

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.000
and question the
number of people

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.060
who were there in a
photographable place,

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.730
watching his inauguration.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.800
Can actually argue with
the photographic evidence

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.780
from his own-- not
through public relations,

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.360
not through the press briefing,
not through interviews

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.630
he might give-- but through
his own direct contact

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.900
with an audience of millions.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.010
And that is an aspect of
the world we're living in.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.150
And fiction writers
and nonfiction writers

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.660
might take an interest in that.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.420
I can't understand
how anybody would

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.704
find that sort of unremarkable.

00:21:36.704 --> 00:21:37.370
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.040
No, extraordinary.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.950
But also, the idea that people
withhold information just

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.320
in daily life.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.740
That's a truth.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.730
That's a fact.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.306
And but it's also a fiction.

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:49.180
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.844
GABY WOOD: How about this idea
of men who are not really men?

00:21:53.844 --> 00:21:55.510
I mean, Ronnie Pinn
is not really a man,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.760
because he literally
does not exist.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.250
But there's also Craig
Wright's oddness.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.210
Assange, also, you felt was
sort possibly on the spectrum.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.870
I mean, it must
have made you ask--

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.494
I mean, it's clear
that it made you ask

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:08.830
what it is that makes us human.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.490
I mean, two men, the
two real men, so-called,

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.430
have kind of lost
something of their humanity

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.052
through their circumstances.

00:22:17.052 --> 00:22:19.510
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I think it's
an interesting question, that.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.130
Because I did ask myself a lot
with those particular guys,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.160
if there wasn't
something alarmingly

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.140
arrested in each case.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.590
And I have to say that so many
of the people that I worked

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.770
with in relation to the
cryptocurrency question

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:40.150
and in relation
to Wikileaks were

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.950
either on the spectrum
by their own admission,

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.430
or had some sense of arrested
development, that they were

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.830
stuck in a kind of childhood
fantasia about rectitude,

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.950
and about being vindicated.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.560
The amazing thing about Assange
in particular was that--

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.890
I mean, his pride was
of a childish sort.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.666
I mean, he's in
the embassy today.

00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:03.040
I mean, he could
come out, and he

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.081
would be taken to Paddington
Green police station

00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:09.220
and booked for jumping bail.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.020
Booked.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.780
That's it.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.540
I mean, he wouldn't go
to jail for decades.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.750
He probably wouldn't
go to jail at all.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.970
Then after a few days,
and the paying of a fine,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.330
he'd be able to get on a
plane and go somewhere.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.040
But he, in a sense,
he's under conditions

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.200
of suspended animation
that he's addicted to.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.620
That there's a fantasy
of heroism going on,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.090
that I'm under arrest.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.170
I'm being silenced.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.680
I'm being imprisoned.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.320
And he always spoke
in that way to me.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.500
He hated the idea of conceding
to normal circumstances,

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.710
or in any sense,
showing weakness.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.210
His big obsession was weakness.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.550
He was always saying to me--

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:54.380
if I'd say, well, maybe
you were wrong about that.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.574
And we can say there was
no question of admitting

00:23:58.574 --> 00:23:59.740
that I was wrong about that.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:05.610
There was no question of
showing any self-deprecation.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.570
At one point in the
story, I say that I

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.890
tried to give him a crash
course in self-deprecation.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.370
The idea that you could
tell a joke against yourself

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.890
is completely foreign to him.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.850
It's the cornerstone of good
humor and wit and friendship,

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.130
that you can take the piss
out of your own supposedly

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.730
unassailable position.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.440
But he wanted the illusion
of unassailability,

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.769
even in his own memoir.

00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:29.310
I did say to him
one day, do you need

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.710
to make yourself the hero of
absolutely every anecdote?

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.100
Is there any possibility
that you were ludicrous?

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.010
Because of course, if you
know anything about writing,

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.590
you know that it's not just
a piece of self-advertising,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.360
or a piece of PR.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.310
All great stories
involve a certain amount

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:50.080
of humorous failure,
and self-failure,

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.910
and misapplication,
and mis-naming.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.305
There was none of that allowed.

00:24:56.305 --> 00:25:00.370
And I got the sense
very early that whatever

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.230
those boiling contradictions
of his childhood were,

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.350
they had created
an absolute need

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:10.300
for international
vindication every day.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.467
And that's incredible to me.

00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:12.133
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:25:12.133 --> 00:25:13.720
ANDREW O'HAGAN:
Fascinating, though.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.386
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:25:14.386 --> 00:25:16.824
No, it's extraordinary.

00:25:16.824 --> 00:25:17.740
This idea of a ghost--

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.680
I mean, the first essay
is called "Ghosting."

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.310
But also, I suppose that
Ronnie Pinn is a kind of ghost,

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.990
because he's based
on a dead person.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.880
I mean, you haven't
quite resurrected him,

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.330
because you've
invented a new person.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.550
The book is partly about
the traces we leave behind,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:37.455
or it's possible for a fictional
person to leave lots of traces,

00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:40.030
but for a real person
to leave no traces.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.990
Or Craig Wright wipes
out his digital history

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.350
or the traces of himself.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.360
So it is linked to this
idea of memory, I suppose.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.400
But it's mainly very specific
to the era in which we live now,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.330
that the idea of
technology as memory,

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.070
or technology as a ghost.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.844
That sort of--

00:25:57.844 --> 00:25:59.260
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I
mean, technology

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.990
has become the
ghostifying thing for me

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.419
in that the ghostifying thing--

00:26:03.419 --> 00:26:04.210
GABY WOOD: Defying?

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.040
ANDREW O'HAGAN: No, it
makes you sort of ghostly.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.748
It makes all of us--
we're ghosting our--

00:26:07.748 --> 00:26:10.960
I mean, every time you add
something on Wikipedia,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.640
what are you if not a ghost?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.800
You're a ghostwriter.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.275
We're all ghostwriters now.

00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:16.900
And as it happens,
I've always believed

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.890
that novelists and
poets are ghostwriters.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.249
You're always
ghostwriting for somebody.

00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:24.040
If you're inventing a
character, and you're

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.570
writing in the first person, as
many novelists do very often,

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.471
one of the things you
are is a ghostwriter.

00:26:30.471 --> 00:26:32.470
GABY WOOD: Because your
character is the writer?

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.303
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yes.

00:26:33.303 --> 00:26:35.152
And you're making it
for somebody else.

00:26:35.152 --> 00:26:36.610
I mean, I've always
been interested

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.460
in that relationship.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.459
I mean, I know it's got
a commercial definition,

00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:41.590
and that people ghostwrite
things [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.490
We get that.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.100
But the most interesting form
of ghostwriting, I think,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.620
is the sense of
throwing your voice,

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.330
of haunting houses that
you can't live in anymore.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.190
Novelists do that all the time.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.990
I'm haunted by the
books I've written,

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.970
as well as having been a ghost.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.930
So those notions have
always interested me.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.710
My first book was
called "The Missing."

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.950
I was interested in the
disappearance of women--

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.440
you'll remember, Gaby, that
some of the investigations I

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.560
was doing at that
time were about women

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.200
who were murdered by
Fred and Rosemary West

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.390
in Gloucestershire, and who
were never reported as missing.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.410
They were ghosts.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.930
And the idea that they could
have lived in the world,

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:24.820
and had relationships,
and gone to schools,

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.850
and had GPs and siblings,
but nobody reported them

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:28.360
as missing.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.940
They just sort of vaporized.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.780
And that was a new
thing in society.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.140
And that was slightly
pre-internet, wasn't it?

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.585
It was just really--

00:27:36.585 --> 00:27:38.710
it wouldn't be accurate to
say it was pre-internet.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.700
But it was before the
whole world of online

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.904
normality, if you can call it
that, this sort of customary,

00:27:44.904 --> 00:27:47.320
you wake up in the morning,
and you turn on your computer.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.600
It wasn't like that.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.630
And none of that book was, as
it were, worked up from Google.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.770
There was no search engine
then to check street names

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.110
and addresses, and histories,
and voters rolls. .

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.190
I mean, the way that
search engines have

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:08.140
changed the work that writers do
and journalists is incredible.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.500
Because I remember, in order to
find out the various addresses

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.750
that girls had lived
at in the 1970s,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:18.820
having to spend
months among the paper

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.957
electoral rolls at
the British Museum,

00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:22.165
the British Library, as was--

00:28:22.165 --> 00:28:24.459
GABY WOOD: In the
old days, yeah, yeah.

00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:25.750
This means it was a round room.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.704
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yeah,
having to go through them.

00:28:28.704 --> 00:28:30.430
And poor [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.601
I mean, I think I damaged my
eyesight by the age of 26,

00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:34.850
staring at those paper things.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.339
But of course now, 192.com--

00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:38.380
GABY WOOD: Straight away.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.754
ANDREW O'HAGAN: You pay your
money, you got your credits,

00:28:40.754 --> 00:28:42.720
you'll find anybody's address.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.020
Not anybody's, but a fair
number of them very quickly.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.520
And you'll find out where the
three previous addresses were.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.724
It's a different world.

00:28:48.724 --> 00:28:49.390
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.060
ANDREW O'HAGAN: So
the books were--

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.240
these stories, in a sense, are
continuing material for me,

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.530
and old topics revived, and
coming all the way around

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.060
in middle age to things that
interested me as a young man,

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.020
except the technology
has enriched and deepened

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.314
and estranged those
interests of mine.

00:29:06.314 --> 00:29:07.980
GABY WOOD: Yeah, but
that's exactly what

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.790
I was going to ask you about.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.200
Because there is
a point at which

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.080
you describe Wright as a
sort of missing person.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.600
There's this line,
the complications

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.520
of being themselves
wipe them out.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.187
That actually, these
people who are so--

00:29:19.187 --> 00:29:20.645
I mean, we were
talking about being

00:29:20.645 --> 00:29:23.020
on the spectrum-- that they
are missing, in some sense.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.000
And so I was interested in how
your thoughts about missing

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.670
persons had evolved through
this, through thinking

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.680
about these people?

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.305
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Well,
it's interesting.

00:29:32.305 --> 00:29:34.990
I mean, it has an absolute
direct, almost kind of--

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.080
there's a kind of
mirroring going

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.200
on between some of
those obsessions

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.787
I had about missing persons.

00:29:41.787 --> 00:29:43.620
I had them in the book
called "The Missing."

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.920
But I also had
them in the novels,

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.086
that so many of the characters
in the novels earlier

00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:50.380
were people who had lost
sight of their life.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.695
They'd lost their selfhood
along the way somehow.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.040
And now I was able to find out,
in relation to the Ronnie Pinn

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.540
story in this book, for example,
the middle story that we've

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.610
been talking about, that
when I was in that graveyard,

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:10.580
and choose that particular
dead child's name,

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:17.220
I saw that Ronald Pinn had
died 20 years old in 1980.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:25.350
When I put the words Ronald
Pinn into your engine, no other,

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.172
the result was
precisely nothing.

00:30:29.172 --> 00:30:30.680
There was nothing.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.640
In relation to him, that
person [INAUDIBLE] nothing.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.305
There was nothing
to bring you to him.

00:30:37.305 --> 00:30:39.180
There was nothing to
tell you about his life.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.319
There was no taste expressed.

00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:42.110
There was no light.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.860
There was nothing.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.950
There was no memory.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:48.920
By the end of the process of
my inventing a Ronald Pinn

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.000
based on him, there were
thousands and thousands

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.470
of the fake Ronnie Pinns.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.970
So as the fake Ronnie Pinn's
footprint, in a sense,

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:03.550
completely outnumbered and
outclassed the original.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.640
And it told you something
about what our life has become.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.170
The original actual flesh
and blood Ronnie Pinn

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:16.190
had no footprint in the
world beyond perhaps,

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.440
in the memory of his
mother, who I later

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.730
found to be still alive.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.945
And I end the piece
by going to visit.

00:31:21.945 --> 00:31:24.062
And that's why I included
the real Ronnie Pinn.

00:31:24.062 --> 00:31:25.520
Because I wanted
the reader to deal

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.030
with the ethical
difficulty, not only

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.830
of what I'd done in
order to tell the story

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.930
and reproduce the
police have done,

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.440
but also to think about what
it meant to have been a person.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.630
Not just that I invented a guy
and put him into the dark net,

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.110
and made him buy
stuff, and drugs,

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.693
and guns and everything
else, and made

00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:45.785
him exist in the sense of
having a false passport

00:31:45.785 --> 00:31:47.060
and false driver's license.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.430
But also, right
beside him, I was also

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:55.860
telling the thin story of
an actually existent person.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.070
And I wanted that irony
to be right at the heart

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.884
of the reader's mind as
they were reading the story.

00:32:00.884 --> 00:32:01.550
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.740
Because the question
does crop up,

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.281
of course, why you
needed to do that,

00:32:04.281 --> 00:32:06.444
why you needed to take
a once real person,

00:32:06.444 --> 00:32:08.110
or why you couldn't
just make up a name.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.450
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.741
I mean, and that was the thing.

00:32:09.741 --> 00:32:11.660
I could have made
life easy for myself

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.690
by just have inventing a name,
and a false birth certificate.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.350
And I mean, there's all sorts
of ways to be a fake person,

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:19.295
trust me.

00:32:19.295 --> 00:32:21.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:27.340
There's the question of
building a legend around us,

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.670
a real person was
a way of, as it

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.980
were, building up a
bank of integrity,

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.000
as the police called it.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.140
If said to you, which
school did you go to?

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.236
You could say, well,
and you had it all.

00:32:38.236 --> 00:32:40.900
GABY WOOD: When did you first
hear about that practice

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.830
of the police?

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.246
ANDREW O'HAGAN:
Quite a while ago,

00:32:43.246 --> 00:32:45.240
just after it was
exposed, actually,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.386
as having been a common
practice in the Met.

00:32:47.386 --> 00:32:48.760
There was always
rumors about it.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.760
And a police officer
told me back in the '90s

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.820
that this was happening.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.915
And I thought, no.

00:32:55.915 --> 00:32:59.260
But I always knew if it ever
could be made to emerge,

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.170
it would tell you an incredible
story about the times.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.305
And I'm always
interested in stories

00:33:05.305 --> 00:33:07.450
that, as it were, sort of
throw light on to the way

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.350
we live now.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.330
I'm sort of fascinated by that.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.141
I mean, Facebook
admits quite freely--

00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:16.640
the numbers are
probably much higher

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.957
if they admit it freely--

00:33:17.957 --> 00:33:21.905
that there are upwards of 78
million fake Facebook accounts.

00:33:21.905 --> 00:33:22.796
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:33:22.796 --> 00:33:24.670
ANDREW O'HAGAN: It's an
incredible statistic,

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.586
if you think about it.

00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:28.720
That 78 million people
on the planet at least

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.155
have taken the trouble
to invent another self.

00:33:32.155 --> 00:33:35.770
Now to whatever extent
they're using that self,

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.620
dwelling in that self,
embroidering that self,

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.600
using it to enter chat
rooms, using it just

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.229
as a way of looking in places
where they otherwise might be

00:33:44.229 --> 00:33:45.520
too afraid to go, I don't know.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.010
But it's an interesting part of
your potential experience now.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.385
There was always
the double life.

00:33:51.385 --> 00:33:54.070
We know about Oscar Wilde
and the double life.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.980
But it was never, as it were,
a daily part of your activity

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.620
in the way that it can be now
because of the technology.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.654
I think I'll just go
and be John for an hour.

00:34:01.654 --> 00:34:02.320
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.903
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I think I'll go
and be Susan for five minutes.

00:34:04.903 --> 00:34:07.090
I mean, the technology
allows that.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.614
And I wanted to swim down into
that as far as I could go.

00:34:10.614 --> 00:34:11.780
GABY WOOD: That's brilliant.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.550
I mean, now in retrospect,
or having done all this work,

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.000
do you feel that
privacy is a right?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.500
ANDREW O'HAGAN:
I've always felt it.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.699
And I feel it more now.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:21.699
GABY WOOD: Do you?

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.074
ANDREW O'HAGAN:
At the end, yeah.

00:34:23.074 --> 00:34:27.430
I mean, I know there's a giant
question now, given that--

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:29.130
it was interesting,
Mark Zuckerberg,

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.588
who's obviously
younger than me, is

00:34:30.588 --> 00:34:34.219
part of that generation feel
that privacy's completely

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:39.010
outmoded, that in a sense,
the wish for privacy

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.900
is a kind of misnomer.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.590
Why would you wish for privacy
unless you were underhanded,

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.940
I think is
Zuckerberg's position.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.570
And it certainly was
"Gawker's" position.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:55.239
That every time a privacy
was exposed or corrupted,

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:58.300
"Gawker" cheered, and
thought, that's right.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.140
That's one step closer
to the reality we want,

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.116
where nothing is private,
and nothing is secret.

00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:05.740
But I, on the other
hand, would come in

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:11.410
and say that a raid on privacy
is a raid on selfhood itself.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:17.020
The idea that there's no
respect for the private sphere,

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.980
a place where your consciousness
and its alterations,

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.780
your arguments with yourself,
that psychoanalytically,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:30.790
the self's romance, it's
growth, and its backward slides,

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.755
and its relationship--

00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:32.020
GABY WOOD: [INAUDIBLE]
done in public.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.686
ANDREW O'HAGAN: --with
love and identity

00:35:33.686 --> 00:35:37.690
is not about a public
manifestation always.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.233
It's about an inward journey.

00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:42.760
It's about an interiority.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.750
I mean, we don't
have time today,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.960
but we could talk
about how inarguably,

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.420
the whole of
literary fiction has

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.420
been an argument
about interiority

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.370
and how alterations
in what happens

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.190
to people inside themselves
impact on other people

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.235
and on the world.

00:35:58.235 --> 00:35:59.864
I mean, that's Henry
James, is it not?

00:35:59.864 --> 00:36:01.030
GABY WOOD: Absolutely, yeah.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.140
ANDREW O'HAGAN: And
if you take that away,

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.389
and you just imagine that
if anybody's not telling you

00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:07.440
something private, it's because
they're doing something wrong,

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.150
then you're playing
into the security state

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.200
in a way that will rue the day.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.910
And now that we're in the
age of certain television

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:22.150
manufacturers, let's just say,
having a mechanism called fake

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.651
off.

00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:24.566
Where your television,
when you switch it off,

00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:25.290
isn't really off.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.240
It's still recording
and still watching.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.760
And that the security agencies
can gather that information

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.230
and use it.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:35.740
Privacy, then-- including the
privacy that can exist between

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.559
two people--

00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:38.600
what you say to your
girlfriend, or your husband,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.880
or your boyfriend
might well be a matter

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.220
that is all the deeper and
all the more enjoyable,

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.820
to put it at its most
basic, because it's private,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.040
because nobody
else knows that you

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.100
feel exactly this at this
moment, and that you did this.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.470
If it's all out there in
some "Gawker" universe,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.900
then I think it's a degradation
of human experience,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:02.934
I have to say.

00:37:02.934 --> 00:37:05.350
GABY WOOD: Yeah, I feel that,
even about teenagers saying,

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.950
love you in a text message.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:07.847
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:07.847 --> 00:37:10.180
GABY WOOD: We should probably
let you ask some questions

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.460
if you'd like.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.410
And if so, do step up
to the David Lynch mike

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.450
that we have here ready
to scramble your speech.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.220
We can carry on
talking [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.660
AUDIENCE: So can you hear me?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:25.820
Is that all right?

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.430
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I can, yeah.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.054
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:27.054 --> 00:37:30.290
So you just all on that point
where it seems inevitably

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:34.069
we're going to a world where
we don't have privacy anymore,

00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:35.360
what are your thoughts on that?

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.310
And in your experience
speaking to people

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.707
like Craig Wright
or Julian Assange,

00:37:40.707 --> 00:37:42.290
what role we're going
to play in that,

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:43.750
and what role
these other powers,

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.166
and these people
are going to play

00:37:45.166 --> 00:37:47.200
in deciding how that turns out?

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.890
GABY WOOD: When you say we, do
you mean the general public,

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:49.370
or do you mean, you, Google?

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:50.450
AUDIENCE: I'd say the
general public, no.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.200
I very much mean
the general public.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.520
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Thank you.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.470
Well, I think it's
going to be one

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.450
of the big challenges
for this generation,

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.610
and for coming
generations is trying

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.130
to find a code of
decency, and, as it were,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:09.880
a philosophical set of thoughts
about how we as human beings

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.530
exist in relation
to our devices.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.770
There's going to
be a giant new era.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.015
I'm not just talking about
artificial intelligence.

00:38:17.015 --> 00:38:18.640
I'm talking about
even our relationship

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.150
with a search engine.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.960
What is that engine
in our epistemology?

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.500
What is it in our
sense of who we are,

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.090
and how we relate to history
and the present, and in relation

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:34.270
to the known and the unknown,
in relation to privacy,

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.380
and the told?

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.926
It's not-- | don't think we're
more than 10 minutes away

00:38:39.926 --> 00:38:42.300
from the point where that will
be one of the things we do

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:46.650
at university is to try and
work out what a relationship is

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:51.465
as individuals with an
encoded identity, with a DNA.

00:38:51.465 --> 00:38:55.050
And is that a paramount
thing in the future?

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.960
Or are we all simply part
of a neural network, where

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.600
we're hardwired into
a neural network where

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.280
we have a certain force,
perhaps, a certain brightness.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.670
We shine a certain light for a
short period, and then go out.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:13.300
But we don't actually have a
private universal narrative

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.630
that we have sovereignty over.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.730
The question of
sovereignty of self

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.980
in the age of the
internet, will be, I think,

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.810
one of the great challenges
for writers, thinkers,

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.760
practitioners,
individuals, technologists

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.430
the day after tomorrow.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:30.930
As for those
individuals that you've

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.479
mentioned that I've
worked with, they

00:39:32.479 --> 00:39:35.020
will be remembered as people
who made a contribution to this,

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.120
I'm sure.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.920
One of the reasons I was so
drawn to sticking with them,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.280
even through sometimes quite
harrowing circumstances,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.140
because I really
believed that they

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.210
were important
fighters in that debate

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.000
that I've described as
both coming and happening.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.130
They wouldn't be
victorious, necessarily.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:02.000
Neither of those men,
at least, up to today,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.920
are having a triumphant time.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:12.430
Craig Wright, in the end, failed
to consolidate his position

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.650
as Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.559
He failed his own
paternity test in public.

00:40:18.559 --> 00:40:20.100
Although I personally
always believed

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.290
that he was certainly there
at the foundation of Bitcoin,

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.170
and that his attachment
to the technology,

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.790
his attachment to the timeline,
and his being in possession

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:32.910
of the codes--

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.130
it was too much evidence.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.060
So the mask had--

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.820
as it were-- eaten so
deeply into his face

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.380
that he couldn't take it off
is one way of putting it.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.150
The Satoshi mask-- and
not just into his face,

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:47.890
but I presume, into
others that he worked

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.760
with on that original software.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.440
Assange is a different story.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.330
But he too will be an
important figure, I think,

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.330
when we come to look at
what is the relationship

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.180
between an individual
and the state.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.910
That will be-- just as
we talk with John Wilkes,

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:08.200
I think, as somebody who
opened up the question of what

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.176
was liberty.

00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:11.800
And we're still asking
what is liberty?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.430
But you need to ask
the question every day.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.888
Because the meaning changes
every day in relation to what's

00:41:15.888 --> 00:41:16.520
in front of it.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.570
And what's in front
of it at the moment

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.210
is a series of powers
within the machine that

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.650
will change the
nature of the law,

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.140
to say nothing of morality.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.260
So I think we're in
for exciting times.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.260
But we're in the
foothills at the moment.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.890
I mean, we don't even have
a generally agreed code

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.885
of decency for the
internet at the moment.

00:41:37.885 --> 00:41:39.968
And that sounds like the
beginnings of an argument

00:41:39.968 --> 00:41:41.930
for censorship, and it's not.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.460
I mean, I'm not into censoring
films, or censoring television.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.152
But I generally believe in
the board of certification,

00:41:48.152 --> 00:41:49.860
and I generally believe
in the watershed.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.490
Because I've got a
13-year-old and I

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.364
don't want her to be
frightened going to bed.

00:41:53.364 --> 00:41:55.117
It doesn't mean I
want censorship.

00:41:55.117 --> 00:41:56.450
It's the same with the internet.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.030
We need to get a
bit sophisticated,

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.950
I think, in our
politics about it.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:03.400
Because it's a bit kind of
you're either for everything

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.570
or you're for censorship.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.820
And there's got to be
something-- there's

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.260
so much thinking to be done.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.968
It's not going to be
done by me, clearly.

00:42:09.968 --> 00:42:12.400
It's done by people
cleverer than I, I hope.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.310
I hope it will be done.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:15.060
GABY WOOD: Thanks.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:17.013
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Thank you.

00:42:17.013 --> 00:42:18.960
GABY WOOD: Is there
another question?

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.950
AUDIENCE: You mentioned how you
invented an individual based

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.870
on this young man
that had died before.

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:31.620
How did you approach the
ethical questions around this?

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.110
Does this young man have
some kind of right of privacy

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.170
after his death?

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:42.460
And are you altering
his memory without him

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.750
being able to consent?

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.870
ANDREW O'HAGAN: That's an
interesting core question

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.550
about that story for me.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.620
Believe me, I was well
aware of it at the time.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.600
And you don't go into writing
a story like that blind.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.062
I mean, in a sense, the
story's about that question.

00:42:59.062 --> 00:43:00.520
And I believe as
a writer, your job

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.110
isn't to just
solve all the maths

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:05.350
and tell the reader how clever
you are as a mathematician,

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.670
morally or otherwise.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.550
Your job is just to provide the
arithmetic in the right way,

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.970
and in the right
order and walk away.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.850
And I believe that
there was only one

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:20.920
way to tell that story of the
ethical nightmare of stealing

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.220
dead children's names, and
creating false identities,

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.080
as our police force was doing.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.240
The only way to tell
that was to do it.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.170
To really get inside
how they did it,

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.630
and what it meant, and
did it have an effect--

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:40.012
to go back to your question-- on
one's sense of the real person.

00:43:40.012 --> 00:43:41.470
Another question
that comes with it

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.230
is do we own the story
of our own lives?

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.320
Do you own your story?

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.600
Do you, Gaby, own yours?

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.650
Does anybody in the
audience or watching

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.675
actually have ownership rights
on what happens to them?

00:43:53.675 --> 00:43:55.300
Because you might
say it doesn't really

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.967
belong to oneself at all,
it belongs to the world.

00:43:59.967 --> 00:44:02.050
Where I was born and what
happened, and what I did

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.260
and what was did to me
is a possession of mine.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.670
Is the story of my
children my possession?

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:09.360
I know we behave as if it is.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.080
Because if it's a corruption
of some personal ownership.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.120
But ultimately, it
belongs to history,

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.520
and it belongs to the world,
and it belongs to writing.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.270
That's my argument.

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.350
But there's a more
popular, I think,

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:28.540
ethical position, which is that
Ronnie Pinn's mother, as it

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.220
were, owns his memory now.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.900
And that it was a
corruption of his memory

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.290
to take him and attach these
details to somebody else.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.380
Again, I would argue
that I wanted the reader

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.860
to go on asking themselves
about that ethical difficulty

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.140
long after the
story was finished.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.830
My job, in a sense, would
be done if that happened.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:53.200
For my own part,
I certainly felt

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.830
it was important to tell the
actual story of the true Ronnie

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:02.050
Pinn as part of my story so
as not to dodge the bullet.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.490
And in a sense, your
question suggests

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.969
that I might have taken
him away from reality.

00:45:07.969 --> 00:45:09.760
I think I gave him a
reality that he didn't

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.130
have by recording him, finally.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.110
Because now, the real
Ronnie Pinn story

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:20.230
is actually part of what we can
say about that young man who

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.210
lived and died in 1980.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.520
But I agree with you.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.930
It's an ethical conundrum.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:27.130
That's why I wrote it.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.230
A lot of stories are.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.230
GABY WOOD: Thanks.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.830
AUDIENCE: On my
way back to office,

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:42.110
I was listening to Malcolm
Gladwell's recent podcast.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:49.060
So he is explaining
about a CIA informant,

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.670
and asked the ethical
question of the one side,

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.010
we have the need
for need to know,

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.870
and the other side that
is personal safety.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:00.410
I mean, when you go
into these secret lives,

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:04.750
you're going to get entangled
into very serious stuff,

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:08.960
espionage, national security,
and things like that.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.170
Do you have an
experience of that kind?

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.660
Or in that case, how do you--

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.200
you might have to withhold some
information from the public.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.610
Or do you decide that?

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.270
From your discussion
about the Wikileaks,

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.280
and they felt that you wanted
to have more information given

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.360
to the public.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.130
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.340
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Well, that
is actually-- thank you

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.798
for that question--
it was actually

00:46:29.798 --> 00:46:34.130
core to the whole Wikileaks
experience over the war logs,

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:38.780
was that Wikileaks were very
keen to dump that material

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.130
onto the internet pretty fast.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.394
And indeed they did.

00:46:42.394 --> 00:46:44.060
There was a question
from some quarters,

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.684
including some of
the public publishing

00:46:45.684 --> 00:46:47.370
partners, "The
Guardian" and so on,

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.120
about whether the material
should be redacted

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.410
before appearing in public.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:54.430
And there's a strong argument
for redaction in that case,

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.120
as implicit in your question.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.670
Because sometimes,
informants will be named.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.730
And you might be condemning
them to death, actually,

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:04.150
by just dumping that material
straight onto the net.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.440
That was a strong argument
in the Wikileaks case.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:11.330
Now they've resisted
it, sometimes clumsily,

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:13.380
sometimes with good argument.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.840
But it was debatable.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.440
But from my
perspective, redaction

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.000
would always be necessary.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.710
Redactions are something a
bit of an incendiary word.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.550
Again, it's like censorship.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.470
You're not censoring
something because you

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.600
can't face the truth.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.260
You're editing it so as
to protect the innocent.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:35.246
And we do that every
day in writing.

00:47:35.246 --> 00:47:36.620
We do it every
day in journalism,

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:41.330
we do it every day in
software production.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:44.750
You don't have such a
respect for the truth

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:49.640
as if the truth is of
this of clear flowing

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.080
river of excellence.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.640
It's a muddy thing, full
of branches and roots,

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.530
and made up stuff,
and old prams,

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.800
and stuff that was never true,
but people think it's true.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:07.150
I mean, the truth is a
capacious mess of a thing.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.750
And so the idea of just dumping
the truth on the internet

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:12.756
is always going to be
questionable to me.

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.630
I believe in editing.

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:15.240
I believe in publishing.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.810
I believe in the judgments
that come with selection,

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:19.980
with scholarship.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:25.650
And I was always trying to push
Wikileaks towards scholarship,

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:31.410
towards the publisher vessel,
and to proper academics taking

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:35.490
the material from each region,
and spending years filtering,

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.820
collating, examining,
annotating.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.470
Because that is a thing.

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:43.770
That's a whole industry,
and it matters in human life

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.080
to carefully--

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.080
even as journalists-- to
carefully, with a legal eye,

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.340
and also with an eye for
protecting individuals,

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.159
even if they don't hold
your political views.

00:48:56.159 --> 00:48:57.700
Perhaps even especially
if they don't

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.480
hold your political views,
you must protect them

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.330
against savagery that
might come their way

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:06.337
from your careless
exposure of them.

00:49:06.337 --> 00:49:07.920
That was a big issue,
and it continues

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.461
to be a big issue
when you're dealing

00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:14.110
with secret information, or
formerly secret information.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.190
It was there-- we won't
go into it today--

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.530
but it was there in the Edward
Snowden case with the NSA.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:23.220
He was altogether a
much more cognizant,

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.540
I think, of the problems
and the deeper issues

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.030
to do with safety and security.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.330
I think it's naive and
childish just to suggest

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.270
that all security is bogus.

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.940
I want to say grow
up to those people.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.650
There are threats against us.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.204
There are lunatics in the world.

00:49:42.204 --> 00:49:44.370
And there are people with
strong political arguments

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.280
who behave like
lunatics as well.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.410
But we must defend
ourselves against them,

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:52.010
and protect our
children, our people.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.570
And that will involve a certain
amount of secrecy and sharing

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:56.610
of information in a careful way.

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:00.480
It doesn't make one a
right-winger to recognize that.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.010
I think it should be recognized.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:06.360
At the same time, I'm
all for breaking down

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.390
those false and
corrupt links that

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:12.270
can exist between governments,
moneyed individuals,

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:15.660
and ideologues and so on,
which is what Wikileaks started

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.807
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:16.807 --> 00:50:17.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.135
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Thank you.

00:50:18.135 --> 00:50:19.635
GABY WOOD: Good
question, thank you.

00:50:19.635 --> 00:50:23.622
Is there another one?

00:50:23.622 --> 00:50:27.162
We have a bit more
time if you want.

00:50:27.162 --> 00:50:28.620
If not, actually,
I want to ask you

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.720
something about your own
position in all of this.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.290
Because at one point, you
say that pleasing people

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:35.520
is a vice and a virtue.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.290
I can't remember
which way around.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:39.930
Virtue as a man and a vice as
a journalist, or the other way

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:40.435
around.

00:50:40.435 --> 00:50:41.310
The other way around.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:42.810
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:46.090
GABY WOOD: And there's another
point at which someone wants

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.550
a cigar-- must be Assange--

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:48.510
and you give it to him.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.040
There's just one line, he wanted
a cigar, and I gave him one.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.540
I thought, wow, he's got cigars
just lying around his house.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.350
This is a perfect--
who knew that this

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.900
was the job of a reporter?

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.190
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Just keep
a stash, just in case.

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.170
You never know when
the Castros might

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:03.510
arrive at the door wanting
a cup of tea and a cigar.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.360
GABY WOOD: Exactly.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.080
So I mean, how do you
position yourself,

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.140
or are your concerns
about reporting

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.147
on some of this tricky
material as a sort of voyeur

00:51:13.147 --> 00:51:14.730
or whatever you want
to call yourself?

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:19.890
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I think that
the reporter should always,

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.950
at least in my book, be
ready to put themselves

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:24.692
through the mill a bit.

00:51:24.692 --> 00:51:25.650
GABY WOOD: In what way?

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.300
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Well, it
doesn't mean necessarily

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.430
be digging in your elbows
under the barbed wire,

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:32.730
sort of, at the war front.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:34.200
But it sometimes does mean that.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.684
It means putting yourself
at risk to get the truth.

00:51:37.684 --> 00:51:39.600
It means exposing yourself
to a certain amount

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.210
of psychological difficulty.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.970
It means walking in the rain.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.810
It means walking away
from your comforts.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:49.020
It means not sitting at
home working on your novel,

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.330
but actually-- which is
an important activity

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:52.690
if you a novelist.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:56.700
But sometimes putting
on your sneakers

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.490
and going out into
inclement situations

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:02.310
in order to know what's
happening, in order

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:06.030
to bring back the moral
news to your desk.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.370
I just think it's worth it.

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:09.550
It sometimes got to be done.

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.790
But I don't think that the
writer in that situation

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:16.250
should set him or herself
up as well as the morally

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.000
resplendent person.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.280
I mean, you sometimes see
essayists and writers who

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.300
think of themselves that way.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.050
Good luck to them.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.470
And maybe they are morally
resplendent in every way.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.600
I never thought that
was the writer's job.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.370
I believe the Janet
Malcolm position,

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:31.530
as expressed in "The
Journalist and the Murderer,"

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:34.210
a famous piece for "The New
Yorker," where she realized

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.865
that there is a sort of--

00:52:35.865 --> 00:52:38.970
it's almost like an acting
job, sometimes, being a writer.

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:44.250
Each one requires you to sort
of take a position in the room.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.990
Quite often, you fade
into the wallpaper,

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:48.570
and that's a performance too,
if you're quite vivacious,

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:50.910
and you quite like people,
and you're quite sociable.

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:54.700
Sometimes just not
speaking is a performance.

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.540
And that's what I meant when
I said pleasing people can

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:02.280
be a vice and a virtue.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:07.230
But sometimes, I'm just focusing
on the reader being my friend,

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:09.420
not the people in the
room being my friend.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.880
I don't owe a debt
of friendship to any

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.570
of the subjects in this book.

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:16.070
I mean, I might have felt some
residual friendship for them,

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:17.677
and some loyalty, actually.

00:53:17.677 --> 00:53:19.760
They may not see it that
way, but there was a lot.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.676
It took me a long time
to write these stories,

00:53:21.676 --> 00:53:23.760
and I held much
out of the frame,

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.430
because it was
irrelevant to my purpose.

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.350
So there was loyalty, and
continually so, I think.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.310
What there is, is the
sense that you have

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.090
to do the job for the reader.

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:37.720
And Joseph Mitchell, that
great other "New Yorker" writer

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.260
taught us that you just
have to disappear slightly

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.380
into the miasma of
the thing that's

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.540
difficult to
describe, and somehow,

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:50.122
let it happen to you too.

00:53:50.122 --> 00:53:51.660
GABY WOOD: Yeah,
that's a nice idea.

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.576
The two things that Craig
Wright asked you not

00:53:53.576 --> 00:53:56.550
to say about his personal
life, you withheld them?

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.170
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yes.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.010
Yes, I did.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.170
And again, there are the
great warriors for truth

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.750
who will say, why
did you compromise

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:04.710
by not mentioning them?

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:06.960
But it was a bit like
our friend's question

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.750
before about security.

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:13.740
Those two individual points
he asked me to hold back on,

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.920
had I not held back on them,
could have resulted in harm

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.120
to two sets of individuals.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.200
And I made a very straight
and clear in my mind

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.000
decision to leave
out that material.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.485
It was good material, too.

00:54:25.485 --> 00:54:26.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:26.255 --> 00:54:28.710
GABY WOOD: Well, so supposing
he didn't realize it

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:30.730
would have caused harm, and he
didn't ask you to withhold it,

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:32.790
but you realized that
they would of caused harm,

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:33.540
and you decided.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.910
Would you then have decided
to withhold those things?

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:37.534
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Very
interesting, that.

00:54:37.534 --> 00:54:40.270
I mean, I probably would have.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:41.360
And one of the two--

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.765
I'm sorry this is
so tantalizing.

00:54:42.765 --> 00:54:44.250
GABY WOOD: Yes, what is it?

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.750
ANDREW O'HAGAN: But
we're on camera.

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:51.210
But the problem was that I would
have made a judgment in favor

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:53.580
of withholding on
one of those counts,

00:54:53.580 --> 00:55:00.030
because it involved, shall we
say, people more than averagely

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.700
innocent, young people.

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.694
GABY WOOD: OK.

00:55:04.694 --> 00:55:06.110
ANDREW O'HAGAN:
In the other case,

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:07.690
I probably would have
gone ahead and told

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.273
that part of the
story, because I felt

00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:10.980
it was a part of the story.

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.510
But it would possibly
have exposed that person

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:17.977
to serious doubts about
themselves, and danger.

00:55:17.977 --> 00:55:19.810
They might have been a
danger to themselves,

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:21.780
and I just couldn't
take that risk.

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.960
No piece of journalism's
worth the loss of life,

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.800
I don't think.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.190
And I certainly wasn't going
to be taking that risk.

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:31.540
GABY WOOD: So the question
whether all journalists

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:32.790
are aware of that as they go.

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:33.670
And in fact, Janet Malcolm--

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:35.045
I once interviewed
Janet Malcolm.

00:55:35.045 --> 00:55:36.760
And I asked her
whether she ever felt

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:39.250
she had to protect people
from themselves, whether they

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.760
were telling too much, and
she wants to leave that out.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.385
And she looked at me as
though I was completely mad.

00:55:45.385 --> 00:55:47.170
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Well, there are
moments sometimes when you're

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:48.961
sitting with a person,
and sometimes you've

00:55:48.961 --> 00:55:50.410
been working with
them for months,

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:54.760
and they start to speak, and
something inside you cringes.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.830
The tape recorder's on,
there's a notepad on your lap,

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:03.130
and they're saying something
so damaging to themselves

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:05.110
that you do think--

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:07.090
[SIGHS]

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:12.070
Because you know that it's
not your responsibility to

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.310
censor them, to stop them
from being who they are.

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:19.780
That would be false in
terms of what journalism is.

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.760
And yet, you're human, and you
have a relationship with them.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.834
And they can't hear
how that sounds.

00:56:24.834 --> 00:56:25.875
GABY WOOD: Yeah, exactly.

00:56:25.875 --> 00:56:27.280
ANDREW O'HAGAN: And Janet
Malcolm would tell you--

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.030
I mean, she might
delight in such moments.

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:32.320
But she's probably
tougher than most.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.810
And sometimes you delight in
it, because they're awful,

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:37.660
and you think, you're
now hanging, drawing,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:42.100
and quartering yourself, as I
knew you were capable of doing.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.290
But in other cases, you
think, no, no, you simply

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:49.872
are tin-eared when it comes
to how you are coming across.

00:56:49.872 --> 00:56:52.330
And that thing I was telling
you about before, about people

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.010
having no ear for
self-deprecation,

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.616
no willingness to seek
themselves in a comic way.

00:56:56.616 --> 00:56:58.990
And after many, many months
of that, you know the reader.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.130
Because you become
an intelligencer

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:03.430
for the reader as a writer.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:07.780
You're a kind of forwards
scout for their interpretation

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.340
sometimes.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.930
And as a forward
scout, you're seeing

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:13.750
it coming sometimes,
and thinking, wow,

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.350
he's really going
to say that on tape?

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.109
And yeah, it happens.

00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:20.650
GABY WOOD: In that sense, it's
is a bit like editing, though.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:22.499
And you're a great
editor, where'

00:57:22.499 --> 00:57:24.790
you're trying to imagine how
the reader will take this,

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.680
or you're saying to the
writer or the speaker,

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.940
is that really what
you want to say?

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.814
ANDREW O'HAGAN: Yeah.

00:57:28.814 --> 00:57:30.190
I mean, and sometimes your job--

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.380
I mean,
non-controversially, if you

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.540
like, is to simply help the
person round to the place

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.960
where they can be clear
about what they're saying,

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.225
and what they did, and
why, and who was involved,

00:57:43.225 --> 00:57:44.680
and what time.

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.920
Not everybody's a
born storyteller.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.080
Some people give an awful
account of themselves,

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.260
just awful.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.620
They give a very poor
eyewitness account

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:58.300
of what their life's
been like, most people.

00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:02.080
If you asked most husbands to
give an account of what they

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.730
have been like as
a husband, they'd

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.770
give a terribly self-satisfied
one-sided account

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:07.812
of what it had been like.

00:58:07.812 --> 00:58:10.145
GABY WOOD: Well, that's because
there are risks involved

00:58:10.145 --> 00:58:11.410
in describing it differently.

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:12.451
ANDREW O'HAGAN: I'm sure.

00:58:12.451 --> 00:58:15.550
But I mean, self-knowledge
isn't a given,

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:18.040
and neither is-- even if
you have self-knowledge--

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:21.387
neither is the ability to
then put that into sentences.

00:58:21.387 --> 00:58:23.470
And so we're just talking
about interviewing here.

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.860
GABY WOOD: Yeah.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.450
ANDREW O'HAGAN: The idea that
you interview a human being,

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:26.590
and they immediately
come flowing

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.000
with beautiful
sentences that are

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.260
totally accurate, and legally
secure is not the case.

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.695
People self invent, they
lie, they cut corners,

00:58:35.695 --> 00:58:38.540
they edit, they
obfuscate, they dissemble.

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.880
They can't face it.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.340
They wish they hadn't come.

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.550
But your job is to try
and swim through that

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:49.060
and find something true
and coherent, and hopefully

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.950
entertaining as well.

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:52.859
GABY WOOD: Well,
that's a great result.

00:58:52.859 --> 00:58:54.400
And I think we're
going to end there.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.910
Thank you all very
much for coming.

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.205
And thank you for watching.

00:58:57.205 --> 00:58:59.330
