00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.530
Obesity is officially a disease!!

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:10.290
Now, where's my cupcake?

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.179
Hey guys Tara here for Dnews - and if you're
the type of person who's constantly worried

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.870
about your weight, then do we have the story
for you!

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.880
It's been almost a year now since the American
Medical Association officially classified

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.000
obesity as a disease.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.110
One of the hopes behind this was to raise
awareness to the growing problem of obesity,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.949
but new research suggests that the classification
may be doing more harm than good.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.150
A study published in the April issue of Psychological
Science, recruited over 700 participants to

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.070
take an online survey related to health and
weight.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.850
They calculated the BMI of every participant
- some obese, and some of average weight - and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.460
then asked them to read one of three articles.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.410
The first article was a standard public-health
message about weight, another was a NYT article

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.850
describing obesity as a disease, and the third
was an article specifically stating that obesity

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.379
is NOT a disease.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.450
The findings show that obese participants
who read the article classifying obesity as

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.370
a disease, placed less importance on health-focused
dieting and reported less concern over their

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.220
weight, compared to obese individuals who
read the other two articles.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.000
They also chose higher-calorie food options
when asked to pick a sandwich from a provided

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
menu.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.300
Meaning the "obesity as a disease" mentality
actually led to unhealthier food choices.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.500
Crystal Hoyt, the researcher who spearheaded
the study, says "the term disease suggests

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.100
that bodies, physiology, and genes are malfunctioning.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.600
By invoking physiological explanations for
obesity, the disease label encourages the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.560
perception that weight is unchangeable."

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.900
However, they're not disputing the fact that
obesity should be classified as a disease.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.780
Rather, the aim was to understand how public-health
messages can have unintended consequences.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.890
The most interesting aspect of the study,
I think, is that the people who accepted the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.420
disease classification but made unhealthy
choices anyway - reported greater body satisfaction

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.710
than any of the other groups.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.710
So they may be unhealthy - but at least they're
happy!

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.070
What do you guys think?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.340
Should obesity be classified as a disease?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.250
And does knowing that it is, affect your food
choices?

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.420
