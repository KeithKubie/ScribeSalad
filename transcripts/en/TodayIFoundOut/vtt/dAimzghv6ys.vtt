Early Printing of U.S. Paper Currency

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:51.499
In 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:57.559
Article I of the U.S. Constitution, ratified
on June 21, 1788, Congress was granted the

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:03.799
power to “coin money” and “regulate”
its value, but not to issue paper money.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.590
The result of the near complete devaluation
of the paper money printed to fund the Revolution

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.590
(bills called “continentals” since they
were issued by the Continental Congress, see:

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.590
A Capital Idea- How a Pile of Unpaid Bills
Led to Washington, D.C.), many delegates of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.310
the Constitutional Convention simply had lost
faith in the efficacy of paper money, and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.810
made no provision for it.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.250
Thus, for the first 73 years of the country’s
history, the U.S. relied on coins it minted,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.610
foreign coins (since the U.S. lacked sufficient
precious metals to mint enough of their own),

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.410
and paper money issued by private, state-chartered
banks.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.890
Producing bills of various designs and values,
by the time the U.S. Congress had gotten around

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.340
to issuing its own paper money, approximately
8,000 different private entities within the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.959
United States had already produced some form
of paper currency.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.230
With the resulting confusion over valuation
and authenticity, counterfeiting of the private

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.950
notes was rampant.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.780
Thus, when Uncle Sam decided it needed to
issue paper currency of its own to fund the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.969
Union effort in the Civil War, first in the
form of fifty million in Demand Notes in 1861

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:08.950
and later passing the Legal Tender Act of
1862 authorizing issuing $150 million (about

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.549
$4 billion today) of U.S notes, the possibility
of forgery was forefront on everyone’s minds.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.360
(Fun fact- Abraham Lincoln officially established
the Secret Service on the day he was assassinated,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.069
with this new organization tasked with, not
protecting him, but stamping out such rampant

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.390
counterfeiting.)

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.359
This all brings us back to green money.

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.140
While it’s often stated, even by otherwise
reputable sources, that it isn’t definitively

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.829
known why the color green was chosen for use
with United States paper money, the truth

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.270
of the matter is that (after an amazing amount
of digging), it turns out the reason for choosing

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.599
green couldn’t be better documented.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.069
This documentation is primarily courtesy of
a case brought before the New York Supreme

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.980
Court in 1865- Tracy R. Edson vs The American
Bank Note Company.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.680
In this case, numerous primary documents explain
in painstaking detail why the color green

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.939
was chosen for American currency.

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.430
With a little further digging, more of the
backstory was revealed as well.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.290
Funny enough, it all started with a Canadian-
Dr. Thomas Sterry Hunt.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.750
In 1857, at the behest of the president of
the City Bank of Montreal, William Workman,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.760
Dr. Hunt developed and patented (in Canada)
a new anti-counterfeiting ink.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.860
You see, the City Bank of Montreal, like so
many other banks, issued their own notes.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.669
As was the case with other institutions of
the day, their notes suffered from rampant

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.150
counterfeiting thanks in part to the advent
of certain photographic technologies.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.800
Enter another Canadian- George Matthews.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.610
Upon learning of this new anti-counterfeiting
ink, Matthews almost immediately purchased

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.449
the rights to it from Hunt.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:59.050
He then turned around and patented the ink
in the U.S. (patent #17688) claiming he’d

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.900
invented it and explaining the ink was made
from:

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.819
…calcined green oxide of chromium, (known
to chemists as the anhydrous sesquioxide of

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.810
chromium,) which I mix with burned or boiled
linseed-oil, sometimes called printers varnish,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.199
in the manner usual in preparing ink for printing
bank-notes or other instruments by either

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.199
of the above processes of printing.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.490
After patenting it in the United States, Matthews
turned around and licensed all rights to this

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.780
patent to one Tracy Edson, who along with
his cohorts (Rawdon, Wright, and Hatch) within

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.520
a year would partner up with several other
of the most prominent security printers in

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.980
the United States to form the American Bank
Note Company in 1858.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.690
But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.680
Upon acquiring exclusive rights to the ink,
Edson and co.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.660
wasted no time in investigating whether this
ink really did make bank notes printed with

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.050
it in a certain fashion impervious to counterfeiting.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.840
They soon announced in the following letter
(which also explains why this ink was thought

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.800
so special over others) that they had a method
to finally beat counterfeiters :

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.250
To the Banking Institutions of the United
States:

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.770
In consequence of the great danger to our
paper currency from successful counterfeits,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.470
made by photography and kindred processes,
it has become evident that a NEW SECURITY

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.669
is needed, which, while it shall perfectly
protect our bank notes from photographic imitations,

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.160
and from alterations in their denominational
value, shall, at the same time, preserve that

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.310
security which is always afforded by artistic
and highly finished engraving.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.060
The undersigned beg leave respectfully to
announce to the Banking Institutions of the

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.479
United States, that they have carefully investigated
this subject, and that they are now prepared

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:34.520
to furnish the most perfect possible protection
against all the above descriptions of fraud.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.990
The process consists in the use of TWO PERMANENT
INKS, conjointly, in printing bank notes,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.140
and other documents representing value.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.120
One of these is the ordinary BLACK bank note
printing ink, which, having a basis of carbon,

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.460
is insoluble and indestructible; the other
is an equally insoluble and indestructible

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.340
GREEN-COLORED INK, which cannot be removed
from the paper, without also removing the

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.860
black ink, and thus destroying the note.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.530
It is an established principle in photographic
chemistry, that red, yellow, and green colors

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:11.050
act upon the photographic plates almost precisely
like black; so that lines or figures of these

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.139
colors will appear black in photographic copies.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.669
The use of colors, has therefore, been resorted
to as a protection against photographic counterfeiting.

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:23.349
Unfortunately, however, all the colored inks
heretofore used upon bank notes, for this

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:28.849
purpose, as red, yellow, and blue, can be
removed with more or less facility, by chemical

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.389
means, without disturbing the note itself,
when printed in the black carbon ink.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:37.750
These colors being removed, the black can
be copied by photography and the colors being

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.280
afterwards added by lithography, or otherwise,
a COUNTERFEIT is obtained, which is the more

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.050
dangerous from the fancied security afforded
by the colors.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.810
The use of fugitive black or blue inks, printed
upon a colored ground, has been resorted to

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.039
as a protection against photography.

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:59.039
But these inks are liable to fade on exposure
to light or air; and as it is possible to

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:04.139
efface from notes thus printed the black design,
by chemical means, without disturbing the

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:09.370
red or yellow ground, and to print another
in its place, the use of fugitive inks afford

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.539
great facilities for alterations; while the
distinctive characteristics of the fine engraving

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:18.800
are lost, and the note is rendered easier
of imitation by the ordinary counterfeiter,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.590
and its detection more difficult.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.229
The use of the BLACK CARBON INK above referred
to, for printing bank notes, conjointly with

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:30.379
an equally INSOLUBLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE COLORED
INK, in connection with the highest style

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:35.540
of line engraving, would unite, in the greatest
degree, the best safeguards against all the

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.790
various species of fraud to which surety paper
is exposed.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:45.040
A bank note thus printed in TWO PERMANENT
INKS, would be protected against the possibility

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.790
of imitation by photography, and by the lithographic
and anastatic processes of copying; while

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.780
its denominational value could not be altered
by any chemical means.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.450
Such a note could also be made to unite the
security afforded by the highest artistic

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.020
excellence, against counterfeiting by the
engraving process; and the beauty of design

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.720
and general appearance of the note would be
preserved.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.090
The GREEN COLOURED INK, recently patented,
has been submitted to the examination of several

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.920
of our most distinguished chemists, and other
gentlemen, who, from their practical experience,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.540
are competent to decide a question of this
kind.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.830
They have subjected it to the most severe
tests known to chemical science; and the ink

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.380
having been pronounced by them to possess
the requisite properties, we offer it, with

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.630
entire confidence, as affording the desired
protection when applied in the manner above

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.630
proposed.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.190
Referring to the accompanying documents, and
specimen of printing in the two permanent

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.190
inks, we are,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.560
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servants,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.250
Rawdon, Wright, Hatch &amp; Edson.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.970
As mentioned in the letter, also furnished
as supporting evidence of their claims were

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.380
letters from numerous chemists and photographers
attesting to the fact that, despite their

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.200
sincerest efforts, they could find no way
of perfectly copying the bank notes that had

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.280
both the carbon black ink and the new Patent
Green Tint ink.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.670
For instance, in this letter from Photographer
Charles D. Fredricks, dated May 29, 1857,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.670
he notes:

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.460
Messrs. Rawdon, Wright, Hatch &amp; Edson.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.120
Gentlemen: Agreeably to your request I have
made numerous experiments, by various processes

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.520
upon the green tinted bank-notes submitted
by you, for the purpose of determining the

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.480
ANTI-PHOTOGRAPHIC POWER OF THE GREEN INK in
which they were printed.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.040
The result is that, in all cases, the portions
printed in GREEN, as well as those printed

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.610
in black, appear only in BLACK in the photographic
copy.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.100
And I do not hesitate to say, that it is impossible
to make a counterfeit by photography of any

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.550
bank-note upon which this green tinge is printed
by you, in connection with the black ink ordinarily

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.660
used in printing bank-notes.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.610
Respectfully, your ob’t serv’t,

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.620
CD Fredricks.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.580
Needless to say, the new anti-counterfeiting
ink was a hit and was adopted by numerous

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.760
banks for their bank notes of various designs.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.120
In 1860, after these types of bank notes had
been in the wild for a couple years, notes

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.940
using this ink still seemed impervious to
counterfeiting by ordinary measures, as noted

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.250
by Professor Wolcott Gibb of New York on June
24, 1860:

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.960
In reply to your letter, I have to say that
I have seen no reason whatsoever to change

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.760
the opinion which I expressed in my report
of June 3d, 1857, in relation to the durability

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.510
of the Patent Green Tint.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:23.240
No chemical agent has been discovered which
will destroy its color, when properly prepared,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.610
and I consider it as one of the most fixed
and permanent tints which chemistry can produce.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.140
greenback2So, when the Federal Government
was looking to print the currency that would

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.620
become known as “greenbacks” in 1861,
they ordered the American Bank Note Company

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.370
to print them using carbon black and their
Patent Green ink, earning the company a cool

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.920
$5 ($133 today) per thousand notes they printed.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.930
Of course, as so often happens, it was soon
discovered that at least some counterfeiters

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.140
had little trouble figuring out ways to remove
the green ink without harming the paper or

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.910
black ink, and thus the currency was easily
counterfeited as described in the preceding

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.910
Edson and co.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.910
letter.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.160
The war against counterfeited currency continued,
and still continues to this day, with green

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.100
remaining a primary color of U.S. paper currency
through it all.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.210
While in modern times this is more due to
tradition than anything else, there was a

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.240
prime opportunity to change the principal
coloring in 1929 when smaller notes were introduced

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.460
and things became a bit more standardized
with some new designs.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.720
(For instance, earlier editions of U.S. currency
had an average dimension of 7.375 x 3.125

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.030
inches, rather than the current 6.125 x 2.625
inches.)

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.280
However, according to the U.S. Bureau of Engraving
and Printing, the U.S. chose to stick with

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.420
the green color because the then incarnation
of it was still relatively resistant to chemical

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.420
and physical changes compared to other readily
available inks, they had large quantities

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.180
of it available, and they felt that “green
was psychologically identified with the strong

00:12:52.180 --> 00:13:37.080
and stable credit 

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:47.510
of 

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:55.070
the Government.”
