00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.360
- [Instructor] We are asked,

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.630
What is the average rate of
change of the function f,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.653
and this function is f up here,

00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:08.370
this is the definition
of it, over the interval

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.580
from negative two to three,
and it's a closed interval

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.830
because they put these brackets around it

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.910
instead of parentheses,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.710
so that means it includes
both of these boundaries.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.190
Pause this video and see if
you can work through that.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.900
All right, now let's
work through it together.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.380
So there's a couple of ways
that we can conceptualize

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.216
average rate of change of a function.

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:29.030
One way to think about it is

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.583
it's our change in the
value of our function

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:34.640
divided by our change in x,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.230
or it's our change in
the value of our function

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.400
per x on average.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.910
So you can view it as change
in the value of the function,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.660
divided by your change in x.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.410
If you say that y is equal to f of x,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.540
you could also express it as change in y

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.610
over change in x.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.846
On average, how much
does the function change

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:57.620
per unit change in x on average?

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.030
And we could do this with a table,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.580
or we could try to
conceptualize it visually.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.180
Let's just do this one with a table,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.960
and then we'll try to
connect the dots a little bit

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.300
with a visual.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.407
So if we have x here, and
then if we have y is equal to

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:14.010
f of x right over here, when
x is equal to negative two,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.330
what is y going to be equal to,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.925
or what is f of negative two?

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:19.790
Well, let's see.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.030
f of, so why is equal
to f of negative two,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.350
which is going to be
equal to negative eight,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.080
that's negative two to the third power,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840
minus four times negative two,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.570
so that's minus negative
eight, so that's plus eight.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.140
That equals zero.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.110
And then when x is equal to three,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.820
I'm going to the right
end of that interval.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.687
Well, now y is equal to f of three,

00:01:42.687 --> 00:01:46.860
which is equal to 27,
three to the third power,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.540
minus four times three, minus
12, which is equal to 15.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.519
So what is our change in y

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:56.790
over our change in x over this interval?

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.400
Well, our y went from zero to 15,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.581
so we have an increase of 15 in y.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.450
And what was our change in x?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.120
Well, we went from negative
two to positive three,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.480
so we had a plus five change in x.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.540
So our change in x is plus five,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.140
and so our average rate of change with y

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.410
with respect to x, or the
rate of change of our function

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.500
with respect to x, over the interval,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.460
is going to be equal to three.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.710
If you wanted to think
about this visually,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.250
I could try to sketch this.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.750
So this is the x-axis, the y-axis,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.140
and our function does something like this.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.620
So at x equals negative
two, f of x is zero,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.430
and then it goes up, and
then it comes back down,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.250
and then it does something like this,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.710
it does something like this, and it does,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.170
and it was going before this,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.430
and so the interval that we care about,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.640
where we're going from
negative two to three,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.420
which is right about there.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.150
So that's x equals negative
two to x equals three,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.830
and so what we want to do, at
the left end of the interval,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.672
our function is equal to
zero, so we're at this point,

00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:06.710
right over there, I'll
do this in a new color,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.350
at this point, right over there,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.150
and at the right end of our function,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.150
f of three is 15, so we
are up here someplace.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.233
Let me connect the curve a little bit.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.970
We are going to be up there.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.927
And so when we're thinking
about the average rate of change

00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:27.630
over this interval, we're
really thinking about

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.360
the slope of the line that
connects these two points.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.170
So the line that connects these two points

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.470
looks something like this.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.170
And we're just calculating
what is our change in y,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.090
which is going to be
this, our change in y,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.890
and we see that the value of our function

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.070
increased by 15, divided
by our change in x.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.800
So this right over here
is our change in x,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.480
which we see went from
negative two to three.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.160
That's going to be equal to five.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.000
So that's all we're doing

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.650
when we're thinking about
the average rate of change.
