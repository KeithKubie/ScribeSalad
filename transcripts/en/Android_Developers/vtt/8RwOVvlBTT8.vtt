00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.833
Follow the instructions

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.500
and invite users through
an open or closed beta.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.066

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.566

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.566
you can test up to three
variants of your app icon,

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.766

Don't just assume
it's good enough.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.733
Ratings and reviews will tell
you what your users love

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.566
and love less about your app,

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.900

your app's content

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.166
directly from Google searches
on their devices.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.566

or ratings?

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.400

than usual?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.066

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:33.766

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.733
