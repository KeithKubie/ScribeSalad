00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:01.610
afraid of the answer to these questions
 

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.990

meaningfully communicate with each other

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
meaningfully communicate with each other

meaningfully communicate with each other
and I'm wondering if you didn't call it

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179
and I'm wondering if you didn't call it
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.459
and I'm wondering if you didn't call it
a little bit about temper mentality and

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469
a little bit about temper mentality and
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.980
a little bit about temper mentality and
the differences therein that's what they

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
the differences therein that's what they
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.169
the differences therein that's what they
do in a democracy

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179
do in a democracy
 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.390
do in a democracy
look the lefties they're high in

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
look the lefties they're high in
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.980
look the lefties they're high in
openness and low in conscientiousness

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
openness and low in conscientiousness
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.560
openness and low in conscientiousness
and that means they don't like

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
and that means they don't like
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.210
and that means they don't like
responsibility that much but they're

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
responsibility that much but they're
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.950
responsibility that much but they're
pretty damn creative and they're not

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
pretty damn creative and they're not
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.720
pretty damn creative and they're not
very orderly especially they're not very

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
very orderly especially they're not very
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.800
very orderly especially they're not very
orderly and that's part of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
orderly and that's part of
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.330
orderly and that's part of
conscientiousness by the way and so

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
conscientiousness by the way and so
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400
conscientiousness by the way and so
they're good at being artists and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
they're good at being artists and
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.749
they're good at being artists and
they're going to being entrepreneurs but

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
they're going to being entrepreneurs but
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190
they're going to being entrepreneurs but
they're terrible at running things

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
they're terrible at running things
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080
they're terrible at running things
but then the Conservatives on the other

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
but then the Conservatives on the other
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.880
but then the Conservatives on the other
side they're low in openness which is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
side they're low in openness which is
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740
side they're low in openness which is
the trait creativity that doesn't mean

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
the trait creativity that doesn't mean
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.150
the trait creativity that doesn't mean
they're stupid by the way it just means

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
they're stupid by the way it just means
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.970
they're stupid by the way it just means
they're there they're there thinking

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
they're there they're there thinking
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100
they're there they're there thinking

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
isn't as freeform let's put it that way
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.479
isn't as freeform let's put it that way
and so it's more constrained and they're

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
and so it's more constrained and they're
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.250
and so it's more constrained and they're
high in conscientiousness especially

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
high in conscientiousness especially
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.229
high in conscientiousness especially

things that already work so you need the
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810
things that already work so you need the
Liberals there wouldn't be high openness

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
Liberals there wouldn't be high openness
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.459
Liberals there wouldn't be high openness
low conscientiousness if there wasn't a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
low conscientiousness if there wasn't a
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.599
low conscientiousness if there wasn't a
niche for it and you need the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
niche for it and you need the
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.700
niche for it and you need the
Conservatives and and sometimes the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
Conservatives and and sometimes the
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.560
Conservatives and and sometimes the
Liberals are right no borders should be

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
Liberals are right no borders should be
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210
Liberals are right no borders should be
more open cuz that's their fundamental

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
more open cuz that's their fundamental
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740
more open cuz that's their fundamental
claim and sometimes the Conservatives

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
claim and sometimes the Conservatives
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.120
claim and sometimes the Conservatives
are right the borders between things

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
are right the borders between things
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.880
are right the borders between things
should be more closed and and because

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
should be more closed and and because
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.649
should be more closed and and because

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
they're both right some of the time and
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.539
they're both right some of the time and
because the environment keeps sneaking

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
because the environment keeps sneaking
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.910

around you have to have dialogue between

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
around you have to have dialogue between
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.399
around you have to have dialogue between
the two sources constantly constantly so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
the two sources constantly constantly so
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.429
the two sources constantly constantly so
that the polity can orient itself as the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439

snake of the environment moves and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
snake of the environment moves and
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.390
snake of the environment moves and
that's why you need free speech and so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400

the left and the right get along
perfectly well together as long as they

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

perfectly well together as long as they
can talk to each other but as soon as

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
can talk to each other but as soon as
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630
can talk to each other but as soon as
they can't talk to each other then the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
they can't talk to each other then the
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.429
they can't talk to each other then the
alternative there's only one or two

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
alternative there's only one or two
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.760

that one is slavery the other is tyranny
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.249
that one is slavery the other is tyranny

will either become your slaves or your
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.929
will either become your slaves or your
tyrants so you wipe out free speech then

you don't know anything if you think

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
you don't know anything if you think
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.889
you don't know anything if you think
that it's the mechanism by which people

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
that it's the mechanism by which people
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.219
that it's the mechanism by which people
of different opinions talk instead of

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
of different opinions talk instead of
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.869
of different opinions talk instead of
strangling each other so and but if you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
strangling each other so and but if you
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.279
strangling each other so and but if you
want them to strangle each other which

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
want them to strangle each other which
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.640
want them to strangle each other which
you might

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
you might
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.270
you might
and really you might then take away the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
and really you might then take away the
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.009
and really you might then take away the
right to express their opinion and watch

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019
right to express their opinion and watch
 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.770

the whole thing go up in flames and go
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.660
the whole thing go up in flames and go
like this because maybe that's what a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
like this because maybe that's what a
 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.629
like this because maybe that's what a
big part of you want
