00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.690
 The picture is not for me 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.090
 It became a photograph for those people 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.610
 me 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.070
 Hmm 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.190
 me 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.190
 7 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.510
 My dad sent me a message when I picked up lenses and cameras to see Mr. Toh 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:50.399
 I felt like I was sending 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.399
 I began to feel that I had to record as a photographer 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 At first my heart was sunk, but I will take pictures and talk with the people in the city 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:21.950
 By repeating things I recover my mind little by little 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:29.030
 I was able to 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 What they're pouring in It's brought up looking at their fathers' backs and has the industry in this town 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.390
 I want to go 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:44.670
 Everyone is now headed for a tremendous future compared to five years ago 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:49.590
 I feel that I am having a good time and having fun and exciting and exciting 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 I also like to talk about that together 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.660
 me 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.660
 me
