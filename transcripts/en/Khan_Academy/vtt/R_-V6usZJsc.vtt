00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.140
Given that the Chinese central
bank is printing yuan in order

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.340
to keep it devalued to
other foreign currencies,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.060
especially relative
to the dollar,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.410
a question that may have
jumped into your brain

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.290
is, is this causing inflation?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.840
And when I talk
about inflation, I'm

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.250
talking about price inflation.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.590
Is it making a basket of
goods in China more expensive?

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.240
And the other type of inflation
that the word inflation is

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.722
sometimes to referring
to is monetary inflation.

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.180
That, by definition,
is increasing.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.650
They are definitely
increasing the money supply,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.320
but is it making the price
of goods and services

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.920
in China more expensive?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.490
And to answer that question,
I have this article here

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.370
from the "New York Times"
written by Keith Bradsher,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.480
early January, 2011.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.160
And he writes, "in
China, consumer prices

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.550
were 5.1% higher in November
than a year earlier."

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.620
Remember, in the US, we
try to target inflation

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.140
to be between 1 and 3%.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.830
So the official government data.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.000
So this is according to
official government data,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.412
they admit that their
inflation is at 5.1%.

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:03.370
But the next sentence is
even more interesting.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.380
"And many economists say the
official figures actually

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.310
understate the
rate of inflation,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.350
which might in reality
be twice as high."

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800
And there's tons of
ways to kind of engineer

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.860
the actual inflation depending
on what the basket of goods is

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.850
and how you adjust for things.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.150
Now though, that
cheap currency policy

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.590
seems to be reaching its limits.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.650
The extra renminbi-- and this
is a big point of confusion

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530
when people talk about
the currency in China.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.490
The renminbi is the
name of the currency

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.120
while the yuan is kind of
when someone talks about hey,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.560
I give you five yuan, or you owe
me five yuan, something like.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.380
They wouldn't say you
owe me five renminbi.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.190
And a good analogy is if
you go to Great Britain

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.570
and you buy something, they'll
say, well it'll be five pounds.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.740
So in Great Britain,
five pounds is

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.230
what they say when you're
actually buying something,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.065
but the name of the currency
is called the sterling.

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:02.940
It's kind of like if
people called the dollar

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.740
US legal tender.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.820
That's the equivalent
of renminbi,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.650
while you yuan would
be like the dollar.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.460
So five pounds is
called the sterling.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.040
So the similar analogy,
five yuan, they

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.265
call that the renminbi.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.190
So they're saying the extra
renminbi are feeding inflation.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.960
That is starting to
undermine exporters' price

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.550
competitiveness.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.450
Just as a stronger
renminbi would

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.925
do if Beijing was not
intervening to begin with.

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:35.050
So the whole reason why
they're printing this money

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.760
is to keep the
currency devalued,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.640
but that's making things more
expensive in terms of yuan.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.920
So in the end, that's
kind of counteracting

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.580
some of this cheap
currency policy.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.430
It's making their
exports more expensive.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.310
Money supply figures
for December,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.450
which the central bank
released on Tuesday,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.690
showed that cash and bank
deposits were increasing

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.489
at a rate twice as fast as
even China's soaring economy.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.280
So if you increase the
money supply roughly

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.921
in line with the
growth in the economy,

00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:04.920
then you wouldn't experience
too much inflation.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.530
But they're increasing
it twice as fast.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.457
Ever more renminbi are available
to buy goods and services.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.290
So you see they're
clearly doing that to try

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.706
to keep their currency devalued,
but they're reaching kind

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:17.140
of-- it seems kind of a
breaking point where they won't

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.607
be able to do it as
aggressively going forward.
