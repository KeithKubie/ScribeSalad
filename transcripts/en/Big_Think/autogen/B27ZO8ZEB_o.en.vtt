yes I you know I think studying the

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969
yes I you know I think studying the
 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.850
yes I you know I think studying the
intelligence or the behavior the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
intelligence or the behavior the
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.239
intelligence or the behavior the
evolution of another species is a

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249
evolution of another species is a
 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.120
evolution of another species is a
wonderful way to gain perspective on who

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
wonderful way to gain perspective on who
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.420
wonderful way to gain perspective on who
we are because it's very difficult you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
we are because it's very difficult you
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.060
we are because it's very difficult you
know to really think about who you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
know to really think about who you
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250
know to really think about who you
manzara you Minh intelligence in a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
manzara you Minh intelligence in a
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.830
manzara you Minh intelligence in a
vacuum because we didn't evolve in a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
vacuum because we didn't evolve in a
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.100
vacuum because we didn't evolve in a
vacuum so yes dolphins Dolph study of

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110
vacuum so yes dolphins Dolph study of
 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.989
vacuum so yes dolphins Dolph study of
dolphin brains and intelligence gives us

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:32.999
dolphin brains and intelligence gives us
 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.290
dolphin brains and intelligence gives us
a tremendous amount of of perspective on

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
a tremendous amount of of perspective on
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.899
a tremendous amount of of perspective on
human intelligence I mean when you look

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:38.909
human intelligence I mean when you look
 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.779
human intelligence I mean when you look
at we're so used to thinking of our own

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789
at we're so used to thinking of our own
 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.529
at we're so used to thinking of our own
species as on top of everything on top

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
species as on top of everything on top
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.739
species as on top of everything on top
of nature superior to the other species

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749
of nature superior to the other species
 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.000
of nature superior to the other species
more intelligent qualitatively different

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
more intelligent qualitatively different
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.099
more intelligent qualitatively different
and when you look at our brain we see

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109
and when you look at our brain we see
 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.189
and when you look at our brain we see
that we have these large brains in the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
that we have these large brains in the
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.579
that we have these large brains in the
size for the size of our bodies and yet

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589
size for the size of our bodies and yet
 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.969
size for the size of our bodies and yet
if you look at dolphins you see that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
if you look at dolphins you see that
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.819
if you look at dolphins you see that
they too have extraordinarily big brains

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829
they too have extraordinarily big brains
 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.889
they too have extraordinarily big brains
for their bodies they are very very

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899
for their bodies they are very very
 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.149
for their bodies they are very very
intelligent and even though their brains

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159
intelligent and even though their brains
 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.380
intelligent and even though their brains
evolved along a different trajectory

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
evolved along a different trajectory
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.990
evolved along a different trajectory
than our own so they're structured a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
than our own so they're structured a
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240
than our own so they're structured a
little bit differently the thing that we

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
little bit differently the thing that we
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.800
little bit differently the thing that we
have in common is the fact that we both

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
have in common is the fact that we both
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.819
have in common is the fact that we both
evolved very large complex brains so

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829
evolved very large complex brains so
 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.950
evolved very large complex brains so
that tells us that there's more than one

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
that tells us that there's more than one
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.130
that tells us that there's more than one
way to be highly intelligent sentient

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
way to be highly intelligent sentient
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.950
way to be highly intelligent sentient
and complex on this planet not just the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
and complex on this planet not just the
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.760
and complex on this planet not just the
human way but the dolphin way as well

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770
 
 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.829
