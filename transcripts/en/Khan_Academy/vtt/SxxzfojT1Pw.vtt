00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:02.324
- [Instructor] What we're going
to do in this video is look

00:00:02.324 --> 00:00:06.349
at all of the ways of describing
how to translate a point

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.254
and then to actually translate that point

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:11.163
on our coordinate plane.

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:15.172
So, for example, they say
plot the image of point P

00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:17.676
under a translation by

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:19.509
five units to the left

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:22.221
and

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.471
three units up.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.948
So let's just do that at first,

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:27.743
and then we're gonna
think about other ways

00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:29.408
of describing this.

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:32.340
So we want to go five units to the left.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.536
So we start right over here.

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:36.786
We're gonna go one, two, three,

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.652
four, five units to the left,

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:42.267
and then we're gonna go three units up.

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:46.253
So that's going to be one, two, three.

00:00:46.253 --> 00:00:48.860
And so the image of point P,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.352
I guess, would show up right over here,

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:53.740
after this translation described this way.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.823
Now, there are other ways

00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:56.619
that you could describe this translation.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.515
Here, we described it
just in plain English,

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:00.991
by five units to the
left and three units up.

00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.926
But you could, and this will look fancy,

00:01:02.926 --> 00:01:05.646
but, as we'll see, it's
hopefully a pretty intuitive way

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:06.961
to describe a translation.

00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.357
You could say, look, I'm
gonna take some point

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:11.715
with the coordinates x comma y.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:14.224
And the x coordinate tells
me what's my coordinate

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:17.069
in the horizontal direction
to the left or the right.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.955
And so I want that to be five less.

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.455
So I would say x minus five

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:25.067
comma

00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:27.541
y.

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:28.722
And what do we do to the y coordinate?

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.433
Well, we're going to increase it by three.

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:33.319
We're going to translate three units up,

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.430
so y

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.500
plus three.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.072
So all this is saying is whatever x

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:39.157
and y coordinates you have,

00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:42.835
this translation will make
you take five from the x.

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:45.529
That's what, meaning this is,

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.446
this right over here, is five units

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
to the left.

00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:54.909
And then this right over here,

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.159
is saying three

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.113
units up.

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:01.400
Increase your y coordinate by three.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.745
Decrease your x coordinate by five.

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:05.455
And so let's just test this out

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:08.282
with this particular coordinate,
with this particular point.

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:09.683
So at this point right over here,

00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:13.111
P has the coordinates,
its x coordinate is three,

00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.061
and its y coordinate is negative four.

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:17.271
So let's see how that works.

00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:19.740
If I have three comma negative four,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.136
and I want to apply this translation,

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:23.516
what happens?

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:26.713
Well, let me just do my coordinates.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:30.173
And so I started off with
three and negative four,

00:02:30.173 --> 00:02:34.199
and I'm going to subtract
five from the three.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.063
So subtract five here, we
see that right over there,

00:02:38.063 --> 00:02:41.604
and we're going to add three to the y.

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:43.902
So notice, well, instead of
an x, now I have a three.

00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:45.204
Instead of an x, now I have a three.

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:47.304
Instead of a y, now I
have a negative four.

00:02:47.304 --> 00:02:49.368
Instead of a y, now I
have a negative four.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.675
And so another way of writing this,

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:54.844
we're going from three comma negative four

00:02:54.844 --> 00:02:58.212
to three minus five is negative two,

00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:01.889
and negative four plus
three is negative one.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.817
So what are the coordinates
right over here?

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:06.009
Well, the coordinate
of this point is indeed

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.060
negative two comma negative one.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.643
So notice how this,

00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:13.327
I guess you could say this formula,

00:03:13.327 --> 00:03:17.473
the algebraic formula that shows
how we map our coordinates,

00:03:17.473 --> 00:03:19.515
how it's able to draw the connection

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:21.284
between the coordinates.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.376
And so you'll see questions
where they'll tell you,

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:25.339
hey, plot the image, and
they'll describe it like this.

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:27.214
Translate x units to the left or the right

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:28.658
or three units up or down.

00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:30.410
You'll sometimes see it like this,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.921
but just recognize this is just saying

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:34.199
just take your x and
subtract five from it,

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.234
which means move five to the left.

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:37.801
And this just means take your y coordinate

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.932
and add three to it,
which means move three up.

00:03:40.932 --> 00:03:42.054
And sometimes they'll ask you,

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:43.507
hey, what's the new coordinate?

00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:46.003
Or sometimes they'll ask you
to plot something like that,

00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:50.129
but just realize that it's
all the same underlying idea.
