okay so welcome to I think this is the
 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.029
okay so welcome to I think this is the
eighth lecture although I'm starting to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039
eighth lecture although I'm starting to
 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.370
eighth lecture although I'm starting to
lose count and this year's science and

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
lose count and this year's science and
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.630
lose count and this year's science and
cooking lecture series and we're really

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640
cooking lecture series and we're really
 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.909
cooking lecture series and we're really
honored to have with us

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919
honored to have with us
 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.909
honored to have with us
Martin Breslin who's the chef for

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919
Martin Breslin who's the chef for
 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.670
Martin Breslin who's the chef for
Harvard for HUDs for Harvard and we also

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680
Harvard for HUDs for Harvard and we also
 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.090
Harvard for HUDs for Harvard and we also
have Alex and Louise and we're really

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100
have Alex and Louise and we're really
 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.380
have Alex and Louise and we're really
honored to have them with us we've been

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390
honored to have them with us we've been
 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.119
honored to have them with us we've been
doing this at Harvard for many years and

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129
doing this at Harvard for many years and
 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.069
doing this at Harvard for many years and
we finally get to have Harvard's

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079
we finally get to have Harvard's
 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.229
we finally get to have Harvard's
chefs talk in this series and so I guess

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239
chefs talk in this series and so I guess
 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.490
chefs talk in this series and so I guess
I'd just like to start by clapping for

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500
I'd just like to start by clapping for
 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.319
I'd just like to start by clapping for
that and actually so what they're gonna

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329
that and actually so what they're gonna
 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.299
that and actually so what they're gonna
illustrate for us today is really one of

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309
illustrate for us today is really one of
 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.849
illustrate for us today is really one of
the most fascinating parts of cooking I

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859
the most fascinating parts of cooking I
 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.160
the most fascinating parts of cooking I
think which is the science of texture

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170
think which is the science of texture
 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.529
think which is the science of texture
how it is that you actually thicken

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539
how it is that you actually thicken
 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.719
how it is that you actually thicken
sauces and what is the science behind

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729
sauces and what is the science behind
 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.389
sauces and what is the science behind
that and okay so now just to introduce

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399
that and okay so now just to introduce
 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.280
that and okay so now just to introduce
the science of this I wanted to start by

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290
the science of this I wanted to start by
 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.940
the science of this I wanted to start by
showing you the lab that we're doing

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
showing you the lab that we're doing
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.160
showing you the lab that we're doing
actually right now now starting on

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170
actually right now now starting on
 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.350
actually right now now starting on
Thursday I'm in the Harvard College quad

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360
Thursday I'm in the Harvard College quad
 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.090
Thursday I'm in the Harvard College quad
are we doing it right now we're doing it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100
are we doing it right now we're doing it
 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.410
are we doing it right now we're doing it
right now the lab that we're doing right

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420
right now the lab that we're doing right
 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.760
right now the lab that we're doing right
now in the Harvard College class that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770
now in the Harvard College class that
 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.280
now in the Harvard College class that
goes along with this lecture that the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290
goes along with this lecture that the
 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.200
goes along with this lecture that the
chefs are about to give us and this is a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210
chefs are about to give us and this is a
 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.540
chefs are about to give us and this is a
sort of funny lab it's called macaroni

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550
sort of funny lab it's called macaroni
 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.960
sort of funny lab it's called macaroni
and cheese is that we have the students

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970
and cheese is that we have the students
 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.280
and cheese is that we have the students
and it's in the lab it's in one of the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290
and it's in the lab it's in one of the
 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.170
and it's in the lab it's in one of the
labs over there in one of the science

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180
labs over there in one of the science
 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.210
labs over there in one of the science
labs they make macaroni and cheese and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220
labs they make macaroni and cheese and
 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.030
labs they make macaroni and cheese and
what we ask them to do is a bit strange

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
what we ask them to do is a bit strange
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.460
what we ask them to do is a bit strange
which is that we asked them to make four

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470
which is that we asked them to make four
 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.710
which is that we asked them to make four
different varieties of macaroni and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720
different varieties of macaroni and
 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.060
different varieties of macaroni and
cheese you see we asked them to make it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070
cheese you see we asked them to make it
 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.680
cheese you see we asked them to make it
with all of these different things and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690
with all of these different things and
 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.990
with all of these different things and
then we asked them to measure what we

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000
then we asked them to measure what we
 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.550
then we asked them to measure what we
call the viscosity which is the

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560
call the viscosity which is the
 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.100
call the viscosity which is the
scientific term that basically goes with

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110
scientific term that basically goes with
 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.630
scientific term that basically goes with
thickeners which is sort of when you say

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640
thickeners which is sort of when you say
 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.790
thickeners which is sort of when you say
a sauce is thickening then what the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800
a sauce is thickening then what the
 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.080
a sauce is thickening then what the
scientists would say is well it's more

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090
scientists would say is well it's more
 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.150
scientists would say is well it's more
viscous and we asked them to measure the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160
viscous and we asked them to measure the
 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.610
viscous and we asked them to measure the
viscosity and in order to demonstrate

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620
viscosity and in order to demonstrate
 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.350
viscosity and in order to demonstrate
that this viscosity this is actually

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360
that this viscosity this is actually
 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.700
that this viscosity this is actually
sort of how thick it feels in your mouth

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710
sort of how thick it feels in your mouth
 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.950
sort of how thick it feels in your mouth
but it also has culinary significance in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960
but it also has culinary significance in
 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.840
but it also has culinary significance in
different ways and the method that we

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850
different ways and the method that we
 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.499
different ways and the method that we
use for them to measure the viscosity is

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
use for them to measure the viscosity is
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.460
use for them to measure the viscosity is
well I was going to call it brilliant

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470
well I was going to call it brilliant
 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.559
well I was going to call it brilliant
but that's probably overstating it is

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
but that's probably overstating it is
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.930
but that's probably overstating it is
this is what we do is we tell them to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
this is what we do is we tell them to
 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.070
this is what we do is we tell them to
take a cup full of macaroni and then to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080
take a cup full of macaroni and then to
 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.619
take a cup full of macaroni and then to
pour the sauce on top of it and to

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629
pour the sauce on top of it and to
 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.990
pour the sauce on top of it and to
basically measure how quickly the sauce

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000
basically measure how quickly the sauce
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.030
basically measure how quickly the sauce
covers the macaroni which is of course

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
covers the macaroni which is of course
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.400
covers the macaroni which is of course
measuring how quickly

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410
measuring how quickly
 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.880
measuring how quickly
how easily it flows now in this room in

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
how easily it flows now in this room in
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.200
how easily it flows now in this room in
past years when we've discussed

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210
past years when we've discussed
 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.980
past years when we've discussed
viscosity

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990
viscosity
 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.170
viscosity
we've even brought with us scientific

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
we've even brought with us scientific
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.000
we've even brought with us scientific
pieces of equipment that are very fancy

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010
pieces of equipment that are very fancy
 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.110
pieces of equipment that are very fancy
that are going to the name of rheometer

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
that are going to the name of rheometer
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.180
that are going to the name of rheometer
x' that basically measure the viscous

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190
x' that basically measure the viscous
 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.160
x' that basically measure the viscous
properties of liquids and they're very

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
properties of liquids and they're very
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.450
properties of liquids and they're very
oh so Tareq and there are things that

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460
oh so Tareq and there are things that
 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.520
oh so Tareq and there are things that
like pia and i and dave like but that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
like pia and i and dave like but that
 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.170
like pia and i and dave like but that
most people don't like and it's really

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
most people don't like and it's really
 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.430
most people don't like and it's really
less relevant this is really the key

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440
less relevant this is really the key
 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.350
less relevant this is really the key
experiment actually this picture was

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360
experiment actually this picture was
 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.200
experiment actually this picture was
taken from last year's harvardx class if

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210
taken from last year's harvardx class if
 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.760
taken from last year's harvardx class if
you took the harvardx class you also got

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770
you took the harvardx class you also got
 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.190
you took the harvardx class you also got
to do this lab and here are some

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200
to do this lab and here are some
 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.500
to do this lab and here are some
pictures from the harvardx class but

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510
pictures from the harvardx class but
 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.840
pictures from the harvardx class but
what I want to do at the moment is to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850
what I want to do at the moment is to
 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.100
what I want to do at the moment is to
ask the question which I think will

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110
ask the question which I think will
 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.320
ask the question which I think will
underlie this entire lecture which is

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330
underlie this entire lecture which is
 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.540
underlie this entire lecture which is
why is it that some of these sauces

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550
why is it that some of these sauces
 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.870
why is it that some of these sauces
spread so much more easily than others

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880
spread so much more easily than others
 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.610
spread so much more easily than others
that is what is it about the way that

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
that is what is it about the way that
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.350
that is what is it about the way that
their make made that makes them

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360
their make made that makes them
 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.600
their make made that makes them
something viscous and others not and if

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610
something viscous and others not and if
 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.680
something viscous and others not and if
you want to think about the least

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690
you want to think about the least
 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.690
you want to think about the least
viscous thing that I can imagine it's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700
viscous thing that I can imagine it's
 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.270
viscous thing that I can imagine it's
basically water so water is the least

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
basically water so water is the least
 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.710
basically water so water is the least
viscous thing and you can imagine if you

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
viscous thing and you can imagine if you
 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.330
viscous thing and you can imagine if you
took water and you poured it down this

took water and you poured it down this
 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.280
took water and you poured it down this
column of macaroni what would happen it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290
column of macaroni what would happen it
 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.600
column of macaroni what would happen it
would just go right to the bottom right

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610
would just go right to the bottom right
 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.550
would just go right to the bottom right
it would go very quickly and go right to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560
it would go very quickly and go right to
 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.900
it would go very quickly and go right to
the bottom and this whole art of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910

thickening sauces that we're about to
 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.560
thickening sauces that we're about to
see is really about making that not

see is really about making that not
 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.140

happen and is somehow making it fall

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150
happen and is somehow making it fall
 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.470

viscosity so I already said this that's

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860
viscosity so I already said this that's
 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.350
viscosity so I already said this that's
the thickness of the liquid or liquids

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360
the thickness of the liquid or liquids
 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.540

Nathan said is imagine that you're

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180
Nathan said is imagine that you're
 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.810
Nathan said is imagine that you're
you're going to the subway right and

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820
you're going to the subway right and
 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.279
you're going to the subway right and
you're going and you know you and

imagine you go during a time you know on
the weekend and there aren't many people

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
the weekend and there aren't many people
 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500
the weekend and there aren't many people
there and you go from the you know the

there and you go from the you know the
 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.210
there and you go from the you know the
place where you give your ticket to the

train and you just walk very quickly and
 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.630
train and you just walk very quickly and
there's no problem we all could walk

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640
there's no problem we all could walk
 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.310
there's no problem we all could walk
very quickly there's no problem to get

is this like don't they know how to

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
is this like don't they know how to
 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.420
is this like don't they know how to
drive I may not have made just me who

does this and in reality what's

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380
does this and in reality what's
 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.960
does this and in reality what's
happening is is that the poor person has

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970
happening is is that the poor person has
 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.730
happening is is that the poor person has
this set of people in front of them and

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740
this set of people in front of them and
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.680
this set of people in front of them and
they're they're blocking it and that's

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690
they're they're blocking it and that's
 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.750
they're they're blocking it and that's
viscosity so what are some of the

certainly you've experienced that while
driving is if you pack enough people in

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210
driving is if you pack enough people in

you took a jar of M&amp;Ms right you just
 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.450
you took a jar of M&amp;Ms right you just
shook it the M&amp;M stopped they're not

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460
shook it the M&amp;M stopped they're not
 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.400

flowing does anyone to know what

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410
flowing does anyone to know what
 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.070
flowing does anyone to know what
fraction of the jar is filled with M&amp;Ms

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080
fraction of the jar is filled with M&amp;Ms
 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.080

the audience if they're any kids you or
even the grown-ups if you want to help

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000
even the grown-ups if you want to help
 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.900
even the grown-ups if you want to help
your child win and mmm candy counting

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910
your child win and mmm candy counting
 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.250
your child win and mmm candy counting
contest this is the number you need to

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260
contest this is the number you need to
 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.450
contest this is the number you need to
know I mean the question is what

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460
know I mean the question is what
 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.969
know I mean the question is what
fraction of the jar is filled with M&amp;Ms

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979
fraction of the jar is filled with M&amp;Ms
 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:36.330
fraction of the jar is filled with M&amp;Ms
does anybody know is it 50% you know

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340
does anybody know is it 50% you know
 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.860
does anybody know is it 50% you know
there's air in the dryer if you notice

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870
there's air in the dryer if you notice
 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.750
there's air in the dryer if you notice
this so it turns out there's a magic

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760
this so it turns out there's a magic
 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.080
this so it turns out there's a magic
number it's about 65% that's that's the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090
number it's about 65% that's that's the
 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.460
number it's about 65% that's that's the
fraction so basically if you ever get

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470
fraction so basically if you ever get
 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.650
fraction so basically if you ever get
the volume fraction of the stuff up to

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660
the volume fraction of the stuff up to
 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.500
the volume fraction of the stuff up to
65% it stops if you get it if it's like

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510
65% it stops if you get it if it's like
 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.540
65% it stops if you get it if it's like
30% it doesn't matter it'll flow easily

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550
30% it doesn't matter it'll flow easily
 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.280
30% it doesn't matter it'll flow easily
you might as well not put anything in

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290
you might as well not put anything in
 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.320
you might as well not put anything in
so there's this magic range at about

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330
so there's this magic range at about
 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.540
so there's this magic range at about
50-60 percent and that's where you want

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550
50-60 percent and that's where you want
 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.010
50-60 percent and that's where you want
to get to in these guys and all of these

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020
to get to in these guys and all of these
 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.660
to get to in these guys and all of these
sauces they're gonna make what you're

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670
sauces they're gonna make what you're
 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.040
sauces they're gonna make what you're
gonna see is what they're doing is

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050
gonna see is what they're doing is
 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.660
gonna see is what they're doing is
they're getting the fraction up to

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670
they're getting the fraction up to
 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.310
they're getting the fraction up to
around that range so this is a movie of

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320
around that range so this is a movie of
 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.070
around that range so this is a movie of
molecules flowing over each other so see

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080
molecules flowing over each other so see
 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.990
molecules flowing over each other so see
they don't run into each other so the

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000
they don't run into each other so the
 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.390
they don't run into each other so the
viscosity is actually there's no problem

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400
viscosity is actually there's no problem
 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.720
viscosity is actually there's no problem
here

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730
here
 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.310
here
but on the other hand if you do with the

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320
but on the other hand if you do with the
 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.050
but on the other hand if you do with the
sort of simplest kind of a sauce that

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060
sort of simplest kind of a sauce that
 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.120
sort of simplest kind of a sauce that
you can imagine is a starch thickened

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130
you can imagine is a starch thickened
 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.030
you can imagine is a starch thickened
sauce and if you and will see it starts

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040
sauce and if you and will see it starts
 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.280
sauce and if you and will see it starts
to thicken sauce now if you put starch

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290
to thicken sauce now if you put starch
 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.100
to thicken sauce now if you put starch
I'm granules into a liquid you can put

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110
I'm granules into a liquid you can put
 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.210
I'm granules into a liquid you can put
them so there's this weird thing that

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220
them so there's this weird thing that
 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.690
them so there's this weird thing that
happens you can put them at a pretty low

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:29.700
happens you can put them at a pretty low
 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.890
happens you can put them at a pretty low
concentration a little volume fraction

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900
concentration a little volume fraction
 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.240
concentration a little volume fraction
is what we will say because sort of

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250
is what we will say because sort of
 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.650
is what we will say because sort of
there's a lot of free space here for

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660
there's a lot of free space here for
 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.030
there's a lot of free space here for
these things to move if you imagine

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.040
these things to move if you imagine
 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.200
these things to move if you imagine
these as people in the subway car

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.210
these as people in the subway car
 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.480
these as people in the subway car
they're not running into each other but

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490
they're not running into each other but
 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.830
they're not running into each other but
then the point is when you heat it they

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840
then the point is when you heat it they
 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.900
then the point is when you heat it they
swell and not only do they swell they

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910
swell and not only do they swell they
 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.350
swell and not only do they swell they
exclude excrete stuff they swell and

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360
exclude excrete stuff they swell and
 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.670
exclude excrete stuff they swell and
they excrete stuff and then what happens

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680
they excrete stuff and then what happens
 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.840
they excrete stuff and then what happens
is they end up like this

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:48.850
is they end up like this
 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.610
is they end up like this
and if you imagine that this is people

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620
and if you imagine that this is people
 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.070
and if you imagine that this is people
in the subway car then you see now it

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080
in the subway car then you see now it
 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.360
in the subway car then you see now it
doesn't move so easily and that's

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.370
doesn't move so easily and that's
 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.070
doesn't move so easily and that's
basically what it means this is the crux

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080
basically what it means this is the crux
 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.560
basically what it means this is the crux
of what it means to think in a sauce and

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:58.570
of what it means to think in a sauce and
 

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.300
of what it means to think in a sauce and
I have a little movie of this courtesy

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310
I have a little movie of this courtesy
 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.750
I have a little movie of this courtesy
of Harvard X you see the day so

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.760
of Harvard X you see the day so
 

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.280
of Harvard X you see the day so
basically and they also can stick to

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.290
basically and they also can stick to
 

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.690
basically and they also can stick to
each other not do they grow they stick

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:06.700
each other not do they grow they stick
 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.950
each other not do they grow they stick
to each other and now if they stick to

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960
to each other and now if they stick to
 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.270
to each other and now if they stick to
each other they even become bigger

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280
each other they even become bigger
 

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.880
each other they even become bigger
people so if you imagine the analogy in

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:11.890
people so if you imagine the analogy in
 

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.320
people so if you imagine the analogy in
the subway car imagine that there are

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:13.330
the subway car imagine that there are
 

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.970
the subway car imagine that there are
groups of people that decide to join

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:14.980
groups of people that decide to join
 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.700
groups of people that decide to join
hands and pummel through right that's

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:17.710
hands and pummel through right that's
 

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.140
hands and pummel through right that's
then you're gonna get mad if you're the

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.150
then you're gonna get mad if you're the
 

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.400
then you're gonna get mad if you're the
poor person walking he's only making it

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.410
poor person walking he's only making it
 

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.500
poor person walking he's only making it
harder to get through and that's exactly

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:22.510
harder to get through and that's exactly
 

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.930
harder to get through and that's exactly
what happens when you make sauces as

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:24.940
what happens when you make sauces as
 

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.940
what happens when you make sauces as
we're seeing and so this brings up which

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:26.950
we're seeing and so this brings up which
 

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.340
we're seeing and so this brings up which
is the equation of this week now what

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.350
is the equation of this week now what
 

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.120
is the equation of this week now what
are you supposed to do for the equation

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.130
are you supposed to do for the equation
 

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.190
are you supposed to do for the equation
of the week

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:31.200
of the week
 

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.659
of the week
so anyway but this is the equation and

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:33.669
so anyway but this is the equation and
 

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.250
so anyway but this is the equation and
it's a very simple equation and this

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:35.260
it's a very simple equation and this
 

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.900
it's a very simple equation and this
captures the whole idea of thickening

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:36.910
captures the whole idea of thickening
 

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.360
captures the whole idea of thickening
sauces which is it's the volume fraction

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:39.370
sauces which is it's the volume fraction
 

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.030
sauces which is it's the volume fraction
for some reason we call it fee Greek

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.040
for some reason we call it fee Greek
 

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.020
for some reason we call it fee Greek
letters just to make it sound

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:43.030
letters just to make it sound
 

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.640
letters just to make it sound
complicated but it's just the number of

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:44.650
complicated but it's just the number of
 

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.140
complicated but it's just the number of
particles times the volume of each

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.150
particles times the volume of each
 

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.270
particles times the volume of each
particle divided by the total volume and

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:48.280
particle divided by the total volume and
 

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.790
particle divided by the total volume and
basically the game is when that number

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800
basically the game is when that number
 

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.130
basically the game is when that number
gets to be a 50 60 percent your good

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.140
gets to be a 50 60 percent your good
 

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.250
gets to be a 50 60 percent your good
your thickened your sauce okay so now I

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.260
your thickened your sauce okay so now I
 

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.190
your thickened your sauce okay so now I
have one more thing to say I do have one

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200
have one more thing to say I do have one
 

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.110
have one more thing to say I do have one
more thing to say sorry but I think this

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120
more thing to say sorry but I think this
 

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.400
more thing to say sorry but I think this
is important for what you're gonna do

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.410
is important for what you're gonna do
 

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.650
is important for what you're gonna do
and I just want to so you know when you

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:04.660
and I just want to so you know when you
 

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.150
and I just want to so you know when you
add flour has anyone ever thickened

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160
add flour has anyone ever thickened
 

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.820
add flour has anyone ever thickened
gravy

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:06.830
gravy
 

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.400
gravy
I mean how much flour do you add a lot a

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.410
I mean how much flour do you add a lot a
 

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.950
I mean how much flour do you add a lot a
little a little because it swells right

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:11.960
little a little because it swells right
 

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.540
little a little because it swells right
that's why you don't have to add very

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:13.550
that's why you don't have to add very
 

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.010
that's why you don't have to add very
much because it swells so has anyone

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.020
much because it swells so has anyone
 

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.020
much because it swells so has anyone
ever thickened um you know sort of made

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.030
ever thickened um you know sort of made
 

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.940
ever thickened um you know sort of made
something more viscous by adding like a

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:18.950
something more viscous by adding like a
 

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.070
something more viscous by adding like a
like an anthem gum or some modernist

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:21.080
like an anthem gum or some modernist
 

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.790

thickener do you know how much you need

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800
thickener do you know how much you need
 

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.410
thickener do you know how much you need
teeny teeny teeny do you know how much

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:26.420
teeny teeny teeny do you know how much
 

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.630
teeny teeny teeny do you know how much
of the jello box is gelatin yeah it's

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640
of the jello box is gelatin yeah it's
 

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.370
of the jello box is gelatin yeah it's
very very that most of that jello box

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:33.380
very very that most of that jello box
 

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.570
very very that most of that jello box
you know what the main ingredient is in

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:34.580
you know what the main ingredient is in
 

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.390
you know what the main ingredient is in
the jello box sugar it's sugar it's not

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:37.400
the jello box sugar it's sugar it's not
 

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.040
the jello box sugar it's sugar it's not
Stella so so this is amazing actually

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.050
Stella so so this is amazing actually
 

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.120
Stella so so this is amazing actually
cuz if you think of this in terms of

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.130
cuz if you think of this in terms of
 

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.650
cuz if you think of this in terms of
volume fraction this is totally weird

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:41.660
volume fraction this is totally weird
 

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.880
volume fraction this is totally weird
because you add this little bit of this

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:42.890
because you add this little bit of this
 

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.500
because you add this little bit of this
stuff into this big amount of liquid and

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:44.510
stuff into this big amount of liquid and
 

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.020
stuff into this big amount of liquid and
it comes out and like if we go back to

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.030
it comes out and like if we go back to
 

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.270
it comes out and like if we go back to
the subway cars how does it work so the

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:49.280
the subway cars how does it work so the
 

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.030
the subway cars how does it work so the
answer is that that what happens is that

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040
answer is that that what happens is that
 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.130
answer is that that what happens is that
that these special molecules are

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.140
that these special molecules are
 

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.650
that these special molecules are
polymers and the weight and there's not

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:56.660
polymers and the weight and there's not
 

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.060
polymers and the weight and there's not
very much polymer but the polymer

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.070
very much polymer but the polymer
 

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.450
very much polymer but the polymer
basically forms a path and space which

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:01.460
basically forms a path and space which
 

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.700
basically forms a path and space which
creates a lot of volume and so it

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:03.710
creates a lot of volume and so it
 

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.680
creates a lot of volume and so it
actually takes up a lot of volume even

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:05.690
actually takes up a lot of volume even
 

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.090
actually takes up a lot of volume even
though it's just a little polymer in the

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:07.100
though it's just a little polymer in the
 

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.780
though it's just a little polymer in the
same way that the starch granule it

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:09.790
same way that the starch granule it
 

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.710
same way that the starch granule it
expands and it takes that much more

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720
expands and it takes that much more
 

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.420
expands and it takes that much more
volume that it had originally the

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:13.430
volume that it had originally the
 

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.280
volume that it had originally the
polymer sort of sweeps it out and takes

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:15.290
polymer sort of sweeps it out and takes
 

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:16.690
polymer sort of sweeps it out and takes
up that's much volume and that's why

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:16.700
up that's much volume and that's why
 

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.880
up that's much volume and that's why
modern has thickeners are able to work

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:18.890
modern has thickeners are able to work
 

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.370

more reasons but that's the most
 

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.790
more reasons but that's the most
important reasons why we thicken our

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800
important reasons why we thicken our
 

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.190
important reasons why we thicken our
food the thickening process dispersion

hydration and setting so when we're

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.230
hydration and setting so when we're
 

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.720
hydration and setting so when we're
adding a thickening agent we want to

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:23.730
adding a thickening agent we want to
 

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.850
adding a thickening agent we want to
make sure it's evenly distributed

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860
make sure it's evenly distributed
 

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.100
make sure it's evenly distributed
throughout the liquid we could use heat

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.110
throughout the liquid we could use heat
 

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.220

what you're using to thicken the food so

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180
what you're using to thicken the food so
 

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.910
what you're using to thicken the food so
and then hydration you want it's gonna

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920
and then hydration you want it's gonna
 

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.160
and then hydration you want it's gonna
absorb water or another liquid and it'll

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.170
absorb water or another liquid and it'll
 

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.460
absorb water or another liquid and it'll
swell that's how it thickens howdy the

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.470
swell that's how it thickens howdy the
 

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.600
swell that's how it thickens howdy the
thickening agent will make a thick

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:44.610
thickening agent will make a thick
 

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.670
thickening agent will make a thick
molecular mesh that traps water and

you're using gelatin of course it's

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:53.310
you're using gelatin of course it's
 

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.980
you're using gelatin of course it's
going to set when you chill it now we're

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:57.990
going to set when you chill it now we're
 

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.610
going to set when you chill it now we're
going to start by showing you some

going to start by showing you some
 

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.540
going to start by showing you some
thickening agents and can work so the

first one I'm going to use is blood so

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160
first one I'm going to use is blood so
 

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.670

French culinary repertoire that were
 

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.530
French culinary repertoire that were
thickened with blood and believe it not

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540
thickened with blood and believe it not

you can buy blood so when you're adding

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:24.810
you can buy blood so when you're adding
 

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.600
you can buy blood so when you're adding
blood and I'll show you it'll liaison as

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.610
blood and I'll show you it'll liaison as
 

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.329
blood and I'll show you it'll liaison as
well you with blood you add vinegar and

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339
well you with blood you add vinegar and
 

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:30.980
well you with blood you add vinegar and
we had a great discussion area about

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:30.990
we had a great discussion area about
 

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.970
we had a great discussion area about
what relief that does so you had a

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980
what relief that does so you had a
 

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.410
what relief that does so you had a
little bit of vinegar to the blood and

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420
little bit of vinegar to the blood and
 

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.960
little bit of vinegar to the blood and
it does stop it from coagulating just a

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:41.970
it does stop it from coagulating just a
 

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.850
it does stop it from coagulating just a
drop and another important feature when

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860
drop and another important feature when
 

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.360
drop and another important feature when
you're using blood you want to temper it

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:51.370
 

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.190
so tempering it is just you don't want

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:54.200
so tempering it is just you don't want
 

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200
so tempering it is just you don't want
to shock it going into a hot sauce I'm

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.210
to shock it going into a hot sauce I'm
 

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.100
to shock it going into a hot sauce I'm
just gonna take a little bit of the

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:57.110
just gonna take a little bit of the
 

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:03.400
just gonna take a little bit of the
sauce and temper it here I might just

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:03.410
sauce and temper it here I might just
 

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:10.960
sauce and temper it here I might just
add a little bit more blood why not and

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:10.970
add a little bit more blood why not and
 

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.690
add a little bit more blood why not and
many cultures today still use I mean you

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:16.700
many cultures today still use I mean you
 

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.760
many cultures today still use I mean you
might tell from my accent that I come

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:18.770
might tell from my accent that I come
 

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.050
might tell from my accent that I come
from across the pond and

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.060
from across the pond and
 

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.210
from across the pond and
we use blood sausage all the time for

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:22.220
we use blood sausage all the time for
 

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.180
we use blood sausage all the time for
breakfast so blood is still a part of of

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:25.190
breakfast so blood is still a part of of
 

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.500

dining in Ireland so what you want to do

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:29.510
dining in Ireland so what you want to do
 

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.650
dining in Ireland so what you want to do
is like you're doing a Montejo of beer I

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:32.660
is like you're doing a Montejo of beer I
 

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:42.600
is like you're doing a Montejo of beer I
just gently fold in the blood

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:42.610
 

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.860
so look gross

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:45.870
 

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.370
now do you notice what's happening the

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380
now do you notice what's happening the
 

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.530
now do you notice what's happening the
colors changing right and I can see a

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540
colors changing right and I can see a
 

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.010
colors changing right and I can see a
thickening here

00:15:59.010 --> 00:15:59.020
 

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:13.590
a little bit more heat so I will show

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600
a little bit more heat so I will show
 

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.780
a little bit more heat so I will show
you I'm just heating it a tiny bit more

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:15.790
you I'm just heating it a tiny bit more
 

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.120
you I'm just heating it a tiny bit more
you don't want it to go over 180 degrees

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.130
you don't want it to go over 180 degrees
 

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:30.600
you don't want it to go over 180 degrees
or you will have rambled blood so it

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:30.610
or you will have rambled blood so it
 

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.830
or you will have rambled blood so it
actually gives to this dish a very rich

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:33.840
actually gives to this dish a very rich
 

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.270
actually gives to this dish a very rich
complex sometimes it could be a little

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:36.280
complex sometimes it could be a little
 

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.100
complex sometimes it could be a little
metallic and you can see if you can do

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.110
metallic and you can see if you can do
 

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.890
metallic and you can see if you can do
you see the color and that's pretty

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:43.900
you see the color and that's pretty
 

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.180
you see the color and that's pretty
thick and it's very rich in Cocoa Van is

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:48.190
thick and it's very rich in Cocoa Van is
 

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.290

a very rich dish when you eat it it's a
 

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.720
a very rich dish when you eat it it's a
nice winter dish and that is taco van

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:56.730
nice winter dish and that is taco van
 

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.900
nice winter dish and that is taco van
thickened with blood and we can finish

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:00.910
thickened with blood and we can finish
 

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:08.710
thickened with blood and we can finish
it with some parsley

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720
 

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.880
now that's a beautiful look at the shine

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:10.890
now that's a beautiful look at the shine
 

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.909

and that sauce it's really nice so the

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919
and that sauce it's really nice so the
 

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:17.030
and that sauce it's really nice so the
next thickener is was used also in

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040
next thickener is was used also in
 

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.159
next thickener is was used also in
classic French cuisine and it's called a

00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:19.169
classic French cuisine and it's called a
 

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:24.710

liaison and eleazar basically two things

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720
liaison and eleazar basically two things
 

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.799
liaison and eleazar basically two things
coming together right and we have egg

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:27.809
coming together right and we have egg
 

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:37.940
coming together right and we have egg
yolks and cream now egg yolks are the

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:37.950
yolks and cream now egg yolks are the
 

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.100
yolks and cream now egg yolks are the
same they go over 180 degrees you're

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.110
same they go over 180 degrees you're
 

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.750
same they go over 180 degrees you're
going to have scrambled and it's sauce

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760
going to have scrambled and it's sauce
 

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:54.680
going to have scrambled and it's sauce
with a really lumpy texture okay so

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:54.690
with a really lumpy texture okay so
 

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.419
with a really lumpy texture okay so
you're familiar with an assault scald a

00:17:56.419 --> 00:17:56.429
you're familiar with an assault scald a
 

00:17:56.429 --> 00:17:57.250
you're familiar with an assault scald a
veloute

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:57.260
veloute
 

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.340
veloute
so veloute know so veloute is a velvet

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:01.350
so veloute know so veloute is a velvet
 

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.500
so veloute know so veloute is a velvet
sauce and it gets its name from a

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:03.510
sauce and it gets its name from a
 

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.020
sauce and it gets its name from a
liaison and a lot of restaurants that

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:06.030
liaison and a lot of restaurants that
 

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.730
liaison and a lot of restaurants that
say they serve a salute a really it's

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.740
say they serve a salute a really it's
 

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.030
say they serve a salute a really it's
not a veloute so but they you it's very

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.040
not a veloute so but they you it's very
 

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.450
not a veloute so but they you it's very

that it can only be done last minute

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.040
that it can only be done last minute
 

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.409
that it can only be done last minute
that means when the sauce is ready to be

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419
that means when the sauce is ready to be
 

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:25.010
that means when the sauce is ready to be
served

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020
served
 

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.260
served
you put the liaison on and it goes out

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:27.270
you put the liaison on and it goes out
 

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.750
you put the liaison on and it goes out
you can't reheat it it's going to turn

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760
you can't reheat it it's going to turn
 

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.360
you can't reheat it it's going to turn
into scrambled eggs and it gives a very

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:32.370
into scrambled eggs and it gives a very
 

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:40.350
into scrambled eggs and it gives a very
very unique texture

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360
 

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.500
so thanks Alex

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:44.510
so thanks Alex
 

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.970
so thanks Alex
so yet again I'm gonna just temporarily

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:45.980
so yet again I'm gonna just temporarily
 

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.680
so yet again I'm gonna just temporarily
haze on a little bit with some of the

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:49.690
 

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.960
this is just chicken stock with a very

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:52.970
this is just chicken stock with a very
 

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.590
this is just chicken stock with a very
small roux

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600
small roux
 

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:04.620
small roux
not a full rule that was chicken it so

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:04.630
 

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.590
now it should take on a velvety

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600
now it should take on a velvety
 

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.820
now it should take on a velvety
appearance this is exactly what this

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:12.830
appearance this is exactly what this
 

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.060
appearance this is exactly what this
will do and it makes it for a very

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:16.070
will do and it makes it for a very
 

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.440
will do and it makes it for a very
different mouthfeel it's very rich quite

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:20.450
different mouthfeel it's very rich quite
 

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.140
different mouthfeel it's very rich quite
delicious too

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.150
 

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.490
now I can feel that sauce F is

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:27.500
now I can feel that sauce F is
 

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.960
now I can feel that sauce F is
thickening and if you can see right

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:31.970
thickening and if you can see right
 

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.580
thickening and if you can see right
we don't have scrambled eggs that's a

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:33.590
we don't have scrambled eggs that's a
 

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.900
we don't have scrambled eggs that's a
good thing and that is Coco van and a

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:37.910
good thing and that is Coco van and a
 

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.750
good thing and that is Coco van and a
veloute and I'm gonna pass you down to

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760
veloute and I'm gonna pass you down to
 

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.540
veloute and I'm gonna pass you down to
Alex and Alex is going to show you two

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:43.550
Alex and Alex is going to show you two
 

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.460
Alex and Alex is going to show you two
more thickening and Alex is going to

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:45.470
more thickening and Alex is going to
 

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.530
more thickening and Alex is going to
demonstrate arrowroot and cornstarch as

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:47.540
demonstrate arrowroot and cornstarch as
 

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:56.860
demonstrate arrowroot and cornstarch as
a thickening agent I'm going to talk

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:56.870
a thickening agent I'm going to talk
 

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.650
a thickening agent I'm going to talk
about two more starches arrowroot and

00:19:59.650 --> 00:19:59.660
about two more starches arrowroot and
 

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.820
about two more starches arrowroot and
cornstarch and I'm gonna make two simple

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:03.830
cornstarch and I'm gonna make two simple
 

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.350
cornstarch and I'm gonna make two simple
sauces that we all can do the first the

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360
sauces that we all can do the first the
 

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.680
sauces that we all can do the first the
first our sauce I'm gonna make is a

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:10.690
first our sauce I'm gonna make is a
 

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.860
first our sauce I'm gonna make is a
simple sweet and sour sauce and I'm

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:14.870
simple sweet and sour sauce and I'm
 

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.430
simple sweet and sour sauce and I'm
gonna use cornstarch cornstarch is a

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440
gonna use cornstarch cornstarch is a
 

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:24.520
gonna use cornstarch cornstarch is a
starch from corn and and it has a strong

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:24.530
starch from corn and and it has a strong
 

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:30.130
starch from corn and and it has a strong
flavor and leaves an Opie color it's

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:30.140
flavor and leaves an Opie color it's
 

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.410
flavor and leaves an Opie color it's
it's not the perfect starts to use for a

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:35.420
it's not the perfect starts to use for a
 

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.120
it's not the perfect starts to use for a
clear finishing product but for a lot of

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.130
clear finishing product but for a lot of
 

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:46.050
clear finishing product but for a lot of
Asian dishes the cornstarch is good for

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.060
 

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:51.850
hot cold sweet savory dishes and it's

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:51.860
hot cold sweet savory dishes and it's
 

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.750
hot cold sweet savory dishes and it's
pretty universal it the the cons to

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760
pretty universal it the the cons to
 

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.610
pretty universal it the the cons to
using cornstarch is that it doesn't

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:00.620
using cornstarch is that it doesn't
 

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.750
using cornstarch is that it doesn't
recover from being frozen and the flavor

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760
recover from being frozen and the flavor
 

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.000
recover from being frozen and the flavor
if you use too much the flavor is strong

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.010
if you use too much the flavor is strong
 

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.460
if you use too much the flavor is strong
but the positive side of cornstarch is

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:09.470
but the positive side of cornstarch is
 

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.030
but the positive side of cornstarch is
gluten free and you know with all the

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.040
gluten free and you know with all the
 

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.030
gluten free and you know with all the
allergens going on in the world today

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.040
allergens going on in the world today
 

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.580
allergens going on in the world today
this is a good alternative so simple we

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:21.590
this is a good alternative so simple we
 

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:31.670
this is a good alternative so simple we
add all the ingredients a cup of soy

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:31.680
 

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.290
three tablespoons of sugar

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:36.300
 

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:47.420
a cup of rice wine vinegar and about a

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:47.430
a cup of rice wine vinegar and about a
 

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:55.130
a cup of rice wine vinegar and about a
half a cup of ketchup so to use corn

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140
half a cup of ketchup so to use corn
 

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.440
half a cup of ketchup so to use corn
starch as a thickener you have to make

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.450
starch as a thickener you have to make
 

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.230
starch as a thickener you have to make
what's called a slurry and a slurry is

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240
what's called a slurry and a slurry is
 

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.370
what's called a slurry and a slurry is
basically equal parts flour and water to

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380
basically equal parts flour and water to
 

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:11.960
basically equal parts flour and water to
a thick liquefied paste and the reason

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:11.970
a thick liquefied paste and the reason
 

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.410
a thick liquefied paste and the reason
why you make a slurry is that if you add

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:15.420
why you make a slurry is that if you add
 

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.170
why you make a slurry is that if you add
the cornstarch straight to the sauce

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:18.180
the cornstarch straight to the sauce
 

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.480
the cornstarch straight to the sauce
you would have clumps and lumps of

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:20.490
you would have clumps and lumps of
 

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.150
you would have clumps and lumps of
little little pillows of our corn starch

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:23.160
little little pillows of our corn starch
 

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:30.260
little little pillows of our corn starch
that won't blend properly with make sure

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:30.270
that won't blend properly with make sure
 

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.420
that won't blend properly with make sure
everything is incorporated and I'll

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:32.430
everything is incorporated and I'll
 

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:45.379
everything is incorporated and I'll
start the slurry

00:22:45.379 --> 00:22:45.389
 

00:22:45.389 --> 00:23:07.889
all right okay so you mix the water and

00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:07.899
all right okay so you mix the water and
 

00:23:07.899 --> 00:23:09.330
all right okay so you mix the water and
the cornstarch together you have your

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:09.340
the cornstarch together you have your
 

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.360
the cornstarch together you have your
slurry and when the sauce is up to a

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:12.370
slurry and when the sauce is up to a
 

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.710
slurry and when the sauce is up to a
boil it's the is the perfect time to add

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720
boil it's the is the perfect time to add
 

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.440
boil it's the is the perfect time to add
the slurry in the sauce definitely needs

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:19.450
the slurry in the sauce definitely needs
 

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.669
the slurry in the sauce definitely needs
to be boiling it needs to be above 180

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679
to be boiling it needs to be above 180
 

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:26.279
to be boiling it needs to be above 180
degrees and the slurry needs to start

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:26.289
degrees and the slurry needs to start
 

00:23:26.289 --> 00:23:28.169
degrees and the slurry needs to start
with cold water you can't start with hot

00:23:28.169 --> 00:23:28.179
with cold water you can't start with hot
 

00:23:28.179 --> 00:23:31.859
with cold water you can't start with hot
water because they will definitely do

00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:31.869
water because they will definitely do
 

00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:33.600
water because they will definitely do
something different to the thickening

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:33.610
something different to the thickening
 

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.749
something different to the thickening
where it will premature thicken the

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:36.759
where it will premature thicken the
 

00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:39.629
where it will premature thicken the
slurry but not thicken the sauce and

00:23:39.629 --> 00:23:39.639
slurry but not thicken the sauce and
 

00:23:39.639 --> 00:24:00.300
slurry but not thicken the sauce and
you'll have a broken broken sauce

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:00.310
 

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:05.340
it's most good from here that in just a

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.350
it's most good from here that in just a
 

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.720
it's most good from here that in just a

half a cup of water and there's much
more than a cup of the sauce and this is

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.450
more than a cup of the sauce and this is
 

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.300
more than a cup of the sauce and this is
a couple cups of sauce isn't it it is a

all of the slurry so attendees your
 

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:39.680

and just like the cornstarch I'm gonna
 

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:57.490
and just like the cornstarch I'm gonna
make a slurry with the error let's go

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:57.500
make a slurry with the error let's go
 

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.750

xanthan gum is used in a cold
 

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.640
xanthan gum is used in a cold
application xanthan gum can be used to

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:29.650
application xanthan gum can be used to
 

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.390
application xanthan gum can be used to
thicken dressings oils so you've gotta

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:33.400
thicken dressings oils so you've gotta
 

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.460
thicken dressings oils so you've gotta
think of cold for xanthan gum so does

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:35.470
think of cold for xanthan gum so does
 

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.800

anybody know what it's doing I mean

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:37.810
anybody know what it's doing I mean
 

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.020
anybody know what it's doing I mean
there wasn't very much xantham gum it

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.030
there wasn't very much xantham gum it
 

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.030
there wasn't very much xantham gum it
doesn't need much yeah so I mean

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:42.040
doesn't need much yeah so I mean
 

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.800
doesn't need much yeah so I mean
presumably the xanthan gum is a polymer

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:43.810
presumably the xanthan gum is a polymer
 

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.410
presumably the xanthan gum is a polymer
and presumably as such it's making a gel

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:46.420
and presumably as such it's making a gel
 

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.110
and presumably as such it's making a gel
in the water and that's trapping the

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120
in the water and that's trapping the
 

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.210
in the water and that's trapping the
water and not letting it out and I mean

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:51.220
water and not letting it out and I mean
 

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.560
water and not letting it out and I mean
what's amazing is that such a small

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:52.570
what's amazing is that such a small
 

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.320
what's amazing is that such a small
amount I mean I barely put any in just a

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:55.330
amount I mean I barely put any in just a
 

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.970
amount I mean I barely put any in just a
