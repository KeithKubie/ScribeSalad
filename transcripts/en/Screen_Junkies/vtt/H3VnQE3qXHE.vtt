HONEST TRAILER: The Last Airbender

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.879
VOICE
From the once successful director

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.259
who turned his own name into box-
office poison...comes the poorly

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.930
directed, lazily written, terribly
shot, poorly acted, clumsily

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.770
edited, oddly paced, insulting
adaptation of...

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.450
VOICE (CONT'D)
The Last Airbender.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.750
VOICE (CONT'D)
In crappily converted 3D!

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.880
VOICE (CONT'D)
Prepare for the vibrant world of

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.090
Nickelodeon's beloved Avatar to get

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.550
M. Night Shat-upon in the worst
cartoon adaptation since Dragonball

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.030
Evolution.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.610
VOICE (CONT'D)
Watch as the ethnically diverse

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.930
heroes you know and love are
brought to life...as generic white

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.300
kids!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.230
VOICE (CONT'D)
And the ethnically diverse

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.860
villains...stay ethnically diverse

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.530
VOICE (CONT'D)
Wonder in amazement at how a $150

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.370
million dollar movie ended up with
some of the worst special effects

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.680
ever put to film...

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.730
VOICE (CONT'D)
Scenes that weren't lit properly...

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.190
VOICE (CONT'D)
And unknown child actors who are

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.229
bad even by child actor standards.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.869
They haven't been able to conquer big cities like Ba Sing Se

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.640
but they're making plans I'm sure.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.570
So, are you the Avatar?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.960
VOICE (CONT'D)
Ugh. I hope these kids stayed in

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.240
school.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.200
VOICE (CONT'D)
Journey across four magical

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.360
kingdoms, where a chosen few *sort
of* have the power to bend the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.380
elements to their will

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560
VOICE (CONT'D)
Firebenders who can't catch

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.530
anything on fire

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.400
VOICE (CONT'D)
Waterbenders who can't get this guy

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.650
wet.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.290
Water drops on her brother and he's immediately
dry

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.299
VOICE (CONT'D)
And Earthbenders who could just as

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.190
easily have picked up this rock and
thrown it.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.479
Six Earth benders throw a single rock

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.070
VOICE (CONT'D)
But when the evil firebender Prince

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.990
Zuko goes on the warpath.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350
BRING ME ALL YOUR ELDERLY

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.810
VOICE (CONT'D)
Humanity's last hope is a boy who

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.729
can master every element, The
Avatar.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.610
VOICE (CONT'D)
Oh man, I wish. No, this pouty one

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.960
with all the henna tattoos...
doing his green-belt karate

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.810
demonstration.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.000
VOICE (CONT'D)
Join Aang and two unnecessary

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.509
sidekicks as they struggle to cram
20 episodes of backstory into one

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.330
movie, with techniques like...

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.769
VOICE (CONT'D)
Weird introductions.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.980
My name is Katara and I'm the only water
bender

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.340
left in the southern water tribe.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.319
VOICE (CONT'D)
Weird compliments.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.120
You are a gifted strategist...Your failure
in the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.519
100-day-seige of Bah Sing Se won't be held
against you

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.279
VOICE (CONT'D)
Awkward toasts.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.019
I wanted to thank General Iro and young Prince
Zuko

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.579
for dining with us...As you know, the fire
lord has banished

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.790
his son the prince and renounced his love
of him.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.879
VOICE (CONT'D)
And a super long Star Wars title

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.290
crawl.

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.349
VOICE (CONT'D)
You really should just fast-forward

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.609
through this part.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.980
VOICE (CONT'D)
And maybe even the whole movie...

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.529
VOICE (CONT'D)
Starring...

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:47.689
VOICE (CONT'D)
This girl

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:48.889
VOICE (CONT'D)
This Kid

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.299
VOICE (CONT'D)
This other kid

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.249
VOICE (CONT'D)
This Dude

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:52.980
VOICE (CONT'D)
Who cast this thing?

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.059
VOICE (CONT'D)
Oh the guy from the Daily Show!

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.569
VOICE (CONT'D)
And Slumdog Millionare!

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.569
VOICE (CONT'D)
The Last Airbender

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.049
VOICE (CONT'D)

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.409
If you thought this was bad, wait

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.359
til you see After Earth

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:05.889
So, is this the worst M. Night Shyamalan movie?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.069
Help us decide

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.519
by clicking our new Screen Junkies episode.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.419
VOICE (CONT'D)
"Respect my authoritah!"

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.510
"There's always money in the banana stand!"

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.409
"Flawless Victory"

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:17.859
"It's clobberin' time!"

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.040
"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.689
"Join me and together we can rule the ga"
