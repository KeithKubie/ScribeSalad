00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.160
- Rewrite Y is equal to

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.322
2/3x plus 4/7 in standard form.

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.490
The equation must be simplified,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.130
which means all numbers must be integers

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.220
that do not share a common
factor other than one.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.050
Alright, we'll worry about this
second part in a little bit.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.210
Let's see if we can rewrite this.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.930
So it's Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.140
Let me get my scratch pad out.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.010
So it's Y is equal to

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.000
2/3x plus 4/7.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.300
So the way that it's written right now,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.690
this is slope intercept form.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.930
It's written in the form

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.630
Y is equal to mx plus b,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.520
where m in this case is 2/3 and b is 4/7.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.100
It's very easy to figure
out what the slope

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.460
and what the Y intercept
is from this equation.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.470
But we wanna write this in standard form.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.800
Which would be the form

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.100
Ax plus By

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.540
is equal to C.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.520
And that extra text they were saying,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.130
the equation must be simplified.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.260
Which means all numbers must be integers

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.000
that do not share a common
factor other than one.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.190
That just means that A, B,
and C in the standard form

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.160
they want need to be integers.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.750
And they want them to not
have any common factors.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.830
So if we got to the point of say

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.290
4x plus 2y

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.530
is equal to 10,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.590
well this number, and this
number, and this number

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.920
are all divisible by two.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.530
They all have the common factor of two.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.220
So we would want to simplify it more.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.620
Divide them all by two
and then you would get

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.970
two so you divide this by two.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.460
You get 2x, divide this by two

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.960
you'll get plus y is equal to 5.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.960
So this is the form
that they're asking for

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.420
and probably because it's just easier

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.990
for the site to know that
this is the right answer.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.020
Because there's obviously a
bunch of forms in this way.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.790
So let's see if we can do that.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.500
Let's see if we can write
it in standard form.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.660
So the first thing I would wanna do is,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.160
well there's a bunch of ways
that you could approach it.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.770
The first thing you could try to do is

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.850
well let's get rid of
all of these fractions.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.970
And the best way to get
rid of the fractions

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.960
is to multiple by three
and to multiply by seven.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.730
If you multiply by three you
get rid of this fraction.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.730
If you multiply by seven you
get rid of this fraction.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.760
So if you multiply three
and you multiply by seven.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.580
Let me just rewrite it over here.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.890
There's actually also a couple
of ways that we can do this.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.260
So if you multiply.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.690
So one way to do it.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.400
So we start with Y is equal to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.280
2/3x plus 4/7.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.500
So if I multiply this side by
three and I multiply by seven,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.548
I have to do that to this side as well.

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:42.778
So this is going to be multiplied by three

00:02:42.778 --> 00:02:44.690
and multiplied by seven.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.630
So the left hand side becomes 21y.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.870
21y.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:52.990
Three times seven of course is
21, we just figured that out.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.790
We would distribute the 21.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.460
21 times 2/3, well let's see.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.730
21 divided by three is
seven, times two is 14.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.830
So it's gonna be 14x.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.110
And then 21 divided by seven
is three times four is 12.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.510
So just like that I was able
to get rid of the fractions.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.330
And now I wanna get all the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.220
X's and Y's on one side.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.720
So I wanna get this
14x onto the left side.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.330
So let's see if I can do that.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.008
So I'm gonna do that by.

00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:25.730
To get rid of this I would
want to subtract 14x.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.060
I can't just do it on the right hand side

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.290
I have to do it on the
left hand side as well.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.090
So I wanna subtract 14x, and
then what am I left with?

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.990
Let me give myself a
little bit more space.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.520
So on the left hand side I have

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.450
negative 14x plus 21y.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.620
Plus 21y

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.550
is equal to.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.390
Let's see and I subtracted
14x to get rid of this.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.650
And then I have this is equal to 12.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.960
Now let's see, am I done?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.120
Do these share any, do 14, 21, and 12

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.740
share any common factors?

00:04:03.996 --> 00:04:07.531
Let's see, 14 is divisible
by two and seven.

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:10.260
21 is divisible by three and seven.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.770
12 is divisible by two, six, three, four.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.800
But all of these aren't
divisible by the same number.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.030
14, let's see.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.570
14 is divisible two,
so is 12, but 21 isn't.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.520
14 is divisible by seven,
so is 21, but 12 isn't.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.760
And 21 and 12 are divisible
by three but 14 isn't.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.960
So I think this is about as
simplified as I could get.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.030
If there was a common factor
for all three of these numbers

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.860
then I would divide all
of them the way I did

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.360
in that previous example.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.500
But that's not the case right over here.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.960
So it's negative 14x
plus 21y is equal to 12.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.660
So let me see if I can
remember that and type that in.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.070
So it is,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.970
negative 14x plus 21y

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.480
is equal to 12.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.229
Now let's see if I got it right.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.780
It worked out.
