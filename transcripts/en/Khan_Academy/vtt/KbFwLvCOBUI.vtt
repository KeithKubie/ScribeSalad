00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:03.231
- [Voiceover] We have six
x squared, minus 120 x,

00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:05.925
plus 600, equals zero.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.782
Like always, pause this video,

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:09.626
and see if you can solve for x,

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:13.378
if you could find the x values
that satisfy this equation.

00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:15.777
Alright, let's work through this together.

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:20.227
The numbers here don't seem
like outlandish numbers.

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:22.944
They seem like something that
I might be able to deal with,

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:26.334
and I might be able to factor,
so let's try to do that.

00:00:26.334 --> 00:00:28.261
The first thing I like
to do is see if I can get

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.210
a coefficient of one, on
the second degree term,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.789
on the x-squared term.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.878
It looks like actually all of these terms

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:36.208
are divisible by six.

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.988
So if we divide both sides
of this equation by six,

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:42.355
I'm still going to have
nice integer coefficients.

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:43.237
Let's do that.

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:45.304
Let's divide both sides by six.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:48.160
If we divide the left side
by six, divide by six,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.667
divide by six, divide by six.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.407
And I divide the right side by six.

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:55.938
If I do that, and clearly
if I do the same thing

00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:57.092
to both sides of the equation,

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:58.864
then the equality still holds.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:03.755
On the left-hand side, I am
going to be left with x squared,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.499
and then negative 120, divided by six.

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:09.411
That is, let's see.

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.071
120 divided by six is 20.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.813
So that's minus 20 x.

00:01:15.813 --> 00:01:18.625
Then 600 divided by six, is 100.

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:23.580
So plus 100, is equal
to zero divided by six.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.728
Is equal to zero.

00:01:25.728 --> 00:01:27.443
So let's see if we can factor,

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:30.276
if we can express this quadratic

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.992
as a product of two expressions.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.385
The way we think about this,

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.104
and we've done it multiple times,

00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:40.631
if we have something, if we have x plus a,

00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:44.254
times x plus b, and this is
hopefully review for you.

00:01:44.254 --> 00:01:47.365
If you multiply that out,
that is going to be equal to,

00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:52.365
that equals to x squared, plus a, plus b,

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.614
x, plus a b.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.772
What we want to do is
see if we can factor this

00:01:58.772 --> 00:02:01.396
into an x plus a, and an x plus b.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:06.007
A plus b, needs to be
equal to negative 20.

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:07.928
That needs to be a plus b.

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:10.969
And then a times b, right over here,

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.780
that needs to be equal
to the constant term.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.659
That needs to be a times
b, right over there.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.467
Can we think of two numbers,
that if we take their product,

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:22.927
we get positive 100, and
if we take their sum,

00:02:22.927 --> 00:02:24.924
we get negative 20?

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:26.642
Well since their product is positive,

00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:29.255
we know that they have the same sign.

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:32.445
They're both going to have the same sign.

00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:34.511
They're either both going to be positive,

00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:36.090
or their both going to be negative,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.016
since we know that we
have a positive product.

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:41.036
Since their sum is negative,

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.567
well they both must both be negative.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:46.516
You can't add up two positive
numbers, and get a negative.

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:49.859
So they both must be negative.

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.345
Let's think about it a little bit.

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:55.566
What negative numbers,
when I add them together

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:59.115
I get negative 20, when
I multiply it, I get 100?

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:00.753
Well you could try to factor 100.

00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:03.271
You could say, well negative
two times negative 50,

00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:06.475
or negative four times negative 25.

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:07.892
But the one that might jump out at you

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:12.118
is this is negative 10,
times, I'll write it this way,

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:15.229
negative 10, times negative 10,

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:19.339
and this is negative 10, plus negative 10.

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.539
So in that case, both our a and
our b, would be negative 10.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:26.381
And so we can rewrite the
left side of this equation as,

00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:29.028
we can rewrite it as,

00:03:29.028 --> 00:03:31.234
x, and I'll write it this way at first,

00:03:31.234 --> 00:03:33.853
x plus negative 10,

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:36.636
times,

00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:42.204
x plus negative 10 again.

00:03:42.204 --> 00:03:44.412
X plus negative 10,

00:03:45.527 --> 00:03:48.470
and that is going to be equal to zero.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.722
So all I've done is I've
factored this quadratic.

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:54.205
Another way, these are both
the same thing as x minus 10.

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:59.205
I could rewrite this
as x minus 10, squared,

00:03:59.662 --> 00:04:02.010
is equal to zero.

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:04.840
The only way that the left-hand side

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.186
is going to be equal to zero,

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:08.230
is if x minus 10 is equal to zero.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.274
You could think of this as taking

00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:11.759
the square root of both sides.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.943
It doesn't matter if
you're taking the positive

00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:14.738
or negative square root, or both of them.

00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:16.588
The square root of zero, is zero.

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:21.588
So, we would say, that x minus
10 needs to be equal to zero.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.785
So x , adding 10 to both sides of this,

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:28.796
you have x is equal to 10, is the solution

00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:32.117
to this quadratic equation, up here.
