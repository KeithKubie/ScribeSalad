[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.780
KEVIN SHANAHAN:
Thank you, Jenny.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.760
So as she mentioned, my
name is Kevin Shanahan,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.980
and I'm a project
manager at Peak.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.930
Today I just wanted to talk
about our view of growth.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.600
It's about testing
lots of ideas,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.490
and some of the
principles and process

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.070
that you can use yourselves
to grow sustainably.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.840
So I'm going to use
a lot of examples

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.270
from Peak in my presentation.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.030
So just as a bit of
context as to who we are,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.750
we're a brain-training app
on both Android and iOS.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.705
We have more than 40
games within the app

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.996
to train your cognitive skills.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.000
We're a free app to
download, but if you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.010
want to access the
full set of features,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.380
you need to upgrade to a
Pro subscription for that.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.700
So we're what's called a
freemium app business model.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.930
Cool.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.380
So jumping into growth
is testing lots of ideas.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.340
So to begin with, I just
wanted to illustrate the point

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.040
by showing you four
different conversion tests

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.536
that we've run in
the past six months.

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.510
And I was hoping to
ask the audience which

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.160
one-- similar to what Jenny
did, which one you think

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.190
had the biggest impact
on our conversion rate.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.130
So if we take them in
turn, the first one

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.830
was making the ability
to replay games

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.400
in a given day a Pro feature.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.710
The second one was
reducing the price of Pro

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.220
by 25% in our top two markets.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.190
The third one was
bundling add-on modules

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.220
from our partners, such as
Cambridge and Yale University,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.189
into the Pro subscription.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.730
And the fourth one was showing
a preview of Pro-only content,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.604
so that users could
actually see what they're

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:48.280
getting before they buy it.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.766
So which one do you guys
think had the biggest impact?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.880
D?

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.291
Hearing lots of
different letters.

00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:00.320
Maybe for A, show of hands?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.820
Cool.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.460
For B?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.220
For C?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.000
Not a popular one.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.100
For D?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.870
Wow, OK.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.510
So that's interesting,
because the answer was A.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.150
Making game replays
a Pro feature

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.310
actually increased
our conversion rate

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.890
by more than 50%, which
is huge for the business.

00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:27.490
And you can go further.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.600
It actually had a bigger
impact on our conversion

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.626
rate in the last 10
tests we did, combined.

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:34.750
So what's the key takeaway?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.000
Well, basically, you don't know
what's going to work and what

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.750
won't.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.240
So the key is to test lots of
ideas as quickly as you can.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.240
Cool.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.770
So taking that on board, how
should you approach testing

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.140
in your company?

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.370
Well, we think that before
you test for growth,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.170
you need a great product to
do so, with a great retention,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.750
if you have a customer lifetime
component to your business

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.914
model.

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:02.080
If you don't have this,
then what's going to happen?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.667
Well, you'll be
adding more users

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.500
into the top of the
funnel, but they'll just

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.660
be leaking out down the funnel.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.580
So you won't be able
to grow your business,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.967
and you're going to be looking
like the leaky app there

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:13.300
in the bottom right hand corner.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.970
So testing for growth is
by nature quantitative,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.580
so we also think that you
need a data-informed culture

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.800
to test successfully.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.570
I picked out four
things here that I

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.210
think we do quite well at Peak,
which might be useful for you

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.800
guys.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.070
The first thing is just starting
lots of team discussions

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.340
about ideas for tests,
or tests that you're

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.745
running at the moment.

00:03:39.745 --> 00:03:41.370
And we use Slack for
that, because it's

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.400
a very collaborative tool.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.390
The second thing is
sharing test results.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.670
We use Google Docs, because,
again, it's very collaborative.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.290
The third is
publishing dashboards

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.011
that everyone in your
company has access to.

00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:57.510
This is particularly
useful when you

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.940
have funnels like
your onboarding funnel

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.190
or your conversion funnel.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.070
And last but not least,
it's important to prioritize

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.220
analytics, because it's very
easy for analytics tasks

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.240
to drop by the wayside as
you're building new features.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.800
So our top tip
for that is always

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.350
having an analytic
subtask for the main task

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.326
that you're testing.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.600
Cool.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.460
But the watch-out with data is
to beware of the local maxima.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.211
So if you follow data by
itself, that's very easy.

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:34.710
That's very good at helping you
to optimize what you already

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.647
have.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:37.230
But it's probably
not going to get you

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.950
to your global
maxima as a business.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.000
For that, we believe you need
a long-term product strategy,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.080
and data is just
one input into that.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.810
You should also think of testing
as not just testing features

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.990
within the app, but also
testing other things.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.645
So you should also be testing
your in-app messaging,

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:57.009
your email, your
push notifications.

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.800
There are really very
few limits as to what

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.420
you can test in your
company, and it's

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.710
a good way of making
sure that everyone

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.110
is involved in the process.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.150
So I thought I'd give
you one example of that.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.990
We've run a couple
of really nice tests

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.590
on the Google Play Store,
using the great tools that

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.550
are available there.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.740
So three tests.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.367
The first one was changing
the short description.

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:23.450
So it used to be one that
was a simple description

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.960
of our app, what we do.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.220
And we changed
that to be one that

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.340
highlights an award we received
from Google last year as one

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.387
of the top Android apps.

00:05:33.387 --> 00:05:34.970
The second one was
changing the format

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.114
of the icon from a more abstract
one to one with our name in it.

00:05:38.114 --> 00:05:39.780
And the third one was
changing the color

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.090
of the icon from a light
blue to a light gray.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.775
So three very small things,
which, to be honest, none of us

00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:48.160
had high hopes for.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.350
But cumulatively, they led to a
50% increase in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.274
install rate.

00:05:53.274 --> 00:05:54.773
So that's a hell
of a lot more users

00:05:54.773 --> 00:05:56.776
that we're getting in the
top of the funnel now.

00:05:56.776 --> 00:05:58.150
And there were a
lot of learnings

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.863
that we took from this to other
parts of the business as well.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.839
OK, so those were
a few principles.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.380
I'm now just going
to briefly mention

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.540
how we approach process.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.900
So similar to Jenny's diagram,
there's kind of six key steps

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.960
that we think are involved
in a testing process.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.410
The first one is
brainstorming ideas.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.920
So ideally, you'll
want to get ideas

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.235
from as many people in your
company as possible for that.

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:31.190
The second one is
prioritizing those ideas.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.940
And to do this,
what we tend to do

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.996
is group the ideas by which part
of the funnel we're testing.

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:39.120
And then within that, we
will prioritize them based

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.482
on the impacts that we
think each test will have,

00:06:42.482 --> 00:06:44.940
taking into account that you
never really know which one is

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.600
going to work and
which one won't.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.310
Once you have an
idea of what to test,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.950
you should then try and come
up with the minimal viable test

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.940
for that.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.890
So that's the
quickest, easiest thing

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.540
you can do to either validate
or refute your hypothesis.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.240
You'll then implement your test.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.710
You'll analyze the results.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.340
And the key one is
really to learn from it.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.090
So you want to make sure
that the next steps are

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.950
very clear, that
everyone in your business

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.626
understands what the test
was, what the results were.

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:16.500
And you want to think,
is there anything else

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.667
that I'm doing at the moment
that this test affects?

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.980
So I thought I would
leave you with one thing

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.650
that we find works
very well for testing.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.610
It's to have a shared
testing spreadsheet.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.640
We use Google Sheets,
again, for that.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.390
And I'm going to share it with
Jenny at the end of today.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.080
But if you want, I can
also share it with anyone

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.250
here in the audience.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.070
Just come up to me and
I can send you a copy.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.180
But basically, at
a high level, there

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.690
are five parts to
this spreadsheet.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.960
So the first part is an overview
of the tests themselves,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.370
so description, the
rationale behind them.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.100
The second part is information
on the segment of users

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.567
that we're testing.

00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:04.900
The third part is information
about the control and test

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.920
split within that segment.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.910
The fourth part are the
key KPIs for our tests.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.110
And the fifth part are the
results and the next steps

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.060
for the test that we finished.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.120
So the reason why this
works particularly well

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.030
is that when you
do big tests, they

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.340
tend to affect almost
everyone in the company.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.470
So for example, people
in customer service

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.928
need to know what tests we're
running, because we might get

00:08:28.928 --> 00:08:31.120
a lot of emails
from users asking

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.539
what's going on with the
Peak app in such-and-such?

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.809
So them having access to
this document really helps.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.820
It's also particularly
good because you

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.880
need one source of truth
for all your tests,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.230
one place that people can come
and find out the information.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.840
And we find this a very easy
tool that everyone understands.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.580
You know, spreadsheets
are not rocket science.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.074
So this has worked great for us.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.552
So just to summarize,
then, you can't be sure

00:09:00.552 --> 00:09:02.510
what's going to work and
what won't, so the key

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.160
is to test lots of
different ideas.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
In order to do this well,
it's important to have

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.930
a great product.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.590
Having a data-informed
culture is also key.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.900
At the same time, be
wary of the local maxima,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.750
and make sure that you
test features not just

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.940
inside the app.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.390
We think that having
a well-defined process

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.255
is very important too, and
that shared experiments doc

00:09:25.255 --> 00:09:28.400
that I just showed you is
really one of our key ways

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.970
that we test quickly
and effectively.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.420
