00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.810
We define adolescence as the years between
childhood and adulthood.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.580
The exact age might depend on the country
— things like the age you can vote or drink

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.910
— but it’s roughly defined as being from
age 10 to 19.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.090
But, a new study is suggesting that adolescence
should end as late as 24 to account for the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.840
full range of human development.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.800
WOOOOOO aww wait i’m still an adult.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.350
Compared to other animals, humans give birth
to pretty helpless babies.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.689
Newborn sea turtles can find the ocean on
their own and giraffe calves can walk unaided

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.369
within hours of being born…

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.850
Whereas, we can’t even hold our own heads
up for the first two months of life!

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.969
Comparably, we can take years and years to
becoming fully-formed and functioning humans.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.750
Adolescence is defined as “the period following
the onset of puberty during which a young

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.580
person develops from a child into an adult,”
and it’s commonly associated with our teenage

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.580
years.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.629
But what if that’s all wrong?

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.789
What if adolescence doesn’t end until our
mid-20s?

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.390
Typically, at 18, our parents are no longer
responsible for us, we can vote, we can go

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.789
out into the world and get jobs!

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.640
But, that doesn’t mean we’re not still
growing and changing…

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.409
For example: females develop more regular
menstrual cycles... and males could still

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.860
see some growth in height!

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.010
Some people don’t even develop their wisdom
teeth until their early 20s!

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.130
And both males and females gain bone and have
slight increases in weight gain.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.119
Not to mention the human brain continues to
form and develop until our mid-20s, too.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.430
Meaning we reach maturity, in terms of judgment
and decision-making, at about 24 or 25.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.341
And let’s stick to that, because body changes
outside of adolescence are one thing, but

00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:36.079
brain development is another.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.220
The frontal lobes, the areas of the brain
responsible for planning, working memory,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.130
and impulse control are some of the last to
reach maturity.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.430
As a child grows, the brain makes more and
more neural connections.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.450
Gray matter volume peaks at about 11 or 12
years old, then the unused connections are

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.930
pruned away, leaving behind an efficient brain
that’s more adept at making informed decisions

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.039
and reacting to its environment.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.110
But there’s also research that shows the
teenage brain, under development, is more

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.090
vulnerable to impulsive sexual, eating, and
sleep habits.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.770
In addition, the high rate of drunk driving
among teens has been linked to their underdeveloped

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.420
prefrontal cortices and limbic systems.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.660
Teenage brains are, simply, works in progress.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.580
Whereas, most research seems to agree, development
is pretty much over by about 25.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.390
Thanks to societal changes in the West, the
transitional period between childhood and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.340
adulthood is taking up a greater portion of
our lives.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.080
We’re waiting longer to get married and
start families, and more people are attending

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.670
college than did 50 years ago, extending their
school-age-years.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.400
So, maybe it IS time we changed how we define
“adolescence.”

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.080
What do you think?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.910

For more on the amazingness that is the brain,
here’s a video about how it powers your

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.400
thoughts.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.920
Do you think we should reconsider the age
of adolescence?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.870
I mean, 30 years old works for hobbits … why
not us?
