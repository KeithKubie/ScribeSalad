00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.480
- My husband and I went on safari

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.885
and in a little hut was a gift shop

00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:13.420
and they sold elephant-dung paper,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.290
and I bought several pieces

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.220
and sent them to my pop-up
friends, the paper engineers,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.970
saying, "Well, what are
you gonna do with this?"

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.760
And so Ed Hutchins, who
is just a great dear,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.750
he made this for me, 
"Thinking of you,"

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.513
this is an elephant made
of elephant-dung paper.

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:38.901
- That's really the circle
of life right there.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:41.540
(laughing)

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.800
- That's recycling at its best.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.030
I am Ellen G.K. Rubin

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.680
and I collect pop-up and
movable books and paper.

00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:57.000
I think I wanted to know a body of work,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.730
instead of a smattering of this and that,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.190
something that I could sink my teeth into

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.800
and wanting to be an expert
on something was a goal.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
I get contacted by scholars,
people doing their theses,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
they come here, they do some research here

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.822
or they inquire of me,

00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:21.960
because I literally get
it from around the world

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.793
of people doing research on the flap books

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:23.626
or on the volvelles.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.513
I would go to a cocktail party

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:34.440
or a place, where I
didn't know many people

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.838
and people would say,
"Well, what do you do?"

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:38.090
"Do you work?"

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.393
That question was always answered,

00:01:39.393 --> 00:01:41.530
"Do you mean outside the home?"

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.470
And I went to Yale Medical School

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.580
to be a physician associate,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.430
most people call it physician assistant,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.520
and then when I was
working outside the home,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.541
I said, "Oh, I do
bone-marrow transplants,"

00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:57.870
and they immediately left my side,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.740
"I have to refresh my drink,"

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.630
or something, nobody wanted to know

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.250
anything about what I did

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.850
and so I quickly learned
to say, "Oh well, 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.250
I collect and write about
pop-up and movable books,"

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.592
and their instant smile, which
we call "The Smile Effect"

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:15.920
and they would say, "Oh,
I love those books."

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.602
When I have the opportunity to
talk to people about pop-ups,

00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:24.250
there are three things
I want them to know.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.660
One, they did not start in the 1970s,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.220
the way these Random House books did,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.080
and the earliest books and I
just showed you, one from 1547,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.118
were not for children,
they were for adults

00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:40.200
and they were used as instruments,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.760
mathematics, astronomy,
astrology, and medicine.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.760
This is from 1933, there
are text describing

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.740
what a woman can do to
be a better sex partner

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.607
and so when you say a picture
is worth a thousand words,

00:02:59.607 --> 00:03:02.650
a movable is worth so much more.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.860
To this day, every movable book

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.470
is handmade.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.980
I tell a story of when
I was in first grade,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.860
the class subscribed to
Humpty Dumpty magazine

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.520
and so it was for first graders.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.030
and with scissors and glue,
you could make things.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.610
And then when we got to second grade,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.180
my classmates graduated
to Children's Digest

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.002
and I refused, because Children's Digest

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:38.790
didn't have things to make.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.040
I enjoy doing this,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.160
but I don't have the
skills that these require

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.070
and actually most conservators

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.730
do not have the skill.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.310
I consider myself a cheerleader

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.670
and when I started collecting,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.300
publishers did not put
the paper engineer's name

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.340
anywhere in the book. That
seemed to me criminal,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.369
because it's not a pop-up
book without a paper engineer,

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:18.152
that's where I got the
idea that paper engineers,

00:04:18.152 --> 00:04:20.730
and I didn't even know
the term at that point,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.317
but paper engineers are the artists

00:04:22.317 --> 00:04:25.930
who take the illustrations
and make them move,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.790
and that they are puppet masters,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.010
but they hand the strings
to us, the reader,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.050
we are the ones who activate everything,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.850
who make them come alive.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.630
My son knows I collect elephants

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.490
and so he created this Build-A-Bear

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.120
and he sewed this little pop-up book

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.500
onto the elephant

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.209
and he created this.

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:59.320
- [Elephant] I love the Popuplady,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.487
she's my very best friend.
