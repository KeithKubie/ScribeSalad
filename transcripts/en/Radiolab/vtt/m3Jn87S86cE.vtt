1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.780
You are listening to radio lab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.093
S. E. Yep.

3
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.170
<v 1>Maybe all of us can sit on the couch. You know, we can see,</v>

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.590
I can rock and pull that chair over.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.600
<v 0>So we're going to start with a story from our producer,</v>

6
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.800
Pat Walters about a couple, oh my word then it's okay.

7
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:25.280
So Janet, this is, I mentioned a couple episodes ago, by the way,

8
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:29.360
this is Jad Radiolab that we'll be bringing back some episodes back into the

9
00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:33.530
flow from time to time episodes that we haven't stopped thinking about the field

10
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:37.190
truer to us now than before. Maybe the opposite, you know,

11
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:40.250
episodes that we still end up getting into fights with people about.

12
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:45.251
And a couple of years ago we ran a story about a guy named Kevin and a little

13
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:49.400
bit more recently. Hello? Robert, are you there? Yes. Great.

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.040
Jen will be here in just a sec. Robert Sapolsky,

15
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.140
a neuroscientist at Stanford who Robert Krulwich and I have had on the show many

16
00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:58.370
times. Uh,

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.560
he recently wrote a book in which he makes an argument that really tries to kind

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.450
of just explode that story, uh,

19
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:07.820
in a way that we found sort of interesting.

20
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.320
It was just by a hunch that it plays near a lot of your buttons.

21
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.720
Sure does. So what we did was we sent him that piece, hadn't listened to it,

22
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.340
and actually what we'll do now is replay that piece and then at the end we'll

23
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:26.000
come back and a little bit of a fight about it.

24
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.940
So we're going to start with a story from our producer,

25
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:33.290
Pat Walters about a couple, oh, my word. Oh, that's the lady.

26
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.970
I'm Janet. This is the guy.

27
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.680
<v 1>So I don't need you to introduce yourself. That's usually the thing we do,</v>

28
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.340
but we're not telling people who you are. We're going to call him Kevin. Kevin,

29
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:46.350
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah, that's my name. That's suspicious at all. Yeah.

30
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.280
<v 0>It's not as real name. That make sense?</v>

31
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:49.960
Why we're not using his real name in a second.

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.800
<v 1>Okay. You know, so this one starts a few summers ago. It was July, 2006.</v>

33
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.580
Jan and Kevin were at home and, uh,

34
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.970
some people you don't know show up and maybe out start with you

35
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.100
<v 2>when they show up at their door. So we were, it was a,</v>

36
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:09.010
we were getting ready to go down the shore. It was a Friday. So we,

37
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:11.500
so we're in the kitchen and, and they come to the back door.

38
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.770
<v 1>I thought the, I thought that they were fundraising.</v>

39
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:16.620
I thought they might've been firemen just by, you know, the, the blue shirt,

40
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:19.440
the blue shirt, and then realized that, uh, that they were,

41
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.910
they were law enforcement,

42
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.050
<v 2>two women and a, I think two men came up from around the, you know,</v>

43
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:30.830
the side of the house and they show us their badges or are they cops or they

44
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:32.210
were homeland security.

45
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.080
They took me outside and they kept me and they asked me to stay in the kitchen

46
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.650
and they had a, a woman with me. I didn't know what was going on.

47
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.310
Nobody said anything.

48
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.250
<v 1>What are they saying to you on the porch? Meanwhile, when the,</v>

49
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.020
when they showed up, like after the door, you said, you know, while we're here,

50
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:52.820
I said, yeah, I do. I was expecting you

51
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.820
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

52
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.710
<v 1>and I showed him where everything was. Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.840
<v 0>This story about Kevin and his wife,</v>

54
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:06.640
Janet inspired us to do the entire hour because one of the most basic things

55
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.150
that we do as people is we judge, we judge one another.

56
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.780
We judge what's right and what's wrong. But this story and the two that follow,

57
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.040
they will make you judge how you judge, or at least they had that effect on us.

58
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.350
We're calling our show

59
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.860
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

60
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.670
<v 0>blame. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich and we'll go back to bat.</v>

61
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.743
Before we do,

62
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.190
you should know that this show contains some graphic difficult descriptions in a

63
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.430
few spots. If you're not in the mood or if you have kids around,

64
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.230
you might want to sit this one out.

65
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.170
<v 1>Okay. So what happened in that first scene and what happens next?</v>

66
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.940
Only makes sense. If we go back a little first

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.390
about 15 years, it's just an ordinary day.

68
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.000
Kevin's going home from work and um,

69
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.210
I was driving home going about 65 70 in the fast lane when suddenly there was a

70
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.650
thump in my chest.

71
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.160
Then he just a heat boating. After that,

72
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:13.780
he said suddenly he had this thickness in my tongue and my throat than about

73
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:14.614
taste in his mouth.

74
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.030
Then my hearing faded out.

75
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.373
Any thoughts?

76
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.943
<v 4>It's back</v>

77
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.280
<v 1>when I finally did come to, uh,</v>

78
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.870
he sees his car is smashed into the side of an apartment building.

79
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.110
I do recall the officers telling, you know, you've been in an accident,

80
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:34.741
you've been at an end.

81
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:39.180
He remembers one of them insisted that he smelled alcohol and I was talking

82
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:43.230
through clenched teeth cause I had bit my tongue and uh, and my cheeks.

83
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.070
I was saying over and over again, I had a seizure, I had a seizure.

84
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.000
<v 5>Kevin's got epilepsy. He's had it since he was a teenager.</v>

85
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.610
But two years before this all happened,

86
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:01.660
he'd had surgery to remove the part of his brain that was causing the seizures

87
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.350
and it seemed to have worked. He was doing great.

88
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.970
Essentially wasn't having seizures anymore until suddenly you

89
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.330
<v 1>lost your license. I lost my license for a year.</v>

90
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.680
Things had kind of taken a nosedive. Like here he is, he's 35 years old.

91
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.970
I'm living with my brother,

92
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.971
I'm divorced and I have to call my daddy and ask him now to drive me to and from

93
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:29.830
work and you think I need to do something. This is not sustainable now.

94
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.450
Now don't, don't need that.

95
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.160
So I walked into the office as HR person where he works for a list of all the

96
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.560
employees, give me a list of everybody and where they're from.

97
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.150
So she pulled it up, I go down the list and I get to Janet Woodruff, Bloomfield,

98
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.010
only one. It's really close to me, five minutes away. So I walk to her cube,

99
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.390
knocked on the, on the wall and uh,

100
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.320
introduced myself like, Hey, my name is Kevin. I also work here.

101
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.560
I got this thing though. It's kind of awkward. I can't drive.

102
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.950
And I was wondering if you'd give me a ride. And uh,

103
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.660
she said yes.

104
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.840
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

105
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.720
<v 2>I really passed by his street. I mean on the way to work.</v>

106
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:16.050
So it was right on history pretty much. But I made it clear, you know,

107
00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:19.140
I'll do it when I can. And as they drove together, they started talking,

108
00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:23.280
finding out little bit more about each other pretty quickly.

109
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.480
We liked the same music and that was unique because I sort of liked music that

110
00:06:27.481 --> 00:06:31.350
was probably more in his error. Kevin was seven years older than Jan.

111
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.500
What kind of music were you listening to? Jackson Brown, mostly.

112
00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:38.380
Lot of Jackson Brown. James Taylor just call um,

113
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.140
Bonnie Raitt. It's a little, you know, Elton John,

114
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.480
they found themselves

115
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.480
<v 1>singing along to the lyrics.</v>

116
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.250
You cannot sing with somebody day in and day out and not have something

117
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.610
happened.

118
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.610
<v 2>We wound up as a spring came, you know, it's getting nice out. So now it's like,</v>

119
00:06:56.611 --> 00:06:58.680
well, let's not go home. Let's go out for a beer after work.

120
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.910
We're becoming good friends. We liked each other. For Kevin,

121
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.710
<v 1>it was a little more serious than that.</v>

122
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.360
I'm thinking about her and I'm starting to wake up at night and one day in May

123
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.510
as Jenna is dropping him off, Kevin turns to her and he says, Hey,

124
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:12.860
I really appreciate what you've done for me.

125
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:16.970
Let me take you to dinner just as friends, just as friends. Jen says. Sure.

126
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.100
So May 30th, 1992 Hailo and pavilion. Nicest restaurant. Yeah.

127
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.820
<v 2>So your friends takes you to a four star restaurant.</v>

128
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.090
You're thinking right away he thinks this is a date. We're going on a date.

129
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.480
Come on. So now on panic stricken, we have our dinner, we leave.

130
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:32.650
We had a wonderful time.

131
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:37.020
<v 1>She drops me off and I handed her the poem. What did the poem say?</v>

132
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.790
You still have it? Yeah, I do. Okay. This is a little slower. Okay.

133
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.220
Each time we sing on the way home,

134
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.520
I pray that traffic backs up so we can sing together just a little longer and

135
00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:54.741
the harmony can go on forever and each time we reach my door I feel robbed

136
00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.210
because we're always in mid song or mid thought. If only I could.

137
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.330
He gets out and goes inside and pry thinks, ask him. I gave her that poem.

138
00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:07.530
She's going to be so smitten with me and you go home and what

139
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.060
<v 2>want to throw up. I just thought, Oh God, you know,</v>

140
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.660
next day I just looked at him and said, listen, we got to clarify.

141
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.080
This is clearly just going to be a friendship. He was seven years older than me.

142
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:22.580
He had these brain, uh, you know, surgery. He has epilepsy,

143
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.300
he's divorced. He has two children now.

144
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:31.130
You're catching the compassion here. Try. I'm trying. And he's just like,

145
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.770
I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm asking you to go out on a few days.

146
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.560
<v 1>Exactly. If you go out with me like four times in the next six months,</v>

147
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.900
I'm ahead of the game. He just handled it

148
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.420
<v 2>and I don't think it was long at all. I can't even remember.</v>

149
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:44.150
But it wasn't long at all before we were like a couple

150
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.363
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

151
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.110
<v 2>hey Kevin. Um, I'm dopey. Dopey in love. Oh yeah, yeah.</v>

152
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.670
Doing romantic things for her all the time. Flowers, poems and paintings.

153
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.870
<v 1>Illustration of the Jackson Brown cover. And within a year we were engaged.</v>

154
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.340
But all the while Kevin is having seizures. Yeah.

155
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.240
Since the car accident more and more there was a point where we were obviously

156
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.450
dating. She's helping to make his bed and um,

157
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.400
he said she pulled off the pillow case covered with blood and one, two, three,

158
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:21.181
four, five,

159
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:25.680
six of you can count the number of seizures that I had in between my tongue and

160
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:26.170
bled.

161
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.120
<v 2>I knew nothing about epilepsy.</v>

162
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.940
I had never seen anybody have a seizure in my past.

163
00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:33.250
Those would have been big red flags that I would have just walked away.

164
00:09:33.251 --> 00:09:34.810
But I just went with it

165
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.220
<v 1>and they both went with it for a few years until finally Kevin and Jan decide</v>

166
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.930
this is enough. I wanted to be done with it. I just needed to be done with it.

167
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.610
So the schedule of brain surgery,

168
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.833
<v 7>uh,</v>

169
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.150
<v 1>which sounds like a big deal and obviously it is,</v>

170
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.720
but they had every reason to think that this wouldn't change it.

171
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.520
<v 2>I honestly thought that he was going to come out of it fine. Better</v>

172
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.150
<v 1>cause that's what happened the first time.</v>

173
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.590
Kevin had actually gone through brain surgery much like this one once before and

174
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:08.310
he'd come out pretty much the same guy. He was still himself. In fact,

175
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.230
he made sure of it. I had a, I was awake for the surgery and that's crazy. Yeah,

176
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.840
it was. I had to be awake, had to do with music.

177
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:21.190
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

178
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.900
<v 1>Kevin is a musician and the doctors told him, they said that if I lost anything,</v>

179
00:10:25.901 --> 00:10:27.970
I was going to lose my appreciation for music,

180
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.180
that it would be like music would be white noise. I said, you know,

181
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.910
no. For me music was no is part of my personality.

182
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.570
It was how I coped with my darkest moments in dealing with epilepsy and

183
00:10:43.061 --> 00:10:46.600
seizures. At 18 years old, I'd have a seizure.

184
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.010
I take my harmonica and I'd find a place with decent reverb somewhere and be

185
00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:54.070
right where I needed to be. I didn't want to lose that part of me.

186
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.820
So as the doctors were doing the brain surgery, they had his head open.

187
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.170
They asked him to say, you remember what you're saying? Um, into the innocence.

188
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:07.060
Some James Taylor and while he's saying they would tickle different parts of his

189
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:11.560
brain and if they ever touched the part that made him stop singing, they'd say,

190
00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:15.520
okay, that's a part we can not take out. Wow. Yeah. And in the end,

191
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.180
I think they ended up taking out like four and a half centimeters, like a gall,

192
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:21.340
you know, a little bit bigger than a golf ball. Well,

193
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.530
but afterwards as he was recovering, I had my keyboard in the room, you know,

194
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.260
and I tried playing right away, Dah Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah Dah.

195
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.610
<v 7>Okay.</v>

196
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.000
<v 1>And it works. The part of him that he really cared about was still there.</v>

197
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.850
Exactly. Yeah. It was it man. I fell in love with after the first surgery.

198
00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:40.570
So I thought, well, you know, now that you've got to do a second surgery,

199
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.010
he's already been there on this road, we're fine. And after that second surgery,

200
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.760
he did Tim fine. Janet didn't have her brother sneak my,

201
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.890
my keyboard up to the room again. He was very, very adamant that he wanted that.

202
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.100
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

203
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.730
<v 1>just noodled a couple of notes played a couple of things. And it was like, okay,</v>

204
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:01.990
I'm there. It's still me.

205
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.080
I was ready to go to you go home and like it seems to have worked.

206
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.810
<v 2>Yeah. As far as seizures go, we thought, okay, this is it. We're home free.</v>

207
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:13.390
And uh, I was just happy to have some normalcy.

208
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.960
<v 1>But then in the winter, by beginning in the middle of January,</v>

209
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.490
Kevin noticed he wanted to eat my physical appetite a lot more than usual.

210
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.840
Got like insane.

211
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.400
<v 2>This is a guy who didn't eat breakfast.</v>

212
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.340
He had minimal lunch and he'd have an sensible dinner, maybe a snack.

213
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:30.460
That was it. But now I can eat the couch. It just was odd.

214
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:33.100
It was not him normally, but you know, you're like, okay.

215
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.550
She thought maybe it's just a side effect from the medications.

216
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.330
But then the piano

217
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.060
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

218
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.150
<v 2>I play the piano for hours. Same songs they used to sing in the car together.</v>

219
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.110
He has stuck on a piece. He would play for hours. How many hours?

220
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.450
Eight. Eight, nine. And then there was sex, you know,

221
00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:55.530
we were happy, healthy couple. Kevin's nodding. Yeah. Yeah, it was fine.

222
00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.360
But what was abnormal? Was, it was, it was anywhere. Clearly. It wasn't like,

223
00:13:00.361 --> 00:13:03.270
oh, we're in the supermarket, let's have sex here. I mean, it wasn't like that,

224
00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:06.840
but I mean it was like I could just walk in the kitchen from being out of work

225
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:10.290
and he'd be like, Oh, you, let's go here. Which struck her as weird.

226
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.800
But then again, we were thinking, you know, let's try to have a family.

227
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.400
So the timing made things confusing and more than that,

228
00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:21.480
it wasn't like any of this stuff was out of character. Exactly. In fact,

229
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.050
it was all stuff that she liked about him. Yeah.

230
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.880
Except now it was all turned up to 11.

231
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.150
All the things that were wonderful became chores

232
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.550
<v 1>and that's pretty much where things are at.</v>

233
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.830
When those federal agents showed up in July of 2006,

234
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.080
<v 2>just completely blindsided.</v>

235
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.770
<v 1>You said, you know why we're here. I said, yeah, I do.</v>

236
00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:44.530
I was expecting yet Kevin took the agents upstairs.

237
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.490
I took them right into here where my computer was and they arrested him for what

238
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:52.580
was on that computer. I gave it up to him right away. Warning. Uh,

239
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:56.800
this next passage contained some graphic imagery. I mean I had hadn't,

240
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:02.430
I don't know if I had fully like I think I had just like let child porn be this

241
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:08.101
kind of vague thing that meant someone younger than 18,

242
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:15.270
but then I read some of the court documents and they were like toddlers.

243
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.380
They were picked videos of two, three and four year olds. There, there,

244
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.250
these sites had the most despicable,

245
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.870
disgusting things you can, you can imagine infants on throw,

246
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.820
um, you know, pre preteen and you know, preadolescence you know,

247
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.330
in a an adolescence it bought and you bought these things and put them on your

248
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:40.000
computer. I, yeah,

249
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.370
yeah. It, it, it bothers me. It bothers me.

250
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.260
Like I said, initially it was, you know, it was just your base, your basic,

251
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.160
you know, a Hetero Heteros, heterosexual playboy, like penthouse,

252
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:56.600
like sites.

253
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.930
And then windows would just start to open up and pretty soon he says he was

254
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:05.300
going everywhere there was gay sex. They were, I mean there was,

255
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.500
there was bondage, there was a defecation sex,

256
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.680
there was animal sex, xeno sex.

257
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.180
I went everywhere that a button came up to push.

258
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.270
I still don't understand it. I still, I still don't understand it.

259
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.150
He said it disturbed you and you feel terrible. I just like wonder, like,

260
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:29.870
how do you detail yourself? Like, that wasn't me.

261
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:34.780
Like how do you explain it to yourself to so that you can kind of, I dunno,

262
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:39.820
not feeling like you're as bad as the person who goes there

263
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.740
without a brain injury is, you know, like,

264
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:52.610
oh, I know. I say that again.

265
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.440
Ask that. I guess I'm just wondering, I don't know.

266
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:57.320
Like knowing that that's a thing that you did and it sounds like obviously you

267
00:15:57.321 --> 00:16:00.470
know, that that was bad. It was a wrong thing and it's like a terrible thing.

268
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.660
Um, but it was, it was you who did it? Or was it not?

269
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.040
I don't know. You know what I mean? No, it, it was, it was me who did it,

270
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:13.820
but it was me with a complete lack

271
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:15.743
<v 3>of neurological,</v>

272
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.710
<v 1>cool control, you know? I mean, I, I,</v>

273
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.340
I know, I know who I am.

274
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.660
I did idiotic things that I couldn't stop myself from doing.

275
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.230
I didn't want to do it. There would be nights where it would be four or five,

276
00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:37.231
six hours of going to the same site and and and downloading one or two files and

277
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:42.430
then deleting them, going back a minute later, downloading the same files,

278
00:16:42.431 --> 00:16:43.264
deleting them.

279
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.650
I would download those files a dozen times and delete them a dozen times cause I

280
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:51.160
didn't want to be there and knew I shouldn't be there and couldn't help myself

281
00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:54.910
from going back. I'm not an idiot. I mean I'm, I'm,

282
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.490
I'm a smart guy. I'm not an idiot,

283
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.250
but I know I had no control

284
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.520
<v 5>and that's when he would argue in court, can we plead guilty?</v>

285
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:07.430
But at the sentencing hearing he asked the judge to be lenient,

286
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.630
arguing essentially that the person who did all those things in some sense

287
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.643
wasn't him.

288
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.660
It was some other part of his brain that he couldn't control that the hearing,

289
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:19.910
he called one witness Devinsky.

290
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.540
I'm a neurologist and epilepsy specialist at NYU Medical Center.

291
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.570
He's been treating Kevin for decades, 2020 some odd years.

292
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.780
And he says as soon as he found out what Kevin had been doing had a terrible

293
00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:33.560
sense of of responsibility. This is because of the brain surgery,

294
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.180
the surgery Orin recommended he have any argued in court that this was not

295
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:39.000
Kevin's fault.

296
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.670
I remember looking at those agents right in their face and saying to them and to

297
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:47.610
the judge, this could be anybody. This could be those agents, judge,

298
00:17:47.611 --> 00:17:49.320
this could be you, this could be me,

299
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:54.321
this could be anybody and we would have no control over what we did and explain

300
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:56.460
to the court what the biology was

301
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.900
[inaudible] that the way the brain is organized,

302
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.660
that there are parts of our brain that are way deep down that control like base

303
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:10.060
desires like hunger. Sex keeps US alive,

304
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.400
but it's teaming with the nastiest thoughts.

305
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.190
We all have these crazy thoughts in our head now and most of us,

306
00:18:15.191 --> 00:18:18.340
those thoughts are kept in check because there are other parts of our brain that

307
00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:22.630
sit on top and act like a lid. But in Kevin's case,

308
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.140
the brain surgeon who did that surgery removed part of that filter and suddenly

309
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.530
the cork was off.

310
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.860
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

311
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.910
<v 5>I mean it was just no lid on his sexual desires.</v>

312
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.250
He said, scientists have known about this condition for a long time.

313
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.850
They first saw in monkeys in rhesus monkeys when the monkeys would lose roughly

314
00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:45.650
the same part of the brain that Kevin lost.

315
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.850
They became very hypersexual males that would only previously be sexually

316
00:18:49.851 --> 00:18:51.050
involved with females.

317
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.980
Now we're 10 times more sexually active with both males and females.

318
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.100
That it feels to me, feels to me like there's a,

319
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.500
there would be a brighter line before kids, you know,

320
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.810
I think there is a line for quote unquote normal individuals,

321
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.790
but in a brain disorder case,

322
00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:14.960
those lines get blurred and he told the court that's what happened here.

323
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.130
It was black and white. Kevin was sick and his behavior was out of his control.

324
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.080
Well, that's not what the facts showed in this case.

325
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.310
This is Lee Barton who was the prosecutor. We saw no evidence of impulsivity.

326
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.500
He says, if you're claiming that he had no control,

327
00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:31.760
that his brain made him do it,

328
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.700
then how come he had all this child porn on his home computer?

329
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.080
I believe it was 52 videos and 125 images,

330
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.140
and yet on his work computer there were zero images,

331
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:47.030
zero videos of child pornography on his work computer, and he worked a lot.

332
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.000
He held down a job. He was working every day.

333
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.640
If he truly lacked impulse control,

334
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.570
I would think you would see child pornography on both computers.

335
00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:01.580
And so what he argued back was what was the lid on at work and off at home?

336
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.200
Seems to me to be an easy out.

337
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.010
So the answer is that this is common with neurologic disease.

338
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.660
They tend not to be 24 seven he says, take something like Tourette's.

339
00:20:11.661 --> 00:20:14.210
Some people, when they're engaged in playing sports,

340
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.860
they tend not to have ticks,

341
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.840
whereas when they're sitting around bored or stressed,

342
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.090
they do tend to have text. So you could say, well,

343
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.220
Tourette's clearly isn't a neurological disorder,

344
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.320
but note Tourette's is a neurologic disorder.

345
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.350
We understand some of the brain things that go on Tourette's.

346
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.260
The prosecution didn't buy it. They just thought it was hogwash.

347
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.440
What was hogwash was his level of certainty,

348
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.810
depressed skis and asked the Kevin be sent to prison for five years,

349
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.820
gives him paying for child porn.

350
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.970
He was supporting an industry that does terrible things to kids.

351
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.410
Kevin hoped he'd avoid jail time all together and instead be placed on house

352
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:51.244
arrest.

353
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.380
<v 2>This is a big Virginia. Um, right after the arrest,</v>

354
00:20:55.381 --> 00:20:58.800
I have to imagine that you were in shock a little bit like, yeah,

355
00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.660
you'd gone to see a lawyer and

356
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.750
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

357
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.780
<v 2>one of the questions he asked was, is this marriage going to survive this?</v>

358
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.910
And I said, I don't know.

359
00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.310
And at that point understand I didn't even know the level of pictures. Yeah,

360
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.020
but she says the moment she heard orange say that this was a brain disorder with

361
00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:22.710
a name called Kluver BST syndrome. Once I was able to get that from me,

362
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.980
it clicked like you couldn't blame it.

363
00:21:25.981 --> 00:21:30.030
We have these experts saying that it was a disease and I kept thinking they'll

364
00:21:30.031 --> 00:21:30.840
understand.

365
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.050
Not to mention that after Kevin was arrested and got an on bail or and gave him

366
00:21:34.051 --> 00:21:37.590
some medication and Janet says it was like flipping a switch.

367
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.610
That's exactly what it was. It was like guy got him back. I was able,

368
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.660
I was able to sit and watch a movie with her, you know, normal.

369
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.180
Janet actually says in a lot of ways,

370
00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:51.150
those few months between the arrest and the sentencing hearing,

371
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.410
they'd been the best months in the marriage. He now was just so much easier,

372
00:21:55.411 --> 00:21:58.380
calmer. Uh, you could you just talk,

373
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.740
the hearing took about three hours and when it was over,

374
00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:05.850
the judge took a recess, went into her chambers. When she came back,

375
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.680
she delivered your decision and we'll hear that decision when we come back after

376
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:11.514
a quick break.

Hey, I'm Jad Abu Rod, this is radio lab.

390
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.100
We're revisiting Pat Walter story about Kevin. And when we left,

391
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.310
the judge was just about to render her decision.

392
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.290
<v 5>She actually wouldn't talk to me for the story,</v>

393
00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:22.680
but I have the transcript from the hearing and um,

394
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.300
if you remember the prosecutor of the bar 10 was asking for five years,

395
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.840
63 months or in Kevin, Janet, we're hoping for house arrest,

396
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.300
meaning no jail time. There's no way they're going to put him in jail.

397
00:23:32.301 --> 00:23:35.180
This is clear cut. And here's what the judge does. She says,

398
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.360
I do agree with orange. It is a neurological disorder.

399
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.600
No question do we can't be held fully responsible for his behavior.

400
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.530
She was getting it on the other and she said the prosecution did have a point

401
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.570
that he was very much in control of his impulses, at least some of the time.

402
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.490
And so the question for the judge was,

403
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.050
how does the legal system assign blame when a person is sometimes themselves and

404
00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:01.670
in control and sometimes not? Well, this was a crime.

405
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.390
She said a crime, which ultimately leads to children being harmed.

406
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.930
And considering that you did have moments where you were in control,

407
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.940
then in those moments you had a responsibility, you could have done something,

408
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.320
you could've asked for help.

409
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.840
You could have told the people around you what you were doing.

410
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.770
So even if you couldn't have stopped yourself, they could have stopped you.

411
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.680
<v 1>She made it very clear that we have to do something here. His sentence,</v>

412
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.860
26 months at a federal prison and 25 months of house arrest.

413
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:34.460
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

414
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.150
<v 1>and I, I believe, I believe that she, she was, she was fair</v>

415
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.440
and I, I believe she was compassionate.

416
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.420
<v 5>And about a week before Christmas in 2008 Janet drove him to prison.</v>

417
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.060
<v 1>How long was he in jail? For? About two years. And she was,</v>

418
00:24:51.061 --> 00:24:53.820
even though the judge said, you know, he is responsible.

419
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.090
Does that change her attitude toward him at all? No,

420
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.650
they totally stuck together. She visited him pretty much every weekend.

421
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:02.760
The whole time

422
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.370
<v 2>I knew the route and I had my own little routine down in between visits.</v>

423
00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.020
She'd send up notes and I'll never forget,

424
00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:11.200
he could send me mail and they had a store where he could get some cards,

425
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.110
super Hallmarky and he would like alter them.

426
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.970
And I remember the very first card I got, it was this very, you know, beautiful.

427
00:25:18.971 --> 00:25:21.550
Supposedly it's supposed to be beautiful, but it was like, you know,

428
00:25:21.551 --> 00:25:25.210
if you need anything, you know anything at all, just let me know.

429
00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:27.640
And then he writes, of course, if it's pressing,

430
00:25:27.641 --> 00:25:31.510
you might want to ask someone else because Oh well you can wait 24 months.

431
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.380
And I remember getting that and just laughing and then that became our thing.

432
00:25:35.381 --> 00:25:37.930
Like, listen, this is a horrible situation,

433
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.730
but we're going to make the best of it.

434
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.340
Tell me a little bit about like where things are at now. I think things are,

435
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.720
are, are almost normal.

436
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.800
<v 1>Uh, you know, I, I am still an on probation. Yeah.</v>

437
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.760
<v 2>But he's home. Um, he's working, life is going on.</v>

438
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:59.030
We have our normal routines. Kevin's still takes those medicines that

439
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.620
<v 1>keep the other part of him in check. I have no libido at all,</v>

440
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.860
<v 3>but I know who I am. I know what I am.</v>

441
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.043
Um,

442
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.340
<v 1>um, I'm disturbed by that portion of my life, but, um, uh, I'm trying,</v>

443
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.360
I'm trying to move on.

444
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:24.620
<v 3>Okay. Aw.</v>

445
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.823
<v 6>Pretty Pat Walters.</v>

446
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.770
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

447
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.140
<v 6>so I know nothing about what your reaction to that will be.</v>

448
00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:39.610
It was just by hunch back

449
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.820
<v 2>to a neuroscientist, author, Rebecca [inaudible]</v>

450
00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.620
<v 6>simple scheme that it's of,</v>

451
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.810
<v 0>it plays near a lot of your buttons. Sure does. Yeah.</v>

452
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.830
And No, while we'd always felt like the, at the end of the story,

453
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.730
the sentence that Kevin gets from the judge was this kind of interesting and

454
00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.850
nuance balance between, you know, the idea that he had,

455
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.390
he just had a brain disease and the idea that there's some still some sort of

456
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:04.770
personal responsibility involved,

457
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.250
we'll right out of the gates and Polsky had a different reaction home appalled

458
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:13.460
that judicial decision and the underlying world view really.

459
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.640
Yeah, completely.

460
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.560
And for him it all centered around that sort of key argument that swayed the

461
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:20.394
judge.

462
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.930
<v 9>That's some of the time he can control these urges and some of the time he</v>

463
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:26.270
can't. The,

464
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.180
the example there was that never once at work did he do anything like that and

465
00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.014
yet he obsessed,

466
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.520
we spent hours each night at home and the fact that he could control it in other

467
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:36.510
circumstances,

468
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:41.400
does that mean there is a separate knee inside there that's able to get to the

469
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:46.401
control panel some of the time but not others and thus that's

470
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.050
<v 0>punishable? Yeah,</v>

471
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:53.190
it's like he's in a kind of pitched battle with some inner urge that he has.

472
00:27:56.271 --> 00:27:57.900
Maybe it's a biological urge, uh,

473
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.240
but sometimes he wins maybe in the morning when he's had some cup of coffee and

474
00:28:02.241 --> 00:28:05.300
he's like nicely sugared up. But then at night, we all know this,

475
00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:09.260
when we get tonight, we're tired, our brains are tired and we,

476
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.140
the aid comes out a tiny little bit.

477
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.120
<v 9>Well, let's,</v>

478
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.170
let's translate what you just said into sort of nuts and bolts biology.

479
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.880
Your frontal Cortex,

480
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.040
which is making you do the harder things when it's the right thing to do is one

481
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:25.350
of the most expensive parts of the brain to operate.

482
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:30.120
And when you're starting to get hungry or you're starting to get tired,

483
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.770
your frontal cortex doesn't work as well. And that's simply why,

484
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.390
uh, we have less regulation of our behavior in at night than in the morning.

485
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.810
And the perfect neurological example where nobody would invoke freewill in this

486
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:47.760
one is you look at somebody with Alzheimer's disease.

487
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:51.030
If they have early stage Alzheimer's disease, they show a Sundre,

488
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.030
a sundowner syndrome, which is in the morning.

489
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.830
They can tell you what their name is and by night they can't tell you in the

490
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.150
next morning, they can tell you again, whoa, are we seeing here?

491
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.310
Sort of a choice. Okay,

492
00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:08.760
so they know their name and if they're not telling you at night,

493
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.160
they know their name, they can tell you their name in the morning.

494
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:12.840
And if they're not telling it to you at night,

495
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.980
they're choosing not to know what happens at night.

496
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:20.850
His blood sugar levels drop and the brain is tired and the frontal Cortex,

497
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:22.740
which has to do the like,

498
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:25.200
what was my name again with three and a half remaining,

499
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:27.120
neurons can't do it as well.

500
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.470
Nobody looks at that and says there's volition. Ooh,

501
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.800
they can do it part of the day. They should be expected to be able to do it.

502
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.920
<v 0>But that's the address that that's because it's a different issue. I mean,</v>

503
00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:41.470
this is what you're talking about. Memory. Okay, so let me, let me,

504
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.460
<v 9>let me,</v>

505
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.990
let me go through a sequence here that I obviously prepared for the occasion.

506
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.043
<v 10>Okay.</v>

507
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.530
<v 9>In the, in the Kevin Segment, they made mention of the syndrome that he has,</v>

508
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:55.990
which is called the Kluver Bussi Syndrome. Right.

509
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.400
And this was first shown in the 1940 [inaudible].

510
00:29:58.401 --> 00:30:03.220
You go into monkeys and you take out the same part of the frontal cortex as they

511
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:07.360
did with Kevin, and you get monkeys that eat themselves into obesity.

512
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:08.620
Now they can't stop eating.

513
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:14.080
They're hypersexual males trying to mount everyone and everything on earth.

514
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.570
Okay. Right off the bat we see some broad similarities. Aha.

515
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.620
You will say though, but Kevin has a moral system.

516
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:27.580
Kevin has Meta control. Kevin, as we saw,

517
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.700
could control it in some circumstances, but not in others.

518
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.320
We've left the world of blameless monkeys, far behind. Yes, yes, yes and yes,

519
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.260
goodbye. But hello blames. We have not,

520
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.640
you've got a monkey there who's got frontal damage and now is hypersexual.

521
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.920
He's attempting to Mt. Infants.

522
00:30:44.921 --> 00:30:49.660
He's attempting to mount water bottles in this cage completely out of control,

523
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.010
but nonetheless, he doesn't try to mount the Alpha male. Huh?

524
00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.270
Interesting.

525
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:59.830
Obviously what we have here is a monkey who has free will because in some

526
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:04.750
circumstances he could not do this bad inappropriate thing because he's got

527
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:08.170
freewill some there. No, that's ridiculous. Okay. Let's,

528
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.850
<v 0>so both he explained to us today, it's not that he could control his behavior.</v>

529
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.780
Some of the time it's that in this instance he was under the influence of

530
00:31:15.781 --> 00:31:18.390
something else that he couldn't control.

531
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.350
<v 9>Fear,</v>

532
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.620
fear of the Alpha male activation of fear circuits override the feeble attempts

533
00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:29.340
to lose four and a half remaining frontal neurons to state regulation in one

534
00:31:29.341 --> 00:31:31.320
circumstance, but not in others.

535
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.130
Not because there's freewill or rotten choices or bad values.

536
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.140
This biologically broken system manifests its brokenness under some

537
00:31:40.141 --> 00:31:41.670
circumstances, but not others.

538
00:31:41.671 --> 00:31:46.440
And there's a logical biological explanation for why you get those exceptions.

539
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.190
<v 10>Okay. Right.</v>

540
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.850
<v 0>You're talking about monkeys and one situation we're not yet. Yeah.</v>

541
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.360
<v 9>So let's take it closer to home now. Okay.</v>

542
00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.660
So you sit down somebody with damage to the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and

543
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:03.250
you put the frontal damage damaged patient.

544
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:08.251
Now in a circumstance where they're in a situation where there's a smarter,

545
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:13.780
more disciplined, better pay off thing to do and they can do it just fine,

546
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.640
but then you get them emotionally aroused over something or you get them tired.

547
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.590
They're horrible, terrible compared to regular folks. In other words,

548
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.390
we've just progressed from, okay, the monkey, if it scared of the Alpha male.

549
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.070
Okay, fear can override the neurons that it has remaining in there and they're

550
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:36.130
swamped. Now we've seen in a human, more in general,

551
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.530
strong emotions can override. So,

552
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:44.531
so far what you've told me though is sometimes I have the resources to choose

553
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:47.360
and sometimes I don't, but it's about the resources,

554
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.210
but the choice doesn't not exist.

555
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.310
It's just sometimes I have choose in their next step, next step, closer in.

556
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.100
So for my money, one of the periods for this,

557
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:04.070
how many rounds are we going to do here? I even have a clipboard here.

558
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:08.460
I've got it sitting in front of me. That's how much I prepared for this. Um,

559
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.880
okay, here's an example.

560
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.120
You take a judge and like this classic important study and you look at the

561
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:22.430
single biggest predictor of whether or not this parole board judge,

562
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:24.530
and this was of a whole panel of judges,

563
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.470
whether they will vote for somebody being paroled or not.

564
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.760
The single best predictor was how many hours it had been since the judge has

565
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.180
eaten what you mean that a Hungary judge will not give parole to someone but a

566
00:33:38.571 --> 00:33:43.340
full and happy tummy in the judge will make the judge more gentle.

567
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.970
You look at this study and right after a meal a convicts had about a 90% chance

568
00:33:49.341 --> 00:33:53.480
of being paroled and right before a meal they were down to about a 10% chance

569
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.310
that and it was a virtually straight line going.

570
00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.260
Debts messed up and you know the single biggest Purdue actually looked the study

571
00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:04.250
up and it turns out if the judge was making the decision right after lunch when

572
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:09.130
they were full, the parolees had about a 60% chance of getting pearls.

573
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.460
Okay. Not as bad as he said,

574
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:15.490
but if the judges were making the decision right before the next meal,

575
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:17.390
like when they were hungry,

576
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:22.190
the parolees had close to a 0% chance of getting parole.

577
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.100
What's interesting about that, number one,

578
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:29.570
the biology makes perfect sense. What are you doing there?

579
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:33.380
When you are a judge trying to judge somebody from a completely different world,

580
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:36.800
from you to reach your point of deciding there's mitigating fac,

581
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:39.200
you're trying to take their perspective.

582
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:44.201
You're trying to think about the indirect ways that you're using your frontal

583
00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:49.040
cortex and when you're hungry and your frontal cortex is and is working as well,

584
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:53.180
it's easier to make a snap emotional judgment. This person's rotten.

585
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.680
The second amazing thing,

586
00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:59.681
which exactly addresses this issue is you get that judge two seconds after they

587
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:03.650
made that decision. You sit them down at that point and say, hey,

588
00:35:03.651 --> 00:35:07.430
so why did you make that decision? And they're going to quote on a no.

589
00:35:07.431 --> 00:35:09.830
A manual contract. Alan Dershowitz at you,

590
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.620
they're going to post hoc,

591
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.920
come up with an explanation that has all the pseudo trappings of freewill and

592
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:22.160
volition and in reality it's just rationalization.

593
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.460
It's totally biological. No, no. That's what we're getting at.

594
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.860
You lose me on the word. Totally. Okay,

595
00:35:27.861 --> 00:35:32.750
so it's met muchly biological, mostly biological. I might.

596
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.070
I might meet you halfway there, but totally no. Why does it have to be entirely?

597
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.280
Why do we have to go like

598
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.173
<v 0>all the way?</v>

599
00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.850
<v 9>Because if you're not going to go all the way,</v>

600
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.520
here's the things that you're asserting.

601
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.590
<v 0>I'm just going to jump in here because this part of the conversation got a</v>

602
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:52.890
little dance and a long but suppose skis.

603
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:57.720
Basic point was that you just have to look at the sort of arc of scientific

604
00:35:57.721 --> 00:35:58.554
discoveries.

605
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.700
<v 9>500 years ago we would've said the epileptic seizure was like bad demonic</v>

606
00:36:04.341 --> 00:36:06.000
possession. Then Anna,

607
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:11.020
we learned that's biological up to the mid 1950s if your like adolescent child

608
00:36:12.441 --> 00:36:15.920
suddenly started having hallucinations and hearing voices mean thought

609
00:36:15.921 --> 00:36:19.580
disordered and you would say you the mother of this child would say,

610
00:36:19.581 --> 00:36:21.380
where did this disease come from?

611
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.040
And the best of science at the time had an answer. They would say you,

612
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.120
it's your fault.

613
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:30.050
It was called schizophrenia genic mothering a mothering style that generated

614
00:36:30.051 --> 00:36:30.884
schizophrenia.

615
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.210
You caused your child schizophrenia and then in the mid fifties the first

616
00:36:35.211 --> 00:36:39.800
anti-psychotic drugs were developed and it emptied out the psychiatric wards all

617
00:36:39.801 --> 00:36:43.790
over the country and everybody in the field said, oh my God,

618
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.100
it's a biochemical disorder,

619
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.100
<v 0>and he says, the same thing happened with dyslexia.</v>

620
00:36:48.101 --> 00:36:50.620
We used to think it was just kids who are lazy. Oh,

621
00:36:50.621 --> 00:36:54.580
that's biological also and his contention is that this is just going to keep

622
00:36:54.581 --> 00:36:57.160
happening like as science progresses one by one.

623
00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:01.510
All of the things that we think are under our control that we should control and

624
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:04.210
that if we don't, we can be blamed for one by one.

625
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.110
All of those things are going to get chocked up to screw ups in our biology

626
00:37:08.111 --> 00:37:11.590
screw ups that we couldn't have controlled. Even if we'd wanted to.

627
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:17.020
<v 9>You're going to have to do at that point is either say starting tonight at</v>

628
00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:21.460
midnight, there will never be a new scientific finding pertinent to this area.

629
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.680
We've learned everything there is or you're going to say freewill is just the

630
00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:28.450
biology that we haven't learned yet.

631
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.303
<v 11>Okay.</v>

632
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.140
<v 0>W when do you in your heart,</v>

633
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.830
in your in and the EAP in the center of your like in that,

634
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.490
do you really believe this? Do you have

635
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:51.420
<v 9>not for first, second, not for a second and that's the whole thing.</v>

636
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.730
This is like my like huge conundrum.

637
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.720
I have like zero belief in freewill at this point.

638
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:02.930
Yet at the same time I cannot for a second imagine what the world is supposed to

639
00:38:03.691 --> 00:38:06.390
look like with people believing there is no free will.

640
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.410
I don't know how to imagine it and I'm constantly this hypocrite.

641
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:15.650
I'm this terrible hypocrite because like I'll put on like my blue tee shirt

642
00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:19.830
instead of my gray tee shirt and one morning and later in the day someone will

643
00:38:19.831 --> 00:38:21.060
say, oh Whoa,

644
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:26.310
nice tee shirt and I'll say thanks. Oh my God,

645
00:38:26.311 --> 00:38:27.990
the hip hop ocracy of it.

646
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:33.830
Here I am taking credit for it and that circumstance I'm not able to stop and

647
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:34.201
say,

648
00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:39.201
well actually I have photo receptors that you know because of this gene variant

649
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:44.320
in that gene variant in my Rhodopsin genes so that I'm particularly good at

650
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:45.310
noticing colors,

651
00:38:45.311 --> 00:38:49.770
sort of combinations and thus I can get the matching and I know,

652
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.900
oh I pick the fresh fruit here because my olfactory receptors allow me to like

653
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:59.530
be able to smell the pineapples that are fresh and the luck of my socioeconomic

654
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:02.440
status has me in life. Some like organic market.

655
00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:06.490
And it gives me that like ability to do that while listening to like fake

656
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.100
Peruvian Muzak playing in the background. And No, you say when they say, Oh wow,

657
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:14.350
you really know how to pick good pineapples.

658
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.400
And I say thanks when it happens.

659
00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.190
Oh this is like totally hypocritical.

660
00:39:21.191 --> 00:39:23.650
A little bit of shade on the intellectual side.

661
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.000
I mean if you believe that every behavior, not just of Kevin's,

662
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.720
because what you're really saying is that the deep lesson of the Kevin Story is

663
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:35.350
that everyone is a Kevin. All of us are Kevin's all the time.

664
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:40.400
And that anything our worst and our best behaviors, yes.

665
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:45.550
That everything we choose to do is in some sense chosen for us that if you knew

666
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.480
enough stuff about anyone,

667
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.660
you know what they're about to do next. Yeah, yeah.

668
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:02.620
No, no, but I readily admit my flag and say, no,

669
00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:04.780
I did not get on board with this.

670
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:09.640
This at least we've done it in a few realms. What do we are able to do it?

671
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.320
When you look, I'm, I don't want you to be a futurist here, but

672
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.810
<v 0>when you look 500 years ahead,</v>

673
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.740
let's say that the things keep progressing in the way that you imagined where we

674
00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:21.730
just keep etching,

675
00:40:21.731 --> 00:40:25.150
like sort of chipping away at this idea of volition and will free will.

676
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.360
What do we do in that point?

677
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:33.310
Do we not hold anyone accountable for anything but we simply prescribe

678
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.230
treatments in, I mean what, what, what does that world look like to you?

679
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.340
<v 9>The treatments and or constraints you fix,</v>

680
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:46.560
the things you fix and the ones that can't be fixed. You constrain things.

681
00:40:46.561 --> 00:40:50.730
Who the damage can't be done, but it's done in a,

682
00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.753
in a way,

683
00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:58.770
a car with broken brakes is incredibly dangerous and can't be on the streets.

684
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.940
And if he can't fix the breaks, you put the car in a garage and

685
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.390
you know you've intervened,

686
00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.650
but you don't invoke a concept of punishment of the car in there.

687
00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.230
And if at that point you say, oh my God,

688
00:41:13.231 --> 00:41:15.690
that's so dehumanizing to be that mechanistic,

689
00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:21.120
that's a hell of a lot better than sermonizing people into having freewill over

690
00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:24.570
stuff that they have no control over. And we've done it.

691
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:29.460
People with treatment resistant epilepsy, they're not allowed to drive,

692
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:34.820
but you don't sit there and say they deserve not to be able to drive.

693
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.030
You don't get like mobs of Gordy Russ,

694
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:42.110
Yahoo peasants cheering as the driver's licenses are burned.

695
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:46.630
No, it's not their fault that they have this thing called a seizure.

696
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.530
Nonetheless, if it's uncontrollable, they shouldn't be driving cars.

697
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:55.690
And we have a therapeutic intervention here that's completely outside the realm

698
00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:00.670
of blame. Justice deserved, anything like that.

699
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:04.570
But let's go back to Kev at the end of the story.

700
00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:10.150
Pat Asks Kevin what, what, what since he makes of his punishment,

701
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:15.280
I assume a that you wouldn't have punished him. Is that right?

702
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.070
You would recommend. Okay. But you notice what Kevin says. Kevin says, well,

703
00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:25.510
I thought that judge was, was a good judge and was fair, fair.

704
00:42:25.511 --> 00:42:30.220
He called her fair. So isn't it troubling to you that this person,

705
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:31.420
uh,

706
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:36.420
somehow was able to somehow feel blame worthy I guess.

707
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.950
But what this justice system is doing is it's sort of saying

708
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:48.240
you were bad. Maybe I was, I feel sorry.

709
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.460
I've got remorse. That's okay.

710
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.500
And now we give you your freedom back. Like there's been a,

711
00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.180
there's been a conversation here, uh, about your morality,

712
00:43:00.181 --> 00:43:03.060
your inner morality, but you do not apparently want to have,

713
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.880
I wondering whether that's a healthy thing,

714
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:10.860
healthy mental, healthy,

715
00:43:10.861 --> 00:43:15.450
healthy or societaly healthy or you feel bad by saying thank you to your,

716
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:20.070
to your boot, to your shirt choice. So there is some human need here.

717
00:43:20.071 --> 00:43:21.770
I don't know whether you might call it biological or not,

718
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.930
but there is something with the justice system is addressing that.

719
00:43:24.931 --> 00:43:29.670
You seem to be, you seem to be taking out of the system and I, yeah,

720
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.770
punishment is pleasurable.

721
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.820
It feels good to do the righteous thing and it feels good to do that in a

722
00:43:37.891 --> 00:43:39.420
punishing, blaming way.

723
00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.840
If you're brought up culturally as most of us are to have this notion of like

724
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:49.850
agency, but I think, I think what Robert might the this Robert a two hour,

725
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:53.250
it might be a, I think Robert, let me know if you, if you,

726
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:57.420
if correct me if I'm wrong, is that it doesn't just feel good personally.

727
00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.190
It's good for society on some level like d we want to live in a society where

728
00:44:02.191 --> 00:44:05.820
the concept of justice has been tossed out and we're in a mechanistic place.

729
00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.920
Well, how about taking it further?

730
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:13.130
Don't we need to have belief in a moralizing and punishing God because why else

731
00:44:13.531 --> 00:44:15.730
would people be nice to each other? God,

732
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.850
I don't need to take it all the way there, but we have laws.

733
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:24.690
Laws are sort of in their way, godlike and that they rule over us,

734
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.260
so why not to send your rights instead of God? You're right. They work better.

735
00:44:28.261 --> 00:44:32.910
As soon as you introduced the possibility of into economic games,

736
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:34.590
you evolve cooperation,

737
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:39.330
you do cross cultural studies and the more there's a belief in a punching hell

738
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.870
and the culture, the more generous people are in economic games. Yes,

739
00:44:42.871 --> 00:44:43.950
that stuff works.

740
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:49.010
Yet over and over we've learned at least one domain where we've stepped outside

741
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:51.390
of all of that.

742
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:56.990
The epilepsy example where nobody thinks of it in terms of it being like just

743
00:44:57.571 --> 00:45:02.280
this is being met out when the driver's license being taken away yet 500 years

744
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:02.880
ago,

745
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.050
somebody who would have been just as smart and just as introspective and just as

746
00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:10.290
reflective and maybe even had like a nice bleeding heart,

747
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:15.060
liberal NPR tote bag would have said, it's really, I'm sad about this,

748
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.890
but have you told them to program? Nevermind. Oh my God. I called,

749
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:23.850
we were on Fox and that person nonetheless would've said,

750
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:27.240
this is tragic and I feel so sorry for their family and all of that,

751
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.280
but who told them to go sleep with Satan? Well, wait with live, let me, let me,

752
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:35.340
let me try it this way. Is there anything in the Kevin Pat Walters story,

753
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:40.341
is there any anyone in there who is being harmed or hurt by by what you heard

754
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.040
now? Well, he's paying a price.

755
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:50.920
His wife paid a price shame, imprisonment.

756
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:57.130
[inaudible] a terrible price here for what was simply a biological problem.

757
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:00.390
Hmm.

758
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:05.390
It's still very hard to imagine a world in which you don't get pissed off at

759
00:46:06.431 --> 00:46:10.780
people who do like crummy things and where you don't feel vaguely pleased when

760
00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:14.570
somebody says, Whoa, nice tee shirts. So what you just said is that the, the,

761
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:19.230
the, the feelings that you have about the story,

762
00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:23.430
the loss to her of her husband time,

763
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.280
the shame of being put away for awhile.

764
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:31.340
You think that later on when the deeply biological explanation for this gets

765
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:37.710
fully revealed in a hundred years,

766
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:41.820
say people who will be listened to the story we just heard, I don't think,

767
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.780
if they only knew. Absolutely.

768
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:47.583
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

769
00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:54.620
[inaudible]

770
00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.830
<v 0>big thanks to Robert Spolsky for chatting with us.</v>

771
00:46:57.831 --> 00:47:02.831
His latest book is called behave the biology of humans at our best and worst,

772
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:08.630
which has a, an extended argument about how there is no such thing as free will.

773
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:13.430
Definitely worth reading. It's called behave. Thanks also to Pat Walters for,

774
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:18.860
uh, reporting that story and, uh, for Kevin for allowing us to air it again.

775
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:21.590
And uh, thanks to you guys for listening. I'm Jada Boom,

776
00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:24.110
rod for Robert Krulwich tonight we will see you next time.
