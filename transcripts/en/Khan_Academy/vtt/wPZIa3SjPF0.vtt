00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.600
What is the type of
this quadrilateral?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.950
Be as specific as possible
with the given data.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.680
So it clearly is
a quadrilateral.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.620
We have four sides here.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.370
And we see that we have two
pairs of parallel sides.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.400
Or we could also say there are
two pairs of congruent sides

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.520
here as well.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.480
This side is parallel and
congruent to this side.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.110
This side is parallel and
congruent to that side.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.350
So we're dealing
with a parallelogram.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.250
Let's do more of these.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.200
So here it looks like
a same type of scenario

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.366
we just saw in the last one.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.430
We have two pairs of
parallel and congruent sides,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.330
but all the sides aren't
equal to each other.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.420
If they're all
equal to each other,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.940
we'd be dealing with a rhombus.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.250
But here, they're not
all equal to each other.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.307
This side is congruent
to the side opposite.

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:46.140
This side is congruent
to the side opposite.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.348
That's another parallelogram.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.150
Now this is interesting.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.340
We have two pairs of sides that
are parallel to each other,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.600
but now all the sides
have an equal length.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.640
So this would be
a parallelogram.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.470
And it is a
parallelogram, but they're

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.630
saying to be as specific as
possible with the given data.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.090
So saying it's a
rhombus would be

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.650
more specific than saying
it's a parallelogram.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.080
This does satisfy
the constraints

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.930
for being a parallelogram,
but saying it's a rhombus

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.290
tells us even more.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.490
Not every parallelogram
is a rhombus,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730
but every rhombus
is a parallelogram.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.350
Here, they have the sides are
parallel to the side opposite

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.330
and all of the sides are equal.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.906
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:30.530
What is the type of
this quadrilateral?

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.150
Be as specific as possible
with the given data .

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.340
So we have two pairs of
sides that are parallel,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.920
or I should say one pair.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.650
We have a pair of sides
that are parallel.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.580
And then we have another
pair of sides that are not.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.351
So this is a trapezoid.

00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:49.850
But then they have
two choices here.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.280
They have trapezoid and
isosceles trapezoid.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.010
Now an isosceles
trapezoid is a trapezoid

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.770
where the two non-parallel
sides have the same length, just

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.300
like an isosceles
triangle, you have

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.230
two sides have the same length.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.110
Well we could see these two
non-parallel sides do not

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.400
have the same length.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.637
So this is not an
isosceles trapezoid.

00:02:10.637 --> 00:02:12.220
If they did have the
same length, then

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.761
we would pick that
because that would

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:15.400
be more specific
than just trapezoid.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.070
But this case right over here,
this is just a trapezoid.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.150
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.610
What is the type of
this quadrilateral?

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.537
Well we could say
it's a parallelogram

00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:27.120
because all of the
sides are parallel.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.740
But if we wanted to
be more specific,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.290
you could also see that
all the sides are the same.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.090
So you could say it's
a rhombus, but you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.720
could get even more
specific than that.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.250
You notice that
all the sides are

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.280
intersecting at right angles.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.450
So this is-- if we wanted to be
as specific as possible-- this

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.370
is a square.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.990
Let me check the answer.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.780
Got it right.
