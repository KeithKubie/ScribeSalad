00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
- [Instructor] This is a chart

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.480
that shows the percentage
of the total population

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.240
of each of these colonies,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.270
and then later, states,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.500
that was made up by enslaved Africans.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.370
Starting in the year 1754,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.000
which we'll show in purple,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.450
and comparing that to the year 1800,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.800
which we'll show here in green.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.150
Now some of these numbers are estimates,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.160
since the census didn't exist before 1790,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.760
but this can help us get an overall sense

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.770
of how the institution of slavery

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.310
changed in these years.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.430
Now on the left side here,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.420
we have the data from the Northern part

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.363
of the country.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.520
Now in purple you can see

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.010
the percentage of the population

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.700
of each colony that was enslaved in 1754,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.790
and generally, it wasn't
a very large amount,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.360
think New York here had
the most at about 14%.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.490
By 1800, however, you can see that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.860
the percent went down considerably.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.550
Some, like Massachusetts,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.170
outlawed slavery altogether,
so they're at 0%,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.350
and others like New York or Rhode Island,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.050
began a process of gradual emancipation,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.220
phasing out slavery.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.740
Another thing to note is that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.770
new territories in the West

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.830
that were claimed by the United States

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.020
either had very small amounts of slavery,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.100
like in the Indiana
Territory, or none at all,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.270
like in the Northwest Territory,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.900
where slavery was outlawed.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.470
Now let's compare that to the same period

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.070
in Southern Regions.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.530
In most of the South in 1754,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.640
enslaved people made up

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.430
a very significant
portion of the population.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.250
In some cases, like in South Carolina,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.580
outnumbering whites at
a rate of more than 60%

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.820
of the population.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.930
And unlike in the North,
as you see here in teal,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.100
in 1800, enslaved people remained

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.740
a really quite large percentage

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.040
of the population.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.080
In some cases, the percent of people

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.210
who were enslaved grew considerably,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.360
like in Delaware or in Georgia,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.400
and in other places stayed about the same.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.650
In places like Virginia
and South Carolina,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.040
the percent of the
population that was enslaved

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.130
actually dropped over this time period,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.520
but not because there were fewer slaves,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.380
but rather because the white population

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.480
had grown faster than
the enslaved population

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.930
in the same time period.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.510
And unlike in the Northern Territories,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.730
the percentage of enslaved people

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.810
in the new Southern Territories

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.470
claimed by the United States,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.460
Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.320
was quite significant as well.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.250
So what's happening here?

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.580
Why, over this 50 year period,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.320
did slavery begin to die out in the North,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.300
while surviving, and even expanding West,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.360
in the South?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.950
How much change was there
over this time period

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.160
in the regional attitudes about slavery?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.610
And how would we even go
about figuring that out?

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.690
One way that we can attempt

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.650
to measure the extent of change

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.020
is by identifying the
things that stayed the same

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.750
during this time period,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.803
which we call Continuities,

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.610
or aspects of society that continued on

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.300
being the same as they were before,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.750
and Changes, aspects of society

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.190
that were different than before.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.740
There are many different
aspects of society

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.527
that historians can trace changes

00:03:44.527 --> 00:03:46.660
and continuities in over time,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.940
like changes in politics
or art or gender roles,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.010
but for this video,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.710
I'm gonna choose Economics and Ideas.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.360
Why am I choosing those two?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.430
Well, first and foremost,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.530
because slavery was an economic practice.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.760
It was a source of labor

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.200
that supported the production

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.990
of agricultural products.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.870
Second, I know that in this time period,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.410
the American Revolution

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.470
introduced radical changes

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.030
in ideas about Liberty and Equality,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.730
which stand in stark contrast

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.570
to the institution of slavery.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.840
So let's compare the Economic systems

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.840
and Ideas about slavery
in each of these Regions,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.950
in 1754 and 1800, to see what changed

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.870
and what stayed the same.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.530
So first, let's look at
the Economic systems.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.890
In the North, where the
climate and the soil

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.280
was not suited for large scale

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.790
plantation agriculture,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.480
the economy centered around
family farms in 1754.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.060
Proximity to the coast facilitated fishing

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.290
and shipping,

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.670
and the people who actually did this work

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.870
tended to be either
the owners of the farms

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.650
or the boats, or indentured servants,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.640
and a small number of enslaved laborers

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.850
who worked for them.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.670
None of these activities really required

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.570
the labor of a large
number of enslaved people.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.630
All right, well, what about in 1800?

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.440
Farming and fishing and shipping

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.250
were still going strong,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.840
but as the first Industrial Revolution

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.470
began to take off in the late 1700s,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.470
factories began to spring up in the North,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.720
and the cheapest labor
source for these factories

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.680
was immigrant laborers,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.750
not slaves, not indentured servants.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.620
Now let's look at the Economic systems

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.300
of the South in 1754 and 1800.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.780
In 1754, plantation agriculture

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.700
based on enslaved labor

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.600
was the central economic
system, and it was also

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.360
the central economic system in 1800.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.560
But unlike in the North,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.360
where the technological innovations

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.130
of the Industrial Revolution

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.270
made indentured servants

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.890
or enslaved laborers unnecessary,

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.840
the major technological innovation

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.330
of the cotton gin

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.970
made cotton easier to process,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.040
and therefore, saved it
as a profitable crop,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.400
which made slave owners eager to expand

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.190
the institution of slavery,

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.510
rather than phase it out.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.690
Next, let's take a look at the ideas

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.860
about slavery, which were commonly held

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.260
in each of the regions.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.580
In 1754 in the North,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.260
I would say a few people questioned

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.160
the existence of slavery.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.250
Northern Shipping was involved

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.640
in the Atlantic Slave Trade.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.880
The idea that masters
deserve to rule slaves

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.330
was as natural as the idea

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.880
that kings deserve to rule their subjects.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.370
Even free people of color
were rarely considered

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.530
full British citizens,

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.740
the way people of English descent were.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.620
How did things change in 1800?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.070
The Revolutionary War had a strong effect

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.750
on the ideas about slavery in the North.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.260
Northerners apply the Revolutionary ideals

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.070
of Liberty and Equality

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.430
to long-standing ideas about social rules,

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.311
and they found that slavery

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.670
was incompatible with them.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.880
So after the Revolution, Northern States

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.370
either abolished slavery

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.400
or began to phase it out

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.040
with gradual emancipation.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.540
But I wanna caution you

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.030
into thinking that this
turned the North into

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.330
a racial utopia.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.670
People of African descent

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.870
were still not permitted

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.730
to become American citizens,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.100
even though the immigrants,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.780
who were beginning to
flood in from Europe were.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.920
So I think it would be
fair to say overall,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.200
that the North had never
really needed slavery,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.270
and therefore, when
the Revolution led many

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.720
to question the institution of slavery,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.520
it was pretty easy to abolish it.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.930
How does that compare to
the South's transition

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.080
in this time period?

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.580
Well, by 1754, the notion that

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.000
slavery was natural

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.030
and enslaved Africans were property

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.270
was pretty well-ingrained.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.130
But the ideas of the Revolution

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.330
didn't have quite the
same effect on the South

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.860
as they did in the North.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.040
If anything, by 1800, white Southerners

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.490
were determined to enact

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.740
harsher slave codes than ever

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.000
because they feared uprisings,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.370
since the ideals of
the American Revolution

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.770
had inspired the Haitians

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.310
to overthrow the French.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.790
So why did these changes

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.510
in continuities over time matter?

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.740
Well, because by 1800, you start to see

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.040
attitudes around slavery crystallizing

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.300
in the United States,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.380
creating a North where slavery was rare

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.720
and considered a perversion of the ideals

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.980
of the Revolution,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.710
and a South where slavery was central

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.280
and considered natural

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.480
and perhaps even a desirable way

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.120
to organize society.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.740
And as white settlers
from each of these regions

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.650
moved farther and farther West,

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.010
into territories that were opened up

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.960
by the American victory
in the Revolutionary War

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.530
and by Indian removal,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.750
both Northerners and Southerners

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.700
would export their Economic systems

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.000
and their ideas about slavery

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.570
into these adjacent Western lands.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.430
By 1820, this gradual process

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.753
would erupt into Sectional
crisis over slavery.
