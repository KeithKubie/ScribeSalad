00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:02.374
- [Voiceover] Let's talk a
little bit about one of the,

00:00:02.374 --> 00:00:03.893
what I find to be one of the more

00:00:03.893 --> 00:00:05.469
mysterious forces of the universe.

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:06.947
Actually, I find all of the forces

00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:09.569
of the universe to be fairly mysterious.

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:11.882
So, let's talk a little bit about Charge.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.631
And we've all heard of charge.

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:16.089
Charge the battery.

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.621
This particle has charge.

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:19.607
But when you really think about it

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:23.926
all charge means is that there's
this property called charge

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:28.926
and we know that if something
contains a positive charge

00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:32.739
and calling it positive
is a little bit arbitrary.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.142
It's not like protons have a
little plus written on them.

00:00:35.142 --> 00:00:36.200
We can could've called them negative.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.342
But that when something
has a positive charge

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:41.185
and when something else
has a positive charge

00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:45.297
that they repel each other.

00:00:45.297 --> 00:00:47.533
And we also know that
if I had something else,

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.733
another particle that happened

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.533
to havea negative charge

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.773
and once again the word
negative being applied

00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:54.672
to this is completely arbitrary.

00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:57.973
They could've called it
blue charge and red charge

00:00:57.973 --> 00:00:59.932
but all we know is that
when another object

00:00:59.932 --> 00:01:03.122
has the other charge, in this
case we call it negative,

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:05.835
that's going to be attracted
to a positive charge.

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:07.644
All right, so, what do
we know about charge?

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:10.284
Charge is a property that particles have

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:12.023
and if you put enough particles together,

00:01:12.023 --> 00:01:14.558
I guess objects have
that property as well.

00:01:14.558 --> 00:01:16.825
So, it's just a property

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:18.886
and that's a way of saying

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:20.243
that I really don't know what it is

00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:23.181
and frankly, no one
fundamentally knows what it is.

00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:24.283
I actually didn't.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.651
No one really fundamentally
knows anything.

00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:28.598
But charge is a property of particles

00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:30.179
and objects just like mass.

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.118
I mean, if you think about it,

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:33.878
mass is just a property and to some degree

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:35.776
it seems a little bit
more real than charge

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:38.816
because in our brains are wired

00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:42.593
to in some way comprehend what mass is

00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:45.731
but we're probably more
comprehending weight and volume more

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.330
than mass but we can think more
about that at another time.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.071
Charge is a little bit more abstract

00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:55.071
because before we started
rubbing amber into our hair

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.091
we really didn't experience much charge

00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:00.561
unless we got struck by lightning.

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.978
So, charge is a property that
particles or objects have

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:05.335
and we know that there
are two types of charge,

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:10.335
which we've arbitrarily
named positive and negative

00:02:12.184 --> 00:02:15.213
and we know that like charges...

00:02:16.413 --> 00:02:21.178
like charges repel

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:24.513
and opposite charges...

00:02:24.513 --> 00:02:29.513
opposite charge attract
or unlike charges attract.

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:31.217
All right.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.991
So, what can we do with this?

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:37.173
Well, if we have this property
I think a useful thing

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:39.673
to do would be to measure the property

00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:41.996
and so we came up with units

00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:46.130
and so the unity of charge
is called the Coulomb.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.769
It's named after a scientist

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.862
in the late 1700s who played
around a lot with charge.

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.541
You can look up more
about him on Wikipedia.

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.813
But it's called the
Coulomb and the Coulomb,

00:02:56.813 --> 00:03:00.475
there's a bunch of definitions but I like

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:03.701
to think of it in terms
of elementary particles.

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.153
Just because to some
degree, well, unless you go

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.532
and start going into quantum theory

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:09.252
and start thinking about quirks and stuff.

00:03:09.252 --> 00:03:11.553
The elementary charge is the charge

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:13.671
on a proton or a neutron.

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:15.915
So, I'll go into more detail in the future

00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:18.614
on actually the structure
on atoms and whatever else,

00:03:18.614 --> 00:03:20.072
but let me just draw a little example.

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:24.732
So, a atom tends to have
some neutrons in them

00:03:24.732 --> 00:03:27.136
which don't have this charge property.

00:03:27.136 --> 00:03:30.525
It'll have some protons in 'em

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:32.992
which have a positive
charge and once again

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:35.973
that's kind of arbitrarily
defined as positive.

00:03:35.973 --> 00:03:39.197
We could've called it it has a red charge.

00:03:39.197 --> 00:03:41.331
And then it has these
things floating around

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:44.569
that are much lighter than,
the much, much, lighter

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.431
than the, than the protons and
the neutrons in the nucleus.

00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:51.524
And these are called electrons.

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:52.763
It's not even clear that they,

00:03:52.763 --> 00:03:54.202
that they're real objects.

00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:58.172
They're almost, like, energy but sometimes

00:03:58.172 --> 00:03:59.791
it's useful to view them as objects.

00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:02.316
Sometimes it's useful to view them as,

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:03.669
well, not as objects and we'll go

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.888
into all of that more later.

00:04:05.888 --> 00:04:08.105
But electrons have a negative charge.

00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:10.855
And the fundamental
unit of charge as far as

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.557
we are concerned right now before we start

00:04:12.557 --> 00:04:14.036
talking about quarks and other

00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:17.086
potentially subatomic
particles is the charge

00:04:17.102 --> 00:04:20.932
in an electron or proton and
they have the exact same charge

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:23.351
and that elementary
charge is denoted by E.

00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:26.391
And to be frank, I'm not
sure whether E stands

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.834
for elementary or E stands for electron,

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:32.191
but actually E is equal
to the charge of a proton,

00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:37.187
so it probably stands for
elementary charge of a proton

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:43.487
and the charge of an electron
is the negative of this.

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:47.601
So, negative E is the
charge of an electron.

00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:50.724
Charge of electron.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.495
But if we didn't care about size,

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:56.741
about sign than the
magnitudes are the same.

00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.581
So, that's the fundamental as far as

00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:01.602
we know as so far in our physics.

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.424
That's the fundamental charge.

00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:04.758
The fundamental unit of charge is just

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:07.006
the charge in a proton or neutron.

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.123
So, how does a Coulomb relate to that?

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:12.483
Well, a Coulomb, which we'll denote by C

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:16.151
is equal to, and this is a
bit of a arbitrary number,

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:18.141
but when we start doing
things with electricity

00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:21.242
we'll see why the Coulomb
was defined the way it is.

00:05:21.242 --> 00:05:23.621
But a Coulomb is six point two four

00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:28.621
times ten to eighteenth Es.

00:05:29.673 --> 00:05:31.113
Or you could say six point two four

00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:35.653
times ten to the eighteenth
times the charge on an electron.

00:05:35.653 --> 00:05:37.394
Actually, times the charge on a proton.

00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:40.834
And then of course, in terms of magnitude.

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:42.215
Because if I just say Coulomb

00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:43.695
I'm not really giving it direction.

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:45.192
So, if you look at the other way around

00:05:45.192 --> 00:05:47.851
you could say the elementary
charge, the elementary charge,

00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:50.985
is equal to, at least its magnitude,

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:55.985
one point six times ten to
the minus nineteen Coulombs.

00:05:56.743 --> 00:05:58.039
So, fair enough.

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.170
This might be a useful number to memorize

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.140
but it will usually be
provided for you in some way.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.133
So, what can do?

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:07.253
We've, we say that these objects

00:06:07.253 --> 00:06:08.674
have this property called Charge.

00:06:08.674 --> 00:06:11.769
Like charges repel,
unlike charges attract.

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:16.191
If we have enough of
these protons together

00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:18.304
then the whole object has charge.

00:06:18.304 --> 00:06:21.366
If we have more, let's
say, protons than electrons

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:22.407
and we have a positive charge.

00:06:22.407 --> 00:06:23.785
If we have more electrons than protons,

00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:25.873
we have a negative charge.

00:06:25.873 --> 00:06:28.345
And we know that we've
defined this unit of charge

00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:29.946
called the Coulomb which is a bunch

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:31.982
of the fundamental charge.

00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:33.204
So, let's play around with this

00:06:33.204 --> 00:06:36.233
and see if we can measure charge.

00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:41.134
So, in part of the initial,

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.716
I guess we can call it
definition on what charge is

00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:48.112
I said that like charges repel.

00:06:48.112 --> 00:06:50.124
Right, like charges
repel, so if those, both

00:06:50.124 --> 00:06:53.488
of these are positive they're
going to repel each other.

00:06:53.488 --> 00:06:56.858
And unlike charges, if this
is negative, this is positive,

00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:59.184
they're gonna attract each other, right?

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:02.231
So, by definition, if they
are moving each other,

00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:04.226
they're, these two particles are going

00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:05.745
to accelerate away from each other.

00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:06.465
These two particles are going

00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:08.664
to accelerate towards each other.

00:07:08.664 --> 00:07:10.944
The charge between these particles

00:07:10.944 --> 00:07:12.561
or the charge in each of these particules

00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:15.662
must be generating some
type of force, right?

00:07:15.662 --> 00:07:16.697
If there was no force being generated

00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:20.169
then they wouldn't repel
or attract each other.

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:21.956
And this is where we get to Coulomb's law

00:07:21.956 --> 00:07:26.034
and this is why we name
charges after Coulomb.

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:29.189
Coulomb figured out that the force

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:32.168
between two charges is equal to,

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:33.748
and this is going to be a vector quantity,

00:07:33.748 --> 00:07:36.228
and in about thirty seconds
I'll tell you which,

00:07:36.228 --> 00:07:37.948
what happens with the direction,

00:07:37.948 --> 00:07:42.948
is equal to some constant
times the first charge

00:07:43.218 --> 00:07:46.118
times the second charge

00:07:46.118 --> 00:07:49.769
divided by the distance
between them squared.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.072
And this is pretty neat because

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:53.494
this looks an awful lot like,

00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:57.093
so, if we call this the
force, the electric force,

00:07:57.093 --> 00:08:00.185
that looks a lot like the
gravitational force equation.

00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:03.098
Let me write that down.

00:08:03.098 --> 00:08:06.676
Force from gravity between two masses is

00:08:06.676 --> 00:08:08.385
equal to the gravitational constant

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:13.126
times M one times M two divided

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.781
by the distance between them squared.

00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:17.522
So, so far the two forces that we covered,

00:08:17.522 --> 00:08:20.422
Gravity and now we're
covering electric force,

00:08:20.422 --> 00:08:22.864
and we'll eventually expand
this to electromagnetic force,

00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:25.822
it seems like they kind of act at distance

00:08:25.822 --> 00:08:27.122
in a similar way and both of these

00:08:27.122 --> 00:08:29.843
forces into gravity, in a vacuum.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.322
So, it doesn't matter if you have no air,

00:08:31.322 --> 00:08:34.323
if you have no substances
between the two particles,

00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:37.004
somehow they're communicating
with each other,

00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:38.775
which I find kind of amazing, right?

00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:41.656
You can have nothing
between these two particles

00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:44.253
but somehow this particle knows
that this particle is there

00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:46.173
and that particle knows
that that particle is there,

00:08:46.173 --> 00:08:49.175
and they start moving without having any,

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:50.868
It's not like they have a
wire connecting to each other

00:08:50.868 --> 00:08:52.544
and someone's telling the other particle,

00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:54.104
"Hey, there's a particle
there, start moving."

00:08:54.104 --> 00:08:55.944
So, I don't know if you
find that as amazing as I do

00:08:55.944 --> 00:08:57.119
but think about it and you might.

00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:58.279
And it's just like gravity.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:09:00.301
I mean, the two masses
are in no way connected.

00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.640
They could be sitting in a vacuum

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.099
but somehow they know that
the other particle is there

00:09:04.099 --> 00:09:06.649
and when we start learning about

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:07.820
special relativity and all of that

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.241
we'll learn that, oh,
maybe there's nothing there

00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:12.838
but maybe the masses are
somehow shaping the universe,

00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:14.409
and maybe that's happening with,

00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:16.704
with the electric charges as well.

00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:18.064
But all we know at this point

00:09:18.064 --> 00:09:20.046
is that we have these charges

00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:22.951
and that they exert a force on each other

00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.798
that's proportional to the product

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:27.298
of their respective charges divided

00:09:27.298 --> 00:09:30.138
by the square of the
distance between them.

00:09:30.138 --> 00:09:32.781
And this constant right here

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:36.991
that is, I always forget it, what was it?

00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.590
I think it's six point...

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.543
I always forget what that constant is.

00:09:42.543 --> 00:09:45.746
It is nine times ten to the ninth.

00:09:45.746 --> 00:09:47.898
So, K, that's, it's rounded of course.

00:09:47.898 --> 00:09:51.432
That would amazing if it was exactly nine.

00:09:51.432 --> 00:09:55.262
Nine times ten to the ninth

00:09:55.262 --> 00:10:00.212
and the units are newton meters
squared per Coulomb squared,

00:10:03.143 --> 00:10:04.278
and why are the...

00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:06.198
Why are those the units?

00:10:06.198 --> 00:10:09.746
Well, pretty much because
at the end we have,

00:10:09.746 --> 00:10:10.999
we have Coulomb, Coulombs.

00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:14.077
We're gonna have Coulomb squared
divided by meters squared

00:10:14.077 --> 00:10:16.176
and we wanna finish with newtons

00:10:16.176 --> 00:10:18.156
so we wanna cancel out the Coulomb square

00:10:18.156 --> 00:10:18.987
by putting in the denominator.

00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:20.408
We wanna cancel out the meters square

00:10:20.408 --> 00:10:21.953
by putting in the numerator

00:10:21.953 --> 00:10:23.977
and then we'll end up with
the newtons to get the force.

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:25.878
So, that's just where the units come from.

00:10:25.878 --> 00:10:27.757
So, given that let's figure out

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:30.856
the force between two particles.

00:10:30.856 --> 00:10:33.696
So, let's say I have, I have,

00:10:33.696 --> 00:10:35.078
and I've spent ten minutes

00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:36.780
with a pretty long winded explanation

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.299
but the actual problems you'll
see in your physics class

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:42.678
are pretty straightforward
when it comes to Coulomb's law.

00:10:42.678 --> 00:10:47.434
So, they'll say, "Hey,
we have a positive..."

00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:50.725
We have a particle here that
has a positive charge of,

00:10:50.725 --> 00:10:54.274
let's call it, I don't know, plus,

00:10:55.397 --> 00:10:58.417
I don't know, let me
think of a good number.

00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:02.561
I don't know, plus five times ten

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:06.000
to the minus three Coulombs.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.161
So, that's a positive charge.

00:11:07.161 --> 00:11:09.908
And then we have a negative charge here.

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:13.955
And let's say that, I don't
know, how far will I make them.

00:11:13.955 --> 00:11:17.035
Let's say that they're half a meter apart,

00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:18.617
point five meters apart,

00:11:18.617 --> 00:11:21.930
and then I have a negative
charge here that is,

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.917
let's say that this is ten minus ten times

00:11:28.332 --> 00:11:32.524
ten to the, I don't
know, minus two Coulombs.

00:11:32.524 --> 00:11:34.617
So, what is the force
between these two particles?

00:11:34.617 --> 00:11:37.276
So, if we just plug
them in to Coulomb's law

00:11:37.276 --> 00:11:41.635
we get the electric, the
force due to electricity,

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:44.707
due to the electrical force
not due to electricity.

00:11:44.707 --> 00:11:46.086
We haven't done that yet.

00:11:46.086 --> 00:11:48.957
The static electric force
between those two particles

00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:52.615
is equal to the constant,
nine times ten to the ninth.

00:11:52.615 --> 00:11:57.226
Nine times ten to the
ninth times the first chage

00:11:57.226 --> 00:12:01.238
times five times ten to the minus three

00:12:01.238 --> 00:12:02.496
times the second charge.

00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:04.289
Let me do that in a different color.

00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:09.127
Times minus ten times
ten to the minus two.

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:11.120
I just rewrote that although
you probably can't see it.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.266
Divided by the distance
squared, so point five squared.

00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:16.696
We just plugged into this formula.

00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:18.675
So, that equals, let me see.

00:12:18.675 --> 00:12:20.667
So, nine times point five times ten.

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:23.049
I'm just gonna do the ten separately.

00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:24.182
So, that's times minus ten.

00:12:24.182 --> 00:12:27.923
So, it's minus, this is point five times

00:12:27.923 --> 00:12:32.923
minus ten is minus five, times
nine is minus forty five,

00:12:32.937 --> 00:12:35.516
and then ten to the ninth minus three,

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:38.836
so ten to the sixth and then minus two.

00:12:38.836 --> 00:12:43.404
So, ten to the fourth
times ten to the fourth

00:12:43.404 --> 00:12:48.404
divided by, and what's point
five squared is point two five.

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:50.317
All right, and this is equal to what?

00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:53.058
It's equal to four times is not one sixty

00:12:53.058 --> 00:12:57.563
plus this is equal to minus
one hundred and eighty

00:12:57.563 --> 00:13:02.428
times ten to the fourth newtons.

00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:07.146
And actually, this might
seem like a large number

00:13:07.146 --> 00:13:08.525
but these charges that I put here

00:13:08.525 --> 00:13:10.404
are actually fairly large charges

00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:13.102
and we'll, hopefully
you'll get a sense for

00:13:13.102 --> 00:13:14.686
what's a big or small charge later

00:13:14.686 --> 00:13:16.505
but these are reasonably large charges

00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:19.664
and so that's why there's
a relatively large force

00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:22.024
exerting between these two particles.

00:13:22.024 --> 00:13:23.567
Now, we got a negative number,

00:13:23.567 --> 00:13:24.078
so what does that mean?

00:13:24.078 --> 00:13:27.960
Well, we know that unlike
particles attract, right?

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.600
Almost by definition.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.478
In this case we had a
positive and negative.

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.517
So, when we have a negative...

00:13:33.517 --> 00:13:35.773
When we end up with a negative force

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:36.844
when we use Coulomb's law,

00:13:36.844 --> 00:13:40.448
that means that the force
will draw the two particles

00:13:40.463 --> 00:13:42.880
to each other along their,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.015
the shortest distance between them.

00:13:44.015 --> 00:13:45.796
I mean, it's not it's gonna
make them go in a curve.

00:13:45.796 --> 00:13:47.536
It kinda makes sense.

00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:49.234
If we had a positive
there, then that means

00:13:49.234 --> 00:13:51.893
that the force was
repelling the two particles.

00:13:51.893 --> 00:13:52.974
And if you ever get confused,

00:13:52.974 --> 00:13:53.527
just think about it.

00:13:53.527 --> 00:13:55.488
If they've both negative,
they're gonna repel.

00:13:55.488 --> 00:13:57.707
If they're both positive,
they're going to attract.

00:13:57.707 --> 00:14:01.337
I will see you in the next video.
