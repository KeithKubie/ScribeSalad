00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.650
This formula we just created has a special name. It is called the quadratic

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.367
formula. And this name makes sense. Remember, this gives us solutions for

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:14.155
quadratic equations, which are written in the form ax squared plus bx plus c

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:19.043
equal 0. As long as we can find these coefficients, we can solve for x. So let's

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:23.429
try this out. Let's see if it really works. Let's look at an example we did

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.821
before, and see if we can get the same answers for the x coordinates of its x

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:32.652
intercepts, as we did using other methods. Let's look back at x squared plus 5x

00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:37.192
plus 6 equals 0. For this quadratic equation what are a, b, and c? Were these in

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:41.949
reference to the general form of the quadratic equation that we've been talking

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:42.393
about?
