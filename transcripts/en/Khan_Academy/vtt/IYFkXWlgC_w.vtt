00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:02.052
- What I'd like to do in
this video is start exploring

00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:04.665
how we can model things with
the differential equations.

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:06.202
And in this video in particular,

00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:10.395
we will explore modeling population.

00:00:11.038 --> 00:00:12.305
Modeling population.

00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:14.181
We're actually going to
go into some depth on

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.035
this eventually, but here we're going

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:17.540
to start with simpler models.

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:19.573
And we'll see, we will stumble on using

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.385
the logic of differential equations.

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:23.420
Things that you might have seen

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:26.581
in your algebra or your precalculus class.

00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.938
So, in some level, what
we're going to do here

00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:32.139
is going to be review, but
we're going to get there

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:36.183
using the power of modeling
with differential equations.

00:00:36.552 --> 00:00:38.598
So let's just define some variables.

00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:43.598
Let's say that P is
equal to our population.

00:00:44.662 --> 00:00:49.662
And let's say that t
is, let's say that t is

00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:54.199
equal to the time that has passed in days.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.176
In days, it could have
been years or months.

00:00:57.176 --> 00:00:59.577
But let's say we're
doing the population of

00:00:59.577 --> 00:01:01.399
insects that reproduce quite quickly.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.399
So days seem like a nice
time span to care about.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.882
Now, what would be a reasonable model?

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:12.551
Well, we could say that
the rate of change,

00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:16.511
the rate of change of our
population, with respect to time,

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:21.637
with respect to time is, well,
a reasonable thing to say

00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:23.279
is that it's going to be proportional

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:26.673
to the actual population,
the actual population.

00:01:26.673 --> 00:01:28.165
Why is that reasonable?

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:30.616
Well, the larger the population,

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:32.488
the larger the rate at any given time.

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:34.040
If you have a thousand people, the rate

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.257
at which they're reproducing
is going to be more,

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:38.794
or a thousand insects is
going to be more insects

00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:41.396
per second, per day or per year

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:43.633
than if you only have 10 insects.

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:45.652
So it makes sense that the rate of growth

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:47.748
of your population, with respect to time,

00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:51.450
is going to be proportional
to your population.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:52.671
And so, you know, sometimes you think of

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:55.567
differential equations as
these daunting complex things,

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:57.278
but notice we've just been able to express

00:01:57.278 --> 00:02:01.680
a reasonably not so complicated idea.

00:02:01.068 --> 00:02:02.493
The rate of change of population is going

00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:05.682
to be proportional to the population.

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.904
And now, once we've expressed
that, we can actually

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:10.059
try to solve this differential equation.

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.185
Find a general solution, and
then we can try to put some

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.271
initial conditions on there or
some states of the population

00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:19.038
that we know to actually
solve for the constants

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.289
to find a particular solution.

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:23.366
So how do we do that?

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.140
And I encourage you to
pause the video at any time

00:02:25.014 --> 00:02:27.392
and see if you can solve
this differential equation.

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:31.393
So assuming you, at least,
maybe have had an attempt at it,

00:02:31.793 --> 00:02:33.436
and you might immediately recognize that

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.870
this is a separable differential equation.

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:36.863
And in separable differential equations,

00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:39.722
we want one variable and
all the differentials

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:42.523
involving that variable on one
side, and the other variable

00:02:42.523 --> 00:02:43.474
and all the differentials involving

00:02:43.474 --> 00:02:45.575
the other variable on the other side,

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:47.801
and then we can integrate both sides.

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:52.801
And once again, dP, the
derivative of P with respect to t,

00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:54.915
this isn't quite a fraction.

00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:59.181
This is the limit as our change
in P over change in time.

00:02:59.181 --> 00:03:02.407
This is our instantaneous
change, but for the sake of

00:03:02.407 --> 00:03:04.408
separable differential equations

00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:06.734
or differential equations
in general, you can treat,

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.361
you can treat these, this
derivative in Leibniz notations

00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.137
like fractions, and you can
treat these differentials

00:03:13.137 --> 00:03:16.514
like quantities because we
will eventually integrate them.

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:17.549
So let's do that.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.491
So, we want to put all
the Ps and dPs on one side

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.267
and all the, all the things that involve t

00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:27.319
or that I guess don't
involve P on the other side.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.616
So, we could divide both sides by P.

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:33.071
We could divide both sides
by P, and so we'll have

00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.123
one over P, and you have one over P

00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:39.424
here and then those will cancel,

00:03:39.424 --> 00:03:43.201
and then you can multiply
both sides times dt.

00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:45.202
We could multiply both sides times dt.

00:03:45.202 --> 00:03:48.078
Once again, treating the
differential like a quantity

00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:50.354
which isn't, it really isn't a quantity.

00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:53.005
You really have to view this as a limit of

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:56.190
change in P over change in time.

00:03:56.757 --> 00:03:59.658
The limit as we get smaller and smaller

00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:01.984
and smaller changes in time.

00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:03.810
But for, once again, for the sake of this

00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:05.482
we can do this, and when we do that

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:11.098
we would be left with one over P dP

00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:17.375
is equal to, is equal to

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:22.391
k dt, is equal to k dt.

00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:26.395
Now we can integrate,
integrate both sides.

00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:29.258
Because this was a separable
differential equation,

00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:31.823
we were able to completely
separate the Ps and dPs from

00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:33.424
the things involving ts or, I guess,

00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:36.250
the things that aren't
involving Ps, and then

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:39.376
if we integrate this side,
we would get the natural log,

00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:43.703
the natural log of the absolute
value of our population,

00:04:43.703 --> 00:04:46.229
and we could say plus
some constant if we want

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.205
but we're going to get a
constant on this side as well

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:51.682
so we could just say that's
going to be equal to,

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:55.434
that's going to be equal to
k, it's going to be equal to

00:04:55.434 --> 00:05:00.434
k times t, k times t plus some constant.

00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:03.104
Plus some constant.

00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:05.763
I'll just call that C one, and once again

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:08.085
I could've put a plus C
two here, but I could've

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:10.470
then subtracted the
constant from both sides

00:05:10.047 --> 00:05:12.734
and I would just get the
constant on the right hand side.

00:05:13.742 --> 00:05:16.668
Now, how can I solve for P?

00:05:16.668 --> 00:05:18.944
Well, the natural log of
the absolute value of P

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:21.776
is equal to this thing right over here.

00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:24.172
That means that's the same thing.

00:05:24.172 --> 00:05:26.523
That means that the absolute value of P,

00:05:26.523 --> 00:05:28.198
that means that the absolute value of P

00:05:28.198 --> 00:05:32.300
is equal to e to all this business,

00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:36.855
e to the, e to the, let
me do in the same colors,

00:05:37.152 --> 00:05:42.152
kt, kt plus,

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:47.441
plus C one, plus C one.

00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:50.134
Now this right over
here is the same thing.

00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:52.330
Just using our exponent
properties, this is the same thing

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:55.161
as e to the kt,

00:05:56.304 --> 00:05:59.218
e to the k times t

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:03.457
times e, times e to the C one,

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.157
e to the C one.

00:06:06.088 --> 00:06:07.590
Now this is just e to some constant,

00:06:08.382 --> 00:06:09.398
so we could just call this,

00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:12.043
let's just call that the constant C.

00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:16.008
So this is all simplified to C e,

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:20.338
C e to the kt,

00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:24.190
to the kt.

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:27.275
And if we assume our
population at any given time

00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:30.638
is positive then we could get rid of

00:06:30.638 --> 00:06:34.153
this absolute value sign, and
we have a general solution

00:06:34.153 --> 00:06:37.180
to this, frankly, fairly
general differential equation.

00:06:37.018 --> 00:06:37.793
We just said proportional.

00:06:37.955 --> 00:06:40.381
We haven't given what the
proportionality constant is,

00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:42.857
but we could say, if we
assume, positive population

00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:46.809
that the population is
going to be equal to

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:51.809
some constant C times e to the kt power.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:55.638
To the kt power, and the
reason why I said that

00:06:55.638 --> 00:06:57.394
you've seen this before is this

00:06:57.394 --> 00:07:00.938
is just an exponential function,
and it's very likely that

00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:04.192
in algebra or in precalculus class

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:06.414
you have modeled things
with exponential functions,

00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:08.694
and my guess is that
you've modeled things,

00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:12.371
modeled things like population.

00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:14.067
The reason why this is interesting is

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:15.150
you now see where this is coming from.

00:07:15.897 --> 00:07:17.923
The underlying logic that's just driven

00:07:17.923 --> 00:07:20.574
by the actual differential equation.

00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:22.850
The rate of change, with respect
to time, of the population.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:26.602
Well, maybe it's just
proportional to population.

00:07:26.602 --> 00:07:28.403
So I'll leave you there,
and in the next video

00:07:28.403 --> 00:07:31.354
we'll do what you probably
did in the 10th or 11th grade

00:07:31.354 --> 00:07:33.141
or maybe later in your
life, it doesn't matter when

00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.506
you did it, where we actually look at some

00:07:35.506 --> 00:07:39.158
initial conditions to find
a particular solution.
