00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.440
In the last video, we talk
about how seasons on Earth

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.550
are not caused by
how close Earth

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.080
is to the sun in its orbit.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.460
And we also hint at the
fact that it's actually

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.710
caused by the tilt of the earth.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.590
And so in this video,
I want to show you

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.110
how the tilt of the earth
causes the seasons to happen.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.410
So let's draw-- so
I'm going to try

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.634
to draw as many diagrams
as possible here.

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:25.050
Because at least
for my brain they

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.610
help me visualize what's
actually going on.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.450
So we could imagine
a top view first.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.479
So let's have a top view.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.120
That is the sun
right over there.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.430
And let me draw
the earth's orbit.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.510
So Earth's orbit maybe
looks something like that.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.712
Let me draw it almost,
it is almost circular.

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:45.170
So I'll draw it as
something that's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.520
pretty close to a
circle right over here.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.350
And I'm going to draw Earth at
different points in its orbit.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.040
And I'm going to try
to depict the tilt

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.470
of its rotational axis.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.980
And obviously, this is not drawn
anywhere near close to scale.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.880
Earth is much further
away from the sun,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.170
and much, much smaller
than the sun as well.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.940
So I'll draw the
earth at that point.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.315
And at this point,
the earth will

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:09.620
be tilted away from the sun.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.020
So Earth's tilt does
not change if you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.670
think about the
direction, or at least

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.253
over the course of
a year, if we think

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:17.290
about relatively
small periods of time.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.720
It does not change
relative to the direction

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.340
that it's pointing
at in the universe.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.490
And we'll talk about
that in a second.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.590
So let's say right over here we
are pointed away from the sun.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
So we're up and
out of this page.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.010
So if I wanted to put some
perspective on an arrow

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.390
it would be up and-- actually
it would be more like

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.060
up and out of this page.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.120
So that's the direction.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.680
If you were to come straight
out of the North Pole.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.846
And if you were to go
straight out of the South Pole

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:49.021
you'd go below that
circle right over there.

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:50.770
And if I wanted to
draw the same position,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.890
but if we're looking
sideways along the plane,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.234
the orbital plane, or the
plane of Earth's orbit.

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:00.150
So if we're looking at
it from that direction.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.020
So let me do it this way.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.220
If we're looking at
directly sideways,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.590
this is the sun right
over here, and this

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.085
is Earth at that position.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.100
This is Earth right over there.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.320
If I were to draw an arrow
pointing straight out

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.520
of the North Pole it would
look something like this.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.895
So this arrow and
this arrow they

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:35.450
are both popping straight
out of the North Pole.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.690
And so when we talk about
the tilt of the earth,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.550
we're talking about the
tilt of its orbital axis,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.020
kind of this pole that could
go straight between the South

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.030
Pole and the North Pole.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.980
The angle between that and
a pole that would actually

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.740
be at a 90-degree
angle, or perpendicular,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.890
to the plane of its orbit.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.130
And so compared to if it was
just straight up and down,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.170
relative to the
plane of the orbit.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.220
So this right here is the
angle of Earth's tilt.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.350
Let me draw that a
little bit bigger

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.750
just so it becomes a
little bit clearer.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.280
So if this is the
plane of the orbit,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.340
we're looking sideways along
the plane of the orbit.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.170
And this is Earth
right over here.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.900
My best attempt
to draw a circle.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.330
That is Earth.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.790
Earth does not rotate.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.230
Its axis of rotation is not
perpendicular to the plane

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.210
of the orbit.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.320
So this is how
Earth would orbit.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.080
This is how Earth
would rotate if it was.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.880
Earth rotates, Earth's
rotational axis

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.950
is at an angle to
that vertical relative

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.270
to the plane of its orbit,
I guess you could say it.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.097
It rotates at an
angle like this.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.430
So this would be the North Pole.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.750
That is the South Pole.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.540
And so it rotates like this.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.370
And that angle relative to
being vertical with respect

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.670
to the orbital plane, this
angle right here for Earth

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:14.770
right now is 23.4 degrees.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.029
And if we're talking about
relatively short periods

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.320
of time, like our
lifespans, that is constant.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.080
But it is actually changing
over long periods of time.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.280
That is changing between--
and these are rough numbers--

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:36.980
it is changing between 22.1
degrees and 24.5 degrees,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.810
if my sources are correct.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.394
But that gives a rough estimate
of what it's changing between.

00:04:41.394 --> 00:04:42.768
But I want to make
it clear, this

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:44.150
is not happening overnight.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.810
The period to go from roughly
a 22-degree angle to a 24

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.640
and 1/2-degree angle and back
to a 22-degree angle is 41,000

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.140
years.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.320
And this long-term
change in the tilt, this

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.850
might play into some of the
long-term climactic change.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.450
Maybe it might
contribute, on some level,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.110
to some of the ice ages that
have formed over Earth's past.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.470
But for the sake of thinking
about our annual seasons

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.930
you don't have to
worry too much,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.596
or you don't have to
worry at all really

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:17.560
about this variation.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.770
You really just have to
know that it is tilted.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.550
And right now it is tilted
at an angle of 23.4 degrees.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.310
Now you might say OK, I
understand what the tilt is.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.510
But how does that
change the seasons

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.000
in either the Northern or
that Southern Hemisphere?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.930
And to do that, I'm going
to imagine the earth when

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.050
the Northern Hemisphere is
most tilted away from the sun,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.540
and when it is most
tilted towards the sun.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.200
So remember this tilt, the
direction this arrow points

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.580
into relative to the
rest of the universe,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.120
if we assume that
this tilt is at 23.4%,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.180
it's not changing
throughout the year.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.190
But depending on where
it is in the orbit

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.740
it's either going to be
tilting away from the sun,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.840
as it is in this
example right over here.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.540
Or it will be tilting
towards the sun.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.770
I'll do the towards the
sun in this magenta color,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.420
or it would be tilting
towards the sun.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.940
So six months later when
the earth is over here,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.670
it's going to, relative to
the rest of the universe,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:21.020
it will be tilted in that same
direction, up out of this page

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.920
and to the right.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.830
Just like it was over here.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.220
But now that it's on the
other side of the sun that

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.450
makes it tilt a little
bit more towards the sun.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.620
If I were to draw
it right over here,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.910
it is now tilted
towards the sun.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.470
And what I want to think
about is how much sunlight

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.670
will different parts
of the planet receive.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.420
And I'll focus on the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.330
But you can make
a similar argument

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.660
for the Southern Hemisphere.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.620
I want to think about how much
sunlight they receive when it's

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.840
tilted away or tilted
towards the sun.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.459
And so let's think about
those two situations.

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:05.500
So first of all, let's
think about this situation

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.890
here where we are tilted
away from the sun.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.590
So let me zoom in a little bit.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.090
So this is the situation, where
we're tilted away from the sun.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.640
So if this is the vertical,
so let me draw it.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.310
I could actually just
use this diagram.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.770
But let me make it.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.305
So we're tilted away
from the sun like this.

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:26.520
I'm going to do this
in a different color.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.020
So if we have an arrow coming
straight out of the North Pole

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.020
it would look like this.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.420
And we are rotating
around like that.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.384
So we're out of the page
on the left-hand side,

00:07:40.384 --> 00:07:42.300
and then into the page
on the right-hand side.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.200
And so we're rotating
towards the east, constantly.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.380
So this arrow is in the
direction of the east.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.920
So when we're at this point
in Earth's orbit, and actually

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.090
let me copy and paste this.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.600
And I'm going to use
the same exact diagram

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.970
for the different seasons.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.410
So let me copy.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.529
And then let me paste
this exact diagram.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:05.445
I'll do it over here for
two different points.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.440
So when we are here
in Earth's orbit

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.857
where is the
sunlight coming from?

00:08:14.857 --> 00:08:17.398
Well, it's going to be coming
from the left, at least the way

00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:19.120
I've drawn the diagram
right over here.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:29.050
So the sunlight is coming from
the left in this situation.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.159
And so if you think about
it, what part of the earth

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.620
is being lit by sunlight?

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.490
Or what part of the
earth is in daylight,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.570
the way I've drawn
it right over here?

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.600
Well, the part that
is facing the sun.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.190
So all of this right over here
is going to be in daylight.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.140
As we rotate whatever part
of the surface of the earth

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.540
enters into this yellow
part right over here

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.427
will be in daylight.

00:08:53.427 --> 00:08:55.010
But let's think about
what's happening

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:55.920
at different parts of the earth.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.253
So let me draw the equator,
which separates our Northern

00:08:58.253 --> 00:08:59.880
and Southern Hemispheres.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.965
So this is the equator.

00:09:05.501 --> 00:09:07.500
And then let me go into
the Northern Hemisphere.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.870
And I want to show you why when
the North Pole is pointed away

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.722
from the sun why
this is our winter.

00:09:13.722 --> 00:09:15.430
So when we're pointed
away from the sun--

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.480
Well, if we go to the
Arctic Circle-- so let

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.430
me go right over here.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.640
Let me go to some point
in the Arctic Circle.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.800
As it goes, as the earth
rotates every 24 hours,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.030
this point on the globe
will just rotate around just

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.000
like that.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.832
It will just keep rotating
around just like that.

00:09:34.832 --> 00:09:36.790
And so my question is,
that point in the Arctic

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.460
Circle, as it rotates
will it ever see sunlight?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.300
Well, no, it will
never see sunlight.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.110
Because the North Pole is
tilted away from the sun.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.590
So what I'm drawing, what
I'm shading here in purple,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.070
that part of the earth, when
it's completely tilted away,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.086
will never see sunlight.

00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:55.460
Or at least it
won't see sunlight

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.430
while it's tilted away,
while it's in this position,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.000
or in this position
in the orbit.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.080
I won't say never, because
once it becomes summer

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.246
they will be able to see it.

00:10:04.246 --> 00:10:10.580
So no sunlight, no day, I guess
you could say, no daylight.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.210
If you go to slightly
more southern latitudes,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.860
so let's say you go over here.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.570
So maybe that's the latitude of
something like, I don't know,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.360
New York or San Francisco
or something like that.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.890
Let's think about what it
would see as the earth rotates

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.510
every 24 hours.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.020
So this would be daylight,
daylight, daylight, daylight,

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.500
then nighttime, nighttime,
nighttime, nighttime,

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.077
nighttime.

00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:33.410
This is now going behind the
globe nighttime, nighttime,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.050
nighttime, nighttime, nighttime,
daylight, daylight, daylight,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.140
daylight.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.796
So if you just compare this.

00:10:38.796 --> 00:10:40.295
So let me do the
daylight in orange.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:48.170
And then nighttime I will do
in this bluish purplish color.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.260
So night time over here.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.560
So if you go to really
northern latitudes,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.656
like the Arctic Circle,
they don't get any daylight

00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:57.280
when we are tilted
away from the earth.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.270
And if we go to slightly
still northern latitudes,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.080
but not as north as the Arctic
Circle, it does get daylight.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.510
But it gets a lot less daylight.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.000
It spends a lot less
time in the daylight

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.530
than in the night time.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.070
So notice if you say that
this circumference represents

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.950
the positions over 24 hours,
it spends much less time

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:24.740
in the daylight than it
does in the nighttime.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.560
So because, while the Northern
Hemisphere is tilted away

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.670
from the earth, the latitudes
in the northern hemisphere

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.875
are getting less daylight.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.660
They are also getting
less energy from the sun.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.890
And so that's what
leads to winter,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.120
or just being generally colder.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.760
And to see what
happens in the summer

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.380
let's just go the other side.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.040
So now we're going to the
other side of our orbit

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.940
around the sun.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.680
This is going to be
six months later.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.950
And notice the actual
direction, relative to the rest

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.910
of the universe,
has not changed.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.890
We're still pointed in
that same direction.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.660
We still have a 23.4 degree
tilt relative to, I guess,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.220
being straight up and down.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.590
But now once we're over
here the light from the sun

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.180
is going to be coming
from the right.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.890
Just like that.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.880
And now, if on this
diagram at least,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.020
this is the side
of the earth that

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.560
is going to be
getting the sunlight.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.210
And let me draw
the equator again,

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.984
or my best attempt
to draw the equator.

00:12:29.984 --> 00:12:31.650
I'll draw the equator
in that same color

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.590
actually, in that green color.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.750
So this separates the Northern
and the Southern Hemisphere.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.170
And now let's think
about the Arctic Circle.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.640
So let's say I'm sitting
here in the Arctic Circle.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.300
As the day goes on,
as 24 hours go around,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.760
I'll keep rotating around here.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.850
But notice the whole time
I am inside of the sun.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.470
I'm getting no nighttime.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.400
There is no night
in the Arctic Circle

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.820
while we are tilted
towards the sun.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.780
And if we still do that
fairly northern latitude,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.280
but not as far as
the Arctic Circle,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.520
maybe in San Francisco or New
York, or something like that .

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.240
If we go to that latitude,
notice how much time

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.580
we spend in the sun.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.550
So maybe we just enter.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.260
So this is right at sunrise.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.259
And then as the
day goes on we're

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.842
in sunlight, sunlight, sunlight,
sunlight, sunlight, sunlight,

00:13:23.842 --> 00:13:25.200
sunlight, sunlight.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.100
Then we hit sunset.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.480
Then we hit
nighttime, nighttime,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.821
then we hit nighttime, and
then we get sunrise again.

00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:34.570
And so when you look
at the amount of time

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.480
that something in the
Northern Hemisphere

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.470
spends in the daylight
versus sunlight,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.870
you'll see it spends a lot
more time in the daylight when

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:45.100
the Northern Hemisphere
is tilted towards the sun.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:53.930
So this is more day, less night.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.190
So it is getting more
energy from the sun.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.690
So when it is tilted
towards the sun

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.030
it is getting more
energy from the sun.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.240
So things will
generally be warmer.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.560
And so you are now
talking about summer

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.960
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.834
And the arguments for
the Southern Hemisphere

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:12.440
are identical.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.064
You could even play
it right over here.

00:14:14.064 --> 00:14:16.690
When the Northern Hemisphere
is tilted away from the sun,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.674
then the Southern Hemisphere
is tilted towards the sun.

00:14:19.674 --> 00:14:21.090
And so for example,
the South Pole

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.230
will have all daylight
and no nighttime.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.770
And southern latitudes will have
more daylight than nighttime.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.870
And so the south
will have summer.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.405
So this is summer in the south,
in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:32.940
And it's winter in the north.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.690
And then down here the
Southern Hemisphere

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.670
is pointed away from the sun.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.707
So this is winter in
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:14:40.707 --> 00:14:43.040
And you might be saying, hey
Sal, what about you haven't

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.360
talked a lot about
spring and fall.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.730
Well let's think about it.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.938
Well, if we're talking about
the Northern Hemisphere,

00:14:48.938 --> 00:14:51.140
this over here, we
decided, was winter

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.940
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.110
And we're going to
rotate around the sun.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.840
And at some point, we're
going to get over here.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.490
And then because of
this tilt we aren't

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.130
pointed away or towards the sun.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.570
We're kind of pointed
I guess sideways

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.330
relative to the
direction of the sun.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.990
But this doesn't favor one
hemisphere over the other.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.600
So when we're over here
in-- and this will actually

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.700
be the spring now- when
we're in the spring,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.850
both hemispheres are getting
the equal amount of daylight

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.870
and sunlight, or
for a given latitude

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.520
above or below the
equator, they're

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.890
getting the same amount.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.490
And the same thing
is true over here

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.374
when we get to--
so this is spring.

00:15:33.374 --> 00:15:35.290
This is the summer in
the Northern Hemisphere.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.770
Now this will be the fall
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.850
And once again, we're
tilted in this direction.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.660
And so the Northern
Hemisphere isn't

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.646
tilted away or towards the sun.

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:50.020
And so both
hemispheres are going

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.770
to get the same amount of
radiation from the sun.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.710
So you really see the extremes
in the winters and the summers.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.600
Now one thing I do
want to make clear,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.659
and I started off with just the
length of day and nighttime.

00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:03.950
Because frankly, that's maybe
a little bit, or at least

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.990
in my brain, a little
bit easier to visualize.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.750
But that by itself
does not account

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.820
for all of the difference
between summer and winter.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.180
Another cause, and actually this
is probably the biggest cause,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.320
is if you think about
the total amount of sun.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.657
So let's talk about the
Northern Hemisphere winter.

00:16:19.657 --> 00:16:21.740
And let's say there's a
certain amount of sunlight

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.985
that is reaching the earth.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.020
So this is the total
amount of sunlight

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.310
that's reaching the earth
at any point in time.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.230
You see that much more of
that is hitting the Southern

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.930
Hemisphere than the
Northern Hemisphere here.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.330
All of these, if
you imagine it, all

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.700
of these rays
right over here are

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.307
hitting the Southern Hemisphere.

00:16:45.307 --> 00:16:47.390
So a majority of the rays
are hitting the Southern

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.100
Hemisphere.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.760
And much fewer are hitting
the Northern Hemisphere.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.270
So actually a smaller amount
of the radiation period,

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.450
at even a given period
in time, not even talking

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.750
about the amount of time
you are facing the sun.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.330
But at any given moment
in time more energy

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.500
is hitting the Southern
Hemisphere than the Northern.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.970
And the opposite is true
when the tilt is then

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:09.810
towards the sun.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:16.900
And now a disproportionate
amount of the sun's energy

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.460
is hitting the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.460
So if you draw a
bunch of, if you just

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.300
think that this is all of
the energy from the sun, most

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.859
of it, all of
these rays up here,

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:27.369
are hitting the
Northern Hemisphere.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:31.060
And only these down here
are hitting the Southern

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.980
Hemisphere.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.390
And on top of that, what
makes it even more extreme

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.970
is that the actual angle, and of
course, this is to some degree

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.940
is due to the fact that
where the angle of the sun

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.420
relative to the horizon,
or where you are on Earth.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.530
But even more than
that if you are on,

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.860
let's say that this
is the land, and we're

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.600
talking about the winter
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.800
So let's say you're
talking about,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.960
let's say we're up over here
at this northern latitude.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.980
And we're just looking
at the sun here.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.460
And over here,
you could see even

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.570
when we are closest to the
sun the sun is not directly

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.569
overhead.

00:18:10.569 --> 00:18:12.110
When we're closest
to the sun the sun

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.450
still is pretty
low on the horizon.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.230
So it may be right
over here when

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.150
we're closest to the sun
in the winter the sun might

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.740
be right over here.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.340
But if you look at that
same latitude in the summer

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.440
when it is closest
to the sun, the sun

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.370
is more close to being
directly overhead.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.300
It still won't be
directly overhead.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.020
Because we are still at a
relatively northern latitude.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:45.120
But the sun is going to
be much higher in the sky.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.799
And these are all
related to each other.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:48.340
It's kind of connected
with this idea

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.830
that more energy is hitting
one hemisphere or the other.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.180
But also, when you
have a, I guess

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.080
you could say, a steeper
angle from the rays

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.030
of the sun with the
earth, it's actually

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.960
going to be dissipated
less by the atmosphere.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.600
And let me just make
it clear how this is.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.750
So in the summer-- so let's
say that that's the land.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:16.070
And let's say that-- let me
draw the atmosphere in white--

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.929
so all of this area right over
here, this is the atmosphere.

00:19:18.929 --> 00:19:21.470
And obviously there's not a hard
boundary for the atmosphere.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.760
But let's just say this is the
densest part of the atmosphere.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:32.480
In the summer, when the
sun is higher in the sky,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.730
the rays from the sun are
dissipated by less atmosphere.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.300
So they have to get through
this much atmosphere.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.300
And they're bounced off.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.970
And they heat some
of that atmosphere.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.530
And they're absorbed before
they get to the ground.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:49.340
In the winter when the
sun is lower in the sky,

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.994
so maybe the sun is out here.

00:19:51.994 --> 00:19:53.160
Let me draw it a little bit.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.830
So when the sun is lower in
the sky relative to this point,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.490
you see that the
rays of sunlight

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.130
have to travel through
a lot more atmosphere.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.020
So they get dissipated
much more before they

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.460
get to this point on the planet.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.690
So all in all it
is the tilt that

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.930
is causing the
changes in the season.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.190
But it's causing it
for multiple reasons.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.660
One is when you're
tilted, we'll say

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.590
when you're tilted
towards the sun,

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.840
you're getting more
absolute hours of daylight.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.340
Not only are you getting more
absolute hours of daylight,

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.686
but at any given moment, most
or more of the sun's total rays

00:20:30.686 --> 00:20:32.810
that are hitting the earth
are hitting the Northern

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.050
Hemisphere as opposed to
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:40.350
And the stuff that's hitting
the places that have summer,

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.740
it has to go through
less atmosphere.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.597
So it gets dissipated less.
