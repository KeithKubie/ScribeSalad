MALE SPEAKER: Jen, over to you.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.618
JENNIFER EVANS:
OK, well, thank you

00:00:02.618 --> 00:00:05.280
very much for coming and
spending your lunch hour

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.090
listening to me talk about
something quite random.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.360
I'm a senior lecturer in
history at the University

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.530
of Hertfordshire.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.009
And I run a blog called
Early Modern Medicine.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.300
I have some cards at the front.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.670
If you do you find yourself
fascinated by the end,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.340
please come and take one.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.840
And I'm going to talk to
you about my first book.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.170
As you'll have seen from
your raffle tickets,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.660
academic monograph,
slightly different ballgame,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080
very expensive, so
there's only a few of them

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.260
here, and slightly
different process, maybe,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.690
to writing other kinds of books.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.730
So what I'm going to do is
try and condense my book

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.950
into 50 minutes, give
you the major highlights.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.980
And what I really
hope to show you

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.400
is that we tend to think in
modern society of aphrodisiacs

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.757
in a very specific way.

00:00:50.757 --> 00:00:52.590
You say the word
"aphrodisiac," and everyone

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.340
thinks about lust,
sexual desire,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.030
and we very rarely think about
it in relation to reproduction.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.220
And what I want to
show you is that what

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.960
I found while
reading 17th century

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.680
medical texts is that
wasn't the case in the past.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.800
And actually, when you
read a lot of history books

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.220
on this subject,
historians will tend

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.149
to just talk about aphrodisiacs
using modern technology.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.690
But they're not
quite the same thing.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.360
They're must more of a medicine.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.250
So hopefully that's
what we're going

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.980
to get to over the
next 45, 50 minutes.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.820
So before I get on to that, I
wanted to cover some background

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.005
material.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.930
I wasn't quite sure
what kind of a crowd

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.170
I'd be talking to in terms
of historical interest

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.610
or enthusiasm or knowledge,
so a few little things.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.300
I'm going to bandy the term
"early modern" quite a lot.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.010
Historians do this all the
time, and then people say, oh,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.890
is that the medieval period?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.030
No, it's not.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.270
So we're normally talking about
the area between 1550 and 1750

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.690
or between 1500 and 1750.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.440
What I'm going to talk
to you about today,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.910
I mostly focus on
1550 and after.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.300
And there's no exciting reason.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.720
It's just very pragmatic in
that medical books before 1550

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.490
tended to be published in Latin.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.170
I don't read Latin,
so my book would

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.099
have been really short had
I tried to go before that.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.140
I do sometimes read stuff
that's older than that,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.490
but I tend to stick with things
that are written in English.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.860
Predominantly, my main interest
is in the 17th century.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.470
And this is because I think
it's the most exciting and most

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.090
vibrant century
you could possibly

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.650
study for English history.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.780
As many of you
will probably know,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.450
it's the era of the
English civil wars.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.370
It's the era of
the protectorates,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.310
the regicide of Charles I,
Restoration of Charles II.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.380
It's the era of the
Glorious Revolution in 1684

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.490
when James II is ousted
and the Protestant William

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.220
of Orange and his wife
Mary are given the throne.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.150
But it's also really
interesting outside of politics.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.830
I'm not a big fan of
political history.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.890
In the world of science,
a lot of the names

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.030
that you'll have learned
at GCSE and earlier,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.570
they're all people working in
the 17th century, so Robert

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.979
Boyle, Robert Hook, Christopher
Wren, Francis Bacon,

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.020
and perhaps the most famous
of all, Isaac Newton.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.650
They're all 17th century
men who like to study.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.590
And in the world
of medicine, it's

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.340
also a really important era.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.230
There was a lot happening.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.550
William Harvey discovered
the circulation of the blood

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.740
and published his first
book on that in 1628.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.490
And perhaps more
important for what

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.870
I'm going to talk about today,
both the egg and the sperm

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.130
were discovered in
the 17th century.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.650
So there's a lot happening
in 17th century England.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.170
And the other background
I want to briefly cover

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.870
is the medical
model of the time.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.370
Most people will
have heard of this.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.580
Hands up if you've heard
of the humoral model.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.260
Excellent.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.690
Hands up if you
know what it means.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.060
Oh, good, so my next
slide isn't pointless.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.320
OK, so humoral medicine
is the predominant way

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.690
of thinking about the
body in the 17th century.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.770
And it's what we're
going to focus on today.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.270
That's not to say
new things weren't

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.560
happening in the 17th century.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.240
You get the rise of
chemical medicine

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.230
very early in the century, and
towards the end of the century

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.500
you get a focus on
nervous disorders.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.030
Everything becomes about
nerves and mechanics.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.220
But predominantly, people
focused on the humoral model.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.860
And this was a
very ancient model

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.730
created by Hippocrates,
who lived around circa 460

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.839
to 370 BCE.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:25.570
And it was refined then in the
second century AD by Galen.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.250
The theories had existed
throughout the medieval period.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.300
They were there.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.400
But really in the Renaissance
in the 16th century,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.440
there's like a
drive to rediscover

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.020
that ancient medicine
and to revive the text

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.100
and to understand what
Hippocrates and Galen said

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.520
in its purest form.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.980
So humoral medicine has
this kind of resurgence.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.935
Older historians--
and I don't mean age;

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:51.920
I'm talking
chronologically-- tend

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.790
to say that the humoral
model stops being influential

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.760
at the end of the 17th century.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.050
For what I look at,
reproductive medicine,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.040
that's not really the case.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.520
And more and more
historians are accepting

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.350
that actually the
humoral model stays

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.630
quite influential
through the 18th century

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.840
and even tailing into
the 19th century.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.970
So how does the
humoral model work?

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.150
I'm hoping everyone
can see this slide.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.180
So under the humoral
model, your body

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.920
is created, or
predominantly made up,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.160
of four humors, or
fluids-- blood, phlegm,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.340
yellow bile, and black bile.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.410
And each of those
four fluids exists

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.930
inside your body in
your own personalized

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.397
kind of complexion.

00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:36.980
So some people have
more of one thing.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.080
Some people have more
of another thing.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.434
And those humors are all
related to different kinds

00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:42.975
of qualities.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:46.970
So each humor has a quality--
hot, cold, wet, and dry.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.962
And again, that affects
what kind of body you have.

00:05:49.962 --> 00:05:52.170
And what's really interesting
about the humoral model

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.149
is that-- you might
say unlike today,

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:56.440
but that might not be the case.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.414
Unlike today, your
humoral complexion,

00:05:59.414 --> 00:06:01.080
the way your body is
made up, is thought

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.830
to affect everything about you.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.950
So your strength,
your character,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.460
your emotional
stability, the kinds

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.440
of diseases you're
liable to get are all

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.010
linked to your
humoral complexion.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.680
And I really like this.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.470
You can see the picture
on the right-hang side

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.000
to you shows four different
types of body-- phlegmatic,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.460
sanguine, melancholic,
and choleric.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.220
And you can see on
the left-hand side

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.400
is a womanly body, because
women are thought to be

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.699
colder and more moist than men.

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:36.990
Men are on the right-hand side.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.710
They're hotter and drier.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.070
And this, in the humoral model,
is more perfect, so patriarchy

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.010
built into the medical model.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.460
Women are just
less good than men.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.362
So this all effects the kind
of person you're liable to be.

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:51.820
And these are
another set of images

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.900
showing the different kinds
of person you might be.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.500
And my favorite book
for describing this

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.060
was one written by John Fage,
and he really nicely sums up

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.790
how these different
humoral complexions

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.570
affect your personality.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:11.390
So he writes that choleric men
were for the most part short

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.180
because their natural
heat consumes and dries up

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.900
all the moisture in their
body so they can't grow.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.250
And this, he said, was
connected to the fact

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.210
that they would
sooner grow beards,

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.680
they would be
naturally quick-witted,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.370
they would be courageous
and have strong appetites.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.030
Unfortunately for
choleric men, they're

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.370
also liable to be arrogant,
graceless, quarrelsome,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.470
fraudulent, and
constant and crafty.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.227
Whereas, he says,
phlegmatic men-- and I'm

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:43.060
sure I don't need to
explain what phlegm is.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.680
It's still pretty much the same,
cold, wet, goopy, grossness.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.050
Phlegmatic men are hindered
by their bodies' overabundance

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.080
of phlegm.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.020
And so they're likely
to be short, gross,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.250
and fat without hair or beards,
and so they're not very manly.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.080
And they're also liable to be
slothful, forgetful, cowardly,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.710
covetous, and vain.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.140
So everything about
you is kind of

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.370
dictated by the makeup of
your body and these fluids.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.130
And importantly
under this model,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.590
a healthy body is
a body that flows.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.010
because it is made of fluids.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.820
And a healthy body is
one that's in balance.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.050
So you should be maintaining
your own balance of humors

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.807
in order to maintain
your health.

00:08:21.807 --> 00:08:24.140
And they do this through
something called regimen, which

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.710
again was something taken
from Hippocrates and Galen,

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.700
and it's focused
around something

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.929
they call the Six Non-Naturals,
six factors that you regulate

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.710
in order to maintain health.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.330
And I am going to read these off
my list-- air, diet, exercise,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.789
bodily evacuations of all
kinds, emotions, and sleep.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.930
And if you regulate those,
you should be very healthy.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.230
And perhaps the
most famous thing

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.850
about humoral
medicine is connected

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.920
to this idea of
balance and flow,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.985
is the way in which
they treat illness.

00:08:53.985 --> 00:08:57.100
So illness tends to
be a buildup of one

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.750
humor in the body, or an
excess, and the only way

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.690
to kill that is to
remove the excess.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.800
And so early modern
medicine and before

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.750
tends to focus a lot on purging
and lots of emetics next

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.130
to make you vomit, things
to go the other way as well,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.450
and the most famous, phlebotomy,
so cutting with scalpel

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.840
or using leeches to
remove excess blood.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.566
And so we all look
back on the past

00:09:23.566 --> 00:09:25.190
and think, oh, my
God, that's horrific,

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.997
what are they doing
to these people,

00:09:26.997 --> 00:09:29.580
it actually makes perfect sense
for what they're trying to do.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.810
They're trying to
restore balance.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.430
So it was under
this type of model

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.310
that the people I'm
looking at tried

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.670
to understand aphrodisiacs
and how they worked.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.820
So before I really get into
the kind of meat of the book,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.270
I want to have a little section
of caveats and addendums.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.420
And the first is
that you are going

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.211
to hear about some quite
famous, well-known aphrodisiacs.

00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:54.960
Oysters in particular
are going to pop up,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.270
and asparagus and
a couple of others.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.290
But you're about to be bombarded
with the most ludicrously,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.647
ridiculously long list of foods
that function as aphrodisiacs.

00:10:03.647 --> 00:10:05.480
Please don't leave here
and worry about what

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.830
you're going to have for lunch.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.380
It's fine.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.757
The major caveat
is I'm not going

00:10:10.757 --> 00:10:12.590
to be talking about
chocolate, so anyone who

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.589
was here hoping for a
nice history of chocolate,

00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:15.700
I'm very sorry.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.580
I didn't talk about
chocolate in the book

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.540
because it's everybody's
favorite go-to aphrodisiac

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.310
substance, so there are hundreds
of histories of chocolate.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.270
The other reason I didn't
write about chocolate

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.520
explicitly is because,
as hopefully you'll see,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.970
chocolate is one of the
most famous aphrodisiacs

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.070
in the 17th century.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.950
Everyone knows chocolate
is an aphrodisiac.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.450
But they're talking
about the drink,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.310
very different to
what we know today.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.930
It's a mix of cocoa, milk,
spices, often chili and pepper

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:42.695
and cinnamon.

00:10:42.695 --> 00:10:44.570
And the reason I'm not
going to talk about it

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.370
is because it's seen as
luxurious and exotic,

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.130
and so the chocolate
is an aphrodisiac,

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.635
but it's also what goes in it
that makes it an aphrodisiac.

00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:56.100
And not everyone's sure
what is more important,

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.490
the cocoa or everything else.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.370
And we're going to talk
about the everything else.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.470
The other kind of brief
caveat I want to make

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:10.110
is an apology for the quotes.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.430
If you don't understand
something I'm quoting,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.770
please just wave at me and
we'll stop and talk about it.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.990
So to think a little bit
about reproduction and sex

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.619
in the early modern
era, as I said

00:11:21.619 --> 00:11:23.160
at the very beginning,
what we really

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.140
need to do for the
next 20 minutes or so

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.700
is throw out your
modern understanding

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.690
in how we think about
sex in the modern day.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.950
In this era, reproduction is
almost inextricably linked

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.010
to sexual pleasure and desire.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.190
So people can think
about them separately,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.690
particularly if
they really want to,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.270
if they have a specific
purpose in mind

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.394
and they don't want a baby.

00:11:44.394 --> 00:11:45.970
They can think about
them separately.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.710
But they're really, really
closely tied together.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.410
And the major reason
for this is the way

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.400
they understand the
reproductive organs.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.700
And for many people
in this era, they

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.170
think that men and women have
the same reproductive organs.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.550
Now, this does change over time.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.400
But very early in
the era, they think

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.524
that the women's reproductive
organs, because she's

00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:06.930
colder and wetter on that
side of the humor model,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.630
are held inside the body.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.870
Men, being hotter,
have a heat force

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.790
that propels them outwards.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.410
But they're exactly the same.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.727
That model does come under
heavy criticism right

00:12:17.727 --> 00:12:20.060
from the 16th century, because
there are a lot of people

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.660
going, it's ridiculous.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.750
They're clearly not
the same set of organs.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.350
And so there's a bit of
tension between anatomists

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.630
and traditional
medical knowledge.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.220
But importantly,
one of the things

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.450
that stays for much
of era through to when

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.270
the egg and the
sperm are discovered

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.190
is the idea that both men
and women have testicles

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.840
and that both men and
women produce seed,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.790
or spermatic matter,
reproductive matter,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.190
whatever you want to call it.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.430
Those matters have
to meet in the womb,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.010
preferably at the
same time, not one

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.040
first and the other one joining
later, in order for conception

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.040
to occur.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.010
And what this means for
men and women in this era

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.760
is that they expect both men
and women to orgasm in order

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.640
for a conception
to occur, which is

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.390
great-- misogynistic,
patriarchal system

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.447
in which women's pleasure
is given priority.

00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:08.030
You would think that
would be awesome,

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.010
but it doesn't quite work
out like that for most women.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.000
Now, one of the
problems with this model

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.420
is you get lots of medical
writers and legal writers

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.650
and theologians all saying, yes,
but Mrs. Brown down the road

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.280
is married and has 20 kids,
and she never enjoys it.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.930
We can tell.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.269
She doesn't like her husband.

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:26.810
And so they can see
there's something

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.190
wrong with their model.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.340
But for the most of it, they're
following this two-seed model,

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.980
both men and women have seed.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.420
And one of the most interesting
things to come out of that

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.950
is the way that the 17th century
writers and legal writers

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:41.060
think about rape.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.950
Because if a woman is raped
and conceives a child,

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:45.770
she cannot claim
she's been raped,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:50.030
because if she enjoyed it,
somehow enjoyment and pleasure

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.740
equals consent, and it's not
until the 1670s that people

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.755
start really questioning
that and saying, well,

00:13:55.755 --> 00:13:56.720
hang on a minute.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.350
That's a bit ludicrous.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.820
So it's within this
kind of framework

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.500
that people are
understanding aphrodisiacs.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.140
And the last caveat
I want to make

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.620
is that I'm going to
talk about sexual desire

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.240
and sexual pleasure, and I tend
to do it quite interchangeably.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.110
And that's a reflection
of what they're saying.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.970
So the lines between the
two are often very blurred.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.469
And as we'll see,
particularly when

00:14:18.469 --> 00:14:20.760
you're talking about foods
that stimulate these things,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.760
there can be this
really complicated,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.080
cyclical relationship where
pleasure causes desire,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.830
and desire causes pleasure, and
they're all connected together,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.700
and they can't
really separate them.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.800
So apologies for the blurred
lines, but just go with it.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.584
It will all make
sense at the end.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.250
So hopefully, given
what I've just said,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.375
you can already start to
see how aphrodisiacs would

00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:42.955
be a quite different substance
to what we know them to be

00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:43.455
today.

00:14:46.159 --> 00:14:48.450
The only other thing I'll
say before we really get into

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.620
is I'm not going to talk about
religion very much today.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.010
But it's worth bearing in
mind that the religious setup

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.870
of the country, it's a
very Protestant nation.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.870
Sexual pleasure and desire
between a man and his wife

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.070
is very important.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.455
It's supposed to stop
fornication and adultery,

00:15:05.455 --> 00:15:08.330
and marriage is supposed
to be for mutual benefit.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.830
And men and women are expected
to give what they term

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.070
"due benevolence."

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.270
And you're not
supposed to reject

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.520
your spouses, due benevolence.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.250
And if you ask, you're
supposed to give it up.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.930
And this is all framed as well
around the biblical injunction

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.840
to be fruitful and multiply.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.212
So there is a religious
thinking that kind of

00:15:27.212 --> 00:15:29.670
supports the medical literature,
and the medical literature

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.020
draws on those
religious thinking.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.720
So fundamentally, aphrodisiacs
in this era work in two ways.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.910
The first is perhaps
the most obvious

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.920
and the one that will
seem most familiar,

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.250
is that it prompts libido.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.450
And so it facilitates
the occasions

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.920
in which conception can happen.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.890
Without libido, there's not
going to be much intercourse,

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.598
and there aren't going
to be many babies.

00:15:51.598 --> 00:15:53.890
And so it functions
in that kind of way.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.910
And several medical
writers make a point

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.620
of pointing out how
important sexual desire

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.510
and sexual pleasure
are for this.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.640
And one or two even go so far
as to say without sexual desire

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.090
and pleasure, everyone
would stop breeding

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.880
and the human race
would come to an end.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.389
And I want to share with you
perhaps my most favorite quote,

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:16.680
and I've been studying this
topic for over seven years,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.020
so it's won out over a
long list of contenders.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.980
And my most favorite
quote is from a man

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.890
called John Martin writing
in the early 18th century.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.750
And he's a surgeon.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.995
He writes on reproduction
and venereal disease.

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:31.165
And he writes about
sexual desire and pleasure

00:16:31.165 --> 00:16:32.600
in the following way.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.760
"God Almighty has endured each
sex with natural instincts,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.240
prompting them to the
use thereof with desire

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.840
in order to perpetuate
the species by producing

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.260
new creatures to supply the
room of those who are gone.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.020
Without which, what
rational creature

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.140
would have taken delight in
so filthy, so contemptible

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.330
and base thing as venery
is?"-- as intercourse is.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.780
"And indeed, had not nature
tapped a more than ordinary,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.080
pleasing sensation and
desire to each sex in the act

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.300
by giving those parts
such a quick, tender sense

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.780
and transporting
titillation and which

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.930
with all the artillery of reason
we are not able to control,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.260
so furious is our
passion in the embrace,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.810
we should have no manner of
incitement or inclination

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.849
to performing it.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.740
And consequently,
procreation must soon

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.960
cease and be at an end."

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.724
I think he wins for
most melodramatic quote

00:17:19.724 --> 00:17:22.349
about sexual pleasure you could
possibly find in a medical text

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.339
ever.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.495
So this is the kind of
overarching framework.

00:17:27.495 --> 00:17:29.620
It's one of the ways in
which people could say, oh,

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.440
that food works
as an aphrodisiac

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.430
and it works for
fertility and conception

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.640
simply because it prompts
people to have sex.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.560
And so it's encouraging
things in that way.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.240
And what you find
in medical texts

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.490
is they will write
separate chapters.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.900
So normally medical texts
are organized by disease.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.350
They have separate chapters.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.670
And there might be a
chapter about barrenness

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.010
and infertility.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.710
And you also find some that
are about loss of libido,

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.740
or as they call it, a
want of carnal copulation,

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.290
lack of drive, as we
would call it today.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.850
But interestingly,
when these writers

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.910
include two separate chapters,
and they have aphrodisiacs

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.060
that link to this
kind of quotation,

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.390
they will often write
that both kinds of drugs

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.790
are applicable in both
ways, in both places.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.520
So if we look at Felix Plater--
he's not an Englishman.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.100
His book is published in
England in 1662 after his death,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.550
and he writes only that
the things mentioned

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.450
to provoke lust are chiefly
used for conception.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.570
So the primary use
of all aphrodisiacs

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.590
is to promote conception,
which is not exactly how we

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.810
think about them.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.650
But beyond this, early
modern men and women

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.875
think about different foods as
affecting the reproductive body

00:18:39.875 --> 00:18:42.760
in quite substantial
ways, all of which

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.990
promote desire and
libido, but all of which

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.379
also improves the body's
fertility at the same time.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:51.170
What I'm going to do
now is go through each

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.620
of those categories with
you, what types of foods

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.760
could you eat in the
early modern period

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.520
if you were having problems.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.260
And for the book,
I did this as well.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.930
I broke them up into these nice
snazzy chapters and headings.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.680
I do like a bit of
alliteration, so there

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.460
are lots of alliterative
titles going on

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.950
over the next few slides.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.560
But it's important to
remember that mostly I've

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.820
done this for ease of reading.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.136
It gets very muddy
and complicated.

00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:19.010
There are many, many
foods that people simply

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.907
say, oh, it's an aphrodisiac.

00:19:20.907 --> 00:19:21.490
And that's it.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.900
That's all the information
they're going to give you.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.700
When you're trying to write
a book on why aphrodisiacs

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.260
work in 17th century,
that's very frustrating,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.740
very annoying.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.220
But they all say muddle them up.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.980
So drugs in the early modern
era are very rarely specifics.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.795
They very rarely function
to help just one body part

00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:42.100
or to cure just one disease.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.320
They tend to do lots and
lots and lots and lots

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.530
of different things depending
on the context you're using them

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.340
within.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.760
And so you might have one
person say that oysters

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.800
are an aphrodisiac
for one reason,

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.620
and another medical writer
publishing the same year

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.620
or a year later will say they're
an aphrodisiac for a completely

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.760
different reason.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.590
So there's lots
jumbled and mixed up,

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.800
and things tend to
have multiple virtues.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.410
But for ease of what
we're talking about today,

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.110
these are my nice little
semi-fake categories

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.700
of aphrodisiacs.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.370
So the first few what
I'm going to talk about

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.130
are all based on
that humoral model

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.720
that we looked at earlier.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.540
And the first category is
hot foods and heating herbs.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.550
I told you alliteration is
going to feature heavily now.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.400
And this is because for
early modern men and women,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.330
a body that was cold,
or as they termed

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.610
it, frigid, was
one that was deemed

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.000
to be unable to procreate,
unable to reproduce,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.335
and was unable to feel
any sexual pleasure

00:20:37.335 --> 00:20:38.285
or sexual desire.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.994
An important part
of this is that seed

00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:45.410
that we were talking
about earlier

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.760
that men and women produce.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.120
That needs to be warm.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.220
Otherwise it can't
spark new life.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.970
And in particular
for men, it needs

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.895
to be warm, because men,
being the more perfect

00:20:54.895 --> 00:20:56.870
of the species,
are the ones that

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.450
endow a new child, a
new fetus with its soul.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.870
And they think all of
this has to be warm

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.220
for it to happen,
but not too hot,

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.150
because if your seed
is too hot, it burns up

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.941
all the important
elements, and that's just

00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:10.560
as bad as if it's really cold.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.240
For women, the womb also
needs to be warm enough

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.450
to cherish a newborn
fetus-- newborn

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.790
is probably the wrong term--
newly conceived fetus.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.130
If the womb is considered too
cold or too wet and slippery,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.410
it will slide out or freeze
and it will all go wrong.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.410
So given that they thought
about things in this way,

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.430
one of the most popular
categories of aphrodisiacs

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.370
was these hot foods
and heating herbs.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.920
And if we look at popular
medical writers like Nicholas

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.110
Culpepper, he's a really
fascinating character.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.080
He lives in the 17th century.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.655
He's supposed to go to
university to become

00:21:46.655 --> 00:21:49.570
a theologian and a clergyman.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.826
He decides he doesn't
like it, tries

00:21:51.826 --> 00:21:52.950
to elope with a young girl.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.060
He gets struck by lightning
and never meets him,

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.720
ends up becoming an
apothecary, and then turns

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.140
into this kind of
semi-radical figure

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.930
who rails against the Royal
College of Physicians, who

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.455
publish everything in
Latin and want to hold all

00:22:06.455 --> 00:22:08.400
their medical knowledge
close to their chest.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.950
Culpepper thinks
that's unfair, so he

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.055
translates nearly everything
they write and publishes it

00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:16.230
in English so
everybody can read it.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.410
And he writes that the fourth
cause of natural barrenness

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.580
is a loss of carnal copulation.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.580
And he describes it as follows,
"when men and women come

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.760
to the school of Venus either
not at all or so frigidly

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.150
that never a wit is
never the better."

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.760
And so he says these people
should eat heating herbs,

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.295
and this will help them
regain their libido,

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:40.520
their sense of pleasure, and
their ability to conceive.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.780
And one of the very earliest
texts I look at, Jacob

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.370
Rueff's medical and
midwifery manual,

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.160
advised that women
who were, quote,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.850
"hindered very much for a want
of desire to be acquainted with

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.630
Venus"-- the language of how
they describe sexual pleasure

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.120
is just amazing
throughout the whole era--

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.930
"should take heating herbs such
as gelengal, rocket, pepper,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.980
ginger, and cinnamon."

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.094
And it was some of those
spices in chocolate,

00:23:03.094 --> 00:23:05.260
and it was that heating
effect in the chocolate that

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.730
was thought to be
aphrodisiac as well.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.590
While another Englishman,
Philip Barrow,

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.830
writing in the
16th century stated

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.260
that "frigid men
and women should

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.210
eat meats that do heat and
engender good humors, as is

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.420
the flesh of hens, capons,
partridges, pheasants,

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.520
young doves, birds of the
mountain, especially sparrows,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.630
cockstones, and suchlike."

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.680
So clearly you're not
lacking for options.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.820
There's quite a few
things you can choose.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.310
The most famous of all of the
hot foods and heating herbs,

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.510
though, was the Spanish
fly, Contharides.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.430
And this small,
iridescent beetle

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.910
was very rarely recommended
by medical writers.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.110
It's incredibly dangerous.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.850
And it's incredibly
dangerous still.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.240
And I'm not sure I'm-- well,
people often end up on my blog,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.680
I can see what they've been
searching for, and a lot

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.850
of people are searching
for Contharides and whether

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:54.510
they're dangerous.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.593
And I just want a big
banner on my blog that says,

00:23:56.593 --> 00:23:58.760
yes, don't use them.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.182
They're known to blister
and burn the skin.

00:24:02.182 --> 00:24:04.140
And that's both if they're
applied to the skin,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.560
or if they're
consumed internally,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.190
they'll blister and
burn internally.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:11.220
But they do create
this warming sensation.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.925
So anything that's hot
under the humoral model

00:24:13.925 --> 00:24:16.060
or creates that sensation
of warmth when you eat it

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.170
is really good as
a heating herb.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:22.340
And Contharides are
probably the most potent.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.260
So given how dangerous
it was, medical writers

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.240
didn't really like
to recommend it.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.720
And in fact, they spent a lot
of time trying to warn people

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.640
about the side effects.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.500
And Jane Sharp, who was the
first woman and Englishwoman

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.640
to ever write a midwifery
text and publish it in England

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.930
writes of Contharides,
or Spanish fly.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.480
She warns people
"not to take them

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.000
to stimulate an
erection, because it

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.760
could result in a priapism,
or a continual standing

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.955
of the yard."

00:24:48.955 --> 00:24:51.330
Yard is one of their term--
I don't need to explain that,

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.240
do I?

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.240
We don't think it's
based on length, though.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.860
We're still trying
to figure that out.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.060
So priapism, or continual
standing of the yard,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.100
which she goes on to
say is more of a problem

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.750
than if it never stands at all.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:03.880
And she's not wrong.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.280
Other writers tend towards
quite gruesome tales.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.090
They like to recite
a nice little story

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.590
to try and put people off.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.810
And the Swiss physician
Theophile Bonet,

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.690
who is working in Geneva,
records in his medical texts

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.730
that, "I've known several among
the rest, two noblemen who

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.755
used Contharides,
the one to gratify

00:25:21.755 --> 00:25:24.260
his whore, the other,
his new married wife,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.470
but wholly with ill
success, for the first

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.990
fell into a most dangerous
pissing of blood, of which he

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.656
was cured with great difficulty.

00:25:30.656 --> 00:25:32.780
And the other, the second
day after he was married,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.700
died of an apoplexy,"
which is what we would

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.910
now term a stroke.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.360
So heating aphrodisiacs
are very popular

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.960
throughout the entire era,
but they're quite dangerous,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.360
particularly the Spanish fly.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.600
Now, many of the foods that
were thought to be warming also

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.040
were thought to fit in our next
category, which is nourishing

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.460
foods and seed provokers.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.490
Any food that
nourished the body was

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.366
thought to be good
as an aphrodisiac

00:26:00.366 --> 00:26:01.990
because it fundamentally
meant that you

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.107
were producing more seed.

00:26:04.107 --> 00:26:06.190
For early modern men and
women, you eat your food,

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.370
it sits in the stomach,
gets converted into blood,

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.737
blood circulates around the
body, ends up in the testicles,

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.820
or depending on which text
you read, the prostate,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.350
because some people think
the prostate is doing this,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.470
where it's-- they term it
concocted or elaborated

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.250
and turned into seed.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.950
And so blood that was
food becomes seed.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.260
And so anything you
eat that's nourishing

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.590
is producing more
seed in your body.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.600
And seed is really
important because it's

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.450
thought to be stimulating.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.690
So as it passes through
all the little passageways

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.310
of the reproductive organs,
it stimulates sexual pleasure.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.640
And this is where you get
that complex desire-pleasure

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.860
crossover, because
the production of seed

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.090
is stimulated by desire,
which creates pleasure,

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.260
but the pleasure also
stimulates the desire, which

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.620
creates the seed production.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.560
And I think they
get as confused as I

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.980
do when they were writing them.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.530
So anything that helps
nourish you produces seed.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:06.390
And better quality seed
gives more titillation.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.470
But importantly,
it's also more likely

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.390
to result in a
conception, so again,

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.280
this link between
sex and reproduction.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.280
So if we look back at
Felix Plater's 1662 book,

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.160
he loves this category.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.520
He goes nuts and lists
huge amounts of things.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.840
And so he says,
"To correct a want

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.750
of copulation in particular,
we give things that cause seed.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.970
And this, as is said, by
its plenty and sharpness

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.830
stirs up desire to the act and
disposes the members for it.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.410
These are such as
cause much blood,

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.820
which is the matter of
which seed is made."

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.760
Some some suggestions
that he offered

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.800
were the "brain's stones," which
is their word for testicles,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.200
and flesh of crawfish, crabs,
lobsters, oysters, cuttlefish,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.100
[INAUDIBLE], cocks, quails,
sparrows, and foxes, as well as

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.140
milk, eggs, chestnuts, parsnips,
almonds, pine nuts, pistachios,

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.370
artichokes, rapeseed, beans,
peas, rice, and barley.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.680
So you were definitely not going
to not find an aphrodisiac.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.710
There's always something
you can turn to.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.950
Now, a very similar category
to these are seed provokers.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.960
And when I was writing the book
and doing the research for it.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.960
I kept coming across
these two kind

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.070
of interchangeable terms,
nourishing foods and seed

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.610
provokers.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.100
And in the 18th century, they
even get called spermatics,

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.700
which I quite like as a term.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.274
But I think, depending
on where you're reading,

00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:29.440
these are either the same
thing, or they're actually

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.273
something different.

00:28:30.273 --> 00:28:32.770
And a seed provoker is
something that prompts the body

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.000
to make seed out of nourishment
that's already there as opposed

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.650
to just providing more
of the base material.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.687
And Felix Plater's is
one of the text where

00:28:40.687 --> 00:28:42.520
you can see this
distinction, because having

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.020
given that huge, long
list of nourishing foods,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.510
he goes on to say that you could
also take these seed provokers.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.520
And he says that these are
onions, leeks, mushrooms,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.025
rocket, colewart, which
is a type of brassica,

00:28:55.025 --> 00:28:57.430
a bit like kale, and asparagus.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:01.440
And so he's quite clear
to separate the two out.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.650
Now, I've said seed
was titillating.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:06.280
There is a reason for that.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.230
The reason why
seed is titillating

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.750
is because of its salt content.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.150
They believe that seed is salty.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.390
And so another category
of aphrodisiacs

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.080
are salty or slightly
salty, brackish foods,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.290
because they augment
the quality of seed

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.080
that makes it titillating.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.370
And one medical
writer is [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.630
He explains in the 17th
century that "salt,

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.680
by reason of its
heat and acrimony,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.690
provokes to lust those
that used to eat it

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.055
in any great quantity.

00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:38.180
And it was for this cause
that the Egyptian priests

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.740
would want to abstain from
all manner of salt meats,

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.990
having found by experience
that salt does cause

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.950
a kind of itching or
tickling in the parts that

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.910
serve for generation."

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:54.460
And this is quite a nice
anecdote that he includes.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.580
It sounds quite sophisticated.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.830
Another text I read was
slightly less sophisticated

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.840
and said it was
evident that salt

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.770
was an aphrodisiac
because mice on ships are

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.952
want to breed quite excessively.

00:30:04.952 --> 00:30:07.410
And even if you have one mouse,
by the end of your journey,

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.910
you'll have lots,
and that's clearly

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.120
the fault of licking
salt from off the ship.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.370
Theophile Bonet, our Swiss
physician we met earlier

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.940
liked to link it more to Venus.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.070
And he said that "saline
and acrimonious things

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.730
were aphrodisiacs
because, as Venus

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.680
is said to be born of
salt sea, so saline things

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.150
you know to be stimulate."

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.090
And he goes so far as to say
that the word "salacious" must

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.430
all be connected into this
because of that "sal,"

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:38.860
"salaciois," "saline" all
comes connected to Venus.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.110
What I found really interesting
while writing the book

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.530
is that lots and lots of medical
texts in the 17th country

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.695
just kind of cut and paste.

00:30:45.695 --> 00:30:48.160
They're huge fans of plagiarism.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.522
They will republish and reprint
and steal from each other

00:30:51.522 --> 00:30:52.480
over and over and over.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.310
So change can be
quite slow to identify

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:59.019
and slow to make its way
through these kinds of texts.

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:00.560
But throughout the
17th century, they

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.390
are questioning
their aphrodisiacs.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:03.770
They're questioning what works.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.440
And poor saline,
salty foods are one

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.480
of the first kind of casualties
of this reexamination.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.972
And John Martin, who wrote about
pleasure-- we saw him earlier--

00:31:12.972 --> 00:31:14.430
he writes in the
early 18th century

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.096
that there's no way
that these can work,

00:31:16.096 --> 00:31:18.740
because there's not
enough salt in seed

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.947
for it to be stimulating.

00:31:19.947 --> 00:31:22.030
And I think his word choice
is really interesting,

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.220
because he's not outright
saying salt isn't aphrodisiac,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.412
just that there's not enough
there, which to my mind

00:31:27.412 --> 00:31:28.870
would mean a reader
would just say,

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.860
oh, well I'll eat lots more
of it and then it will work.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.420
But he's trying to
distance himself

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.800
from that kind of understanding.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.460
Others are a bit more
argumentative and forceful.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.140
And so say salty
foods stop being

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.350
described as an
aphrodisiac fairly early

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.700
in the 18th century.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.180
So, so far, hopefully
you've picked up

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.030
on this, all of these foods
work for both men and women.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.810
And that in part is
because of that idea

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.520
that men and women's
bodies are very similar.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.800
They do function
in different ways,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.020
but they're quite similar.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.390
But there was one aphrodisiac
that was solely for the men's

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.870
bodies, solely for men.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.060
And this is normally my
most popular category

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.230
of aphrodisiacs.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.570
They were things that
cause flatulence,

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.260
so flatulence foods
come to be known

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.570
as windy meats in
the 17th century

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.270
and in the early modern era.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.030
And anything that releases
wind into the body,

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.730
into the reproductive organs,
is supposed to be good for men.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:26.510
The reason it's good for men
is because the way anatomy

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.405
understands the male body at
the very beginning of the era

00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:31.460
is they think that
an erection functions

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.870
through blood, imagination,
muscles, pressure, seed,

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.050
and wind.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:39.980
And this is my second-favorite
quote from the book.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.070
Helkiah Crooke, an Englishman,
writes of the male member

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.010
that it was, quote, "a gut
filled with wind, presently

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.910
swelling and grown hard,"
so not a very sophisticated

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.560
understanding of the male body.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.770
And windy meats are
really bad for women.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:57.950
Wind collecting in the womb is
a disorder called the dropsy.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.200
It's very bad, but there are
some very amusing stories

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.180
about when that wind
is released from women.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.470
Medical writers like
to write about that.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.920
But dropsy actually
causes barrenness,

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.690
so it's a bad thing for
women, but it's good for men.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.770
Now, the reason this
is so good for men

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.660
is because it
facilitates an erection.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.700
We might think that's
purely mechanical.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.640
So are they really
aphrodisiacs if it's just

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.000
aiding the mechanics?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.020
But by enhancing and
lengthening the amount of time

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.005
a man can sustain
an erection for,

00:33:26.005 --> 00:33:27.380
what they believe
is happening is

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.520
you're giving more time for
friction, which causes more

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.110
heat, but you're also giving
more time for that woman's

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.430
colder body to get to a
point where she will orgasm.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.330
And so there is more
chance of those two

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.660
seeds meeting at the
same moment in the womb

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.160
and forming a fetus.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.890
So again, it's kind of pleasure,
but in a really off mechanical,

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.180
mechanistic kind of way.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.140
So the flatulent
category, probably not

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.110
a surprise to anyone, includes
beans, peas, and chickpeas.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.360
And Philip Barrow,
who we met earlier,

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.660
argued that when a man
cannot fulfill his duties,

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.910
which I think is a very
interesting phrase, quote,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:09.210
"windy meats are good for him,
as be chick peas and beans,

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.630
scallions, leeks, the root and
seed of parsnips, pine nuts,

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.170
sweet almonds, and
other such like."

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.679
Again, anything that's
similar will work.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.540
Another author claimed
a similarly long list

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.110
of foods as windy
aphrodisiacs, including

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:26.360
pine nuts, pistachios, small
nuts, chives, artichokes,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.989
colewarts, rapes, carrots,
parsnips, green ginger, eryngo,

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:34.969
which is a plant that grows
in coastal areas in England,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:38.070
satyrion, which we're going to
see in a minute, onions, water

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.570
nuts, rockets, et
cetera, oysters,

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.290
also chestnuts, chickpeas,
and all such like meats.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.690
And I think you can
see here this repeated

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.550
phrase of "and suchlike."

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.330
And so they're very
open to the concept

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.671
that if you haven't got
exactly what's on my list,

00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:54.420
anything you've got
that's kind of similar

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.770
is probably going to work, which
is very important when you're

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.410
talking about quite
a varied wealth

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:04.110
dynamic across the country.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.870
As with salty foods, windy
meats, unfortunately-- I

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:11.350
think it's a real shame-- fall
foul of the reinterpretation

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.540
and reinvestigation
of aphrodisiacs,

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.430
and increasingly across
the 17th century,

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.000
anatomists point out that
the penis is a lot more

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.630
complex than just
an empty gut that

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.200
needs to be filled with wind.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.080
And so these are gradually
rejected as aphrodisiacs.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.880
And Theophile Bonet argues
that "it's commonly reported

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.440
of aphrodisiacs that flatus, or
wind, is necessary for venery.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.160
But though in boys, erection
or distention of the penis may

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:40.020
seem to be from flatus, and
these may concur by accident,

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.340
yet they cannot nor ought
not to be reckoned amongst

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.570
aphrodisiacs.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.650
Those things indeed
excite the spirits

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.200
and stir up venery and
make the seed turgid

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.520
but so do not those
things that breed wind."

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.145
I think it's shame
just because they're

00:35:54.145 --> 00:35:55.380
the most fun to talk about.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.220
So it would have been nice had
they carried on a bit longer.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.450
So all of these
groups of aphrodisiacs

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.810
provide the body with
something that it's missing.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.690
If your body is
cold, you heat it up.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:08.050
If your body lacks wind, you
eat things that give more wind.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.370
And this is in the
humor model tends

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.260
to be called "curing
by contraries."

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.270
So you give something
of the opposite quality

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.940
to the disorder, and
it will help cure it.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.690
But there's one
group of aphrodisiacs

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.550
that function under
another model,

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.752
and this model is often
curing through sympathy

00:36:23.752 --> 00:36:25.960
and is sometimes called "the
doctrine of signatures."

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.680
Has anyone hear
that term before?

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.280
So the doctrine of
signatures basically

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.210
outlines that you
can identify what

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.030
something is good for by
the signature it bears.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.630
So what does it look like?

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.460
And what is it similar to?

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.900
And the most famous-- I'll
leave you with that picture

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.630
while you think
about that phrase.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.040
So under the doctrine
of signatures,

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.550
anything plant-based
that's of a phallic shape

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:56.310
is going to work for
an aphrodisiac process

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.270
and to help conception.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.310
And this plant, you can
see on the board here,

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.130
is called satyrion.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.020
It's also called dogstones.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.085
It's a type of orchid.

00:37:05.085 --> 00:37:06.460
And there's a
whole set them that

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.484
are called foolstones,
foxstones, dogstones.

00:37:09.484 --> 00:37:11.150
And if you remember
I mentioned earlier,

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.660
stones is their
word for testicles.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.795
And so this plant is
famous in the 17th century

00:37:16.795 --> 00:37:18.370
for being an aphrodisiac.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.600
It's got a tool, fleshy, erect
stem, as they describe it,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.360
a nice bulbous head on the top,
and two bulbous little balls

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.070
at the bottom covered in
roots that look like hairs.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.850
So its signature was very clear.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.330
And Richard Bunworth,
who is a commentator

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:34.230
on the doctrine of
signatures, argues

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.660
that "the roots of
satyrion, or dogstones,

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.210
represent the
testicles in figure

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.240
and are famous for their
[INAUDIBLE] stimulation

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.670
to venery.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:46.354
While Oswald Croll, a writer
on chemistry and medicine,

00:37:46.354 --> 00:37:48.270
also talking about the
doctrine of signatures,

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:51.330
stated that this was so potent
that it worked even if you just

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.860
held it in your hand.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.615
You didn't even have
to consume this one.

00:37:54.615 --> 00:37:56.010
It's that good.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.480
So I think we can
all see why that

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.290
functions under the
doctrine of signatures.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:01.789
It's quite clear
what it looks like.

00:38:01.789 --> 00:38:04.938
But there are also some
more add and unusual ones.

00:38:04.938 --> 00:38:09.410
Beans-- now, to me, beans
don't look particularly

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.040
like any part of the
reproductive organs.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.680
But for people in the
17th and 18th century,

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.310
they look like the
glans of the penis,

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.230
so the very end of the penis,
and that's why they work.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.730
So William Salmon, who wrote
a book called "Botanologia"

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:25.990
in 1710, informed his readers
that "a strong broth of beans

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.130
stirred up lust and
was good for impotency

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.290
in the male kind who
have not the power

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.770
to use the act of generation,
both because they're

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.340
nutritious," and
we've seen already

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.570
they're windy, but, quote, "by
reason, the bean, especially

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.420
the field kind,
has the signature

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.980
of the glans of the penis.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.100
And for that reason,
Pythagoras and his followers

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.850
judge them to be
provokers of lust."

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.940
What I think is really
interesting is outside

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.065
of these ones that resemble
the glans of the penis,

00:38:51.065 --> 00:38:53.250
most aphrodisiacs
by signature relate

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.394
to looking like the testicles.

00:38:55.394 --> 00:38:57.810
And I think again here, you
can see the really close link.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.700
This isn't just about sex.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.590
Because if you're
augmenting the testicles,

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.720
you're augmenting the
thing that produces seed,

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.800
and seed is fundamental
for conception.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.730
So even when it looks
like they're just

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.590
talking about sex and
sexual pleasure and desire,

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:14.420
they're still talking about
conception and reproduction.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.845
Now, it wasn't just
plants you could

00:39:16.845 --> 00:39:19.890
eat under the doctrine
of signatures.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.670
Apologies-- this
is slightly gross.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.860
Animal genitalia were a popular
aphrodisiac at this time.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.200
The testicles and the pizzle, or
penis, of bulls, boars, goats,

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.610
and stags were all recommended.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.070
Goats were often described
as a lascivious goat,

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.730
even in medical texts.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.190
They say take the stones
of a lascivious goat.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.770
According to the Oxford
English Dictionary,

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.762
a lecherous goat is still
a phrase and used now.

00:39:44.762 --> 00:39:46.970
I haven't heard it any time
recently, but apparently.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:51.550
So you can all call people
lecherous goats if you need to.

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.580
While I think stags,
bulls, and boars were all

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.860
a bit more obvious,
they're all seen

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.030
as quite potent, quite virile
animals, particularly stags--

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:02.650
and stag horns as
well also work--

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.070
perhaps a bit more
unusually, you

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.070
could also eat the brains
of these creatures.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.936
So creatures thought to be
particularly lascivious,

00:40:08.936 --> 00:40:10.810
you consume their brains,
and it will provoke

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.320
you to think in the same way.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.790
So Nicholas Culpepper wrote
that "whatsoever any creature

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.630
is addicted extremely to, they
move the man that eats them

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:20.350
to the like.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:24.300
Therefore, partridges,
quails, sparrows, et cetera,

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.490
being exceedingly
addicted to venery,

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.970
they work the same in those
men and women who eat them.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:33.220
Now, I kind of expected
rabbits to make an appearance

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.570
in this category,
given their reputation.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.910
And sometimes they'll recommend
the womb of a hare for women

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.100
to eat for conception
purposes, but very

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.280
rarely for aphrodisiacs.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.110
So it's very rarely connected
to the kind of desire,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.150
pleasure side of things.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.670
So poor rabbits clearly
developed their reputation

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.480
slightly later than this.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.460
So those are the main types of
aphrodisiac that were in use

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.920
or were being discussed by
medical writers at this time.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.700
And hopefully what you can
see is there's an awful lot

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.880
to choose from.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.260
And within that, there's
a whole range of things

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.930
that you could grow in the
garden, so carrots and parsnips

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.330
and onions, things you
could get in hedge rows,

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.620
like nettles, right the
way through to things

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.280
that are more expensive,
like cinnamon and saffron.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.650
So they're really making
sure they cater to everybody

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.515
and all social classes.

00:41:21.515 --> 00:41:23.140
But you might be
sitting here thinking,

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.348
this is all well and good,
but they're medical texts.

00:41:25.348 --> 00:41:27.360
They're supposed to
talk about diseases.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.310
And did people outside
of those circles

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:33.120
really think in
these kinds of ways?

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.670
So I want to kind
of try and prove

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.570
to you that it's a
widespread understanding,

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:42.140
and it's not just sad medical
men writing in their books that

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.810
thought this way.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.680
And early modern England is
quite consistently recognized

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.430
as an era where
people are expected

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.070
to know about their bodies,
to know about their health.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:55.150
That's a nice little Latin
phrase, nosce te ipsum,

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:59.155
know thyself, which underpins
the idea that you should really

00:41:59.155 --> 00:42:02.660
understand your body, understand
how to keep it healthy.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.596
Physicians are also
really expensive,

00:42:04.596 --> 00:42:07.220
so it's in your best interest to
know how to cure your own body

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.640
and how to help it.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.220
And we can see, therefore, that
people know the humoral model

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.870
quite well and they know
their medicine quite well.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.297
And we see it in
both directions.

00:42:17.297 --> 00:42:19.130
So it's not just that
everyday people listen

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:20.670
to what medical writers say.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.549
Medical writers also pick up
top tips from everyday people

00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:25.840
and record them in their books.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.850
So occasionally you'll
see them saying, oh,

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:29.695
whoever it is down the
road is using this,

00:42:29.695 --> 00:42:31.070
and it seems to
work really well,

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.290
and they incorporate
that into their own text.

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.470
So it's quite a broad
medical culture.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.460
It's not too specialized.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.440
And we can see
this in particular

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.330
if we turn to ballads.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.070
And ballads, unfortunately
not power ballads

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.290
like the '80s, but
similar principle.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.210
Songs with a story
to them are printed

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.510
throughout the 17th century.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.032
They're printed very cheaply.

00:42:55.032 --> 00:42:55.990
They do look like this.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.610
They're one side of
a sheet of paper.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.100
They're normally only a
couple of pence to buy.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.801
And one historian has estimated
that three to four million

00:43:02.801 --> 00:43:05.300
of these were printed in the
second half of the 17th century

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.090
alone.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:10.310
And they always deal with kind
of popular themes and notions.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.650
And if we look at these
songs and these ballads,

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.360
we see there's a whole
grouping that are completely

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.120
obsessed with inadequate
husbands and impotent men

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.690
and men whose
wives cheat on them

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:24.290
and so make them into cuckolds.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:25.960
And what we see in
several of these

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.580
is that the wives of these
insufficient husbands

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.680
turn to aphrodisiacs in
order to try and ameliorate

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.320
their plights and make
their lives a little better.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.950
So the wife who is the main
character in "The London

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.520
Cuckold," printed in
the 1680s, explained

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.160
that she gave her husband
a whole series of things

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.760
to try and make him better.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.190
"She gave him kisses and
sack posset very good.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.810
Cordial, too, she never
misses, for they warm and heat

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:50.600
the blood.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.030
Such things will create desire
and new kindle Cupid's fire.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.670
These things make
his kiss his wife

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.500
and call her love and life."

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.050
And sack posset is cream
with spices and eggs in it.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:05.205
And cordial is a bit like mulled
wine but thicker and with oats.

00:44:05.205 --> 00:44:09.820
It's kind of like a winey
gruel type of thing.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.870
Another ballad,
"The Woman's Brawl,"

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.350
which I think is a great
title, included a section

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.780
where the protagonist, Doll,
complained about her husband

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:17.800
to a neighbor.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.170
And she said of him.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.350
"Thou unnatural clown,
thou, feeble dick,

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.090
thou, as I'm an honest women
neighbor, I went like a fool

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.570
and made him a cordial
with turkey eggs

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.260
and afterwards a tansy with
new-laid eggs from a hen

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.820
trod by gamecock.

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.070
I put comfrey and clary in and
fed him lamb stones, caviar,

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.390
and potato pies, yet he could
do no more good to a woman

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:39.140
than a boy of a year old."

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:42.099
She's not very happy
with him in this ballad.

00:44:42.099 --> 00:44:43.640
What I think is
really interesting is

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.472
in medical texts, aphrodisiacs
are thought to work.

00:44:46.472 --> 00:44:47.930
And in all of these
kinds of texts,

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.660
quite often they don't work.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.990
And I think predominantly,
this is because it's funnier

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.930
if they don't work.

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:54.780
And they work better
for the kind of genre

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.490
if they don't succeed in
making the husband particularly

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.015
lusty or fertile.

00:45:01.015 --> 00:45:03.140
But both of those ballads
I just spoke to you about

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.930
were about importance and about
sex and about sexual pleasure.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.590
But if we look deeper, we
can again see this connection

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.570
to reproduction and conception.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.510
So the plot of "The
Contempted Cuckold"

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:17.470
focuses on a bridegroom
whose new father-in-law

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:20.470
promises to pay him quite
a substantial sum of money

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.470
on the birth of
their first child.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.680
And the poor man
after seven years

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.620
still doesn't have a
child and importantly

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.530
hasn't received his payment.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:32.550
But he's now being ridiculed
by the people in the community.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.360
And the ballad runs as follows.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.860
"There was no hopes
of an heir being born.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.800
Therefore, he was
much discontented.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.640
All his old cronies
did laugh him to scorn.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.010
Alas, he was daily tormented."

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.780
And likewise, a
pamphlet that describes

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.450
some of these stories, the
title is "A Fumbler's Hall

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:50.687
at Doolittle Lane."

00:45:50.687 --> 00:45:52.270
They were great with
their euphemisms.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.514
It's not a difficult
one to work out.

00:45:54.514 --> 00:45:56.680
There's a whole series of
women in this pamphlet who

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.140
moan that their husbands
aren't quite good enough.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.930
And one of them
claims that she's now

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.550
being exposed to the taunts
and jeers of my neighbor, who

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.390
called me Barren Doe.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.620
And she thinks this is
completely unacceptable

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.390
and she should be allowed
to seek another husband.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.240
So when you look at
popular literature,

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.640
you can still see this
connection, this understanding

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.490
that an aphrodisiac would work
not just to improve your sex

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.640
life, but to improve your
chances of being a parent.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.660
And this was really
important, because children

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.670
in the early modern period
are an outward display,

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:28.970
they're an outward sign, that
you are virile and potent

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.550
if you're a man, which is
important for masculinity.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.240
And for women, having
a child is the moment

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.280
when you're kind of brought
into the circle of local married

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.410
women and mothers,
and you're allowed

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:41.950
to attend gossips
and childbirths.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:45.210
And so it really cements your
standing in the community.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.070
And so if you look
at court cases,

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.385
you can also see why
aphrodisiacs would

00:46:49.385 --> 00:46:51.200
have becomes so important.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.200
And Laura Gowing, who's a
historian at King's, has

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.054
found a couple of cases
of sexual defamation being

00:46:57.054 --> 00:46:58.720
brought to courts,
where it's not really

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.530
about the sexual aspect.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:01.910
It's about fertility.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.990
And so there's a woman in London
who brings a case of defamation

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.120
against her neighbor
because the neighbor said,

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.840
I have 10 children, and
thou hath never a one.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.820
And that was seen as a
slander on her reputation.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.014
Likewise, a man in
Essex sued his neighbor

00:47:16.014 --> 00:47:17.430
because the neighbor
had said they

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:19.640
had no prick to get a child.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.840
And so children
are very important.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:26.044
And hopefully that will help
you understand why aphrodisiacs

00:47:26.044 --> 00:47:27.210
are slightly more medicinal.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.620
We tend to think of them as
sexual curiosities, I think,

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.369
but for people in the
early modern period,

00:47:35.369 --> 00:47:36.990
they can be things
that really matter.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.090
They are a medicine
that can help you change

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:41.140
your status in the community.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.680
And I'd like to finish today
by contradicting everything

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.620
I've just said by pointing
out that although this was

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:52.030
the predominant understanding,
aphrodisiacs are still things

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.990
that provoke lust,
and not everybody's

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.181
a good follower of medical
advice in the 17th century.

00:47:58.181 --> 00:47:59.930
And so people do use
them in ways that are

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.910
considered to be inappropriate.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:07.360
And this is one of my
favorites, an advert listed

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.890
in "Harris' List of Covent
Garden Ladies," which

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.280
was a book detailing all
the prostitutes working

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.300
in the area, revealed
that there was

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.160
at least one prostitute with
a very unique selling point.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:20.640
"A Miss Bland of
Wardour Street, Soho,

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.410
is a gay, volatile girl,
very genteel in her person,

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.070
and has an extraordinary
titillation in all her members,

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.300
which she's very
fond of increasing

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:31.010
by making use of provocatives
for that purpose,

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:34.890
such as pullets, pigs, veal,
new-laid eggs, oysters, crabs,

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.745
prawns, eryngos,
[INAUDIBLE]," et

00:48:37.745 --> 00:48:39.410
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:41.910
"She's reported to have
a kind of savage joy

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.160
in her embraces and
sometimes leaves

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.910
the marks of her penetrating
teeth on her paramour's

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.720
cheeks."

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.030
And medical writers,
too, were aware

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.780
that people could use these
things in the wrong way.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.220
And so John Martin,
who we met earlier,

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.700
cautioned people that
old lechers, thinking

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.490
to improve their former
prowess, and young gallants

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.700
willing to marry
their Mrs. Goodwill,

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:07.530
do oftentimes misapply
those medicines.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.530
And likewise, as I've
already suggested,

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:12.070
Contharides were
particularly dangerous,

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:15.307
and people liked to
warn against their use.

00:49:15.307 --> 00:49:17.640
And this was in part because
they're dangerous, but also

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.490
because they're being used for
the wrong types of purposes.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.720
And John Quincy warned his
readers with the story of a man

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.120
who, taking a large
does inwardly,

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.510
"so inflamed himself, that
he almost killed his wife,

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.570
and yet continued, even in
distraction, with a fresh rage

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.070
until he died, delirious."

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:39.550
And in one murder trial that
reached the Old Bailey in 1739,

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.320
Catherine Demay was
accused of having

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.890
put Contharides in the
coffee of a young man living

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.010
in her house.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.430
And given their
reputation, many people

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.380
felt it necessary to
say to the courts,

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.110
she wasn't trying to seduce him.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.470
That's not what it was about.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.360
She was using them as a poison.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.470
And so they crop up.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:59.110
Aphrodisiacs crop up in a lot
of places in a lot of ways

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.490
that theologians
and medical writers

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:03.873
would have deemed
completely inappropriate.

00:50:03.873 --> 00:50:06.910
But having said that, I
think if we expand our minds

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.680
and stop thinking
about modern mindset,

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.827
we can see that sex in the past
is quite different for people.

00:50:12.827 --> 00:50:14.410
They think about it
in different ways.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.391
And in this era, it's
mostly about having a baby,

00:50:17.391 --> 00:50:19.390
even when you're enjoying
something as frivolous

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:20.490
as an aphrodisiac.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.618
So thank you very much.

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:25.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:26.266 --> 00:50:27.474
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Jen.

00:50:27.474 --> 00:50:29.099
We have time for a
couple of questions.

00:50:31.978 --> 00:50:33.882
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned stag horns.

00:50:33.882 --> 00:50:35.092
Did people eat stag horns?

00:50:35.092 --> 00:50:37.050
MALE SPEAKER: Can you
repeat the question back.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.340
JENNIFER EVANS: Yes, so
people did eat stag horns.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.050
They come up quite often,
actually, in medical texts.

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:47.140
And I know that people
in the modern era

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.110
have also tried them.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:50.720
AUDIENCE: And that's not
a euphemism, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.815
JENNIFER EVANS: No, they
don't bother with euphemisms.

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.700
So if they want you
to eat a stag's penis,

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.610
they'll say stag pizzle.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.680
And one medical text I love
says stag pizzle, brackets,

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.340
if you can't get
that, a bull will do.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.292
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.756
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.450
JENNIFER EVANS: Yeah, so
wealth and aphrodisiacs

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:19.090
is really interesting, because
you would think that the lower

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:21.495
classes are on a poorer diet,
so their libido is probably

00:51:21.495 --> 00:51:24.120
going to be lower anyway because
they're not as well nourished.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.610
But the upper classes,
and particularly

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:29.590
in the late 17th century,
early 18th century,

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:33.180
people are just so worried
about luxury and excess.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.610
They think it's actually
damaging the upper classes'

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:36.490
libidos.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:40.300
Because they become quite
fat and gross and large.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.240
Gross in their sense, not in
our modern sense, in case people

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.530
think I'm being really
rude about people.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.550
So they worried, actually,
eating too much sugar,

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.200
too much salt, too much fat,
is actually quite damaging

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.700
to the upper classes.

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.390
And there's a bit of concern
in the early 18th century

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.840
that the nobility
are going to be

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.760
out-bred by the lower classes.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.280
And you can't have that,
because then there's

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.460
a power struggle going on there.

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.720
And there's lots of nice
stories about milk maids

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.610
who are incredibly lusty
and fertile and wonderful,

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:13.450
while these weak, pale
women in the upper classes

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:14.777
can't bear enough children.

00:52:14.777 --> 00:52:17.360
And of course, part of that is
prompted by the royal families,

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.910
because they often have
trouble conceiving children.

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:22.950
And so people see the
problems the nobility

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.880
are having with
their child-bearing.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.909
But there are
aphrodisiacs for everyone.

00:52:27.909 --> 00:52:29.700
You've got things in
the hedge row and then

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.260
really expensive things.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:34.570
I've only come across
one recipe where it says,

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:36.640
if you're wealthy, take this.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.500
If you're poorer, then
substitute X, Y, and Z

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.610
in with cheaper things.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:45.010
So I think it's a case of
adapting to your own means what

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:45.510
you've got.

00:52:48.712 --> 00:52:49.628
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:01.699 --> 00:53:03.240
JENNIFER EVANS: It's
difficult to see

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.720
if there are things that are
recommended that are unhealthy

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.030
now, because medical texts-- I
mean, one of the things I found

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.030
is they recommend
pretty much everything

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.030
at one point or another.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:14.930
Someone will say everything.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:20.120
Other than tea, which is never
an aphrodisiac, and coffee,

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.550
which causes impotence, other
than those things, nearly

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.360
everything is recommended
at various points.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.360
And the problems with
diet for the lower classes

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.970
is lack of meat.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:34.030
So they don't have
as much meat to eat,

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:35.384
which is possibly quite healthy.

00:53:35.384 --> 00:53:37.300
But given how much manual
labor they're doing,

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.280
they need the caloric intake.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.070
For the upper classes, health
becomes a serious problem,

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:44.369
because when sugar
is introduced,

00:53:44.369 --> 00:53:46.160
they start eating a
lot more sugar and fat,

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.890
and gout becomes incredibly
prevalent amongst the upper

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:52.180
classes, particularly for men.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.840
And so there are
lots of health issues

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.380
connected to the very sumptuous,
luxurious upper class diet.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.120
And there are some
people in this era

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.300
who are recommending
vegetarianism

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.890
as the most healthy diet.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:07.490
So they are concerned about
health and what they eat.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:13.430
But I don't think they
recommend anything

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.610
that we necessarily
would think was super

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.050
dangerous as a normal food.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.240
So they recommend dangerous
things like pennyroyal,

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.700
but they're to provoke
miscarriages and abortions.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.240
And they're still
today dangerous

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.240
because they provoke
miscarriages and abortions.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.804
So they know what quite
a lot of things do.

00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:31.720
I'm not sure I really
answered that very well.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.155
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] I'll
finish with one final question.

00:54:40.155 --> 00:54:43.180
What did you find was the
most unbelievable example

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.070
of an aphrodisiac?

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:45.869
What could you not believe?

00:54:45.869 --> 00:54:48.160
JENNIFER EVANS: I couldn't
believe quite a lot of them,

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:48.659
actually.

00:54:48.659 --> 00:54:51.450
But parsnips kept coming up
over and over and over again.

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:52.780
And I was like, it's a parsnip.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:56.780
And parsnips kept coming up
because they're nutritious.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.820
But they would append on to
it, oh, the lower classes

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.820
eat a lot of parsnips,
and they're good.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:06.390
And potatoes also came up
in one text with the comment

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:07.890
that the Irish eat
a lot of potatoes

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:12.240
and have a lot of children,
so clearly they work.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.660
I think the most-- the
brains of the small birds.

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.930
I can't really see modern
bandwagon building up

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:23.425
around eating bird
brains as an aphrodisiac.

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:30.990
There was nothing outrageously
outrageous, I don't think.

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.746
But all of them are
a little bit odd.

00:55:33.746 --> 00:55:35.870
AUDIENCE: Well, join me in
thanking Jen, everybody.

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:39.820
[APPLAUSE]
