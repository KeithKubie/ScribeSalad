00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.940
- [Instructor] What we have
here is a visual depiction

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.170
of a function.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.170
And this is a depiction
of Y is equal to H of X.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.616
Now when a lot of people see
function notation like this

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:17.203
they see it as somewhat
intimidating until you realize

00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:18.790
what it's saying.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.000
All a function is, is
something that takes an input,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.160
in this case it's taking X as
an input and then the function

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.050
does something to it and then
it spits out some other value

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.450
which is going to be equal to Y.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.450
So for example what is H
of four based on this graph

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.710
that you see right over here?

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.230
Pause this video and think through that.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.050
Well all H of four means
is when I input four

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.050
into my function H what
Y am I spitting out?

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.289
Or another way to think about
it, when X is equal to four,

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.452
what is Y equal to?

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:04.452
Well when X is equal to four,
my function spits out that Y

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.440
is equal to three.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.780
We know that from this
point right over here, so Y

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.560
is equal to three, so H
of four is equal to three.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.810
Let's do another example.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.850
What is H of zero?

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.530
Pause the video try to work that through.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.600
Well all this is saying is
if I input an X equals zero

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.780
into the function what is going
to be the corresponding Y?

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.780
Well when X equals zero we
see that Y is equal to four.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.160
So it's as simple as that.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.720
Given the input what is
going to be the output?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.460
And that's what these points
represent, each of these points

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.680
represent a different
output for a given input.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.670
Now it's always good to keep
in mind one of the things

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.370
that makes it a function is
that for given X that you input

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.940
you only get one Y.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.380
For example if we had two dots
here, then all of a sudden

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.510
or we have two dots for X
equals six, now all of a sudden

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.370
we have a problem
figuring out what H of six

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.153
would be equal to because
it could be equal to one

00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:11.760
or it could be equal to three.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.410
So if we had this extra dot
here, then this would no longer

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.670
be a function.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.441
In order for it to be a
function for any given X,

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:22.750
it has to output a unique
value, it can't output

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.385
two possible values.

00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:27.190
Now the other way is possible.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.630
It is possible to have two
different X's that output

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.890
the same value.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.890
For example, if this was circled
in what would H of negative

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.049
four be?

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.490
Well H of negative four when
X is equal to negative four,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.870
you put that into our function
it looks like the function

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.500
would output two.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.160
So H of negative four
would be equal to two.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.550
But H of two is also equal
to we see very clearly there,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.710
when we input a two into the
function, the corresponding Y

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.100
value is two as well.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.750
So it's okay for two
different X values to map

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.200
to the same Y value that works.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.310
But if you had some type of
an arrangement, some type

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.311
of a relationship where
for a given X value you had

00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:14.090
two different Y values,
then that would no longer

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.080
be a function.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.720
But the example they gave
us is a function assuming

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.803
I don't modify it.
