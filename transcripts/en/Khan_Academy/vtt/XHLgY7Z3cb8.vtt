00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.930
Let's see if we can
write 3/5 as a decimal.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.640
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.940
and think about if you
can do it on your own.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.470
And I'll give you a hint here.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.690
Can we rewrite this
fraction so, instead

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.370
of it being in terms of fifths,
it can be in terms of tenths?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.570
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.930
Let's try to rewrite this
as a fraction with 10

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.150
as the denominator.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.340
But let's just first
visualize this.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.405
So we have fifths.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.995
So let's say that's 1/5.

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:35.830
Actually, let me just
copy and paste this.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.720
That is 2/5.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.850
That is 3/5, and that is 4/5.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.610
And that is 5/5, or this
would be a whole now.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.970
So that is our whole.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.980
And we want to color
in 3 of those 5,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.920
so we want to think
about what 3/5 are.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.070
So let me get my magenta out.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.110
So that's 1/5.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.570
I can actually make this
bigger even-- 2/5 and 3/5.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.190
There you go.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.530
Color that in.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.000
That is 3/5.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.170
Now, how could I
write this in terms

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.470
of tenths-- instead of 3/5,
a certain number of tenths?

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.900
Well, let's split this
whole into tenths.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.010
And the easiest way to
split this whole into tenths

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.010
is to take each of those
fifths and turn them into 2/10.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.360
So let's do that.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.160
So If we were to do
this right over here,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.470
we now have twice
as many sections.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.600
So another way of
thinking about it,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.260
we are multiplying the
number of sections by 2.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.340
We now have 10 sections.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.460
Each of these is a tenth.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.970
And the 3 of those sections are
now going to be twice as many.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.460
What we have in magenta, we
now have twice as many sections

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.000
in magenta.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.800
So we're going to multiply
that by 2 as well.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.390
Notice we just multiplied the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.190
by 2.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.150
But hopefully it makes
conceptual sense.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.500
Every piece, when we're
talking about fifths,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.720
we've now doubled so
that instead of every 1/5

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.690
is now 2/10.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.990
You have a 1/10
now and a 1/10 now.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.960
And we could just keep
writing 1/10 if we like.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.130
Each of these things right
over here are a tenth.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.150
And then each of the 3 are
now twice as many tenths.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.400
So the 3/5 is now 6/10.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.200
So let's write that down.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.256
So this is going to
be equal to 6/10.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.320
Now why is this interesting?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:59.400
You can literally
view this as 6/10--

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.055
let me write it this
way-- 6 times 1/10.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.340
I'm going to do that in blue.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.130
6 times 1/10.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.360
Well what's another way to
represent 6/10 or 6 times 1/10?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.440
Well you can express
that as a decimal,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.220
where we go to the tenths place.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.820
So when you write a
decimal-- so let's

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.180
see 0 point-- the place
right to the right

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.130
of the decimal, that
is the tenths place.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.340
This right over
here is the ones.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.220
That right over
here is the tenths.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.730
That's the tenths place.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.090
So how many tenths do we have?

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.380
We have six tenths.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.260
So we could write this as 0.6.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.220
So there you have it.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.130
Let me write that.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.940
This is equal to 0.6.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.150
And we're done.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.360
We've just expressed
this as a decimal.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.200
0.6 is the same
thing as 6/10, which

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.770
could be rewritten
as 3/5 or vice versa.
