RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.190
Hey there, and welcome to this
week's Android Developer

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.750
Office Hours.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.140
It's just the two
of us this week.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.930
Myself, Richard Hyndman, and--

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.190
CHRIS BANES: Chris Banes.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.050
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Nick's slacking
off on holiday, and

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.770
Stephan Linzner is doing a
talk in Germany today.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.760
GDG Munich I'd like to say.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.150
CHRIS BANES: I don't know.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.315
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It
must be GDG Munich

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:26.600
followed by GDG Berlin.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
And there's a hackathon in
Berlin on the weekend and then

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.340
Droidcon Berlin on Monday
and Tuesday next week.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.320
Ah, Moritz, you going
to be there?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.630
MORITZ: Yup.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.520
Also Droidcon in Berlin.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.080
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Excellent
I'll see you there.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.225
I'm heading out for Monday
and Tuesday as well.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:39.890
MORITZ: Oh, cool.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.040
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I've never
actually been to a Berlin

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.550
Droidcon before.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.050
I made a few of them,
the UK ones and the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.720
Dutch ones but never--

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.330
CHRIS BANES: That's
the original.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.850
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The original.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.990
Probably going to have a nice
new building for it

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.870
this year as well.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.120
CHRIS BANES: Awesome.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.960
MORITZ: Yeah, the last one
was not very good.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.130
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The last
one wasn't really--

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.660
you can't say that.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.740
You never know who's watching.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.240
MORITZ: Trying to help.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.526
RICHARD HYNDMAN: RICHARD
HYNDMAN: effort.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:04.330
Anyway, as usual, we'll be
taking about Android

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.450
development topics, and we won't
be answering questions

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.750
on unreleased features,
things like that.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.160
Also, as usual, Joseppi
has also joined us.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.850
Hey Joseppi, good to see you.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.370
And Yossi of course.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.325
Hey there.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.740
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Hi guys.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.600
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.470
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.440
RICHARD HYNDMAN: If you've
got one ready, let's--

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.657
CHRIS BANES: First question.

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:23.370
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --jump
straight in.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.900
CHRIS BANES: Let's
do this one.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.840
Cameron from the US has asked,
is the preferred way to do

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.170
HTTP calls still have to
use HttpURLConnection?

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.710
Because he apparently
seen some flakiness

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.180
in some corner cases.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.690
Yes.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.910
So since ICS changed from the
Apache HTTP library-- but the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.640
preferred way to do it is move
from the Apache library to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.380
HttpURLConnection, and that
hasn't changed since.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.030
There's a good blog post by
Jesse Wilson from about two

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.730
years ago which tells why and
explains the reasons.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.965
And so yeah, there's not
much-- there's no

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:03.886
update to it really.

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:07.104
That's they way to go forward.

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:08.940
Yeah.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.449
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.130
is the way to go
forward right?

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.690
Yeah.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.490
MORITZ: Sorry, I don't want to
have captured the situation,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.475
but I've also got a question
about the URLConnection.

00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:20.100
Can I skim in?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.395
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Please do.

00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:21.930
CHRIS BANES: Yeah sure.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.660
MORITZ: We've got also one
of those corner cases.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.710
And the situation is that when
we do a post request with the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.110
URLConnection and we wait for a
couple of minutes, like four

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.280
minutes, and we do the next post
request, the request is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.450
sent twice.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.610
The server receives the request
twice only after those

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.180
four minutes.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.720
If we do the next request
immediately,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.860
it's working fine.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.880
But after four minutes, in a
window of like four to six

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.060
minutes, it repeats
the request twice.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.090
And after 10 minutes or so
it works fine again.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.100
Is there anything which we
should take care of?

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.362
RICHARD HYNDMAN: That's
a really strange one.

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:07.180
Have you looked on Stack
Overflow for that, see if

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.520
other people are suffering
from the same issue?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.520
MORITZ: We had the one person
who had the same issue, but

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.870
the answers did not
really suffice.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.770
CHRIS BANES: From what I
remember, HttpURLConnection

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.880
uses a pool of connections,
so--

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.880
I don't know.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.660
Maybe some flaking has
to do with queueing.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.760
It sounds like a bug if
it is doing this.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.990
There's nothing I can
really think of.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.220
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Moritz, is it
on a specific API version?

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.600
MORITZ: We had it from four to
one app works, and we're not

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.870
sure about the lower
version numbers.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.570
CHRIS BANES: The best thing
to do is file a bug on

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.870
betandroid.com.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.430
And set me a link if
you can on Google+,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.590
and I'll have a look.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.410
MORITZ: OK.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.490
Also, is there maybe something
related to the radio shutting

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.680
down and going into sleep
mode at some point?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.170
Or is that unrelated?

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.320
CHRIS BANES: See I'd have
thought you'd have got a

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.180
exception back saying, no
internet connection or

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.230
if that was happening.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.160
So it sounds like there's some
sort of queueing going on

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.940
somewhere where it's just--

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.640
you've got the connection for
it, but it's not actually

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.790
following the connection.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.630
And then the next time it
happens, it queues them off

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.730
and sends them all through.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.770
But either way it sounds
like a bug to me.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.820
MORITZ: OK, I will follow up
on you with Stack Overflow.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.080
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
sounds good.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.330
MORITZ: Thank you.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.650
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Does anyone
else from inside the Hangout

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.290
have a question?

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.540
Can we carry on?

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.450
OK.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.010
Someone was asking--

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.350
Alex, from Israel is asking,
how to turn off the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.960
auto-translate feature
for comments in

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.000
the developer console.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.040
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
I saw that just--

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.470
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.140
Why?

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.510
Why would you want to?

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.840
Do you know all the languages?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.220
This is only something you
see yourself right?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.650
auto-translate feature.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.110
I just tried to bring mine up,
but I have to sign into a

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.110
different account.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.530
If it's not an obvious option,
then maybe we didn't think

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.320
about turning it off.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.450
But strange, usually
it's an opt in.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.360
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, usually
it's a one

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.330
time thing isn't it?

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.660
You put in your natural language
then press the

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.080
button, and it also translates
to everything.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.020
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes, I'm going
to log in and try it.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.690
CHRIS BANES: OK.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.940
I'll look at a question.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.960
So this is a good one.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.050
So Scienza--

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.730
I don't think I pronounced that
right-- had asked, how do

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.380
you in the Google+ app--

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.130
the animated GIFs--

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.700
so how is it sort of
been able to decode

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.780
them and display them.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.370
So if you have a look--

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.870
I'm not sure the actual
exact way they do it.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.290
But if you have a look at the
Google+ Settings app in the

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.811
settings, at the bottom
there's an open

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:55.620
source library section.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.400
And what they actually
use to decode the GIF

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.160
is listed in there.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.410
So it's an open source
class which you can

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.700
download and use yourself.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.775
To actually display it, I'm
not entirely sure how

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:07.080
they're doing it.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.090
But I'm guessing there's a
runnable, which updates an

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.800
image view or something
like that.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.140
So yeah, really.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.920
But it's not-- actually
no it's probably not.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.940
I know [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.250
supported in the frameworks.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.110
You have to do it yourself.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.250
But that's how you do it.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.700
MALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.770
CHRIS BANES: Have you found
the translate thing?

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.140
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, you can
turn it off on a per comment

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.890
basis, so you get no--

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.780
JOSEPPI: Probably I
can ask question?

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.280
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Underneath
the--

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.870
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.530
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.180
JOSEPPI: Well, as everybody
know, hackers are working too

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.530
much on the--

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.050
you smile because all worries
on this matter, but this is

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.870
very important for us.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.530
Hackers are working on some
place or [? mode ?]

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.720
and around the web, but we can
find many, many APK that

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.510
install a fake store.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:10.390
I have developed myself some
sign to check on server site.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:18.290
So when the fake market store
returns the result--

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.860
and this market we
know that they

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.870
always returned licensed--

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.470
I get the sign [? through ?]

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.790
and send to the server and
compare it to the public key

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.680
from back server, from
Google panel.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.630
This is correct?

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.260
Or do you think that the method
that I am using it's

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.660
hard to work around?

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.910
To go around?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.920
The sign to check I mean,
it's a good system?

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.190
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.310
What I would recommend the most
is to do the check on

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.500
your servers if possible, and
then only give access to the

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.920
content inside the application
once your server has validated

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.790
that the user should have
access to the content.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.040
So if you can pass the signed
message back to your server,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.100
then it means-- when you get to
this level of security, it

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.610
means that the hackers have
to individually hack you

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.520
application as opposed
to using some generic

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.530
hacks that may work--

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.900
JOSEPPI: They have to work
especially on the application.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.200
They cannot use the automatic
[INAUDIBLE] software.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.660
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Exactly.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.270
So then they're working against
you directly to hack

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.960
your application, and then you
have control over the--

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.190
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.090
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --applications
to fix the

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:29.730
hacks and--

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.760
JOSEPPI: More hard, more
hard, more hard.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.860
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, but this is the hardest

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.559
for them to achieve the value of
freeing your application or

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.990
making your application free.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.550
If they can make a lot of
applications free with one

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.690
hack, then obviously that's
a lot easier for them.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.030
JOSEPPI: But Richard, the
question is the following.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.720
Because to check the license and
then get back the response

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.390
et cetera, et cetera, many times
depends on the distance

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.330
between our European server and
the final customer that

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.360
probably is in Australia, OK?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.740
This takes time in the license
check purchase.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.160
So what is the problem?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.880
The problem is--

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.170
JOSEPPI: The problem
is that I would

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.490
like to store it somewhere.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.990
The first answer of the
licensed check.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.670
So once the licensed check is
approved and I'm sure that the

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.700
sign too is fine, I would
like to store somewhere.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.780
OK, next time, don't check the
license again, and almost two,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.560
three second to check
the license.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.870
Is there any, any kind of
storing system that we can use

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.160
to save the data safely?

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.930
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Sure we do.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.315
JOSEPPI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:52.350
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
most recently against storing

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.730
data on Android.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.920
And you can get to a point
where again, you're in a

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.450
position where the hacker
would have to hack your

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.910
individual application quite
hard to get access to it.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.860
There's a recent blog post on
the Android developer's blog,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.140
learn how to secure data.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.280
Of course, if the user has route
access, they can get

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.030
access to the data.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.335
But then if it's encrypted and
we give you guidelines on how

00:10:11.335 --> 00:10:13.630
to encrypt it, then they'd
have to unencrypt it.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.620
And then they've got
to hack your

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.710
application to find the key.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.860
And if you use a salt as well,
and you store that salt,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.120
encrypt it as well and you know,
there's a few different

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.854
things you can do to make it
harder and harder and harder

00:10:22.854 --> 00:10:23.820
for someone to get
access to it.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.740
JOSEPPI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.200
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Right.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.090
JOSEPPI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.570
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And if you're
changing the key with each

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.400
time someone starts the app,
then it's even harder.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.930
There's a lot of things
you can do.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:37.020
But we did a blog post on it
recently about the best ways

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.255
to secure data on Android.

00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:41.100
But of course, if you have a
very dedicated hacker who

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.080
really, really wants to get
access to that data, then--

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.510
and you know, they've got the
resources to do it, then they

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.400
can do it on any system.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.730
It's not an Android issue.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.300
JOSEPPI: Of course.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.620
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's a
computing issue, right?

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.390
JOSEPPI: Of course.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.790
RICHARD HYNDMAN: But just make
it as hard as you can for them

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.530
to get access to it.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.100
But have a look at
the blog post.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.240
There's some very good
recommendation for--

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.580
and sample code for
quite simple ways

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.820
to secure your data.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.170
Which will make it much
harder for hackers.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.710
JOSEPPI: What if you happen to
have the link probably you can

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.370
put in chat for me.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.280
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Sure.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.025
Yeah, it was like three
posts ago on the

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:10.822
Android developer blog.

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:11.170
CHRIS BANES: Yes, I agree.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.981
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'll
upload that.

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:15.662
CHRIS BANES: It would be on the
first page of the blog.

00:11:15.662 --> 00:11:18.320
JOSEPPI: OK, OK, thank you.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.580
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'll try
and find the thing.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.990
CHRIS BANES: So I've
got a question--

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:30.310
Has anyone else got a question
in the chat?

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.050
JOSEPPI: If I would
like to share a--

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.080
CHRIS BANES: Joseppi's
gone again.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.390
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Joseppi?

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.310
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.560
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Oh,
so he's stuck.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.060
RICHARD HYNDMAN: So the title
of our blog post was, "Using

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.980
Cryptography To Store
Credentials Safely On Android.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.550
I haven't got access to a
keyboard, so I won't put it in

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.180
the chat, but "Using
Cryptography To Store

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.590
Credentials Safely On Android.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.440
Answering--

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.410
what was the name of they guy
who had a question about the

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.360
developer console.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.470
CHRIS BANES: Alex.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.560
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Alex from
Israel's question on disabling

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.230
auto-translation, looks like you
can't do it at the moment.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.410
CHRIS BANES: Yossi's replied.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.470
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We are now
showing automated translations

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.620
of user review-- you can also
view the user review in your

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.190
original language.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.390
You can also set your
language at--

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:18.815
yeah.

00:12:18.815 --> 00:12:19.820
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah,
there was an

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.070
announcement on the dev console--

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.430
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.630
YOSSI ELKRIEF: --and you can
only basically set the

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.220
translation to which
language--

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.030
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You can do
it on a per review basis.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.790
You can see the original
translations, but you can't

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.590
turn it off globally for
all translations.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.410
But I'll certainly pass that
back to the Google Play

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.590
developer console team
who sit [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:40.660
And let them know that
you'd like to be able

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.462
to turn it off again.

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:44.072
Yup, hey Moritz.

00:12:44.072 --> 00:12:45.322
MORITZ: Hi.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.840
When starting an activity, you
have the activity options.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.620
We had the [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.340
video a few days ago, which
shows you how to fade into a

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.022
new activity from someplace
or from an image actually.

00:13:00.022 --> 00:13:00.450
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
[? It's a mix ?].

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.270
CHRIS BANES: That mix.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.140
MORITZ: Exactly.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.500
Last video, and is there
a way to do that for

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.750
fragments as well?

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.080
CHRIS BANES: Not really.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.190
So you can put custom animations
in, so you can put

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.210
set custom animations on the
fragment transaction.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.350
MORITZ: Yep.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.910
CHRIS BANES: So you could,
theoretically, get the view

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.180
from the fragment by calling
fragment.getView, and then

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.680
hacking an animation
together that will

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.490
do something similar.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.090
MORITZ: You would need to
provide an ID for an

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.240
animation, so can you create an
animation which has an ID

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.845
at runtime?

00:13:44.845 --> 00:13:46.640
CHRIS BANES: There's two
versions of methods from what

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.150
I remember.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.590
There's one which gives the
resource ID and one that has

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.910
an animation object.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.380
MORITZ: No, I think
they both--

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.705
there are two methods,
but I think they

00:13:54.705 --> 00:13:55.600
both require the ID.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.900
CHRIS BANES: OK.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.308
I'll check that.

00:13:59.308 --> 00:14:00.216
In that case I'll--

00:14:00.216 --> 00:14:03.440
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I think
you can use the--

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.000
to create an object for
animation, then

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.910
attach it to the view.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.280
Just a second.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.502
Animations.

00:14:11.502 --> 00:14:14.140
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
custom animations.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.430
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.022
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:18.760
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
enter, exit [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.160
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK,
load animation

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.206
from a resource and--

00:14:29.206 --> 00:14:31.030
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, I can't
see a way of doing it, you're

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.020
right, without using
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.640
MORITZ: I mean, obviously,
passing in your own custom

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.010
animation would probably solve
this as you pointed out.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.890
But the API doesn't
allow it yet.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.920
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, I can't
think of a way then.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.940
MORITZ: OK, thanks anyways.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.600
CHRIS BANES: I'll investigate.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.374
Because that's quite an
interesting thing to have a

00:15:00.374 --> 00:15:01.044
look at, so--

00:15:01.044 --> 00:15:03.510
MORITZ: Most definitely, yeah.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.830
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Wait, but if
you have a fragment holder

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.320
view, can't you do the
animation on it

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.200
when the view changes?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.980
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, you
could have a--

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.870
YOSSI ELKRIEF: It should be
easier to do that instead of

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.870
hacking after the view
is created or

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:18.800
something like that.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.050
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.960
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Like once
onViewCreated, and then you

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.030
load the animation and insert
it to the view back.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.810
MORITZ: But I want to have the
same effect, like you fade up

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.370
an image, and then the image is
displayed in full screen.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.735
For example, like in
a gallery, like

00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:42.160
you would have it.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.710
So you would need the original
location of the image in the

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.335
first fragment and fade it up
to the full-screen fragment.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.580
Like [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.340
does pretty well.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.180
OK.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:56.790
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, I'll
look [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.040
MORITZ: Thanks anyways.

00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:02.100
CHRIS BANES: If no one else has
got a question I'll get

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.415
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:03.415 --> 00:16:04.300
Moderator.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.910
So--

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.680
it's an abbreviated name, Howard
Porkins, I think, from

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.520
San Jose in California, has
asked, what's the best way to

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.380
check and see if you're
able to commit a

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.660
transaction for fragments?

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.220
Before being able to
use state loss.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:26.410
So if you call commit before
and after unsaved instance

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.770
[INAUDIBLE], you'll get
an exception back.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.500
So he's asking, what's the best
way to check whether you

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.130
are passed that or not.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.350
And if you are, save the
transaction and being able to

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.060
sort of commit it later.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.360
So my original thought with
this was, if you want to

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.810
commit the transaction later
anyway, why not choose

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:51.170
commitAllowingStateLoss and cut
out the middle section of

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.750
the code and just
do it anyway.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.310
But if you do want to handle
it yourself and save the

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.835
transaction for later, the best
way to do would be to

00:17:00.835 --> 00:17:06.150
save some sort of flag or
variable or something in your

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.190
activity, in your save
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:18.327
And then reload it on restore
and retrace it and commit it.

00:17:18.327 --> 00:17:19.577
JOSEPPI:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.040
CHRIS BANES: So yeah.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.820
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.402
Find a good question?

00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:34.270
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Nope.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.530
CHRIS BANES: No?

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:35.780
OK.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.420
RICHARD HYNDMAN: WebView
inside a

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.410
ScrollView below some TextViews.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.890
ScrollView will always
start from the top of

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.700
the WebView by itself.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.630
WebView inside a ScrollView?

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.352
Why would you put a ScrollView
inside a ScrollView?

00:17:49.352 --> 00:17:49.830
That's going to be tricky.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.685
CHRIS BANES: I don't know.

00:17:52.685 --> 00:17:54.230
RICHARD HYNDMAN: He wants to
put a WebView inside a

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.410
ScrollView, below
some TextViews.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.050
The ScrollView would always
start from the top of the

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.640
WebView making the TextViews
above it go

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.510
out of the top page.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.320
I need the WebView to show
some styled HTML content.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.570
Is there any solution?

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.690
CHRIS BANES: I think he's
asking for WebView to be

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.630
non-scrollable.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.880
Because it wraps.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.730
RICHARD HYNDMAN: If Winkey
Wong has any more--

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:21.990
CHRIS BANES: Is that the name?

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.290
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.030
CHRIS BANES: Good name.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:25.720
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I need
more details.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.400
I don't quite understand
the question.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.540
You want a WebView below some
TextViews and the WebView

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.248
would always be making the
TextViews above it go out of

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:37.498
the top edge?

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.670
YOSSI ELKRIEF: He wants a fixed
TextView on top and then

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.260
a WebView--

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.380
RICHARD HYNDMAN: But he wants
the whole thing to scroll

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.270
together or he wants to make?

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.520
Yeah, I think just
try it basically.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.820
It depends what you want
to put in the WebView.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.140
Maybe if it's only text content,
you could use the

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.325
TextView underneath and then use
that TextView to turn the

00:18:57.325 --> 00:18:59.430
HTML styling on for
that TextView

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.630
would be a good option.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.800
Hopefully, that would
work for you.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.551
Try and avoid using a WebView
inside a ScrollView.

00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:08.020
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.050
RICHARD HYNDMAN: If you are
going to do that, you're going

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.290
need to handle the touches
yourself, and then decide

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.185
which ones to pass to the
WebView and which to leave at

00:19:15.185 --> 00:19:16.820
the ScrollView layer.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.540
And my guess is, you would
just stop the WebView

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.350
processing any TouchViews
at all.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.120
So you'd override the touch
handler of the WebView.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.730
CHRIS BANES: I think
that's great what

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.120
you said in the reply.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.360
Texts you can actually
handle, simple HTML.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:39.350
So if things like paragraphs,
and [INAUDIBLE], those sort of

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.510
things, they're all handled
quite nicely by TextView.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.390
So the nice-- and there's
a static method called

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.596
HTML.fromHTML.

00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:49.530
Which will convert your HTML
into a [INAUDIBLE] which can

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.880
be displayed by TextView.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.670
And so that's quite a nice
thing, and it will eliminate

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.730
the whole scrollable
content within a

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.100
scrollable view group.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.090
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.458
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:20:02.458 --> 00:20:03.820
I think we might got
a post on that

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.635
recently as well, handling.

00:20:06.635 --> 00:20:08.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.910
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --through
different layers of views.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.320
RICHARD HYNDMAN: What's the best
way to show an action bar

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.840
in a DialogFragment?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:13.990
Tricky?

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.560
Yeah, DialogFragments don't
have action bars.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.540
CHRIS BANES: Fragments
aren't supposed to.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.670
Activities are.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.110
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.080
Why, are you unnamed?

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.580
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
I'm unnamed.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:24.740
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.220
All right.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.280
So as Chris says--

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.516
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I was wondering
who has no name.

00:20:31.516 --> 00:20:31.892
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:20:31.892 --> 00:20:33.020
Why didn't you sign in?

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.440
CHRIS BANES: I do.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.400
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You just
changed your [INAUDIBLE] name.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.892
CHRIS BANES: It's my
corp account, so--

00:20:36.892 --> 00:20:39.576
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:20:39.576 --> 00:20:43.226
Yeah, you can [INAUDIBLE]
yourself.

00:20:43.226 --> 00:20:45.260
I'm not quite sure why would
you want an action bar in a

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.735
dialogue but--

00:20:47.735 --> 00:20:48.230
CHRIS BANES: It's
quite similar.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.370
Because actually, Google+
does this.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.790
So then [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.980
yourself.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.200
There's no easy way that--

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.870
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Where
is it in Google+?

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.535
CHRIS BANES: It feeds on the
phone, you get post.

00:21:00.535 --> 00:21:01.193
Oh, there we go.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:01.940
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
Oh, yes, yeah.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.572
When you're in a post there
is an action bar in a

00:21:03.572 --> 00:21:04.934
dialogue for that.

00:21:04.934 --> 00:21:06.240
CHRIS BANES: You can
fake it as well.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.480
So you can have an activity
stall as a dialogue and

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:13.030
each way.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.562
But it's not really supported
as such so--

00:21:17.562 --> 00:21:20.220
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.136
Dialogue.

00:21:22.136 --> 00:21:23.826
He doesn't have the dialogue
on top of the dialogue.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.200
Cancel.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.540
CHRIS BANES: Michael from
Austin has asked--

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.550
so using BitmapFactory.Options
inSampleSize, so being able to

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.720
sample an image [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.760
constrains on a bitmap.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.570
So he's trying to do it in GIF
images, and he's wondering why

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.270
it's not working.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.220
So I'd look at [INAUDIBLE], look
at the code and for some

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.110
reason or another, it hasn't
been added to the GIF decoder.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.660
I'm not sure entirely
the reasons why.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.830
It might be a restriction on
the GIF decoder we use, but

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.270
the option just isn't
even read.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.720
So as it's been there since
version one, I'm guessing it's

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.100
a known issue, and there's
just no way to fix it.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.840
I'm not entirely sure.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.400
It needs some more
investigation.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.390
But the issue has been there
in book tracker for about

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:25.270
three years now so
I don't know.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.890
It seems quite a big
one to miss.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.455
I have no more information
than that.

00:22:30.455 --> 00:22:31.705
It's just what I've
had [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.270
So other ways around it.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.330
So you could decode the
image yourself.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.110
There are various image loading
libraries in which you

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.280
can use which don't
use Android's

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.910
built-in image decoder.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.160
So ImageMagick is one, there's
one by Lightbox which you can

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.030
use, which includes it's
own GIF decoder.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.620
So you could use them.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.300
Or you could go the hard route,
and then load the

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.020
bitmap full size,
then [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.630
bitmap.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.440
But that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.090
So the best way would be to
try and do your images in

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.600
pings rather than GIFs really.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.480
So sorry, I haven't
got anything

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.820
more than that really.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.580
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah, why
are you using GIFs?

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.450
Joe is asking what are good
ways to do assertions and

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.380
debug code in Android.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.190
We want to be able to put a
few assertions in and have

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.550
them be easily removed.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.340
Stephan's actually dong a talk
on something very related to

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.330
this in Munich tonight.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.360
He would be the guy
to answer it.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.590
He has a lot of information on
this, so maybe we can answer

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.000
it in more depth in next week's
office hours when

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.230
Stephan's back.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.300
But in the meantime--

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.443
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, ProGuard
is pretty good for

00:23:41.443 --> 00:23:43.040
this kind of stuff.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.820
So you can set it to strip
out individual methods.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.650
So a good way is, you have
your log.d, log.exception

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.210
methods in Android.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.430
You can change your ProGuard
conflict to strip all those

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.370
methods out automatically,
which is quite nice.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.440
There's also ways you
can do it around--

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.070
so when you build your
[INAUDIBLE], there's

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.050
BuildConfig for all that
gets generated.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.723
And that is a variable called
DEBUG, which get's set to true

00:24:11.723 --> 00:24:14.220
or false depending on whether
the app has been built in

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.990
DEBUG mode or release mode.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.750
And so you can wrap your-- wrap
any sort of assertion or

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:22.525
DEBUG code in one of those
[INAUDIBLE], and then it won't

00:24:22.525 --> 00:24:23.780
run on a release.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.990
And if you use ProGuard, the
good thing is that it will

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.370
also get stripped out as well.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.160
So--

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.720
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.290
size.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.720
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.390
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.375
I have a special requirement to
get the installation date

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:39.980
of an application which I
installed from Google Play.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.210
I want to get installation date
from Google Play with my

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.350
own account.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.150
How do I get that date?

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.676
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, see when I
read this, I wasn't sure if he

00:24:46.676 --> 00:24:50.480
was using an app or trying to
get the dates from an external

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.050
kind of service.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.050
So there is no Google Play
API which you can use.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.500
So I took it that it
was from an app.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.970
So PackageInfo has got a lot
of information about

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:07.170
applications, and so you can
get the PackageInfo for

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.650
individual apps from--

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.340
getPackageManager.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.645
And so once you have the object
for an individual app,

00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:15.710
it can give you a lot
of information.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.630
What installed it?

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.670
When was it first installed?

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.420
There's all sorts.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.770
So yeah, all the information
is there.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.242
There's a variable called first
installed dates, which

00:25:26.242 --> 00:25:29.570
will tell you when it
was first installed.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.310
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Has anyone in
the chat seen any interesting

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.985
Android news this week they
want to talk about?

00:25:34.985 --> 00:25:38.310
Anything we can talk about
that's come up that is.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.145
What's been going on this week
in the Android land?

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.610
It's been a quiet week.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.310
CHRIS BANES: It's been
a quiet week.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.860
MORITZ: I think just today, we
had the new developer console

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.102
stats, and they were
[? tuned ?]--

00:25:56.102 --> 00:25:57.180
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.440
MORITZ: --5%.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.020
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Switch the
Android dashboards on the

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.620
developer console to show the
stats based on active users of

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.540
the Play store as opposed to
active Android devices.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.730
So Android devices hit
two of our servers.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.495
They do check-ins and
they also do--

00:26:13.495 --> 00:26:15.430
yeah, when people use
the Play store.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.770
And we believe that the Play
store stats are more relevant

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.100
for Android app developers.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.320
You want to see the users who
will be downloading your

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.270
applications, and those stats
are also more favorable in

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.370
terms of Ice Cream Sandwich and
Jelly Bean hitting close

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:34.950
to 60% of the market together
on the Play store stats.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.452
So if you are looking at
building an Android

00:26:36.452 --> 00:26:40.540
application, API 10 and upwards
is like over 90% now.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.620
And API 13 and upwards
is kind of 60%.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.534
So it's--

00:26:44.534 --> 00:26:45.905
CHRIS BANES: Really.

00:26:45.905 --> 00:26:46.819
RICHARD HYNDMAN: 58.

00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:47.276
CHRIS BANES: 54 was it?

00:26:47.276 --> 00:26:47.920
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Was it?

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.880
OK.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.330
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.138
somewhere.

00:26:51.138 --> 00:26:52.542
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Close enough.

00:26:52.542 --> 00:26:54.570
RICHARD HYNDMAN: My
bad [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.150
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, but we are
seeing more and more apps

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.500
going ICS upwards
now, which is--

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.200
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.300
It can save you a lot of
development time just doing it

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.690
once using all the latest
features and doing it all

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.252
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:06.252 --> 00:27:07.940
It can definitely be worth--

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.130
especially, if you think in six
to 12 months time, all the

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.180
effort you're putting in to
doing the Gingerbread versions

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.770
will be, for the most part,
not that relevant.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.490
Has anyone pre-orderd a Galaxy
S4 or an HTC One yet?

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.000
I'm not sure you can
order an S4 yet.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.583
Has anyone played with
an HTC One or an S4?

00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:26.410
Anybody seen any of
these devices?

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.650
Mythical devices?

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.100
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, not yet.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.900
MORITZ: Yeah, I've played
with the One.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.300
Quite nice.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.520
It's very cool.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.960
I like the speakers.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.665
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The speakers?

00:27:35.665 --> 00:27:37.270
MORITZ: They're pretty
loud actually.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.260
Good for consuming snippets
of videos.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.295
It's pretty cool.

00:27:41.295 --> 00:27:43.670
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Would you
consider getting one?

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.060
MORITZ: Well, it's not the
Android, so it's hard to

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.205
recommend for me.

00:27:47.205 --> 00:27:48.730
But for somebody else?

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:49.820
Yeah maybe.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.560
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.750
MORITZ: I most like
it actually.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.940
It's expensive though.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.880
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
S4's going to be

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880
expensive as well, right?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.190
Both of these are
top end devices.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.910
I haven't played with either
of them yet, I'm looking

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.890
forward to trying them out.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.030
Maybe, Samsung will turn
up a Droidcon Berlin.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.686
UK last year.

00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:06.890
MORITZ: The One is
really solid.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.825
It's pretty awesome
to touch it.

00:28:08.825 --> 00:28:10.020
It's really cool.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.567
RICHARD HYNDMAN: HTC has that
build quality thing down.

00:28:11.567 --> 00:28:13.120
CHRIS BANES: Yeah the
hardware is--

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:13.340
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.010
CHRIS BANES: --really good.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.140
RICHARD HYNDMAN: People
have said that that

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.345
screen's just amazing.

00:28:18.345 --> 00:28:20.670
How it would ride up on the
surface of the phone, and very

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.240
high definition.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.020
Quite looking forward to that.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.840
MORITZ: I'm not so sure
about the Blinkfeed.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.510
What's it called?

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.160
The very first home screen
thing, which you always have

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.020
by default.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.444
I'm not sure that's really
something I would like to use.

00:28:35.444 --> 00:28:37.890
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I didn't
really spot that.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:38.410
MORITZ: A bit strange.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.570
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I sort of
ignored all those things.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.330
MORITZ: And also, I found it
interesting, the very first

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.640
thing you do on the device, you
unlock it, and you swipe

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.380
away at the clock And
this is a bit laggy.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.670
And the very first impression
you get, it lags.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.760
And that's very strange.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.815
The other stuff doesn't lag,
but the unlocking, swiping

00:28:52.815 --> 00:28:56.205
away at the phone, the clock,
that's strange.

00:28:56.205 --> 00:28:56.940
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I wonder
if that's a

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.310
power management issue.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.000
When it's locked, they're
keeping the power rate down.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.580
And then you swipe, it's
ramping up those--

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.060
CHRIS BANES: Yeah,
[? the CP Unit ?].

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:02.970
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --300
processes or

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.550
whatever it's got.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.606
MORITZ: Possibly, yeah.

00:29:05.606 --> 00:29:07.375
Yeah, I mean the [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:07.980
Is that right?

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.830
That's pretty awesome
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:10.300
I love it.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.593
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:11.593 --> 00:29:13.190
OK, actionlauncher155--

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.640
says Yossi, go actionlauncher.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.386
We've got one question left
in the Moderator.

00:29:18.386 --> 00:29:21.606
Is it advisable for an app to
rely on shared preferences.

00:29:21.606 --> 00:29:23.390
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.230
Does it use XML to store
the data internally?

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.423
I'm developing an app which
stores data in a

00:29:27.423 --> 00:29:28.750
raw XML file privately.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.780
Few devices throw an end of
file exception when the

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.468
battery is removed.

00:29:31.468 --> 00:29:32.304
What may be the reason.

00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:34.605
Yeah, I would definitely go
for shared preferences.

00:29:34.605 --> 00:29:36.755
CHRIS BANES: Well, it depends
on his [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:36.755 --> 00:29:39.440
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Well,
[INAUDIBLE] text file stuff.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.010
CHRIS BANES: If you're all
storing raw XML yourself, I

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.620
wouldn't use a shared
preference.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.060
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I see.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.180
You think he's storing--

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.440
I though he meant he's using
XML to store the data.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.220
But you're right.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:49.950
He wants--

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.787
he's storing his data
in a raw XML file.

00:29:51.787 --> 00:29:53.450
Is he storing XML data
or is he storing raw?

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.322
CHRIS BANES: See,
I don't know.

00:29:55.322 --> 00:29:56.750
Shared preferences are--

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.140
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's
a good point.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:57.237
CHRIS BANES: --

00:29:57.237 --> 00:29:57.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.110
store.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.270
So if you're storing data where
you have it, sort of key

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.250
value form then yeah, shared
preferences is great.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:11.930
But if you're storing anything
more complex and you need

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:16.810
compound objects or whatever,
JSON or an XML format is

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.880
probably a good way to go.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.340
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Or you
could use stORM.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.710
CHRIS BANES: Or you
could use stORM.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.812
RICHARD HYNDMAN: David Chandler,
our own David

00:30:23.812 --> 00:30:26.100
Chandler, has been working
on an ORM for

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.820
Android called stORM.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.210
So you could just stash your
objects away nicely.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.860
And it does all your data
access objects for you

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:34.540
CHRIS BANES: One final
thing actually.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.000
You mentioned using an object
output stream and that's using

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.460
serialization, which
is generally a

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.550
bad thing on Android.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.080
You should be using
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.840
objects, and always output into
some sort of text, XML or

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.850
JSON if you're going to file.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:57.830
Serialization is slow, so
that's my word on that.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:58.920
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Have you
looked at stylus events?

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.020
There was one last question
there that was put at the end.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.890
Stylus events are supported
since ICS.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.270
Is it possible to subscribe
for events when the user

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.940
unplugs the stylus
from the device.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.800
It's a very strange--

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.400
CHRIS BANES: So they just
want a system sort

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.190
of call backer of--

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.060
So stylus events come through
as mouse events.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:17.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.215
views, so--

00:31:20.215 --> 00:31:21.830
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I don't think
we have a concept of it,

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.640
stylus being plugged in
and unplugged though.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.390
You just get the
events through.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.975
CHRIS BANES: You just
get the up and down.

00:31:26.975 --> 00:31:29.816
That's pretty much it.

00:31:29.816 --> 00:31:31.808
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:31.808 --> 00:31:33.280
OK, we're about done.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.450
Does anyone else in the Hangout
have any questions

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.170
before we call it quits
for this week?

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.530
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, just wanted
to point out that the Android

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:49.580
developer event shows that the
time is 5:00 PM instead of

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.730
4:00 PM for Israel.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.490
It an hour difference.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.090
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Thank
you Yossi.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.400
What for this show today?

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.476
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah.

00:31:57.476 --> 00:31:59.260
I just saw it right now.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:31:59.770
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Cheers.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:00.670
OK, we'll get that resolved.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.020
That's because the US changed
time zone two weeks ago, and

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.165
we were two weeks behind.

00:32:05.165 --> 00:32:07.590
And they actually set
our shows up for us.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:10.120
They haven't noticed that we've
caught up on Saturday

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.370
with our time zones.

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:16.056
Maybe I'll pop back on in an
hour and apologize to the

00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:18.170
people who are trying
to join us then.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.650
Thanks very much for everyone
who joined us today.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.870
We'll be back at the same time
next week for more Android

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.010
developer questions.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:24.690
CHRIS BANES: Cheers guys.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:25.170
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Bye guys.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:25.470
Cheers.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.720
JOSEPPI: --guys.
