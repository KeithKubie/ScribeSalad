00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.926
We have triangle ABC here, which
looks like a right triangle.

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:05.300
And we know it's
a right triangle

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.720
because 3 squared plus 4
squared is equal to 5 squared.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.050
And they want us to figure out
what cosine of 2 times angle

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.970
ABC is.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.620
So that's this angle-- ABC.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.850
Well, we can't
immediately evaluate that,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.400
but we do know what the
cosine of angle ABC is.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.810
We know that the cosine of
angle ABC-- well, cosine

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.680
is just adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.159
It's going to be equal to 3/5.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:39.700
And similarly, we know what
the sine of angle ABC is.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.530
That's opposite over hypotenuse.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.310
That is 4/5.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.200
So if we could break this
down into just cosines of ABC

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.120
and sines of ABC, then we'll
be able to evaluate it.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.340
And lucky for us, we have a
trig identity at our disposal

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.410
that does exactly that.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.310
We know that the cosine
of 2 times an angle

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.390
is equal to cosine
of that angle squared

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.560
minus sine of that
angle squared.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.710
And we've proved
this in other videos,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.040
but this becomes very
helpful for us here.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.545
Because now we know
that the cosine--

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.560
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.460
Now, we know that the
cosine of angle ABC

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.670
is going to be equal
to-- oh, sorry.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.810
It's the cosine of 2
times the angle ABC.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.360
That's what we care about.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.310
2 times the angle
ABC is going to be

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:40.480
equal to the cosine of angle ABC
squared minus sine of the angle

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.050
ABC squared.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.740
And we know what
these things are.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.060
This thing right
over here is just

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.470
going to be equal
to 3/5 squared.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.320
Cosine of angle a ABC is 3/5.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.640
So we're going to square it.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.740
And this right over here
is just 4/5 squared.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.590
So it's minus 4/5 squared.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.120
And so this simplifies
to 9/25 minus 16/25,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.320
which is equal to 7/25.

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:22.015
Sorry.

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:23.021
It's negative.

00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:24.020
Got to be careful there.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.010
16 is larger than 9.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.299
Negative 7/25.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.840
Now, one thing that
might jump at you

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.370
is, why did I get a
negative value here

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.260
when I doubled the angle here?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.852
Because the cosine was
clearly a positive number.

00:02:38.852 --> 00:02:41.310
And there you just have to
think of the unit circle-- which

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.910
we already know the unit circle
definition of trig functions

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.080
is an extension of the
Sohcahtoa definition.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.830
X-axis.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.740
Y-axis.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.830
Let me draw a unit circle here.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.430
My best attempt.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.340
So that's our unit circle.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.775
So this angle right over here
looks like something like this.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.610
And so you see its
x-coordinate-- which

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.940
is the cosine of that
angle-- looks positive.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.640
But then, if you were
to double this angle,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.965
it would take you out
someplace like this.

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:18.090
And then, you see-- by the
unit circle definition--

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.850
the x-coordinate, we are now
sitting in the second quadrant.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.520
And the x-coordinate
can be negative.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.667
And that's essentially what
happened in this problem.
