00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.900
 the brain. Each time you think or feel, or do several involuntary actions 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.900
 The hundred million neurons in your skull manage to transmit electrical signals and carry messages between them, 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.680
 Problem in the end, you! And everything is done 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.120
 It is the most complex and necessary organ in the body. It represents the center of the nervous system in all vertebrates. 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.200
 But what if you think and feel it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.000
 Not just under the control of the brain and the central nervous system, but another brain 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Did not you learn about it? 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160
 The brain uses the vagus nerve to connect and connect to many parts of the body 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.920
 Including vocal cords, heart, lungs and most of the digestive tract. 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.120
 This nerve is also used to carry messages (fight or escape) which illustrate 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.829
 You may not experience tremors, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and pain in your stomach when you are very anxious. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.680
 But while this WAN sends signals 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.540
 Consistently from the brain to the rest of the body, the researchers noted that 80-90% of nerve fibers 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.100
 In the intestinal nervous system is actually moving from the intestine to the brain. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.790
 In fact: the intestinal nervous system which consists of a wide network of neurons 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.650
 Which control your entire digestive tract from the esophagus to the anus 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.000
 You do not need the brain at all. When the vaginal nerve is cut off, the intestinal nervous system 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.770
 Able to regulate and direct his reflexes of digestion, because he possesses 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.130
 A tangled group of neurons. It is your second brain, and it controls you 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.689
 More than you can imagine. 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.520
 From the perspective of evolution, before the modern protocols of food safety, were our choices 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.351
 Great revolves around food. Is it safe? Does it cause my illness? Will he give me energy? 

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:44.211
 This is why we need a direct line of communication between the intestine and the brain. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.480
 For example: fat and sugars are good sources of body energy, so we have developed mechanisms 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.689
 Let the brain alert the neurotransmitters dopamine (feeling happy) when we eat 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.670
 Food is high in fat and sugars, which makes us want it constantly. 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.539
 You will become more interested in the intestinal nervous system when you realize that 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.020
 The bacteria in your bowels produce more than 50 percent of your body's dopamine 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.160
 Ninety percent of serotonin, the two neurotransmitters that have a severe effect on mood, are happy and happy. 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.800
 These bacteria manipulate their desires and eating habits to ensure their survival. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.480
 Your diet determines which bacteria will grow, and as a result, the bacteria that thrive 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.159
 In your bowels you can send signals to your brain through the vagus nerve to keep you eating 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.230
 The food they love. For this reason, some scientists have proposed probiotics, 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.490
 Or the cultivation of fecal spores (from a healthy donor) may be effective solutions in the treatment of over-eating, disposal 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.770
 Of some bacteria that generate a strong desire for foods rich in fats and sugars. 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.599
 In fact, current research of the intestine shows healthy microbes as a strong predictor 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.580
 Mental and mental health. Mice that are fed in sterile environments without the presence of bacteria 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.720
 Is characterized by social features similar to those seen in humans with autism 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.740
 When the researchers studied their brains they found important changes 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.520
 At serotonin levels and a special protein associated with learning and memory formation. 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.300
 But after feeding mice with probiotics to help them develop healthy microbes 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.520
 The symptoms subsided. 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.160
 In a 30-day study, people who ate a protein containing probiotics were compared to a decrease in anxiety 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.440
 And depression compared to those who consumed milk does not contain bacteria. 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.409
 Another study found that mice fed a particular type of bacteria had a lower level of stress hormones 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.970
 In her blood, she performed better in learning and memory tests. But when 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.329
 Researchers cut the vagus nerve, all these improvements disappeared, and the intestines returned to dominate 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.770
 On her emotions. 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.239
 Studies have shown that vaginal nerve stimulation at different frequencies, by implantation 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.799
 A small regimen may help patients with treatment-resistant depression mimic 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.769
 Vaginal nerve activity for someone with healthy intestines. 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.449
 The primary role of the intestines here does not end 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.560
 Given that large social groups increase the likelihood of gene transmission (for both our genes and bacteria) 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.020
 Researchers now believe that the mechanism of action of microbes partly promotes positive social behaviors. 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.440
 Healthy intestinal bacteria may lead to higher resilience to negative emotions than others 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.580
 Making you more tolerant and gives you a better ability to build strong social connections 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.159
 We improve your chances of having children. 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.159
 All thanks to your second brain! 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.159
