00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.310
Problem 13.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.390
These eight cards are placed
face down and shuffled.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.200
So these are the eight cards.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.090
If Beatrice turns over only
one card, what is the

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.450
probability that she will
get a card with a

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.310
number less than four?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.240
So all of these cards right here
are potential outcomes.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.710
She's going to flip
them all over.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.190
And then she wants to know the
probability that she gets a

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.940
card less than four.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.050
So what are the cards
that satisfy that?

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.549
Well, there's three cards
that are less than four.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.630
They didn't say less than
or equal to four.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.810
So it could be that card,
that card, or that card.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.720
Those are the cards that she
can pick, out of the eight

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.170
cards, that would satisfy
this constraint.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.590
Or those would be the three
outcomes, out of the eight

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.290
possible outcomes, that would
satisfy these conditions.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.550
So the probability is just three
cards that satisfy your

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.190
condition divided by the total
number of outcomes.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.519
So the probability of her
picking a card that is less

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.210
than four-- there's three cards
that are less than four

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.900
out of eight cards.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.440
The probability is 3/8.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.820
And that is choice B.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.980
Always nice when our answer
is actually there.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.520
OK.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.280
Problem-- what's the
next problem?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.430
Problem 14.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.810
The Smithburg town library
wanted to see what types of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.390
books were borrowed
most often.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.510
All right, there we go.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.250
They drew a little
pie diagram.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.720
According to the circle graph
shown above-- OK, let's see

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.360
which of these statements
are true.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.380
The first statement says, "more
Children's books were

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.850
borrowed than Romance and
Science Fiction combined."

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.170
Let's see if that's true.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.070
Children's is 26%, and
then Romance and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.210
Science Fiction combined.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.960
Romance is 13, and Science
Fiction is 18.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.750
So what's 13 plus 18?

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.390
3 plus 8 is 11.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.740
And then we have 1
plus 1 plus 1.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.450
And so then we get 31.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.750
So if you take Romance and
Science Fiction combined,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.150
that's 31% of the books,
while the Children's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.670
books were only 26%.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.880
So that is definitely
not correct.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.490
More than half of the books
borrowed were Children's,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.440
Mysteries, and Art combined.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.360
So more than half would mean
it has to be more than 50%.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.920
So they think Children's,
Mysteries, and Art combined.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.610
So let's see what that gets.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.230
Children's-- I'll do it
in a different color.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.800
Children's, Mysteries,
and Art.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.870
So Children's and Mysteries, if
you add those together, 26

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.420
plus 20, that gives you 46%.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.000
And then you add another
4% to that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.640
We're combining with Art.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640
That gets us to 50%.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.960
So exactly half the books
borrowed were Children's,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.270
Mysteries, and Art.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.140
But they're saying
more than half.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.580
This is exactly half.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.650
So this doesn't seem
right either.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.400
If they said half or
more, then we would

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.170
have picked this choice.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.540
But they said definitely more
than 50%, so that can't be it.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.270
Although it's kind of a tricky
one, because it's exactly 50%.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.230
C, more Mysteries were borrowed
than Art and Science

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.870
Fiction combined.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.720
Mysteries was 20%, and then
Art and Science Fiction

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.270
combined is 4 plus 18.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.700
If you combine these two, you
get 4 plus 18 is 22%.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.230
So the Mysteries are definitely
not more than the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.060
Art and Science Fiction
combined.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.290
So that's not the
correct answer.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.820
And then finally, more than half
of the books-- this is

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.730
probably going to be our answer,
if we haven't made any

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.070
silly mistakes.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.740
This says more than half of
the books borrowed were

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.880
Romance, Mysteries, and Science
Fiction combined.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.620
Let's see that.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.485
Romance, Mysteries, and
Science Fiction.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.130
We already know Romance plus
Science Fiction, that was 13

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.980
plus 18, which we already
figured out was 31%.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.700
These two could combine at 31%,
and then you add that 31%

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.930
to the Mysteries.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.850
So it becomes 51%.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.330
So that's right.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.020
This is 51% of the
books borrowed.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.370
So that's definitely more than
half of the books, so the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.820
correct choice here is D.
