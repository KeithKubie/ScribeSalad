00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.790
What a great looking movie.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.490
When's the next showing?

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.880
Can I see a preview?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.630
[TROMBONE BLOWING]

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.820
Nowadays, nearly
everyone has the internet

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.170
in their pocket and access
to the world's information

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.480
at their fingertips.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.870
However, getting and interacting
with that information

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.220
isn't always easy.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.750
So where did I put
that bar code scanner?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.860
Do I even have a bar
code scanner on here?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.610
[TROMBONE FAIL SOUND]

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.992
However, if we believe
in Moore's law at all,

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:32.450
we can project that
there are going

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.820
to be millions of smart devices
in our homes, in our work,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.360
and everywhere in between.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.540
Accessing functionality
from these devices

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.670
can be just like using the web.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.451
You just walk up, tap, and go.

00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:45.950
Cool.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.830
There's a show in
just a few minutes.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.660
[VICTORY SOUND]

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.260
Hello, I'm Scott Jenson, and
this is the Physical Web.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.010
So how does this work?

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.080
The poster is using a
Bluetooth low energy beacon

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.730
to broadcast a URL
once every second.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.369
The device here can run for
five years on a single charge.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.660
There's a simple scanner on
the phone that looks around

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.820
whenever you wake it up.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.890
It won't do any scanning if
the phone is in your pocket.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.340
The user must always ask to
see if anything is nearby.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.799
If the scanner
discovers something,

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.339
it'll give you a
list to choose from,

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:19.650
ranked and filtered, to reduce
spam, and bring the most

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.400
relevant content to the top.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.520
You select a web
page, and it opens,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.280
just like clicking
on a search result.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.590
One of the reasons we use
URLs is that they are very

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.400
well understood and flexible.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.070
They can point to a simple web
page with information, a more

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.910
interactive web app,
or could even deep

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.160
link into a native
application in your phone.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.650
As these beacons are really
just small computers,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.460
the URLs can even
dynamically change,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.330
reflecting a sensor value or
even an authentication token.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.959
Check out this
parking meter example.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.500
The user walks up
to it and pulls out

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.300
their phone to see a
list of nearby devices.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.250
They tap on the parking meter
and are taken to a web page.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.179
They just add the time
they want and hit Pay.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.220
All of the billing is
taken care of in the cloud.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.460
And once that's done, it
just authorizes the meter.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.000
So what's happening here?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.540
The Physical Web URL points to
a web page on a standard web

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.470
server that connects
to a small controller

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.130
here, inside the parking meter.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.590
When the purchase
goes through, it

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.430
uses a WebSocket to
message the board,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.009
which then adds the time.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.550
While the movie poster took you
on a journey from the beacon,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.290
to the phone, and then
straight to the web, here,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.665
the parking meter completes
the loop interacting directly

00:02:22.665 --> 00:02:24.460
with the machine
right in front of you.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.720
All just using standard
web technologies.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.350
I want to stress
this just a bit.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.020
The Physical Web is only about
getting the URL to the phone.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.510
Everything else after that
is just using the web.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.240
In this example,
all of the real work

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.560
is done by using WebSockets.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.590
That's the idea behind
the Physical Web.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.690
Objects can broadcast
URLs wirelessly

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.150
to the area around them.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.200
Anyone with a phone or a tablet
nearby can scan the area,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.530
pick an object, and interact
with it on the spot.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.350
Unlike most apps
today, the Physical Web

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.270
enables very small interactions,
things that you'd never

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.200
consider using an app for.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.010
A dog collar can let
you find its owner.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.710
A bus stop could tell you
when the next bus is coming.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.790
You could rent a
bike, get a mall map,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.690
or even watch a new tutorial
on a new home appliance.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.000
The web is powerful
because it works so well

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.140
for the long tail.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.600
Nearly anything could
have its own web page.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.300
The value of the
web is having access

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.680
to millions of small web pages.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.470
This same power can be
applied to smart devices

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.910
and even places.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.740
Each one of these
Physical Web interactions

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.851
is moderately useful,
but taken together,

00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:29.100
they demonstrate how letting
everything be interactive

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.990
opens up a new long tail
of ephemeral interaction

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.360
for the entire world around us.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.370
The Physical Web is just an
extension of the existing web.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.040
Like all web
technologies, it's open

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.780
and anybody can build on it.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.640
Because it uses URLs as
the core building block,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.430
the entire system
is decentralized,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.350
so nobody controls it.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.830
With the discovery of web
pages made frictionless,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.700
we're excited to see what kind
of next generation experiences

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.600
developers like you will
build on top of the web.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.950
Thank you.
