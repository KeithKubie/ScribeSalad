00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:09.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to I/O Live.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.678
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and I'm standing here

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.000
with Topher of Rain
Forest Connection.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.770
Topher, tell us
about the project.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.350
TOPHER WHITE: We're a nonprofit
startup based in San Francisco.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.240
We build open source
scalable solutions

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.687
to legal logging, poaching,
and environmental protection.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.770
Really just making sure
that we can use technology

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.910
to help protect the planet.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really awesome.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.190
The whole project is both
incredible and inspiring.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.340
How did you come to the idea
and start with the execution?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.940
TOPHER WHITE: Well,
this all kind of

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.950
started by realizing there's
people out in the field,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.450
there's people on the
ground in the rain forest

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.908
who really would
protect it if they

00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:40.960
had the right tools
and the right support.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.390
But a lot of times, some of
that support is technological,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.609
and so if we need them to
help protect the forests,

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.400
because they're the
ones to do it the best,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.730
and protecting the forest
is one of the best ways

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.740
to fight climate change,
then one of the best ways

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.660
to fight climate change
would be to build technology

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.410
to help these people
protect their forest.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.840
And a lot of times
that means they

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.180
need to be able to protect it
from destruction, invasion,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.920
all these sorts of things.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.340
So that's what we're
trying to build.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And tell
us just a little bit more

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.410
about the technology.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.118
How does it work?

00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:03.940
What does it do?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.481
TOPHER WHITE: So basically we
take old, upcycled cell phones,

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.320
we put them in a box with
solar panels and a microphone,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.570
and we put them up in
trees in the rain forest.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.160
They can listen to all
the sounds of the forest

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.330
and stay there for years.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.788
They stream it all
up to the cloud,

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:16.390
and then we use AI,
TensorFlow, to be

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.370
able to pick out the sounds
of chain saws, logging trucks,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.170
really any species
we're looking for,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.460
and send alerts to
people on the ground

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.251
so they can show up
and stop logging trucks

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.892
and loggers in real time.

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.350
But not just them,
we can make this

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.400
available to the whole world.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.590
So we can bring the rain
forest to the entire planet

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.452
in real time.

00:01:30.452 --> 00:01:32.660
And that's something that
couldn't have been possible

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.700
too many years ago.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
you actually partnered

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.730
with some middle school
students in Los Angeles

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.900
to help build these devices.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.540
How hard was it to get them
up to speed on the technology?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.310
TOPHER WHITE: One of the most
amazing things about this

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.780
is they were using tools
that already exist,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.480
using TensorFlow for the
analysis up in the cloud.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.270
We're reusing old cell phones,
old smartphones to actually

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.437
be the sensors in the field.

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:51.061
And all these things
are pretty sturdy.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:52.600
So we can just
work with students

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.570
to teach them that IoT,
the Internet of Things,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.170
is not about new
technologies always.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.260
Sometimes it's about what's here
right in front of us right now.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.450
And so they are pretty
good at taking old phones,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.080
put them in boxes with
microphones and solar panels,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.765
and ship them off
to the rain forest.

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:07.390
And that's really
important, because we

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.800
want to be able to show
that the work that they

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.980
do with their hands, and
the connections they forge

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.730
with the tribes, the
people on the ground,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.454
actually can last well
beyond our impact.

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:16.870
So these next generations being
able to build and actually

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.310
be part of these
projects going forward,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.476
and to have that real-time
connection, the streaming

00:02:20.476 --> 00:02:23.350
sound from the forest, that has
a whole new level of impact.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.550
It all started here
in San Francisco was

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.040
some pretty awesome students,
and now it's expanded to LA,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.689
and hopefully we can see
it expand beyond that.

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's been the
impact of the project so far?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.784
TOPHER WHITE: Well,
we actually can

00:02:33.784 --> 00:02:35.950
say we're actively aiding
in the protection of 1,000

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.739
square miles of rain forest.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.280
We've been active
on four continents,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.420
and we're hoping
to really double

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.640
that to go to about 2,000
square miles of forest

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.240
over the next six
to eight months.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.948
And that's really what
this is all about.

00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:48.250
That becomes possible by
using scalable technology,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.800
like TensorFlow, like
old Android phones,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.160
and with people on the ground.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.440
Because there's so many
people out in the forest

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.824
that would help if they
just had the right tools

00:02:55.824 --> 00:02:56.740
and the right support.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.030
And we're going to
give it to them.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank
you for joining us.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.420
Thank you for
sharing this story,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.201
and thank you for
the work that you do.

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.450
TOPHER WHITE: Thank you for
all that you guys do, too.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.480
We couldn't do without the
technology you guys make.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.771
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Topher.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.650
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is I/O Live.
