hopefully you'll kind of be thinking
about that as we turn this into a

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880
about that as we turn this into a

right light it's an interesting dilemma

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240
right light it's an interesting dilemma
 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.379
right light it's an interesting dilemma
so light is a major consumption of power

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389
so light is a major consumption of power
 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.140
so light is a major consumption of power
around the world probably the largest

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150
around the world probably the largest
 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.700
around the world probably the largest
18% of the world's energy is consumed

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710
18% of the world's energy is consumed
 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.680
18% of the world's energy is consumed
through light sources so there's a huge

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690
through light sources so there's a huge
 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.140
through light sources so there's a huge
amount of pressure to reduce the amount

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150
amount of pressure to reduce the amount
 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.230
amount of pressure to reduce the amount
of energy that light consumes yet there

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240
of energy that light consumes yet there
 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.129
of energy that light consumes yet there
is exponential demand for a light right

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139
is exponential demand for a light right
 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.320
is exponential demand for a light right
so so the predictions is more as the

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330
so so the predictions is more as the
 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.480
so so the predictions is more as the

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.129
access to regular energy or light
sources so there's a huge demand just

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139
sources so there's a huge demand just
 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.140

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.610
there but as the whole world urbanized
is we're looking at more and more light

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620
is we're looking at more and more light
 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.040
is we're looking at more and more light
sources hitting the world so therefore

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050
sources hitting the world so therefore
 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.659

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:54.670
are going to be taken up in the market
 

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.170

how where does fitz phillips fit in this

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:58.180
how where does fitz phillips fit in this
 

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.540
how where does fitz phillips fit in this
continuum and how do you all think about

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:00.550
continuum and how do you all think about
 

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.550
continuum and how do you all think about
yeah it's it's a great great question

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:02.560
yeah it's it's a great great question
 

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.830
yeah it's it's a great great question
and actually i think it's it's it's the

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840
and actually i think it's it's it's the
 

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.880
and actually i think it's it's it's the
right question too because you know

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:08.890
right question too because you know
 

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.830
right question too because you know
being a publicly traded company now

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840
being a publicly traded company now
 

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.140
being a publicly traded company now
there are certain pressures on you to

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.150
there are certain pressures on you to
 

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.000
there are certain pressures on you to
deliver results and continue to be

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.010
deliver results and continue to be
 

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.510
deliver results and continue to be
successful but hopefully that doesn't

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520
successful but hopefully that doesn't
 

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.210
successful but hopefully that doesn't
distract you from your core values and

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.220
distract you from your core values and
 

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.490
distract you from your core values and
your on your core focus and one of

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:23.500
your on your core focus and one of
 

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.320
your on your core focus and one of
phillips Lighting's core values and

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:25.330
phillips Lighting's core values and
 

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.410
phillips Lighting's core values and
focus is innovation in lighting and the

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:28.420
focus is innovation in lighting and the
 

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.780
focus is innovation in lighting and the
benefit of lighting and so I'm actually

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:30.790
benefit of lighting and so I'm actually
 

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.430
benefit of lighting and so I'm actually
pretty proud and I don't have anybody

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440
pretty proud and I don't have anybody
 

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.560
pretty proud and I don't have anybody
here at 90 days type thing but the the

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:34.570
here at 90 days type thing but the the
 

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.480
here at 90 days type thing but the the
balance seems to be a very good one and

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:36.490
balance seems to be a very good one and
 

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:40.560
balance seems to be a very good one and
hopefully the the pressure of being a

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:40.570
hopefully the the pressure of being a
 

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.950
hopefully the the pressure of being a
private sector company can put the right

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960
private sector company can put the right
 

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.780
private sector company can put the right
sort of pressure on the innovation

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:45.790
sort of pressure on the innovation
 

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.060
sort of pressure on the innovation
engine because more and more that

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.070
engine because more and more that
 

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.190
engine because more and more that
innovation needs to be aligned with the

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200
innovation needs to be aligned with the
 

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.470
innovation needs to be aligned with the
needs of a community or the business

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480
needs of a community or the business
 

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.820
needs of a community or the business
otherwise it's not commercially viable

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:53.830
otherwise it's not commercially viable
 

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.370
otherwise it's not commercially viable
yeah so I think hopefully I think we've

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:56.380
yeah so I think hopefully I think we've
 

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.040
yeah so I think hopefully I think we've
got a we got a pretty good balance

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:58.050
got a we got a pretty good balance
 

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.030
got a we got a pretty good balance
on that you know we don't want to just

00:22:59.030 --> 00:22:59.040
on that you know we don't want to just
 

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.370
on that you know we don't want to just
innovate for innovations sake yeah but

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380
innovate for innovations sake yeah but
 

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.050
innovate for innovations sake yeah but
we're trying to make sure it's it's it's

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:03.060
we're trying to make sure it's it's it's
 

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.640
we're trying to make sure it's it's it's
it's it's a benefit to the planet and

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:04.650
it's it's a benefit to the planet and
 

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.290
it's it's a benefit to the planet and
the commercial side as well as the

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:06.300
the commercial side as well as the
 

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.180
the commercial side as well as the
educational side so if your change model

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:08.190
educational side so if your change model
 

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.610
educational side so if your change model
is is is you know connected to both

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620
is is is you know connected to both
 

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.600
is is is you know connected to both
community and to product innovation into

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:13.610
community and to product innovation into
 

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.090
community and to product innovation into
profit obviously as well how is that

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.100
profit obviously as well how is that
 

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.000
profit obviously as well how is that
happening internal and I'll I'll say one

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.010
happening internal and I'll I'll say one
 

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.230
happening internal and I'll I'll say one
of the great things about Carnegie

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240
of the great things about Carnegie
 

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.270
of the great things about Carnegie
Mellon is that you know we have people

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280

about how people make urban environments
 

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.370
about how people make urban environments
but I was talking to one of my

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380
but I was talking to one of my
 

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.230
but I was talking to one of my
colleagues 10 years ago who was working

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240
colleagues 10 years ago who was working
 

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.240
colleagues 10 years ago who was working
in material science and she's talking

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:35.250
in material science and she's talking
 

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.330
in material science and she's talking
about boy you know we're just we need to

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340
about boy you know we're just we need to
 

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.920
about boy you know we're just we need to
get to this point before these cool

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:39.930
get to this point before these cool
 

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.300
get to this point before these cool
things she's doing which eventually led

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.310
things she's doing which eventually led
 

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.870
things she's doing which eventually led
to led um just weren't there yet and so

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880
to led um just weren't there yet and so
 

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.910
to led um just weren't there yet and so
we recognized there was a gap between

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:46.920
we recognized there was a gap between
 

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.350
we recognized there was a gap between
what we're we were here who is Philips

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360
what we're we were here who is Philips
 

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.260
what we're we were here who is Philips
is kind of that the organization right

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:54.270
is kind of that the organization right
 

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.430
is kind of that the organization right
now that's filling that gap right

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440
now that's filling that gap right
 

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.750
now that's filling that gap right
between material science and

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760
between material science and
 

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.750
between material science and
