&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Welcome.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.490
Good morning.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.370
Welcome to the National
Book Festival.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.120
My name is Rob Casper.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.850
I'm the head of the Poetry and
Literature Center at the Library

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.410
of Congress and we're
thrilled to have you

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.670
for this panel celebrating
new poets of Native Nations.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.500
I should say it's both
a panel and a reading,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.370
so you'll hear all
sorts of poems

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.980
in the next hour and 15 minutes.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.690
We'll have a great wonderful
conversation up on stage,

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.020
and you'll have the
opportunity to ask questions.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.780
There should be mics on either
side that you can step up to.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.220
When we get to that
point I'll redirect you

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.700
so we can make sure that works.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.200
All day here at the Library

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.820
of Congress National Book
Festival we are recognizing

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.320
and celebrating the
importance of reading

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.570
and authors and books.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.470
The Library of Congress makes it
seem easy to do this every year,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.170
but the truth is the National
Book Festival is a huge

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.610
undertaking, is a huge financial
undertaking, and it is free

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.080
for everyone because
of the generous support

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.510
from our sponsors
and supporters.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.810
One of our great sponsors

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.130
and supporters is the
National Endowment for the Arts

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.050
which makes this poetry and
prose pavilion possible.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.120
You should find out about the
National Endowment for the Arts.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.210
The staff from the Literature
Division is in the back.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.230
They have materials
you can check out.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.370
They are a great supporter
of poets and writers

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.700
in this country and have been
doing so for a good long time.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.860
You can also spread the joy
of reading with a gift online

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.460
at loc.gov/donate
from the festival app

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.560
or when you purchase
books today.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.010
So let me tell you about
this panel in reading.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.740
We have a good amount
of time today to get

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.110
into a great conversation.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.500
And I'm thrilled to have two
wonderful poets including my

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.590
good friend Heid Erdrich.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.500
I've had many conversations
with Heid over the years

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.110
about new poets of
Native Nations and I want

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.330
to say how honored
I am personally

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.370
to be part of its launch.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.560
Special thanks also to Graywolf
Press and Editor Jeff Shotts

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.790
for supporting this panel.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.620
We were supposed to
have a third panelist

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.060
and reader, Natalie Diaz.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.360
She is in transit.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.820
We're hoping she makes it, so
we're just going to kick off

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.650
and then we'll see what happens.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.000
Let me tell you a little
bit about this event.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.040
Our other poet, Jennifer
Foerster, will read her poems

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.540
from the anthology, then
Heid will talk a little bit

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.250
about the anthology and read
poems by other contributors.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.630
Then she'll invite Jennifer to
ready selections from new poets

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.270
of Native Nations as well,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.990
and I'll lead a moderated
discussion.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.170
Let me say a little
bit about the Poetry

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.620
and Literary Center as well.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.240
We are home to the U.S.
Poet Laureate, and in fact,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.660
you can see our current Poet
Laureate, Tracy K. Smith,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.130
talk with former Poet
Laureate, Robert Hass,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.920
at this stage at 2 o'clock.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.160
The Center also hosts a wealth

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.430
of poetry programming
throughout the year

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.670
at the Library's Capitol Hill
Campus and around the country.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.810
For more information,
visit loc.gov/poetry.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.550
And so now I'm going
to sit down,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.510
and there will be a little
bit of rejiggering my mic,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.520
and then Jennifer Foerster
will kick things off.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.950
So, thanks for much for coming.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.790
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Sorry, I --

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.620
oh, right there [laughter].

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.020
Hello. [Foreign words].

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.650
Jennifer Foerster
[foreign words].

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.950
My name is Jennifer Foerster.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.510
It's wonderful to be here.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.060
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.430
It's good to see all of you.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.130
I'm a member of the Muscogee
Creek Nation through my mother,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.330
and I'll say a few things more

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.310
in Muscogee just to
introduce myself.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:46.920
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.900
So it's wonderful to be here.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.910
I just mentioned my
clan through my --

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.250
I'm a daughter of
the Beaver Clan.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.450
And it's been such
an honor to be apart

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.060
of this incredible anthology
that Heid Erdrich put together.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.690
I think it must have taken a lot
of work to put this together.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.030
I know it did.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.750
And I admire her so much for
her incredible contributions

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.450
over the years and all
the work that she's done

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.220
for Native literature.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.930
Truly bringing Native
writers to the landscape,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.870
the literary landscape,
which is so important

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.010
because we've always been a
part of the literary landscape.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.230
We just haven't been
included in it.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.040
But so much of the literature
of this country and the idea

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.980
of the country is --
involves all of the peoples

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.790
of this country and our stories.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.860
So this is a great contribution,
and I'll read a few poems

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.160
of mine from this anthology.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.490
All right.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.950
There we go.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.230
So my mother us Muscogee Creek,
and our family is from Tulsa,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.580
and one of the early
founding families of Tulsa.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:31.260
And arrived there during the
removal in the mid-1800s.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.200
And my father is Dutch and
German and was in the Air Force,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.750
so I grew up moving
around a lot as a kid.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.340
So I only got to spend
summers back home in Oklahoma,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.220
and the rest of the time -- he
was a diplomat in the Air Force

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.660
so he worked in the -- for
the embassies and we lived

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.630
in Vienna, Austria,
and Brussels,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.640
England, and various states.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.130
So, you know, because we
worked for the government,

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.860
they were kind enough to send us
home every summer, and so I got

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.240
to go home to Oklahoma
every summer.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.310
I always felt a little out of
place because it was my home and

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.420
yet we were the ones that were
always moving around, you know.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.600
And not a lot of people
there moved around.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.600
So I felt like I
was always leaving.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.090
So the first book I titled,

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.820
<i>Leaving Tulsa </i>because
I always wanted to stay,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.890
but I also always
wanted to leave.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.150
And it's that place of
being in-between culturally,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:36.790
linguistically, historically,
that informs this poem.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.210
"Leaving Tulsa."

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.170
Once there were coyotes,
cardinals in the cedar.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.930
You could cure amnesia with
the trees of the back-forty.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.430
Once I drowned in
a monsoon of frogs.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.710
Grandma said it was
a good thing,

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.820
a promise for a good crop.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.710
Grandma's perfect tomatoes.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:07.940
Squash. She taught us
to shuck corn, laughing,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.170
never spoke about her
childhood or the faces

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.160
in gingerbread tins
stacked in the closet.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.800
She was covered in a
quilt, the Creek way.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.300
But I don't know this kind
of burial -- vanishing toads,

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:31.220
thinning pecan groves,
peach trees choked by palms.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.030
New neighbors tossing clipped
grass over our fence line,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.190
griping to the city of
our overgrown fields.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.810
Grandma fell in love with a
truck driver, grew watermelons

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.150
by the pond on our
Indian allotment,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.540
took us fishing for dragonflies.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.800
When the bulldozers came with
their documents from the city

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.500
and a truckload of pipelines,
her shotgun was already loaded.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.360
Under the bent chestnut,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.190
the well where Cosetta's
husband hid his whiskey --

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.220
buried beneath the roots
her bundle of beads.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.390
They tell the story
of our family.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:20.250
Cosetta's land flattened
to a parking lot.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.900
Grandma potted a cedar sapling I
could take on the road for luck.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.760
She used the bark for
heart lesions doctors

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.460
couldn't explain.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.980
To her they were maps, traces
of home, the Milky Way,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.320
where she's going, she said.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:45.010
After the funeral I stowed
her jewelry in the ground,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.610
promised to return
when the rivers rose.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:54.510
On the grassy plain behind
the house one buffalo remains.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:00.680
Along the highway's gravel pits
sunflowers stand in dense rows.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.970
Telephone poles crook
into the layered sky.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.130
A crow's beak broken
by a windmill's blade.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.200
It is then I understand
my grandmother --

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.850
when they see open land
they only know to take it.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.820
I understand how to walk
among hay bales looking

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.610
for turtle shells.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.000
How to sing over the groan

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.730
of the county road
widening to four lanes.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.060
I understand how to
keep from looking up --

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.030
small planes trail
overhead as I kneel

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.190
in the Johnson grass
combing away footprints.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:45.040
Up here, parallel to the median
with a vista of mesas' weavings,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.820
the sky a belt of blue and white
beadwork, I see our hundred

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.970
and sixty acres stamped
on God's forsaken country,

00:10:53.970 --> 00:11:01.250
a roof blown off a shed,
beams bent like matchsticks,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:06.270
a drove of white cows
making their home

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.910
in a derailed train car.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:23.650
[ Applause ]

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:31.960
"Canyon. I also lived for a
long time in New Mexico and went

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.260
to the Institute of American
Indian Arts in Santa Fe.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:40.840
And now I'm there with a
low residency MFA Program

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.140
at that school.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.330
And some of the poets in
the anthology are involved

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.820
with that school, too.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.510
So keep your eye out.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.140
"Canyon." So, anyway, so I spent
a lot of time in the desert

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.360
which has influenced me a
lot, especially the Southwest

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.050
and the sense of the ocean that
is always there in the desert.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.950
The past is always a
part of where we're at,

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.250
even if we don't see it,

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.350
even when it's invisible
in our landscape.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.540
It's here.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:22.520
"Canyon." Brush over stars
dust, up thrust shale,

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.620
erosion stripped
script of leaches.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.980
Sloughing scales off our
hands' finned imprints.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:40.070
Slow, ageing metamorphic
skins, quartz, schist, gypsum,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.720
marine bones bedded
in the drainage.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:50.400
The basin overflows with
wind, horizon, phantom barges,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.930
a shore once lush with cane.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:58.530
Moon, a relic in the azure sky.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.880
Grey face cut from
the mountain spine.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:10.630
A line of dust divides
us, [inaudible] and ghost,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:17.930
ancient stream whose sound
remains, flood land, arroyo,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.870
yucca, sowoaro [assumed
spelling].

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.770
I dive with pipe
fine swallowtails

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:30.060
down winding stairs, crenulated
lava, scrolls fossilized

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.310
in radiant strata,
reed, prickly pear,

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.940
silver cholla, spicules
of sponge.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.380
Here in this rain shadow's
stark flanked gully,

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.700
two blue-bellied lizards
streak across sand,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:54.170
vanish inside a conch
shell, arrived at the bottom

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.790
of the world, I write.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.560
Buried in the canyon's
spiraled larynx,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.640
a raft for the coming storm.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:15.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.700
Want me to go on?

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.060
[ Applause ]

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.930
Okay. I'll read one piece

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.610
from my second book
that just came out.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.710
That kind of follows --
that poem is in this book,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.460
but it's called <i>Bright
Raft in the Afterweather </i>,

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.110
so since I'm talking
about rafts.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.980
This is called "Hookdalwe's
[assumed spelling] Crow."

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:45.150
Hookdalwe is a Muscogee
word for an elderly woman.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.940
It doesn't have the personal
pronoun attached to it

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.240
so it can't be a relative

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.300
because a relative always
has that attachment.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.770
So it' an elderly
woman who has --

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.020
it's kind of close
to a grandmother.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.460
And she informs this book.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.930
She's kind of the character.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:11.340
The first book is following a
woman named Magdalena and she is

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.550
like the chimera of the book.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.490
And so this one is --

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.990
takes place at the edge of
the continent in California

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.170
where I've moved to
and where I now live.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:26.530
And it's following this
elderly woman named Hookdalwe

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:32.840
who I've seen various places
on the beach and around.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.940
So she's who I write to.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.550
Hookdalwe's Crow.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:50.070
There were still songbirds than
nesting in hackberry trees.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:54.230
And a butterfly named Question.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:16:02.280
I remember ivy trembling at the
vanishing point of your throat.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.610
Then the timelines crashed.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.500
California split
into an archipelago,

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.340
orchards withered
under blooms of ash.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:25.970
Now there is no nectar,
no rotten fruit.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:33.060
The air is quiet.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.950
Once in Russia, ornithologists
trapped a population

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:45.430
of hooded crows, transported
them 500 miles westward.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.160
Winter came.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.970
They never caught
up with their flock.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:17:00.080
With crests of calcified algae
we catalog each day lost.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.130
Hot thermals, cirrus vaults,

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.810
fistfuls of warblers
hurtling into dark.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.990
There was no sound
to the forgetting.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:19.680
We knew the heart would
implode before the breath

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.980
and lungs collapsed.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.830
That the world would
end in snow.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:33.250
An old woman walking alone,

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:39.510
empty birdcage strapped
to her back.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:51.160
[ Applause ]

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.310
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: That's
a beautiful poem.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.610
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
Thank you so much.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.440
Am I on? Is my mic working?

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.740
Yeah?

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.040
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Yeah.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.340
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Okay.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.640
Thank you so much,
everybody, for being here.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.940
Thank you, Jennifer.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.240
That was just beautiful.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.370
I am Heid Erdrich and I wanted
to say just a few more things

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.240
about Jennifer before
we move on.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:16.410
Jennifer has recently
been a National Endowment

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.120
for the Arts Fellow.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.080
She is working as
Managing Editor

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.620
of Joy Hardrow's
[assumed spelling] project

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.870
to create a <i>Norton
Anthology of Poetry</i>

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.670
<i>of Native American
Poetry </i>, the first.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:31.130
[ Applause ]

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.860
And if that's not enough,
she recently stepped

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.040
in as the Director of the MFA
Program, the Low-Res MFA Program

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.090
for the Institute of
American Indian Art,

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.980
so she's quite an
accomplished person aside

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.390
from having a new book out,
which is enough work as it is.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.440
And so I'm really grateful to
you for coming in and reading

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.740
from <i>The Anthology </i>.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.040
I really appreciate that, so.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.860
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Do you
want to read a few poems

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.250
from <i>The Anthology</i>
that you love?

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.550
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.950
I'm going to read the first and
last and then as we have time

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.540
between things I will add
a few of the shorter poems.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.400
I'd like to read the first
poem because, you know,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.150
we have a book where I
created this umbrella,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.050
Native American Poetry,
and I don't believe

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.140
that Native American
Poetry actually is a thing.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.470
It's just a term that we use
to bring the original peoples

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.320
of this place together.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.390
And when I move around the
country reading from my own work

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.980
and <i>The Anthology </i>and
teaching, I like to think

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.740
about the original people
who lived in the place

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.140
that we're all inhabiting,
so I want to think

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.560
about those people now.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.840
I want to recognize them
in OccuNations of Virginia

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.580
who recently came
into a relationship

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.170
with the Federal
Government after, of course,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.060
having known people from
Europe for hundreds of years.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.420
So I want to recognize
those people.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.220
And then I want to read --

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.120
[ Applause ]

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.420
Thank you.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.190
Then I want to read the first
poem in the book which is

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.700
by Tacey M. Atsitty ,
and Tacey's a Dine poet.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.170
She also a graduate
of the Institute

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.200
of American Indian Arts
with an MFA from elsewhere.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.570
But she did her undergraduate
work there.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.660
Tacey is writing about the
ancestral group that is known

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.500
as the Anastasi [assumed
spelling], you know,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.880
that's sort of a made-up
term for people's ancestors.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.840
And the conventional wisdom is

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.230
that they just disappeared,
right?

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.040
This group in the
Southwest, the Hohokam,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.540
the Anastasi, all these people.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.160
Nobody knows where they went.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.800
Well, the people
who are descended

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.100
of them know where they went.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.910
So this is a very short poem.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.010
"Anastasi."

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:42.110
How can we die when
we've already been prone

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.070
to leaving the table
mid-meal like ancient ones,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.080
gone to breathe elsewhere?

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.230
Salt sits still, but pepper's
gone, rolled off in a rush.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.970
We've practiced dying
for so long a time.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:04.290
When we skip-dance or
town, when we chew.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.230
We've rounded out like dining
room walls in a canyon,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.280
eaten through by wind.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.180
Sorry we rushed off.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.820
The food wasn't ours.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.360
Sorry, the grease sits
white on our plates.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.290
And the jam that didn't set.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:26.490
Use it as syrup to cover
every theory of us.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.040
[ Applause ]

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.340
So that was Tacey M. Atsitty

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.170
who gave me permission
to read that poem.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.660
When I put <i>The Anthology</i>
together I wasn't sure how I

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.960
was going to do it.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.320
I knew I wasn't going to look
for themes because I believe

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.590
that all these representatives
of their own Native Nations,

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.730
their particular culture
groups or their relationship

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.620
to their descent from
those culture groups

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.510
which is a whole other
category of being,

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.540
were too distinct to represent.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.290
I couldn't, you know,
put it in a category

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.250
of here's Creek poets
or here's Dine poets.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.760
What I wanted was a sense

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.720
of when these writers entered
the American mainstream

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.590
of poetry by publishing
their first books.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.730
So when I read that poem of
Tacey's, I realized I wanted it

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:16.310
to be the first poem in the
book, and because it responds to

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.250
and calls out our ancestry,

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.840
our origin in this
place, this continent.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.740
And because it was the
last book published.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.140
And I realized I had to go
backward from the 2018 book,

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.100
Tacey's book, <i>Rain Scald </i>,

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.290
and forward to the first book
published in the year 2000

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.250
to have 21 poets from
the 21st century.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.600
So the last poem in the book
which I had always wanted

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.000
to be the last poem in the book
is from Janet McAdams who's

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.420
of Creek descent from Alabama.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.240
And this poem is
called "Earthling."

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:59.890
That winter, that warm winter,
no one wanted to be ordinary.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.310
We sat on a pile of
plastic, threatened as a farm

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.680
where the dog is
tied up barking.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.820
Land, we meant to
say we were sorry.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.790
We are so sorry to the
red dirt of your body.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.940
We meant to say meat
or dirty water.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.030
We meant to say before our
bones became lace, before we had

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.870
to lean forward to swallow.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.310
You remember how the story goes.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.040
We came in peace.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.000
But tell that to a drop
of water trying to linger.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:45.370
[ Applause ]

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.250
So those are the
first and last poems.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.660
And I think in my conversation
with Rob, I'll get to some

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.960
of the other things
I want to tell you

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.390
about <i>The Anthology </i>, so.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.690
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Well, thanks

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:56.990
for reading those
poems, both of you.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:03.530
And talking about timelines,
I felt it appropriate to start

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:08.060
with a timeline for this
anthology which is the timeline

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.410
of 20 years ago, the
last major <i>Anthology</i>

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.390
<i>of Native Poetry </i>and the
forthcoming <i>Norton Anthology</i>

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.740
Mwhich I just learned about
which I'm assuming is coming

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.920
in the next few years.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.220
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Mm-hmm.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.500
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: And here between
the future of the "Nortonizing"

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.980
of Native poetry and
this last anthology

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.450
that people could refer to
when they wanted to find

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.720
out who are the exciting Native
poets writing great work today

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.400
sits new <i>New Poets
of Native Nations </i>,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.130
and I think it's a
really interesting title.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.970
And I wanted to talk to you
about what this title means,

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.440
especially in relation
to the sort of past

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.900
and the imminent future.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.200
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Mm-hmm.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.040
Well, you know, I'll
tell you how I --

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.150
the poetry anthology came to be.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.580
I was looking at social
media, as I'm want to do,

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:05.110
and I saw a prominent
critic of American Poetry,

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.700
Contemporary American
Poetry, post the question,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.740
who are the Native Poets
I should be reading today?

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.440
And the answer this person
got back were the names

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.180
of 19-century orators like
Chief Seattle, Gary Snyder,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.060
who is not Native but who can --

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.070
some people think of as
writing Native American Poetry.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:31.020
The names of, you know,
well-known and established poets

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.950
like Joy Harjo, and then
the names of several people

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:41.110
who are not Native but use names
that sound Native in English.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.900
And that really concerned me.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:48.380
It took many comments before
Layli Long Soldier's name came

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.060
up, before some of the
poets who published books

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.510
in the past three years, Sharon
Bitsoi [assumed spelling]

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.250
who did the cover image
for this anthology.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.700
And I would love to talk about
that image if I get a chance.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.940
And, you know, the folks
we wanted in there.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.240
I don't think I commented.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.840
I just sat back and
thought about that.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.380
And I had the gall to write
to Jeff Shotts and go, Jeff,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.440
there has not been an
anthology of Native Poetry

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.860
from a literary press.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.270
There have been anthologies
of indigenous poetry

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.780
from university presses that
cover the whole landscape,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.460
the whole continent, North

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.440
and South America
and Central America.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.310
But there hadn't
been a literary book

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.720
about whose poets were
publishing books today,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.450
and there was nothing that
wasn't themed or set together

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.150
in what I feel is sort of
an artificial apparatus.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:47.930
So I sent this audacious note
to Jeff Shoots at Graywolf

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.200
and he kindly said
that's a great idea.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.740
Let's talk about it.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.220
And then I got scared and
I started like who am I?

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.980
Do I know all the poets?

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.280
You know, who do I know?

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.880
And I made a list of 43 poets
that I thought would be good

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.690
for this anthology, and
then I started to research

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.200
who was coming next and
added to the gaps that I had.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.340
I didn't realize
how many gaps I had.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.410
One gap I had that became
apparent very early on was

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.700
that there is a division
between the literatures

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.400
of academic writers, writers
who wrote for university presses

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.490
or Native series, and
writers who wrote perhaps

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:31.610
to their audience whether
it be gender or class, race,

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.170
issues that had more of an
audience in specific niches.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:41.270
So I ended up really looking
beyond what was comfortable

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.250
for me and creating, I
think, a pretty eclectic book

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:49.490
but that holds together in ways
that are apparent to me, so.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.790
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Jennifer,
I wonder if you could talk

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.700
about what you see this
anthology as doing in relation

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.760
to the anthology you're
charged with helping edit.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.630
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Well, first of all,

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.720
I love the title
of this anthology

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.530
because that's really
what it's doing --

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:12.500
to state new poets of Native
Nations is a first step

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:18.430
in changing the way that
the literary world responds

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.850
to literature by people
of Native Nations,

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.670
is I feel like there has
been, you know, this --

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.560
part of the response to
literature by people who are

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.450
of Native Nations is
to lump them into --

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:37.380
oh, my gosh, first of
all, there are more --

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.480
there are many Nations
inside this Nation.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.180
Yeah. There's a lot.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.110
And people write, yeah.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:53.100
And people from the many Nations
inside this Nation have not only

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:59.080
been telling stories, which is
literature, and singing songs,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.240
which is literature forever,
but have also been writing.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.270
And that's often
not thought about.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.940
But, actually, we have
written literatures from people

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.710
of many different
Nations since, I'd say --

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.930
I mean, it depends also if
you're thinking of what kind

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:21.300
of written -- about 1600's.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:27.040
So there's an amazing history
and heritage of literatures

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.480
of people from the many
Nations with this Nation,

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.240
the Indigenous Nations.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.900
And it's time that
it gets recognized.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.250
That's part of the story.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.590
If we're going to tell a story,
what is our national literature?

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.250
What is the story
of assassinations?

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.410
And, you know, when that first
started coming to be, you know,

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.690
late 1800s, so we need
a national literature,

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.360
and Whitman and, you
know, this kind of --

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.610
wow, the country
is being identified

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.590
by a national literature.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.450
In-between World War I and
World War II there was that --

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.080
we need to have an identity
as a people with a literature.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.400
Those writers were held up.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.410
And not that that
wasn't important,

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:14.510
but those people became
the literary ones.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.690
And meanwhile there
are so many others.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.410
And it's just time that we
start responding to that.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.450
And that will change the
stereotypical narrative

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:27.000
of who we are as a nation
in relation to, you know --

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.880
there's always this
we as a nation

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.290
and then there is the
Natives, you know?

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.860
Like us, we, them, one other.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.620
And, in fact, it's we
are multiple nations

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.870
with different languages
and different customs

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.500
and different stories.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.790
So this book -- that's what I
love [inaudible] I love so much

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.160
about it, but what I would
just say what's captured

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.320
in the title, <i>New Poets
of Native Nations </i>.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.300
It's such an important change.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.030
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: That makes
me think I didn't really answer

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.940
the question about
the title [laughter].

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster: Oh.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.100
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: We had time to
have that question answered.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.090
But I did want to follow up
and say what struck me most,

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.090
especially when you consider
the sort of <i>Norton Anthology</i>

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.630
<i>of Poetry </i>model, is that it
began with new and new poets

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.610
that have foregrounded
that this anthology --

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.480
I shouldn't speak of
it in the past tense.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.030
This anthology foregrounds
the writers of these poems

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.900
and pronounces them as new

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.540
in a really beautiful
and wonderful way.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.220
And maybe you could
talk about that.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.520
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
Yeah, thanks.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.930
I mean, you know,
it's 18 years ago

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.940
that the first book
was published,

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.040
but there were very few
Native poets published,

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.170
especially by literary presses,
and I make that distinction

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:48.920
because there's a
different audience.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.310
You're more likely to see
a book of poems published

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.920
by a literary press as opposed
to a university press just

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.000
on a shelf somewhere
in a bookstore.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And so there were just,
there were just a very few

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.770
until the beginning
of this century.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:06.310
There was just a moment, a
divide, after the late '90s

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.620
where people started
to publish in numbers,

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.440
and some presses would have not
just one Native poet, but two.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.080
And I say in the
Introduction that I --

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.040
when my second collection of
books, I was actually told

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.910
by some of the presses, well,
we already have a Native poet

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.600
so we can't consider your work.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.550
Somebody not from my Nation,

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.910
not from my perspective,
and so forth.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.590
But there was that
lumping together.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.140
So I really wanted the
idea to like look at, well,

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.740
you couldn't -- it's
enough to represent

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.690
in some way your nation or
hold that nation in your body

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:44.070
and have it be part of
your work for these poets,

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:49.750
much less to try to fit into
some category of thematic,

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.710
you know, work by
Native Nations.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.460
So I think -- I mean, I really
was thinking about those things.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.960
I was also thinking about that
problem of these poser poets,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.100
[inaudible], pretend
Indians as we call them,

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.890
people who have made
a career off

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.470
of writing Native-sounding
poetry but have no connection

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.430
to a Native Nation whatsoever.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.380
And they don't even
pretend to when asked.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.660
But that is -- you know, I
really wanted people to begin

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.190
to see a difference, so the
craving for a 19th century voice

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:27.160
that has a particular sound was
put to rest as being something

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.240
that maybe Longfellow did

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.710
after he ripped off James
Rhonson's [inaudible],

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:37.910
the first Native poet who
published in 1824, so.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.410
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I'm interested
also in talking specifically

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.870
about these poems and
the wealth of themes

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:55.570
and images these poems contain,
and the images and themes

00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:00.040
that how you talk about in
the Introduction as those

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.590
that the publishing world,

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:04.960
the sort of mainstream
publishing world expects

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.160
of Native poets.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.850
Reading through this
anthology, what should I

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:15.590
and everyone here come to
expect about the latter?

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.690
What should be understand
about these sort of themes

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.920
and images we've been
told or been reinforced

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.430
from the publishing world

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:24.530
that are Native themes,
Native images?

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.730
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Well,
that's always a problem, right,

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.340
like if I recapitulate them then
they're in your head because --

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.200
and then I tell you but I
can't tell you what, you know,

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.630
what subject will strike Native
contemporary, new Native poets.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.100
But, you know, the
expectation of spirituality,

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.480
constant spirituality, you know.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.770
We have poems for --
anti-spiritual poems.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.420
We have, you know, agnostic,

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.180
even atheistic poems
in this anthology.

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.390
You know, animals
aren't always talking.

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:55.420
People aren't always
in ceremony.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.980
They might write, you know,
beautifully about canyons

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.160
and the relationship
to ancestors,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.010
but with the sensibility
that we have as Americans,

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.540
to be skeptical to
think, you know,

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.420
how is our education
being produced,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.030
what's our critical take?

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.020
So those are the poets
I was attracted to.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.800
There are many other kinds of
Native poets, and I did try

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.790
to include some in the edition

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.420
of <i>Poetry Magazine</i>
that I edited for June.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.780
So that's online.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.130
So if you want to see some
poets who are not contained

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:32.980
in this anthology, you can
see in <i>Poetry Magazine </i>,

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.670
even newer writers who have --

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.620
maybe don't have
their first book yet.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.890
But these writers, like Jennifer
said, are national poets

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.440
in the American scene
in general.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.700
They've won virtually every
major award this year.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.720
Jake Skeets, who's
not in the anthology,

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.220
just won the National
Book Award?

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.810
No. The National Poetry Series.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.110
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.410
The Poetry Series.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:56.710
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.010
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster:
I know that [inaudible]

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.310
to me, but that's awesome.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:00.610
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah.

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.370
And, you know, every
-- if you ask about it,

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:08.750
there have been awards --
Joshua Whitehead actually turned

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.210
down the Lambda Literary
Award, but he was nominated.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:18.010
And there were many other
awards just recently that went

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.060
to Native poets, not
in a special category,

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.600
just the American
Poetry Awards in general.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.100
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Well, there's
also that interesting sense

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:32.200
of multiple identities that you
talk about, the essence of --

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.500
our connection to different
Nations that the poets

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.950
of this anthology
are negotiating with.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.350
At one point you say that no one

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:42.760
in this anthology
defines himself solely

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.060
as Native American.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.550
Can you back that up a
little bit, Jennifer?

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:49.160
Maybe I -- maybe you could talk
about how your work and the work

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.680
of the poets that you admire in
this, negotiate with those dual

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.820
or multiple identities maybe
in connection with one another

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.620
or in opposition to one another.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.390
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster: Hmm.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:11.480
I have a sense -- I feel lucky
that I am friends with most

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.040
of the poets in here,
and those are not --

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.830
it's just because I haven't
had the privilege of getting

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.700
to know them very well yet.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:23.020
But one thing about
this collection

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.690
that Heid has brought
together is that as --

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.600
this collection of poets,
including so many who aren't

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.210
in here, we're in
conversation often.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.510
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Mm-hmm.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.810
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: We know each other.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.110
We dialog.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.410
We read each other.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.940
We teach each other.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.120
So in that sense it's a small --

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.170
well, it's an intimate
community.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.570
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
Mm-hmm, I agree.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.520
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster: And
this is just a beautiful rising

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.330
up of some of those voices,

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.830
kind of like a cross-section
of that community.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.120
And you can read in here how
people are talking together.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.760
There are so many
echoes among the poems.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.590
And I think related to
theme, it's hard, you know,

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.930
reading it through so
many times, you're going

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.700
to find layers and layers
of themes and conversations

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.860
that are happening
among the poems.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:20.810
And one of those, of course,
does have to do with identity

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:30.150
and how we are multiple,
how we are able to be rooted

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:37.560
and centered in a place or a
people, a community, a Nation,

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.830
and at the same time
be multiple.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:44.000
And I think that's,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.150
that's probably how I would
talk about that, you know?

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.950
Also for me it's -- I
went to the Institute

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:54.250
of American Indian
Arts as an undergrad,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:39:00.380
and that was really illuminating
to me because I grew up living,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.740
like I said, you know, summers
in Oklahoma and school years

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.800
in -- mostly in Europe,
actually.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:15.240
And so I felt very close
to my heritage, you know,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.310
because I just knew
my relationship

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.640
with this country was -- on
one hand it was just kind

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.150
of like a -- you know, my
father was in the Embassy,

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:25.820
so it was a very
formalized relationship

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.310
to the United States, being
representative of that abroad.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.470
And at the same time,
my relationship

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:39.060
with this country was -- I
knew I was from the land, too,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.510
and I knew the stories.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.670
I thank my mother for telling
me the stories and the history.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.680
So since I was young I
-- we knew, you know,

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.520
our family was part
of who we are.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:54.030
Our family's dialogues,
where we came from.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:57.540
So my sense of multiplicity
in being --

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.080
I wouldn't say being divided,

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.380
because I don't feel
like it's a division.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.960
And when I went to the Institute
of American Indian Arts,

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.410
it was like -- it was great.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.510
I mean, as a kid, I got to
go to international schools,

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:12.160
and I met people from
all over the world,

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.710
the different languages
and cultures and religions.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.670
And then I went to the Institute
of American Indian Arts

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:21.590
and I got to be with people from
different languages and cultures

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.910
and ways of being in the world.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:27.110
And I just think that's
a beautiful thing.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:31.360
And I think that's
reflected in this book, too.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.660
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.960
Could you read a poem
that might reflect that?

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.260
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.560
I was thinking when
she was answering

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.670
of this poem by Sy Hoahwah.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:43.690
And Sy is -- he's Comanche
and Southern Arapaho.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.100
He's lived all over Oklahoma.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.200
I'm just reading this
through real quick.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.120
But he is also currently
living in Arkansas.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.420
And I always think
it's interesting

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.970
that people don't
think of Native people

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.420
in certain parts of the country.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.750
They're like, oh, they
don't have any Natives here

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.050
when I visit.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.350
But there he is in Arkansas.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.560
And I think like it helps
to think of this poem

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.420
as a graphic novel,
so each section is

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.320
like a little cartoon,
so if you can draw it

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.810
in your head while I read it.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.300
I'm going to switch glasses.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.550
Sorry. I'm old.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.660
Oops [laughter].

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.960
Throwing my glasses around.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.260
These are my grandpa glasses.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.670
"Anchor-Screws of Culture."

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:30.330
After watching the deceased
Comanche Nation princess get

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.670
snagged on an anchor
screw as she crawled

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:42.390
out of the mausoleum, the first
groundskeeper retrieved a pair

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.770
of hedge-clippers.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:53.550
But was chased by a swarm of
bees in the shape of a big hand.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:42:00.530
Second groundskeeper brandished
his brand new cordless drill.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.290
He just had a birthday.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.490
Third groundskeeper
quickly made the oil

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:13.110
and gasoline mixture
for the weed-eaters.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:16.910
Fourth groundskeeper
put out his cigarette

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.960
on the back of a concrete lamb.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:26.600
And the fifth groundskeeper
hooked up water hoses,

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.620
but stopped to help a
spider loosen its fangs

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.140
from an empty grasshopper.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:39.790
The clouds went by
like a Two-Step dance.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:44.650
Instantly I fell in love
with the Comanche culture all

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.240
over again [laughter].

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.470
So to me that kind of
answers that question

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.960
of how do you negotiate
things you think about.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.200
And Sy has like lots of vampires
and zombies in his poetries,

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.000
very much the contemporary, you
know sensibility of that goth

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.800
or post-goth, you know,

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.310
post-apocalyptic
kind of worldview.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.510
But also centered on
Comanche culture, so.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.810
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:17.610
Let's talk about the cover.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:19.520
Since you asked, is
there a way to show it

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.610
up on the screens
where you can see it.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:25.210
This beautiful, beautiful image.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:26.510
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
Yeah, the image --

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.810
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Shamenda
Tui [assumed spelling].

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.620
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah,
Shamenda Tui who is a Dine poet

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.650
who couldn't be in
the collection.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.410
He was working on a new
book-length poem essentially,

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.960
and it just -- he didn't
yet feel he could be part

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.590
of the collection, or it
could separated it out..

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:48.400
Sherman -- Sherwin was
showing his photographs on,

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.810
I don't know, Instagram
or somewhere,

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:51.730
and I really got intrigued
by them, and I said, oh,

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:53.030
I didn't know you
were an artist.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.370
He said, yeah, I paint
and I do photographs.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.800
So eventually when they
asked about a cover,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.660
I suggested this piece of
artwork with his permission.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.550
It was taken in Hawaii
and it was just a piece

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.880
of driftwood found on the beach.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.110
And I thought it was really
beautiful and full of hope

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.420
and kind of a sense
of uplift, you know,

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.070
uplifting of us as people.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.960
It wasn't until we were actually
in production that I found

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.520
out that the hand is not
Sherwin's, which I assumed.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.740
It is the hand of Laura
Ortman who you performed with.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.080
She's a concert violinist?

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.380
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Yeah.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.680
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
And a composer.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.980
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: In Brooklyn.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.310
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: And
her Native Nation is?

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:35.610
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Oh, I don't know.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.910
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
I can't remember.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:38.210
But she's a Native
woman as well.

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:39.510
So I just --

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:42.110
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: -- you
know, I thought that was just

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.440
so perfect that, you know, this
art and music and, you know,

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.760
we holistically -- cultures
don't separate those things.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.030
Ojibwe people, we
sing our poems.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.410
You know, we may not
have great voices,

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:52.710
but that doesn't
matter [laughter].

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.610
You sing your dreams,
your living poems, your --

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.640
you know, that's what you do,
that's what you're supposed

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.390
to do, and that's what people
did for, you know, millennia.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:03.400
And that's true of
many cultures,

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.370
so like I love it the --

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.800
you know, the separations
are not there.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.500
A lot of the poets are
also visual artists --

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.800
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.640
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: --
musicians, among other things.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.940
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Yeah.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.880
I should say that if you'd like
to see Laura Ortman perform,

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:22.970
you can watch the webcast of the
Witter Bynner Fellowship Reading

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:26.770
with Allison Hedge Coke who
brought Laura to the Library

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:28.580
and performed the poem
with her and a whole band.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.840
It was an amazing experience

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.090
and it clearly made
true what you're talking

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:40.900
about about this multi
genre approach to poetry.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.270
You talked a little bit
about being surprised

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.810
by the poets you
didn't know about.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.750
Can maybe both of you can
talk a little bit more

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:54.290
about what surprised
you in this anthology --

00:45:54.290 --> 00:46:03.630
poems, poets, themes, ways
of negotiating, questions.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:05.890
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah.

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:11.560
I didn't know about Jillian
Telemontes Beraski [assumed

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.250
spelling] who uses
the pronoun "itch"

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:20.420
and it has this amazing use of
all types of English language

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:25.370
as well as some of indigenous
language and many of the poets

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:29.270
that I got attracted to use
indigenous language, too,

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:33.160
in their work or -- I shouldn't
say used because it's, you know,

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.760
evoked it, expressed
within their own languages.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.190
And that was a part of my
taste in the work was to look

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.760
at those poems and
be inclusive of them.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.740
Some are not translated
such as Gwen Westermann's --

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.640
one of her Dakota poems.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.380
Some are translated
within the text.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.110
Some are just meant for
an audience of those

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.510
who could read the language
and I couldn't read them all.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.090
So -- but to me the -- our
language teachers tell us

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.060
that we want to speak
the original languages

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.130
of this place, and it's
part of our future.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.570
It's not part of our past.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:07.810
It's part of our future
and our continuation.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:11.270
So however you need to do,
whether it's through poetry

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:14.620
or teaching kids, you
know, it doesn't matter.

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.980
So that surprised me.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.290
You know, playfulness.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.720
A lot of the people think
of the sadness and the sort

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.180
of backward glancing or
nostalgia made of poetry.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.940
And these are playful poems.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:30.880
These are poems with
serious intent but funny, so.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Yeah.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:37.960
I think what I love about it
and that always surprises me --

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.830
and the poems are good poems

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.500
because they're surprising
every time you read them.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.380
And I think I did
an excellent job

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:50.110
of choosing the poems
nd choreographing a book

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.930
because it reveals just
the diversity of poetics,

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.110
not just themes, but poetics.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.410
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Mm-hmm.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:59.990
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster:
You know, we have a range

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:04.500
of poetic modes going on in this
book, from documentary poetics

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:09.060
and different kind
of syntactical play

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:17.720
and narrative work and different
even like typographies and,

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:21.630
you know, using -- some poets
use the page in a very open way

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:26.490
and others are very lyrical with
stanzas and -- I just love that.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.610
It shows a variety
of poetics as well.

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:30.910
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:32.210
I think I was attracted
to that, too.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:37.440
Just, you know, getting a sense
of the voice of that poet.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.740
So from their first book --

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.040
I include something

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.540
from everybody's first
book except for one person.

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.840
I just couldn't.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.150
But all the way through
to their most current work

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.750
and unpublished works, so.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:51.550
I'm going to read
one of the poems

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:52.850
from [inaudible] first book.

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:55.540
It's really quick and it's
-- I'm going to try --

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.160
Trevino's got a great voice.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.460
It's very deep.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:03.300
I can't quite do it, but
-- For the Sake of Beauty.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:10.350
On the phone, I asked her to
wear a full buckskin outfit

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:16.360
and she could be the beauty
that would make me steal horses.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.700
She said, She didn't
have a buckskin outfit.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:25.660
I said I would make her one,
but use the pages from books.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.680
A week later, when she
came over to my place,

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.330
she asked if I'd made an outfit.

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:33.720
I said no.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.340
I couldn't bring
myself to hunt the books

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:42.660
on my shelf [laughter] even if
it were for food or clothing.

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:46.050
I couldn't bring myself
to kill even if it was

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.990
for the sake of beauty
[applause].

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:49.290
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Amazing.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:50.930
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: That's a
lovely poem [inaudible].

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.730
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
That's Trevino --

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:55.570
[ Applause ]

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:56.870
But, yeah.

00:49:56.870 --> 00:50:00.320
I mean I was surprised by many
things and attracted to things

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.560
that were different, you know.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.940
Had I done the book in year two
if I'd finished the manuscript,

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.480
it would have been very
different from what I was able

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:14.070
to finish in 2017 because my
taste broadened, my ability,

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:17.200
my understanding of poets,

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.750
especially GLBTQ plus two
spirit poets really changed

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:28.230
and I was more appreciative
of the works.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:31.820
And found them because they'd
been marginalized, too, so.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.350
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: It's interesting
that you bring that up.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.100
What I meant, publishing
this anthology now.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.860
And, of course, you're
not only an editor,

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.160
you're a great poet yourself.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.680
I'm interested in how
the two of you felt --

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.980
how you felt about having --

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.670
doing this anthology
now for you as a poet.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:50.610
And, Jennifer, I'm interested in
what this anthology meant coming

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:53.220
up now for you as opposed to,
say, when you were working

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.880
on your first book or first
discovering the great wealth

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.730
and new writers around
the country.

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:03.710
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster:
Well, I'm glad it came

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:05.660
out when it did [laughter].

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.940
I think because some of
the poets in this book,

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.420
their first book
did just come out.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.720
Tacey, right?

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.020
Her first book --

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.320
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Tacey, 2018.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster: --

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:18.920
her first book <i>Rain
Scald </i>just came out.

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.280
And so it allowed those
voices to be in it, too.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.580
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Mm-hmm.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.880
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster:
I was grateful for that.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.180
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: And then --

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.480
I mean, these poets
have been writing

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.780
for 10/15 years most of them.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.080
They just couldn't
get published.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.060
Tommy Pico now has three books,
boom-boom-boom, right in a row,

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.290
and he -- and winning
national awards.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:35.720
But he could not get published.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.200
I think [inaudible] that -- I
think he sent it out 27 times,

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.500
which is a lot of work.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.100
Sending a book of
poetry out takes a --

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.270
you have to wait
for it to come back,

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.570
you have to produced
the manuscript,

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.630
you have to fill
out an author form.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.350
You have to do so much to
get those books out there,

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:51.710
and you know, with no hope

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.790
of getting any money
out of the deal.

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.090
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: No [laughter].

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:57.390
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: So,
you know, it's something,

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:58.690
it's a contest, et cetera.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.340
So these poets were
out there struggling

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.760
to be heard, a lot of them.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.140
And I was just grateful

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:08.400
that they shared their
first successes with me.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.860
I was really grateful for that
because they didn't have to.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.710
A lot of them didn't know me.

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.960
They weren't maybe even hooked

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.140
in with the Native
Writing Community until --

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.790
which is still forming.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:22.420
It really has grown a lot
in the past 10 years, so --

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.820
I don't think we're
a school of poetry

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.780
because our poetics
are not prescribed,

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.220
but we are a community, an
intimate community as he said

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.520
for better or for worse.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.820
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Yeah.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.120
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: There is that
larger question, though,

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.600
of what's happened in
the even five years.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.440
It's interesting to
see in the September,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.940
2018 issue of <i>The Atlantic </i>.

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.000
They had a big article by
Jesse Lichtenstein called

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.720
"How Poetry Came to Matter
Again," which is a play off

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.120
of Dana Gioia's "Can
Poetry Matter" article

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.970
that was so foundational.

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.470
And he talks about all sorts

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:59.400
of poets including
Layli Long Soldier.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.190
But it was very exciting to
feel that after many years

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:08.910
of seeing articles about the
death of poetry, about poetry

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:12.460
as elitist, and not
connected to the lives

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.050
of "ordinary Americans,"
quote/unquote, to see a kind

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:17.940
of sea change in the
major media and at

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.570
that same time there's
an explosion of all sorts

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:24.140
of exciting young poets from all
sorts of parts of the country

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:29.380
who are, I think, expanding our
sense of what poetry can mean.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.090
But why do you think
suddenly there are a bunch

00:53:32.090 --> 00:53:35.620
of exciting new poets or
poets who have been writing

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.780
and something, as you
say with Tom Pico,

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.840
boom-boom-boom, three
books in a row?

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.140
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Mm-hmm.

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:44.330
Well I think the -- just
the diversity of the --

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:49.630
or our country, of America,
of the U.S., and the diversity

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:56.120
and growth of Native Nations is
allowing for that possibility.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:01.120
And I think people are
interested in hearing voices

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.730
that are not their own.

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:06.110
And there's more of an openness
to that, especially in poetry.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:08.380
The audience is much
younger and we now know

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.070
from the NEA study
the performed work

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:14.760
of poetry has come
back into play.

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.650
And for Native poets, I think
that has always been a thing,

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:19.160
the idea of performance
of poetry,

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.460
although it's perfectly fine

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.610
to have somebody
who doesn't perform.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:26.010
It's a little harder, but
I perform my work more

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.270
than I publish it in
journals or magazines

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:29.640
because I want a relationship

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.230
with the people I'm
performing to and with.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:35.570
I want to have that
moment of human connection.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:37.490
So I think part of it is that.

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:40.830
But probably the main
thing is just social media

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.130
and the Internet.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:43.430
You could get a following.

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:46.220
You could get some way to --

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.220
if I couldn't just throw an
email off to Jeff Shotts,

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.550
this never would have happened
because I wouldn't have dared

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:54.430
to go like knock on the door
and make an appointment and talk

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:58.300
to Jeff who is the greatest,
sweetest, most humble person

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:02.490

impact on American poetry.

in the place --

time of pretty numbing rhetoric.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:20.670

like none other.

in introducing Natalie while she
catches her breath and drinks,

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:58.420

love in this collection is sort

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.730
of an essay in American

have a critical taste.

Race is a funny word.

1.9% of all police killings,

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.440
Did you have difficulties in --

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:13.370
did you have difficulties

What was your criteria for --

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:20.190
how did you decide that these
words are going to be in

and did you have a sort
of timeline or are you --

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.320
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Yeah.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.620
&gt;&gt; -- looking at the
criteria of their work?

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.070
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: Well,
first they had to be poets

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:31.790
who engaged me in general,
beyond the list that,

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:33.780
and that I felt that
had an audience.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.760
That was important to me,
too, that there were folks

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.280
who were reading these poets
and were interested in them.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.210
It wasn't about the
age of the poets.

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:42.010
It was about when they
published their first book

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:47.460
from the year 2000
forward, and, in general,

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.940
I make decisions very quickly.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:55.090
I knew what I wanted
and I just chose --

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:58.920
and luckily I was allowed to
just choose out of my own taste

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.640
and my own sense of
how the whole was going

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.940
to come together.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.560
I did require that people
have some specific connection

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.930
to a Native Nation however.

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.170
That was one of my -- I'm
not about blood [inaudible]

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:15.660
or descendancy or race
or anything about that.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.880
And I also wanted people
from different directions

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.010
of geography in the country
so that I got a sense

01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:22.460
of the land, you know.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.850

have relatives on the borders

of the U.S. as well as folks
from all over, and Guam

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.490
and Hawaii and Alaska,
to make sure

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:39.230
that we understand ourselves
as part of Native Nations

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:41.510
that are connected under
this political entity

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:44.290
of the U.S. It's really
important to me because I think

01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:48.890
that more and more we will face
challenges to our Nationhood,

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:54.780
and I want us to have bodies of
expression that can meet that

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:58.980
and to teach the American
public that we persist

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:02.640
as Nations regardless of who's
going to come for our resources

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.940

&gt;&gt; Hi. There's a lot
of talk these days

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:20.010
about cultural appropriation,
but I'm sure

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:21.920
that you also want many people

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.670
to read this anthology
far beyond, you know,

01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:28.350
from all cultures,
nationalities,

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:30.420
and that you want those
people, if they're writers,

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.630
to be influenced by the
writers in the book.

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:36.610
So I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit

01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:43.050
about being influenced by
writers of other nationalities

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:45.540
or other cultures
besides your own,

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:50.900
and cultural appropriation
on the other hand.

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.100
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise Foerster:
I got just my first thought,

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.270
I'll just speak to that,
is that when I'm influenced

01:08:56.270 --> 01:09:00.840
by other writers,
influenced poetically,

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.030
then it's because I'm
engaged with their poetics.

01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:08.680
And that may or may not -- of
course, one's poetics is always

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.570
about who they are,

01:09:10.570 --> 01:09:15.140
which includes culture
and all of that.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:20.970
But I think the richness
of poetry in the world is

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:25.610
that we can be influenced by
one another in our poetics

01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:29.710
and that love of each other's
poetics, whether it's --

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:31.940
we're resonant with it
or we have differences

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.430
with it is another way that we
can be a conversation and be

01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:39.440
in conversation as humans
with our differences.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.730
And so I don't think that
it has to do necessarily --

01:09:42.730 --> 01:09:47.310
it doesn't have to do with
appropriation to be, to listen,

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:50.120
and listening is part
of that influence.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.420
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
One of the things

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.850
that I did a little differently
with the anthology was to have

01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:58.390
in the biography people
answer certain questions

01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:01.780
in the author bio, so they talk
about who their influences are

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.970
in those bios or they talk
about who mentored them

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:05.770
so you can see the connections.

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:09.150
Mostly Native writers
mentoring one another,

01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:11.840
even some of the people in the
book mentoring one another.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.470
But also, you know, the poets
that are meaningful to them,

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:21.720
so you see that sort of
generational influence I think.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.150
&gt;&gt; Natalie Diaz:
And appropriation --

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.220
we always forget this, like
appropriation has a lot to do

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.400
with the fact that
you're erasing the people

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.300
who you have taken from.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.410
You know, like America
loves to wear a headdress

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:35.060
and they would much rather --

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.420
I mean, they do nothing
to take care of Natives

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.720
or to give them a place to --

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.080
you know, we couldn't
even practice our religion

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.480
until 1978, yeah, you know,

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.980
like some of us weren't
even born then.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.210
And so I think that's
something, too, is like --

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:50.650
and always to ask
yourself why, like why,

01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:52.510
why is this necessary to write?

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:56.060
Like I think in the book
you can see the necessity,

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:59.880
like these things had to be
written for these writers.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.650
And so I think that's
something to consider, too,

01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:05.550
with influences like when you
find something that, you know --

01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:08.050
it has -- so we always use
that word like, I like this.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:09.850
But, really, it's because
it showed you something

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:12.360
of your life or it showed you
something of your own world.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.660
And you don't have to be Native

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.970
to see our world we're
all living in in this book

01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:20.450
or the pains that we sometimes
suffer, you know, even if it's

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:22.780
across culture or across Nation.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:25.570
And so I think that's
something important, too,

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:29.450
is that appropriation is
not just the influence

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:30.860
or engaging in a conversation.

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:35.850
But it's also like the
obliteration or erasure

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:39.300
of the person who that came
from, whose work that came from.

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:43.700
So I think that's an important
thing to jump into the equation.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.000
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Okay.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.300
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich:
We're at time.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.600
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: We're at time.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.900
One more quick question.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.200
Your one quick question.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.500
&gt;&gt; Well, I just heard you talk

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.800
around about having
the discussion

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.670
within the poetry community
and that a lot of the poems

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:59.330
in the book are sort of a
discussion back and forth.

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:01.290
And I'm wondering
what the mechanics

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:02.590
of that discussion are.

01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:04.630
Is this when you get
together in person?

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:06.560
Are you communicating
through email?

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.610
You know, how is this
discussion going on

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:12.490
and how are you helping
each other?

01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:15.160
&gt;&gt; Heid E. Erdrich: I'm going
to say the simplest answer,

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.550
yes and no [laughter].

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:17.850
And I'm so sorry.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:21.800
I have to happily talk to you
about what I mean by that.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.490
It's more of a poetics
than it is an actual thing.

01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:29.150
But I wanted to say in the
Nishnabe we say [foreign words]

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:34.170
which means thank you
for listening to me.

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:35.970
That's about enough.

01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:48.400
[ Applause ]

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.700
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Thanks
all for coming.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.000
Thanks all for coming.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.270
The booksigning should be on --
I think its at 12:30/1 o'clock.

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:56.530
It should be on your app, the
National Book Festival app.

01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:57.830
Hope to see you soon.

01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:59.130
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Elise
Foerster: Thank you.
