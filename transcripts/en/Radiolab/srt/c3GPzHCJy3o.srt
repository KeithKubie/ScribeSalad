00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Hey everyone. I'm Jad Abumrad.
This is radiolab, the podcast.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,940
Every so often on a radio lab,

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,140
we set aside the science and we set
aside the big ideas and we just play some

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:14,610
music or I should say every so often on
the podcast we have that opportunity.

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:17,070
So I wanted to do that again today.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,070
Also to invite you guys who,

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,850
who like radio lab to check out
this other series that I am hosting,

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,720
a couple of different shows we're putting
together on the wordless music concert

9
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:32,520
series, which is a really,
really innovative concert
series here in New York.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,120
It's curated by a guy named Ronan
vone. Basically what he does,

11
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,060
it's very simple. He
takes classical musicians,

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,090
puts them on the same bill as
rock musicians because it is his,

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:44,880
uh,

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,450
opinion and I agree with this that the
music's do have something to say to each

15
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:52,380
other. So I'll be hosting a couple of
those shows. I hope you can listen,

16
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:56,280
but here is an excerpt
of one of my favorite,

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,540
favorite all time favorite bands
that performed as part of the series.

18
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:05,541
Stars of the lid is probably the
inventor of a certain kind of,

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,130
well, I don't know if
they're the inventor, maybe
Brian Enou is the inventor,

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,680
but they perfected a certain
kind of pop, ambient,

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,090
serene,

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,950
dreamy kind of narcoleptic thing
that is particularly their own.

23
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,200
And they performed recently at a,

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,410
the good shepherd faith church as part
of the word, this music concert series.

25
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:30,411
They played two selections from their
latest release and their refinement of the

26
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,820
decline. So I want to play this for you.

27
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:35,340
Now the people that are
going to hear are, uh,

28
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,880
Brian McBride and Adam Bryan bomb.
They are the founding members of star,

29
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:42,420
the lead, and they're going to
be joined by Ella Bruce on Viola.

30
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:46,860
Kate O'Brien on violin
and Juliet Kent on Cello.

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,090
Here they are stars of the lid at the
Good Shepherd Faith Church in Manhattan.

32
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,290
Uh, this next piece, uh, is
called requiem for dying mothers.

[inaudible] [inaudible]

110
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,020
two pieces by the bands,

111
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:56,010
stars of the lid that was
recorded recently at the
Good Shepherd Faith Church in

112
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:59,600
Manhattan as part of the wordless
music concerts series to perform,

113
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,110
as you heard were the founding
members, Brian McBride and Adam.

114
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,670
Brian Balm along with

115
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,460
Ella Baroo Shun Viola Kate O'Brien
on violin and Julia Kent on Cello.

116
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:12,750
There was also, by the way,

117
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,170
a visual artist Luke
Savitsky showing tape loops,

118
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:23,040
sort of like super eight tape film loops
that he layer one on top of the other.

119
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,510
To create these sort of like textual,
uh, visual escapes to match the music.

120
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,660
You can sort of vaguely conjure
that in your mind and aid case.

121
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,700
You can hear the complete wordless
music concert at Wny C. Dot. Org.
