00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.680
After these messages...

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.340
We'll be right back!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.140
Yeah, this one launches the nostalgic feels.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.800
It's the first commercial for Super Smash Bros. on Nintendo 64.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.100
Now it's a commonplace idea to see your favorite lovable characters beat the shit out of each other,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.020
but back then, seeing these cuddly cuteballs skip was pretty shocking when it was followed by this.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.300
Good Lord!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.860
Suddenly, it's Joaquin Phoenix from Gladiator looking over an enchanted bloodbath!

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.400
Narrator: Something's gone wrong in the happy-go-lucky world of Nintendo.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.880
NC: What I like is before you realize it's all going this direction, it just looks like Mario snapped at Yoshi.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.080
What the hell did he do?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.380
Did he have a flashback to when he was a baby and Yoshi failed to protect him?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.660
(as Mario): Never forgive, asshole!

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.160
(as DK): You're a dickhead, Mario!

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.940
(as Mario): You're-a the dickhead!

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.440
[Verbally (as well as physically) abusing each other]

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.260
10 points to whoever threw Pikachu twice, by the way.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.140
(as Pikachu): Pika, NOOOOOO!

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.240
Why were they even skipping if they were just gonna fight?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.600
Is it like A Clockwork Orange where Mario knew he was gonna jack them up?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.200
(as Mario): I was calm on the outside but thinking all of the time.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.940
So now it was Yoshi the general saying what to do and what not to do.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.540
Well, I viddied what to do.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.000
Couldn't you just get revenge by dropping off another cliff?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.500
We know the Yoshi species are like socks to you.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.180
Ultra violent as hell, but pretty funny, too, this commercial hits hard in the laughs.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.460
Narrator: Only on Nintendo 64.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.340
Alex: I was cured, alright.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800

NC: Hey, kids, wanna eat your bling?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
Seek help, and then seek a Ring Pop.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.620
Boy 2: Will you wear my ring?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.900
NC: It's a catchy jingle and a typical setup,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.700
but it is one of those few commercials that have me constantly asking the question:

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.280
What happened after?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.700
I know, I know, these are just playful scenarios to set up jokes, but what if they didn't cut away?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.380
How would the rest of these scenes play out?

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.580
Boy 2: Will you wear my ring?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.400
Seriously, where's the ring, though?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500
(as Boy 2): Well, I, uh...uh...

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.720
(as Girl 2): You kept a box behind your back saying "Will you wear my ring?"

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.700
You do not screw with a girl when it comes to this!

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.320
(as Boy 2): W-well, I got some Tootsie Rolls, if you're interested in any of those.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.520
(as Girl 2): Oh, look, I can turn it around and wear on the inside.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.700
(as Boy 2): What does it have to do with-

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.460

NC: Ok, what the hell?

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.420
You told me there was a ring, I thought I was fighting the school bully.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.700
I was pissing myself with fear when it was all just a pun for edible jewelery?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.300

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.460

Man 1: Can I get some milk, please?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.620
Man 2: She got the last one.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.500
NC: Believe it or not, there was a time when the funniest commercials you could watch were milk commercials.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.040
Yeah, in the early 90s milk sales were down,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.120
so the California Milk Processor Board hired renowned advertising agency, Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners to make milk...

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.660
well, kinda cool!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.100
But how do you do that?

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.180
But how do you do that? It's milk!

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.560
I mean, this was their advertising campaign before:

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.020
NC: Clearly, it didn't have that big an effect!

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.340
But with the catchphrase of only 2 words, "Got milk?",

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.200
suddenly, milk was hilarious.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.160
Batcave Announcer: Attention, attention! Family thinks high toy price is a joke!

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.080

Kermit: Oh, I see.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.600

Wow. Again, I went really dark on that one.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.800
Really dark.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.520
I am The Nostalgia Critic and...

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.820
I don't know why I look forward to this every year.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.020
I think I'm sick. REALLY SICK.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:04.440

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.120
Goddamn crumpets? Are you shitting me?!

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.940
We're the friggin' Muppets, not Teletubbies! (Kermit's head then hits the empty bottle of beer, it rolls and falls on the floor)

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:06.820
No! No! My grandpa- (hits on the phone rapidly) Noooo! (Everyone in the room laughs)

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.060
