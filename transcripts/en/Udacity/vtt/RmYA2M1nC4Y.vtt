00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.070
There are, however, some issues with design methods. You as a architect or

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.520
designer have to make some choice. Are you going to go do things top down,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.378
bottom up, inside out? There are a variety of choices there.

00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:16.827
Are you going to begin by thinking of the procedures and functions? Or

00:00:16.827 --> 00:00:20.331
are you going to begin by thinking in terms of the nouns and objects like you

00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:24.320
would with objectory development. A topic which we'll come back to later in

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.290
the lesson is the issue of conceptual integrity versus cooperative development.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.460
An important decision in many, software development shops is the trade off or

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.400
the tension between doing a design that takes a little bit more time.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.680
In order to save yourself effort and money in the long term,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.030
by supporting maintainable and general structures. Or are you going to be

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.950
dominated by short term delivery schedule. And finally, is the role of tools.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.610
What, what tools are you going to use in terms of your particular design.
