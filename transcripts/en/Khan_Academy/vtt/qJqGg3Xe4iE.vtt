00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:02.262
- [Instructor] In a previous
video, we asked ourselves

00:00:02.262 --> 00:00:04.112
a very important question.

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:08.340
As the moon has its 28-day
cycle around the Earth,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.151
we talked about how a
new moon is when the moon

00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:14.878
is between the earth and the
sun, and so from the Earth's

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:17.845
point of view, or from the
point of view of someone

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:20.421
standing on Earth, you're
seeing the side of the moon

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.892
that is not lit up.

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:24.106
But an obvious question is
why doesn't that block out

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:27.728
the sun every time we are
in a new moon position?

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:32.621
After all, the sun would be out
here, 93 million miles away,

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:37.047
and so wouldn't the moon block
out the sun in that scenario?

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:38.873
And we also talked about
when the moon is on the other

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:42.196
side of the Earth, when we
would typically see a full moon,

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:45.859
the Earth is between the moon and the sun.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.952
Why doesn't the Earth block
the light from the sun

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:51.291
that's being reflected on the moon?

00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:54.055
So the big question is, why
don't we see a solar eclipse

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:57.177
every new moon and why
don't we see a lunar eclipse

00:00:57.177 --> 00:00:58.975
every full moon?

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.520
If we wanna ask the same
question, looking at the scale

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.767
of the Earth and the moon,
we can see it right over here

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.114
and so this would be the new moon position

00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.850
where the moon is between
the Earth and the sun.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.869
The key explanation for why
we do not have a solar eclipse

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.630
every time we are in the new moon position

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.707
is that the rotation of
the moon around the Earth

00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:23.874
is not in the exact same
plane as the rotation

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.207
of the Earth around the sun.

00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:30.759
It actually turns out that the
plane of the moon's rotation

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.423
is at a five-degree angle with the plane

00:01:33.423 --> 00:01:35.506
of the Earth and the sun.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.141
If this is the sun here, and
this is not drawn to scale

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:42.047
by any means, this is the
Earth, and so the Earth

00:01:42.047 --> 00:01:45.130
is in its orbit, something like that,

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:50.462
the moon's orbit does not
sit exactly in this plane,

00:01:50.462 --> 00:01:52.654
it does not sit exactly in this plane,

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:56.018
the moon's orbit is at
a five-degree angle,

00:01:56.018 --> 00:01:58.409
is at a five-degree angle to this plane,

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.746
so depending what time of year you are at

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:02.604
and where the moon is in its cycle,

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:06.779
the moon will often sit
above or below the plane

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:10.946
of the Earth's orbit, so for
example, from the vantage point

00:02:11.888 --> 00:02:16.055
of the Earth, the moon will
vary up to five degrees

00:02:18.893 --> 00:02:21.883
above the plane of Earth's
rotation around the sun,

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:26.584
often known as the ecliptic,
and five degrees below that.

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:30.347
And so you can see here,
the shadow of the moon

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:34.188
will only fall on the Earth
when the moon is crossing

00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:37.911
through the plane of the
rotation of Earth around the sun.

00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:42.332
Many times, the moon might
be here or here or here

00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:47.299
and in those times, the
shadow will not hit the Earth.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.780
Now what you do see here,
depicted in this picture,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.069
would be a solar eclipse.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.269
Now there's two things
that I've drawn here

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.856
and this is important for
understanding a solar eclipse,

00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:59.682
what you see in those yellow lines,

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:02.907
that's the umbra of the
moon, so if you are in,

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:05.559
if you're at that point right
over here in this picture,

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.718
then the moon will
completely block out the sun

00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:11.513
and it turns out depending
on the solar eclipse,

00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:14.275
where that umbra is hitting the Earth,

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:16.962
it might only be a few
hundred miles where the moon

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:19.696
completely blocks out the sun.

00:03:19.696 --> 00:03:23.315
What you see in this dark blue
color, that is the penumbra,

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:26.057
that is the outer shadow and
if you're in one of those

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:30.727
areas, you will see the moon
partially block out the sun.

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:32.852
Now this is the exact same reason,

00:03:32.852 --> 00:03:36.088
the fact that the plane of its
rotation is at a five-degree

00:03:36.088 --> 00:03:38.231
angle with the plane of
rotation of the Earth

00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.258
around the sun, that's also
the reason why we don't see

00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:43.758
a lunar eclipse every 28 days.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.380
Here we see different
scenarios where the moon

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.594
is on the other side
of Earth from the sun,

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:54.798
when the moon is what we would
call a full moon position,

00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:57.567
and as we can see, it can
vary five degrees above

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:00.219
the plane of the Earth and
the sun or five degrees

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.377
below that and you're only
going to get a scenario

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:08.377
of a lunar eclipse when
the moon happens to fall

00:04:09.943 --> 00:04:12.875
in the shadow of the
Earth and here once again,

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:16.555
between the yellow
lines, you see the umbra,

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:20.616
and between the blue lines,
you see the penumbra,

00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:23.042
which would be kind of a partial shadow.

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:25.226
So next time you look up at the moon,

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.145
hopefully you are armed
with a lot more information

00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:30.704
to think about how it's oriented
with respect to the Earth.

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.590
In fact, now when you
look at the moon at night,

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.503
you can usually look at the
moon and tell which direction

00:04:35.503 --> 00:04:37.940
the sun is in and based on
that, you can even think about

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.845
what time of day it is
and you could figure out

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:43.550
east, west, north, and south.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.619
And we've talked a lot
about the sun, in fact,

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.500
this entire video and the one before it

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.431
is all about light from the sun.

00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:51.769
And just to finish off
with a little bit of awe,

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:55.491
let's just appreciate how
large and how far the sun is.

00:04:55.491 --> 00:04:58.315
As we mentioned before, this
is a scaled representation

00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:01.271
of the Earth and the moon,
the moon being roughly

00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:04.111
240,000 miles away from Earth.

00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.969
If we were to try to model the sun here,

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.425
it is 400 times as far,
depending on your screen size,

00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:12.966
it would be a football field to the right

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:15.441
of your screen and you
would have something

00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:19.103
roughly the size of a beach
ball to represent the sun.

00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:21.624
If you wanted to just
compare the sizes of the sun

00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:24.874
to the Earth and the moon, here you go.

00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.362
The sun is huge.
