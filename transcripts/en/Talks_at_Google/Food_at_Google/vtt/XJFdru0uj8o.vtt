JENNA TAYLOR: My
name's Jenna Taylor.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.834
I'm the newest member
of the Google Food team,

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:06.750
here in Mountain View.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.110
And I'm delighted to be your
facilitator for today's talk

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.410
at Google.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.800
We're very lucky to be joined
this afternoon by James Beard

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.000
award winner for Best Chef
California, San Francisco

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170
magazine's chef of the
year, chef Michael Mina.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.270
As many of you guys
know, Chef Mina

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.900
is founder of the Mina Group,
a restaurant management

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.880
company operating 26
restaurants around the country.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.760
And joining Chef Mina today
is Mina Group president,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.610
Patric Yumul.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.350
Mr. Yumul started working
with Chef Mina in 1999,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.200
and has since helped
grow the brand

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.180
from four restaurants to 26.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970
Clearly, it's a
magical partnership.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.890
Thank you both so much
for being with us today.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.370
I know I have some
questions, based

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.260
on my having followed your
career and your Instagram,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.810
frankly, for some time.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.910
And then, we would love
to open it up to questions

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.490
from the audience, as well.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.710
All right, sound good?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.835
MICHAEL MINA: Great, great.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:12.251
JENNA TAYLOR: So you've always
got something new going on.

00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:14.302
You guys have all these
restaurants and concepts.

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:16.510
Maybe tell us a little bit
about your newest project.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.140
MICHAEL MINA: Sure.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.490
Well, our newest
project-- last year

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.020
we did-- last year we opened
nine restaurants in a ten month

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.360
period.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.460
And they were fairly
significant restaurants,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.780
and not just restaurants.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.170
We actually did a market
in St. Petersburg.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.610
And so this year, our focus was
to really launch this-- what

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.160
we were calling a test kitchen.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.290
But we wanted to take a
much different approach

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.270
with the test kitchen.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.150
We didn't really
want to just create

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.250
a place to go and test recipes,
and create dishes, and then put

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.620
them in restaurants.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.960
We wanted the test kitchen to
serve a few different purposes.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.357
And really, the first purpose
was not just to test dishes.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:06.940
We wanted to get a
lot more out of it,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.020
which was test concepts--
test the complete concept.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.500
Be able to take
a concept, do it.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.930
And in this day and age, with
the way pop-ups have gone,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.320
and the ability
to say, OK, today,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.520
this restaurant is going
to be this concept.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.500
So we know we found a perfect
scenario, in the sense that it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.750
was a neighborhood restaurant.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.010
We really felt-- a
lot of our restaurants

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.290
are large restaurants.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.920
And they're usually
in major cities.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.800
A lot, obviously, here in
the Bay Area-- it's our home.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.990
But we wanted this to
be in a neighborhood,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.310
so we found a
restaurant space that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.400
was already built out
in a little building

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.190
that we could buy.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.010
And we created what we're
calling the Mina Test Kitchen.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.240
And it's just going to
continually change concepts.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.530
And it's on Greenwich Fillmore.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.880
So it's kind of right
down in Cow Hollow

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.730
neighborhood, close to
where Patrick lives.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.090
And it's like 45 seats, and
it has a great little kitchen

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.590
in it.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.010
And so we're doing a
concept, naming the concept,

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.670
and running it for three months.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.520
The first concept is
called middle terranian,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.350
and so it's Mediterranean
and the Middle East.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.220
And I was born in Egypt,
and so it's-- and my chef,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.210
corporate chef, who's kind
of our partner in this whole

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.610
thing, he has a lot
of Israeli background.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.160
And so what we're
doing is really

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.280
creating this first concept.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.420
It's a pop-up, and
what we'll do is

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.520
we'll run it for three months.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.380
We run it four nights a
week, and get real feedback.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.580
And then, three
months later, we'll

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.006
kind of redecorate a little,
and launch another concept.

00:03:58.006 --> 00:03:59.880
On the other days, that
we're not running it,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.671
those are days that
we'll be testing dishes

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:03.510
for the other restaurants.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.010
JENNA TAYLOR: That's exciting.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.640
Innovation-- kind of pushing
the envelope with a new idea.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.390
That's certainly
something that resonates,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.830
I think, with Googlers.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.930
MICHAEL MINA: Yeah, it's
kind of interesting,

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.554
because when you
really think about it,

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:17.899
it's something that could never
have been done 10 years ago.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.550
Because without all
of the everything

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.950
that's out there, the ways to
communicate what you're doing.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.801
We were laughing about
it the other day,

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.800
because what you're saying,
like with Instagram,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.210
and Facebook, and Twitter,
and all the different avenues

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.040
you have now to
get the word out,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.550
you could have
never done something

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.780
like this 10 years
ago, as a restaurateur.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.000
Because really, the only way you
were going to get a message out

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.190
to somebody was that
traditional PR--

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.200
go out, PR a restaurant
for a year, open it up.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.320
And then the only
photos anybody's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.680
ever going to see is when you
reviewed, or-- and now, it's

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.210
just obviously instantaneous,
what you can do,

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.400
and how you can message what
you're doing by the minute, as

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.580
opposed to really not
having-- really giving

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.970
people access to what you're
doing, what you're changing.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.590
So for us, it's going to be
fun, because each week we

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.421
can create new dishes.

00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:15.670
And then ultimately, the
goal is, within three months,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.500
to have a complete menu to take
that restaurant, if we like it,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.417
and then go open
it someplace else.

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:25.250
JENNA TAYLOR: And then
you have a little bit

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.215
of a fan base built in, so
you're getting a head start

00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.010
on opening up a real concept.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.880
Yeah, that's exciting.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.930
That's very exciting.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.410
So that's one thing
that I find fascinating

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.490
about your guys'
company and partnership,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.250
is that the way
you've found success--

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.729
with so many different concepts
in different locations.

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.520
Will you talk to us a
little bit about what

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.720
are those core threads,
that bind amongst all

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.150
of your restaurants?

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.100
Why do you think
they're all successful?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.240
PATRIC YUMUL: I think,
although there's

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.020
a lot of different restaurants,
it's really-- it's one thing.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.360
It's understanding
culture through food.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.160
And for us, we love to
discover, we love to explore,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.060
we love to travel.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.220
We love to connect to
people, to societies,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.100
to the civilizations.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.470
And so, we love to
kind of go to Japan,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.335
and understand the
history of Japan,

00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:21.465
and understand how
society works in Japan,

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:23.340
by going to different
restaurants and eating.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.860
It's the one common
thread that exists

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.040
throughout every culture,
throughout every society.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.620
Everybody has to
sustain themselves.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.120
Everybody has to
nourish themselves.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.780
They have to eat, they
have to come together,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.610
whether it's independently
or as a family.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.370
And so we're really obsessed
with understanding that.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.310
And then learning
about it, and then

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.820
sharing those
learnings with people.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.460
And it allows us to
have connections.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.765
And I think as humans, and as
husbands and fathers and wives

00:06:49.765 --> 00:06:52.390
and sisters and brothers, we all
want to connect to each other.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.580
We all want to feel like
we belong to something.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.210
And for us, it's telling
the story of food

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.670
that allows us to connect to
our guests, to our employees,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.200
to our heritage, our roots.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.520
With middle terrania,
that's allowing Michael,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.680
for the first time ever,
to connect back to the way

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.940
he ate every night
when he was growing up.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.810
And he kind of had to go a
long way to do it, right?

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.110
He went and studied French
cuisine, and modern cuisine,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.180
and expressed himself in
a lot of different ways

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.090
throughout the years.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:27.990
But now it's kind going back to
a very rudimentary beginning.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.740
I think it's going
to be very special.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.650
JENNA TAYLOR: So we talk
about this instantaneous

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.330
gratification of
technology, and we

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.520
talk about these old traditions
of coming together over food.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.400
So how do you, as
restaurateurs and chefs,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.090
find that balance between
technology and tradition,

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.820
and the ways that
those can interplay?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:58.170
MICHAEL MINA: Well, I mean, I
think that with technology, you

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.520
look at it obviously--
probably, I would say,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.250
three different categories.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.380
You look at the first one, which
is always the most important

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.380
to us, is, how is
anything going to help

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.190
us connect with our guests?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.910
I mean, you asked
about our philosophies,

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.270
or what's been kind
of the underlying

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.720
thread of our restaurants,
throughout all

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.610
of our restaurants.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.070
The one thing that we-- the
first restaurant I ever did

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.605
was called Aqua and it
was in San Francisco,

00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:30.730
on California Street.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.260
And I'd been in New York,
I'd been working in New York.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.080
But I was a west coast person.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.390
I was more-- my mindset was
a little more west coast

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.240
than east coast.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.859
And--

00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:45.150
PATRIC YUMUL: You grew up on
a [INAUDIBLE], Ellensburg,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.940
Washington, so.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.990
MICHAEL MINA: Yeah.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.650
And I always said that
we want the same level

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.110
of food, the same
level of service

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.370
that you get in New York.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.710
And this was back in '89.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.800
We opened in '91.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.200
I said, but with kind of the
friendliness of California--

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.370
the mindset of California.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.210
And the goal was always,
how do you-- we look at it,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.010
and we say, how do
you befriend people?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.670
How do you build long term
relationships with people?

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.640
Because that's what
it's all about.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.300
I mean, all of it, at the
end of the day-- there's

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.630
going to be great chefs.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.570
There's going to be
many more great chefs.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.040
For me, I've always--
I said from day one,

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.830
I'll never build
a whisper joint.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.290
And whisper joint, to me, is a
restaurant where you go into.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.060
And it could be
just spectacular.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.380
It could be the best food.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.140
It could be the best
showcase for me to cook,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.700
but where people feel
like they need to whisper,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.800
and they feel like that.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.841
And there's nothing wrong
with those restaurants,

00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:50.300
it's just not my personality.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.800
So I said from day one,
that's not what I want.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.910
And so Aqua was a
140 seat restaurant,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.430
trying to do four
star food, four star

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.630
service with a big, loud bar.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.800
And really, the city
had never seen anything

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.150
like that at the time, it was
really a different mindset.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.480
And so, there was going to
always be bumps in the road.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.010
So you really had to
befriend your customers,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.410
so that you could kind of
understand that energy.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.940
When you build
something where it's

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.300
so precious, when one
little thing goes wrong,

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.530
all of a sudden, really,
it goes from being

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.990
a very insignificant problem,
to a more significant problem.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.840
When you create a
certain environment

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.930
of just really hospitality
and relaxation, but very high

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.277
level food, very
high level service,

00:10:42.277 --> 00:10:43.860
I think that it gives
you that ability

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.340
to get people to be part of
what you're doing for a much

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.505
longer period of time.

00:10:49.505 --> 00:10:50.380
It's more accessible.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.250
People want to be relaxed.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.890
And so technology, in that
sense, with our guests,

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.459
has helped us tremendously.

00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:58.625
And Patrick can probably
talk about it more than me,

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:02.510
but we were the first ones--
when Open Table started,

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.360
we were one of the
original three restaurants,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.260
where they took
our-- from Aqua, they

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.450
took our reservation papers,
and we explained to them

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.120
how it all worked.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.610
And we were part of that,
from the very beginning.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.810
And seeing that as just
kind of that very first step

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.780
of technology, of how,
now all of a sudden,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.590
we actually had
information on our guests.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.110
It wasn't just--
we always had it,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.320
but it was always hand written,
you know, after they left.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.900
But when you cook a
meal for somebody,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.980
this is how my first
introduction to technology was.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.560
Mr. Johnson comes in, I cook
him a nine course menu, right?

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.944
He leaves, I have to
write it all down.

00:11:45.944 --> 00:11:47.360
The next time he
comes in, I gotta

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.110
remember everything
that I cooked for him,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.900
so I can cook him
a different menu.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:57.940
And really, technology-- my
very first encounter with it was

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.160
just kind of being able to
house everybody's-- what we are

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.920
cooking, what people's
allergies were.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.400
What people's likes and
dislikes, what their wine

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.340
preferences were-- all of
these things that just make you

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.740
be able to make your
guest feel much more

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.460
appreciated when they
come into your restaurant.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.360
That was kind of my
first experience with it.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.392
And now, it's unbelievable
what you can do.

00:12:23.392 --> 00:12:25.850
I mean, you can probably talk
a little bit more about that.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:26.683
PATRIC YUMUL: Right.

00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:29.510
I mean, our philosophy is
tech shouldn't replace touch.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.500
And we want to use
technology as a tool,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.410
in order to have better
experiences for not

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.130
just our guests, but
for our employees,

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.796
and for everybody
that's working for us.

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:43.550
So we've developed platforms
where-- the platform we have is

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.480
called recipe
exchange, where all

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.120
the dishes within the
restaurants are featured.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.370
It allows all the chefs
to kind of understand

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.230
what's going on in
all the restaurants,

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.290
as well it's a training tool for
the front of house employees,

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.580
and the back of house employees.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.710
Goes step by step in making a
dish, ingredient by ingredient.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:09.180
It's a very broad tool that
allows us to educate and train.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.050
So that that's one of
the ways technology

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.780
has allowed us to be better.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.754
With Instagram,
Facebook, Twitter,

00:13:17.754 --> 00:13:19.420
all the different
social media channels,

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.934
it allows us to kind of
broadcast our message,

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.850
and amplify what's going
on in the restaurant,

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.020
and help to narrate and tell
a story of what the guest

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.440
experience is going to be
like, or what the employment

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.330
experience is going to be like.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.240
So ultimately, whether it's
through training, hiring,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.520
recruiting, guest education,
guest engagement, follow up

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.680
with the guests-- those
are all the different ways

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.230
in which technology helps
you become a better operator.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.930
So at the end of the
day, a restaurant's

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.770
only open typically five to
six hours for dinner service.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.240
It allows you to
focus that whole time

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.019
on the real engagement
of human interaction.

00:13:58.019 --> 00:13:58.810
MICHAEL MINA: Yeah.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.750
I mean the recipe exchange,
it was a great example,

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.600
because I think we were
talking earlier about something

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.900
that-- about the way you
have to look at technology,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.400
the way you have
to think about what

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.230
you're trying to accomplish.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.690
We started it 10 years ago.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:20.951
We started because we realized
we are going to expand,

00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:22.950
and we were going to build
multiple restaurants.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.410
And in this day and
age, with the fact

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.700
that if you're not
using seasonal products

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.220
and you're not using
local products,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.440
then you're not
really cooking, you

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.670
know, to the best
of your ability,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.750
because it's just--
and so, if you're

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.170
going to have restaurants
all over the country,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.210
and if I'm going to say
that I actually am involved

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.950
in the food in all
of those restaurants,

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.103
and to truly be involved with
that chef who's in Washington,

00:14:50.103 --> 00:14:54.530
DC, I can't tell him that
the menu at Bourbon Steak

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.466
Washington, DC should be the
same as the menu at Bourbon

00:14:57.466 --> 00:14:59.090
Steak, San Francisco,
because they just

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.210
have different products.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.190
They have different seasons.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:08.370
And so just to approve all of
the menus, with 26 restaurants,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:13.580
I mean, you're talking about
hundreds of recipes a day

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.000
that come through to me.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.600
And so just to be
able to collect--

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:24.150
and we basically built this, we
built recipe exchange, and it--

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.320
so every time that we do a dish,
every time that a chef does

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.560
a dish, basically runs it for
three days at the restaurant.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.107
Runs it over a weekend.

00:15:32.107 --> 00:15:34.440
At the end of those three
days, if they're still in love

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.770
with the dish, then
they send it to me,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.360
and it has a photo of the
dish, the recipe of the dish,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.490
and what dish it's going
to replace on the menu.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.260
And then, I'll tell them
what I want changed on it

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.690
or not changed on
it, or whatever.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.705
And then, if I approve
it, then they'll

00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:53.330
do the costing of
the dish, and they'll

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.030
shoot a video of the dish.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.850
And that will all go on
to this site that we have.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.260
And so with 26 restaurants
now, and every dish, when

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.460
it comes off, gets archived.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.900
So there's over 35,000
recipes on the site,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.880
and it's all for the employees.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.960
1800 employees
have access to it.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.230
There's over 3,000 videos.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:20.920
And typically if you're
involved in restaurants at all,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.070
technology is very
hard to push on chefs.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.920
Chefs hate it,
especially back then.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.770
It's changed a lot
now, but it was very

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.760
hard to get it up and going.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.910
I lost a lot of chefs, just
committing to doing it.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.590
And then over a period of
time, we lost a lot of chefs.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.170
But what I found,
at the end of it,

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.660
when we finally--
about five years

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.630
ago-- it got to where
it really worked.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.255
And actually, every
restaurant used it.

00:16:47.255 --> 00:16:49.330
And actually, we couldn't
survive without it,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.675
because we shifted
it to where it's

00:16:51.675 --> 00:16:53.140
where everybody was training.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.569
And it's also where we
would collect-- even when

00:16:57.569 --> 00:17:00.110
we were looking at numbers, we
were trying to look at numbers

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.530
and look at food
at the same time.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:06.045
So if you're looking at your
sales on a lobster pot pie,

00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:07.920
you're actually looking
at a lobster pot pie.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.960
Even your accounting people--
we forced them to look at food,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.130
and to try to
connect it together.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.950
Just because-- just
to keep everybody

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.760
on that same mindset,
of what's important.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.839
But really, what we ended up
finding was the same chefs that

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:27.839
couldn't keep up their site, you
would go into their kitchens,

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.200
and they were not
impeccable kitchens.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.500
If they couldn't keep up
their site, more than likely,

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.070
they couldn't keep
up their kitchen.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.290
And it was amazing
how true that became.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.610
And to this day--
now it's great,

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.590
because now all the chefs
are very competitive.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.470
So because everybody's
looking at each other's food,

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.220
so now they're really
competitive with it.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.030
And it works really well.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.740
JENNA TAYLOR: Huge
array of benefits,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.679
both practical and
kind of unexpected.

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:55.220
PATRIC YUMUL: And
I think that speaks

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.790
to-- you touched on balance.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.610
And as far as running
balanced restaurants,

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.270
you have to run a
balanced business.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:06.020
You have to focus on of
the craft and the art

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.990
of the cuisine, as
well as making sure

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.130
that it costs out properly.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.610
You have to make
sure that you're

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.160
focused on developing talent,
as well as retaining top talent.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.010
And just running a
balanced business.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:21.110
And you what you find
is that leadership is

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.480
kind of an indivisible whole.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.480
You can't try to just
be great at one element

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.660
and be a truly great leader.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.240
You have to actually try
to excel at all of them.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.660
And when you see things
like a sick recipe exchange,

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.450
or the chef's representation
is kind of dismal,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.202
it speaks to,
really, what's going

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:41.160
on throughout the whole
rest of the restaurant.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.110
Because there's
a sickness there,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.750
there's just not that
exuberance to be a master,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.400
or to be a champion of all
elements of the restaurant,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.990
so you know that there's
something funny going on.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.490
JENNA TAYLOR: That's
interesting, it

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.980
being like an indicator of
a larger-- so you talked

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.950
a little bit about atmosphere,
and what you were trying to do,

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.670
bringing your personality.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.097
I think that that is evident in
your partnership with the Levi

00:19:04.097 --> 00:19:06.590
Stadium, and the 49ers, maybe.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.915
It's obviously-- that
strikes a fun chord.

00:19:08.915 --> 00:19:11.944
So maybe talk a little
bit about that experience.

00:19:11.944 --> 00:19:13.610
MICHAEL MINA: Well,
you know, that again

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.610
was one of the restaurant
that we did last year.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.460
And that was a big project.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.670
But really, kind of what
the goal and mission was

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:27.570
for Levi Stadium, I
am a big 49ers fan--

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.280
have been for 20 plus years.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.182
And so when I had
the opportunity,

00:19:33.182 --> 00:19:35.060
it was more of a
passion project.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.299
I said, you know,
this would be great.

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:41.340
PATRIC YUMUL: But the
49ers initially said, we've

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.020
got 6,000 square feet for you.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.437
Do you think you
can do something?

00:19:45.437 --> 00:19:46.644
Would you guys be interested?

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.350
And so we drove down
from San Francisco

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.270
to meet with the president
of the 49ers, Paraag Marathe.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.736
And we talk them into,
no, 16,000 square feet.

00:19:56.736 --> 00:19:58.900
JENNA TAYLOR: Quite a
bit more than 6,000.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.430
MICHAEL MINA: And we set out
to create something that really

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:09.850
hadn't been done, because
as far as the restaurant,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.950
we knew that we wanted to do
the pub and the steakhouse.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:20.430
But really, the whole
driver was to create

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.500
this kind of environment,
and this tailgate party

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:28.550
that was just kind
of really to-- I

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.460
had always thrown
these tailgate parties.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:35.700
And I had so many chefs,
when they would come to town,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.720
or chefs from here would come.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.370
And so everybody
would cook courses,

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.720
and this was out at Candlestick.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.415
And literally, we would roast
whole livers of foie gras

00:20:44.415 --> 00:20:45.207
out at the stadium.

00:20:45.207 --> 00:20:47.290
JENNA TAYLOR: Ridiculous
tailgates at Candlestick,

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:47.870
always.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:48.290
Right?

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:48.780
MICHAEL MINA: Yeah.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.530
And so we said, we
want to do something

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.430
that's completely over the top.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:57.320
And so we created the whole
idea of this tailgate party,

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.260
and inviting chefs from
different cities, whenever

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.110
we're playing those cities,
as well as just other chefs

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.360
that are friends of mine.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.020
And then all of this
equipment that was really

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.630
geared for this party.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.380
And so we built the largest
rotisserie-- indoor rotisserie

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.420
in the United States.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:18.590
And so we roast a whole
Japanese wagu cow every game.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.650
1,200 pound cow, every game.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.322
We have these cranes
with these pots that

00:21:24.322 --> 00:21:28.330
hold 600 gallons of water, with
these really special induction

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.610
burners that boil
600 gallons of water.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.060
So we take the cranes, and drop
like 300 lobsters at a time,

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.900
or 150 crabs at a time.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.420
It's really insane.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:43.190
The event is just insane,
and it just was fun.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.140
It just more of-- it
was just almost more

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.880
of knowing that it would work,
because it's so-- doing things

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.730
like that, just on
game days, works,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.380
because you have this
very captivated group

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.950
of people, that
always want to do

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.680
something that's over the top.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:06.820
And so we kind of knew that
we had the audience for it.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.260
But then it was just, see
how far you can push it.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.800
See what the limits were.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.640
So we got through
our first season,

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.280
and it was pretty amazing.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.980
JENNA TAYLOR: Keep
raising the bar.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.420
PATRIC YUMUL: We're ready
for this season, though.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.640
MICHAEL MINA: Getting
ready for next year, yeah.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.848
JENNA TAYLOR: So how far in
advance do you guys plan?

00:22:23.848 --> 00:22:25.870
You have these imaginations--

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.347
MICHAEL MINA: As soon as
the schedule comes out.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.180
We have to wait for the
schedule to come out

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.263
to know who we're playing.

00:22:31.263 --> 00:22:34.540
We usually plan the teams that
we know we play every year.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.380
So we plan those, and then we
wait to see who we're playing.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.220
And then it just
depends on who we play,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:45.120
because we do about 45
different dishes for each game,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.160
and all in different ways.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.090
So whether people are--
there's walking around,

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.140
there's outdoors.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.350
So we'll bring in
people that do--

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.985
like, if we're playing
against-- like, this year,

00:22:57.985 --> 00:22:59.490
we're playing against St. Louis.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.685
We play every year, and so we're
bringing this guy, Michael,

00:23:02.685 --> 00:23:05.310
from Poppy's Barbecue, which is
the best barbecue in the United

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.024
States.

00:23:06.024 --> 00:23:07.440
And he's going to
do the outdoors,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.400
so he'll do the smoker,
and the outdoors.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.710
And then we'll have another--
usually a Michelin starred chef

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.330
inside.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.829
And plus all of us, and
so there's a lot to plan.

00:23:18.829 --> 00:23:21.370
PATRIC YUMUL: We typically try
to have some connective tissue

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.850
with the city we're
playing, so that we

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.454
can kind of tell that
story, of how they tailgate.

00:23:26.454 --> 00:23:27.870
So there's always
kind of that San

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.280
Francisco versus whoever we're
playing, within that tailgate.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.965
JENNA TAYLOR: Got to throw those
challenges out to your friends.

00:23:33.965 --> 00:23:35.150
MICHAEL MINA: It's fun.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.167
PATRIC YUMUL: Yeah.

00:23:36.167 --> 00:23:37.750
And this year, we
have the Super Bowl.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.032
So that'll be exciting.

00:23:39.032 --> 00:23:40.740
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
so are you thinking--

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.060
how do you even begin to
conceptualize what you're going

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.780
to do for something like that?

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.425
MICHAEL MINA: All the chefs that
are coming this year for guest

00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.674
chefs, they're all going to
come back and do the Super

00:23:47.674 --> 00:23:48.780
Bowl with us.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.870
So we're going to do a big
one for the Super Bowl.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.480
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
I can't even imagine.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.030
Does anybody in our
audience have questions?

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.640
Several layers of question.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.940
But, in essence, how do
you still manage to cook?

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.260
How much do you get to cook?

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.860
How do you foster
innovation, with so many

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.100
different restaurants?

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.715
And how do you remain
really injected into it?

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:13.090
MICHAEL MINA: Sure, well
there's a couple different ways.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.460
I mean, one thing that I'm
always very committed to

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.230
is, when we open a restaurant--
and my son, who's over there,

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.760
can be the first to
tell you-- I spent

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.760
three months in that kitchen.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.120
And I spend three months
running that kitchen,

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.850
just like I was going to be
the chef of that restaurant.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.720
So that way, whenever I--
because usually, my work day

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:40.210
is throughout most of the day,
I'm doing meetings, or more

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.590
of the administrative side.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.720
But then-- then, nighttime, at 5
o'clock, before service starts,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.060
I go to one of the kitchens.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.310
And then, I always want to
be able to feel comfortable

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.740
in that kitchen, so I walk
in and run the kitchen,

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.500
and do what I would
do as if I was

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.130
the chef of that restaurant.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.430
That's why I always spend
the first three months there,

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.060
and do that job.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.700
And so that's how I stay
able to go into the kitchen,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.780
and just be able to-- if you
were to come in for dinner,

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.340
and I'm at that restaurant,
I could cook for you.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.640
That's how I do it.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.050
And I try to block
everything else out,

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.130
once I'm in the kitchen.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.840
I try to keep the phone as
away as much as possible,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.830
and everything else.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:27.340
And then, I cook a lot at home.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:33.500
I set up, kind of-- we live
out in Nicasio, out in Marin.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.570
And so we grow a lot of product.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.510
And then we have our kitchen
right next to what we grow.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.340
And so we do everything
from hosting,

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.760
but a lot of recipe development,
a lot of ideas we'll do there.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.170
But to be honest
with you, it's more

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.320
about your second
question, which

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.910
is, how do you
nurture young chefs,

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.100
and how do you surround
yourself with talent?

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:10.930
That's really the answer to
the question, is at this point,

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:16.520
to really stay relevant, you
have to surround yourself

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.740
with a lot of talent.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.760
And you have to have
very talented people.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.560
Traveling is amazing.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.150
It's much better to travel
in groups of two or three

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.180
really talented chefs,
so that you're constantly

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.260
really dissecting everything,
and questioning everything,

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.150
and everything else.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.770
But also, too, I mean we are
very fortunate at this point,

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.360
because when we wanted to
open a Japanese restaurant--

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.880
I love Japanese food.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.950
I have a good handle on it,
but I'm probably just about

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.260
enough to be dangerous.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.520
So I partnered with an
amazing Japanese chef.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.980
And so not only then
could I learn from him,

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.150
he can learn from us.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.490
We can learn from him.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.590
And then all of the
people in our company,

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.510
all of the young talented
chefs in our company,

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.150
now, besides just being able
to go on recipes exchange

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.410
and get these recipes
and techniques

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:17.750
that a great Japanese
chef will never show you,

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.470
they have access to all of them.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.890
We all do.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.910
And we can also really
benefit from each other.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.710
And that's a big part
of it-- a big part of it

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.150
is really just being able
to-- part of this test kitchen

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.480
was for that reason.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.500
And also, to let some of
our really talented chefs

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:40.720
in our company be able to say
that they want to do a pop up,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.090
and they want to do-- they've
got an idea for a concept.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.760
And they want to do
one of their concepts.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.840
And they all get to
pitch Patric me on them.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.560
And if we like them-- bless
you-- if we like them,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.970
we'll let them do it.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.420
But I would just say
that the answer is

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.600
probably the same to both,
as far as getting to cook,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.000
I definitely force
the time to do it,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.500
because that's
what I love to do.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.840
And then as far as really being
able to motivate and build

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.840
young talent, you have
to look at each person

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.400
and say, what do they
need the most help with?

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.120
I mean, I have some chefs that
are amazing, amazing cooks.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.670
Like, if they sit down and
cook the two of us dinner,

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.253
it's going to be the
best dinner ever.

00:28:26.253 --> 00:28:28.720
But if they tried to cook
for 50 people at same time,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.330
it's going to be a disaster.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.790
So you have to understand
how to get them the skills

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.495
that they need to get to the
next step in their career.

00:28:38.495 --> 00:28:39.870
JENNA TAYLOR: So
the question is,

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.750
with opening so
many restaurants,

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:45.550
how do you guard against
brand exhaustion?

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.680
MICHAEL MINA: I can
tell you, I think

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.400
that's more of a
geographic issue,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.920
because I think that,
in the Bay Area,

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.704
we're trying very hard
right now to create--

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:00.120
if we're opening
more restaurants,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.953
we're doing them with
like what we just did.

00:29:01.953 --> 00:29:05.140
Like with Ken, where we
partnered with another chef,

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.840
or it's-- they're
different concepts,

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.550
completely different concepts.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.520
The only two that
are the same are

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.210
the Bourbon Steak in Santa
Clara and Bourbon Steak

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:16.080
in San Francisco.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.540
So if it's not a different
concept, we won't do it.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.700
But a lot of times
we're going to cities

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.690
like-- when we go to a
city, we don't go to a city

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.800
and say, OK, we want to
build another restaurant.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.410
We go to a city,
and say, we want

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:32.270
to compete at the
very highest level.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.920
If we're going to go
to Washington, DC,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.460
and build a restaurant,
we want to compete.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.740
We want it to be known
as one of the best

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.360
restaurants in Washington, DC.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.117
And so the two
markets where we have

00:29:47.117 --> 00:29:49.200
the majority of our
restaurants are San Francisco,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.870
because it's home, and then Las
Vegas, because it's Las Vegas.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.410
And Las Vegas is just
so much different.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:01.000
Each Casino is its own--
it's really its own city.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.602
And just really looking
at them, they're

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:05.810
all kind of their own cities.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.550
I don't know if there's an
answer to that question.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:20.670
The answer is I can
tell you that we're

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.697
looking at making sure
we have the ability

00:30:22.697 --> 00:30:23.780
to open great restaurants.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.240
If we don't, then
we won't do it.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.820
Whenever we get to
a period of time

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.150
where we don't have the
infrastructure to do it,

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:36.127
we usually take a break, and
we rebuild infrastructure.

00:30:36.127 --> 00:30:37.710
PATRIC YUMUL: I
think, to piggyback on

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.710
that, we want to have
restaurants of consequence.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.609
So we don't want to just loosely
open up a bunch of restaurants,

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:46.900
stick our name on it, and
then let them run themselves.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.430
We're very intimately involved
in the day to day operations.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.171
We're intimately involved in
kind of nurturing the talent,

00:30:54.171 --> 00:30:56.670
working with the chefs, working
with the GMs, the leadership

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.110
team, the somms, the
bartenders, and making sure

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.260
that we're thoughtfully
curating the experience,

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.050
from the kitchen all
the way to the front,

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.380
where the hostess greets you,
as well as the technologies that

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.640
surround-- how to
accentuate that experience.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.530
So we're just that kind
of going out, and putting

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:14.390
our name on things.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:19.120
We're actually
actively pursuing being

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.570
a champion of that
restaurant, within whatever

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.070
markets it's in, and making
sure that it can be competitive,

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:30.310
and considered one of the best
in that city, or in that area.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.010
So having that spirit
is one way to help fight

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.240
against exhaustion
or saturation.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.980
Another is what we spoke
about earlier, is talent.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.650
Is making sure that
we're constantly

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.145
trying to work with some of
the most talented individuals,

00:31:44.145 --> 00:31:46.130
that we're constantly
challenging them.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.880
That we're setting
the expectation

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.780
through being role models
in how we conduct ourselves

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.630
in the restaurants,
and how we kind of set

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.490
the example with the
openings, and then let

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.945
them know what the expected
pace is of the operation,

00:31:58.945 --> 00:32:01.860
and what the expected
spirit is of the operation.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.910
And then hold them very much
to it, while empowering them

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:09.510
and inspiring them to be able to
kind of innovate on their own.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.850
It's kind of a give and take.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.280
At first, it's a
lot of Mina Group,

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.050
kind of putting in systems
and guiding the restaurant.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:19.900
And as we have a
strong relationship

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.630
with the chef and
the general manager,

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.320
they get a lot more autonomy,
and a lot more empowerment

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.450
to kind of creatively
flex their muscles.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.110
And then pretty soon,
it's kind of their show,

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:34.110
with us as almost like
consiglieres, or guidance

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.560
counselors, to
help them maximize

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.590
what they're trying to achieve.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.090
And then, again, it's by
having these unique kind

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.090
of different things, like
the Mina test kitchen,

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.110
where it's an
opportunity for people

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.860
to showcase their talents,
and to kind of think outside

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.340
of the box, and get
involved in something

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.430
that they might
never get exposed to.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.300
JENNA TAYLOR: What is your
process for conceptualizing

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.590
a new restaurant?

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:03.410
How does that creatively
start for you guys?

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:08.590
MICHAEL MINA: Well, I mean
really the biggest piece of it

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.610
is something we're
passionate about.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.150
I mean, we've never
really done anything

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.020
just based on looking
at it and saying,

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.820
well, we know that
this is financially

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.180
going to make a lot of sense.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.900
PATRIC YUMUL: Almost to a fault.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.150
JENNA TAYLOR: Like, you're
obsessed with ramen, maybe.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.860
MICHAEL MINA: Yeah,
well we were obsessed--

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.212
he's obsessed with ramen.

00:33:32.212 --> 00:33:34.420
JENNA TAYLOR: [INAUDIBLE]
son is obsessed with ramen.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.340
MICHAEL MINA: But we were
obsessed with Japanese cooking.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.320
And that's why we did Pabu.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.440
And then Ramen Bar was
something that our partner, Ken,

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.070
wanted to do.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.200
He had always wanted to do it,
and he had always wanted to do,

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.770
but he didn't know how to do it.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.860
And so we said, you know,
let's do it together.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.660
Let's help you on
how to facilitate,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:02.190
how to be able to actually
feed people in that style

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.520
that he wanted to do it.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.909
And so as far as
selecting the concept,

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:10.690
it's usually Patrick and myself.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:15.714
We usually start to
talk about something--

00:34:15.714 --> 00:34:16.984
a cuisine that we love.

00:34:16.984 --> 00:34:18.650
But then we start to
really think about,

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.270
how would we create a
concept that would be ours?

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:25.320
It's not just about--
you go to Pabu,

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.321
it's much different
than most-- than a lot

00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:28.820
of other Japanese
restaurants you're

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.290
going to go to in the city.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.060
And that's what we
still want to be

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.540
able to put our own stamp on
whatever it is that we do.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.510
And this kind of this eastern
Mediterranean-- the pop

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.330
up, we'll put our own stamp on.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.560
But we already have
plans-- hopefully,

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.230
if the pop up goes
well-- of what

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.860
the restaurant will be like.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.489
And that, we'll definitely
put our own stamp on.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:53.530
And so, you know, if
the passion is there,

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.840
then it just always
is a better concept.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.460
PATRIC YUMUL: The
pricing strategy

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:03.610
that we have, with wine,
in particular-- it varies.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.230
It's kind of a flexible or
dynamic pricing strategy, based

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.570
on what we feel are going
to be workhorse wines,

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:14.150
that will help contribute
to overall cost,

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.180
as well as, then, kind
of higher end wines--

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.000
like you're talking about--
that aren't good cost leaders,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.500
but they're good for margin.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.564
But, you know, where
in a retail store,

00:35:24.564 --> 00:35:26.105
you think about it
when you're going,

00:35:26.105 --> 00:35:28.063
you're buying wine off
the shelf in the retail.

00:35:28.063 --> 00:35:31.110
We pay those same prices that
you're getting from a retailer.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.820
Maybe we might pay $1
or $2 less per bottle.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.500
So if you're buying a bottle
of wine from a retailer,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.710
you're buying it for $50.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:41.620
We might be buying
it for $47, $47.50.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.900
But you're taking it home.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.625
We have a staff of people that
are-- we're receiving the wine,

00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:52.390
we're properly storing the wine,
we're educated about the wine.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.274
They're opening up, they're
paying for glassware,

00:35:55.274 --> 00:35:56.940
paying for china,
paying for silverware.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.940
There's a lot of
other expenses that

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.670
go into kind of that
cost factor for the wine.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.400
With intoxicants, such
as beer and wine, liquor,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.290
you don't have a huge
threshold for volume,

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:15.050
because people get
drunk, and then they

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:19.600
can't conduct themselves in
socially acceptable behavior.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.500
As well as we have a
limited seat count, right?

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:30.030
So we're kind of narrow
in on exactly how

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.920
much throughput with
volume we can get.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.900
So you've got to try to maximize
the profitability you're

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.080
going to have when you markup
stuff like liquor, beer,

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.860
and wine.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.550
You know, what's funny is
people kind of hem and haw

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:49.970
about the prices for wine
and liquor in restaurants.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.180
But you know, restaurants,
as a general business,

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.530
aren't profitable
businesses, especially here

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.130
in San Francisco
or the Bay Area.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.474
It's extremely hard
to make a profit.

00:36:59.474 --> 00:37:01.640
Our restaurants are probably
some of the top revenue

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.290
restaurants in the city,
and we constantly--

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.530
there's ebbs and flows
with how well we do,

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.660
just because of
the cost of rent,

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:16.660
the cost of health benefits,
the Healthy SF surcharges,

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.410
the minimal wage
that's increasing--

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:22.070
all these different things
that we have to cover.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.870
And on top of it,
San Francisco's

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:28.880
very controlled with what
we can charge for food.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.350
And it's very competitive,
and everybody's

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.146
hyper critical, and hyper
aware, and hyper vocal, as far

00:37:34.146 --> 00:37:35.520
as what the pricing
structure is.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.090
So we kind of have
handcuffs with that.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:42.470
So we try to really
make most of our money

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.930
through the selling of
liquor, beer, and wine.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.050
We do have, on all
of our wine lists,

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.460
a couple different
sections that allows

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.610
us to kind of go and find
great wines that probably,

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.861
if they were more
known, would be

00:37:57.861 --> 00:37:59.110
through the roof with pricing.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.895
But we try to keep
those priced under $70.

00:38:00.895 --> 00:38:05.089
So we tend to have typically
about 50 wines on all

00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:06.880
of our wine lists, that
are kind of these--

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.110
we call them hidden
gems, or back road wines,

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.120
that our somms, through
their travels, find out.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.310
It's often the second label
from a well-known producer--

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:17.840
that type of stuff.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.370
So we always try to add value
to the wine list with those,

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.480
as well as, in some
of the restaurants,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.215
we'll do on one of the week,
like a Sunday or Monday,

00:38:28.215 --> 00:38:30.090
try to do an industry
night-- but really it's

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.440
for everybody-- where all
the wines on the wine list

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.780
are half off.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.310
So we try to kind of
augment the pricing,

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:41.190
and give some good value through
different types of promotions

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.909
and different types of finds.

00:38:42.909 --> 00:38:44.950
JENNA TAYLOR: So how do
you build a culture where

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.260
it's OK to iterate quickly, fail
fast, as we say here at Google,

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.390
where that's OK?

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.897
Because that is a scary
concept, in general.

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.480
MICHAEL MINA:
Hopefully, not everybody

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.813
that works for us will see this.

00:38:55.813 --> 00:39:03.360
But there's a handful of
people in our top level,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.720
executive court.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.870
And I kind of feel like
you need it, a little bit.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:13.700
There's a handful of
people that will constantly

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.690
want to question--
really deeply question.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:26.880
And in a way, will say, proceed
with caution, type experience.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.180
And then, what I think is really
important for me-- personally--

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.690
I've found that myself
and Patrick, you know,

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.200
the two top people
in the company,

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.310
just are relentless with more
innovation-- more innovation,

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:47.500
more creativity, more-- when
the day comes that the two of us

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.880
say no, we just don't.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.810
We'll try something.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.960
We'll find a way
to test it safely,

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.294
I guess would probably
be what you're asking.

00:39:55.294 --> 00:39:56.960
And for us, it's a
little bit different,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.821
because we don't have to--
I'm sure, for your company,

00:40:01.821 --> 00:40:03.320
when you have to
test something, you

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.230
have to test it
on so many people

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.870
to really get a sense of it.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:10.230
But for us, we can run a
special in a restaurant

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.580
when it comes to food, right?

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:17.620
We can run different dishes,
we can try different things.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:26.729
We can try things in--
where it gets really

00:40:26.729 --> 00:40:29.020
tricky is, obviously, when
you're opening a restaurant,

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.210
you have a full concept.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.370
And then it's--

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.540
We've had one philosophy
since the beginning,

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:42.490
and that's the fact that a
restaurant is better or worse,

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.860
every day, than it
was the day before.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.750
And so today, my
restaurant in San Francisco

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.930
will be better or worse
than it was yesterday.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.530
It's actually impossible
to stay the same.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.790
It's 100% impossible.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.260
If you're striving
to stay the same,

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.350
you're going to get worse.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:01.050
There's no doubt.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.290
You're going to get complacent.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.831
The restaurant is
going to get worse.

00:41:03.831 --> 00:41:07.170
And so innovation is
a huge part of that.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.470
Finding that good balance
of being constantly

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:15.320
trying to innovate, but
really understanding

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.859
that you're trying
to take anything.

00:41:18.859 --> 00:41:20.525
The biggest thing
that I'll say to chefs

00:41:20.525 --> 00:41:25.750
is if you're not creating the
next signature dish, if you're

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.960
not creating the next dish that
likely we can never take off

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.892
the menu, then you're not
creating the next dish.

00:41:31.892 --> 00:41:33.350
You shouldn't create
the next dish.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.910
If, in your mind, you're not
going to create a signature

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.784
dish, if you're ever
going to create a filler

00:41:37.784 --> 00:41:40.100
dish in the menu, don't bother.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.880
Just because, don't bother
saying that, it's a salad,

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.860
so we have to have
a salad on the menu,

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.090
because it's actually not true.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:47.600
You don't.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.540
You have to obsess
over that salad,

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.370
and figure out how to create
the absolute best salad.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:42:00.470
And then, when it gets
to full concepts, that's

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.000
when I think it gets to
be really fun for us,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.150
because then it's, how do you
put the whole creative process

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.760
together, from the
design, to the menus,

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.790
to the style of service,
to the beverage,

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:18.730
[INAUDIBLE] to just the
actual heart, and soul,

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.360
and DNA of the restaurant.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.680
And I think that
getting back to the fact

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.650
that, if you're not
constantly trying to push

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:33.157
and constantly
thinking about-- it's

00:42:33.157 --> 00:42:34.490
not even just what you're doing.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.770
It's obviously what
everybody else is doing.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.020
If you're not in tune to
what everybody else is doing,

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.080
and you're not trying
to push to move forward,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.915
it's pretty hard
to stay relevant.

00:42:45.915 --> 00:42:48.190
I hope that answers
your question.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.200
PATRIC YUMUL: You know,
my philosophy on failure

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.209
has kind of changed, because of
the new generation of leaders

00:42:55.209 --> 00:42:57.250
that we have kind of coming
up through the ranks,

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.040
and the millennial
generation of workers.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.570
And our role is
really to teach people

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.000
how to fail, and
to be OK with it.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.040
Because as soon as
you're OK with failure,

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.310
you can have a lot of fun
with what you're doing.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:13.768
If you're afraid
to failure, you're

00:43:13.768 --> 00:43:18.150
afraid to make decisions, and
you're afraid to fully engage.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:22.565
And, so a lot of times, I
look for opportunities--

00:43:22.565 --> 00:43:26.760
I look for not necessarily I
know someone's going to fail,

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.920
but if they fail, it's OK.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.440
It's not the end of the world.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:34.060
It's not life or
death, but we have

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.724
to make sure that they're
learning from that.

00:43:36.724 --> 00:43:38.640
If they make a mistake,
or there is a failure,

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.810
that they learn from it, and
that they try to figure out

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.854
how to overcome it.

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:45.020
And there's always a reason.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.120
If it's whether I
didn't work hard enough,

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.840
or we didn't put enough time
into something, or it was ill

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.820
conceived, or it just was
flat out the wrong idea.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.300
As long as they're kind
of taking that lesson

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.560
from the failure,
then they're going

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.990
to continue to kind of innovate
and be better and better.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.910
And like I said, right now,
we've got a very young team.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:10.310
So we're putting a lot
of empowerment on them,

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:16.170
and it's kind of fun to see them
go out and fail at some stuff.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.410
But they're really quick to kind
of correct themselves, and pick

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:23.060
themselves up, and try to
figure out what they did wrong,

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.420
and how to improve from it.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:24.960
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
you're playing

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.580
with that concept a little bit
with the Mina test kitchen too,

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.080
right?

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.762
Shrink the field, reduce the
risk a little, let it iterate?

00:44:30.762 --> 00:44:31.970
PATRIC YUMUL: Exactly, right.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:35.500
And we can adapt
and change quickly.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.870
JENNA TAYLOR: Very in alignment
with Google's culture.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.495
MICHAEL MINA: And I think a lot
of it is what Patric just said,

00:44:40.495 --> 00:44:45.350
as far as-- how passionate
is the person who's

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.140
trying to do it?

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.205
I mean, I'll have chefs that
will talk to me about a dish

00:44:51.205 --> 00:44:52.080
that they want to do.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.330
And I can tell in five
minutes how passionate they

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.610
are about the dish, or if it's
just because the other dish is

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.350
out of season and they
need to change something.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:03.860
And the passion has
so much to do with it.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.230
And obviously, you can't let
the passion be dangerous.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.380
It can't be somebody
that's got all passion

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:12.290
and doesn't have the
knowledge to balance them out.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.850
But I think that that's kind
of where the balance comes,

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.420
is how much passion and
how much knowledge, and how

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.320
much-- if they're
passionate, they've really

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.530
done the research, they
have the knowledge,

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:29.540
chances are it's a pretty
good bet to let them try.

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.860
And if they fail, they fail.

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.467
Our most creative
concept failed,

00:45:39.467 --> 00:45:41.300
and it was something
that killed both of us.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.830
We worked on it so hard,
and it, to this day,

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.220
was the best thing we ever did.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:45.870
And it failed.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.629
JENNA TAYLOR: Which was that?

00:45:47.629 --> 00:45:49.170
MICHAEL MINA: It
was called Fourteen,

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:50.970
and it was in Los Angeles.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.340
And so we have a lot of
theories of why it failed.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.680
PATRIC YUMUL: The wrong
place, the wrong time.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.510
MICHAEL MINA: Wrong
place, wrong time.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.704
But it was truly the
best thing we ever did.

00:45:57.704 --> 00:45:59.120
PATRIC YUMUL: It
was a lot of fun.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.536
MICHAEL MINA: It
was a lot of fun,

00:46:00.536 --> 00:46:02.472
and it was the hardest
thing we ever did.

00:46:02.472 --> 00:46:04.430
And it was the most
creative thing we ever did,

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.050
and it might have-- like I said,
maybe it was the wrong place,

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:08.550
wrong time.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.720
Maybe it was too creative.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.890
But I tell you one thing--
what we learned out of that,

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.790
we've had probably 10
successes from there.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.400
And probably the
biggest thing we

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.440
learned is, if we were athletes,
we would have pushed ourselves

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.910
to a point where
we created so much

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.884
stamina, the next restaurant
seemed so easy after that one.

00:46:29.884 --> 00:46:32.050
JENNA TAYLOR: So if it was
really maybe wrong place,

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.508
wrong time, do you think you'll
ever bring it back to life?

00:46:34.508 --> 00:46:35.930
A new iteration?

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.350
MICHAEL MINA: I don't know.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:40.550
It's one of those things,
where I kind of feel it needed

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:45.100
to catch magic at that time,
because I don't know if we

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.690
could get the amount of
buy-in, and passion--

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.440
PATRIC YUMUL: It could
be a test kitchen--

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.750
on queue for the test kitchen.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.510
JENNA TAYLOR: I don't know.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.926
PATRIC YUMUL: You never know,
we might resurrect it there.

00:46:54.926 --> 00:46:58.310
JENNA TAYLOR: Maybe for a 25
years of working together,

00:46:58.310 --> 00:46:59.570
bring it back.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:01.990
Oh, favorite places
to travel for food.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:04.200
Wait, I need to make a list.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.190
PATRIC YUMUL: I mean
obviously Europe is great,

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:11.460
because they're just so
rooted through history,

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.249
with the different
regions of Italy

00:47:14.249 --> 00:47:16.415
have different ways to cook
pasta, or different ways

00:47:16.415 --> 00:47:17.719
to cook pizza, for that matter.

00:47:17.719 --> 00:47:19.760
And to understand why they
arrived at those ways,

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.250
or how they got to
those destinations.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:28.020
France, Spain-- Spain right now
is extremely innovative in what

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:28.680
they're doing.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:36.420
To go to Spain to see the
classic, traditional cooking,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.860
all the way up to what Ferran
Adria was doing, [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.540
or even some of the other chefs,
like at Celler de Can Roca,

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.240
it's mind boggling how much
creativity and innovation's

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.080
coming out of that
region in the world.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.710
But then to go hop, skip,
and a jump away to Greece,

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.510
and just be able to pick out
a piece of fish, and have it

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.920
perfectly cooked
as you're sitting

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.290
next to the water
in the Aegean sea--

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.720
that is pretty
remarkable, as well.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:07.482
So, I mean, there's a lot of
different learnings to be had.

00:48:07.482 --> 00:48:08.940
I love going to
Europe, personally.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:13.460
I like going to Asia, Japan.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.700
For me, what was great about
Japan was it's very modern,

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.690
and it's very Western.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:20.830
However, it's still
very preserved.

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.670
Whereas, you go to
somewhere like Hong Kong,

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.670
it's very Western, and
not very preserved.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.760
It feels like you
could be in Manhattan,

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.880
where when you're in Tokyo,
it feels like you're in Tokyo.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.650
So I always like to have
that type of authenticity

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.185
as part of travel, as well.

00:48:36.185 --> 00:48:38.560
MICHAEL MINA: Yeah, and I
think that a good rule of thumb

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.540
is the food you
love, the food you're

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.430
most passionate about
eating, is probably

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:47.530
going to be-- you might,
in certain ways, feel like,

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:51.360
oh, I love Japanese food,
but I eat so much of it

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.940
that I don't need
to go to Japan.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.820
But when you go to Japan,
and you eat Japanese food,

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.260
you really understand
the culture

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.050
and why you love it so much.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:03.370
I mean, to me, that's
what it's all about.

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.880
It's like when we went
to the Middle East.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.310
What's there is the spices.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.130
When you start to
see the spices--

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:15.950
and so you travel to different
places for different reasons.

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:21.200
But if you really want
to travel based on food,

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.980
I would just do it because
there's great food in Greece,

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.060
if you've only got a few trips.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.800
Go to the places where you
absolutely love that cuisine,

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.110
and then spend the
time doing the research

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:40.540
before you get there to get
the right places to go see.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.161
You'll have such an appreciation
for it when you get back.

00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:44.160
PATRIC YUMUL: But Tokyo.

00:49:46.147 --> 00:49:47.980
JENNA TAYLOR: And what
about closer to home?

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.271
Where's your favorite place
see to eat in the US that's

00:49:50.271 --> 00:49:51.525
not one of yours?

00:49:54.570 --> 00:50:00.990
MICHAEL MINA: Again, it kind
of depends on what level

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:03.200
you're looking to dine.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.000
I would say in the
city, if I want

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.570
to go out to something
that's going to stimulate me,

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.370
I'll go to Cezanne.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:20.380
Josh, we worked together, he
worked for me for a while.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.760
I've always thought that
his food was amazing

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.650
when he worked with
us, and now what

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:31.400
he's done there is--
I'd say that's probably

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.210
my favorite in the city.

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:37.245
Benu is really good,
because it's interesting.

00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:37.870
It's different.

00:50:42.632 --> 00:50:44.340
I mean, there's so
many great restaurants

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.470
right now in San Francisco.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:49.920
PATRIC YUMUL: I mean, those are
obviously three Michelin star

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.690
restaurants.

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.190
And then there's
like little places,

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.860
like Italian
Homemade on Columbus,

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.580
right on the outskirts of North
Beach, where it's a husband

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.980
and wife from Italy that are
making made from scratch,

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.400
handmade pastas, great sauces.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:08.580
It's like $9-- everybody's
Italian in there.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.730
You feel like you're Italian
when you get in there.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.934
And it's an amazing kind
of authentic experience.

00:51:12.934 --> 00:51:14.600
That's what's great
about San Francisco,

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.960
is you've got that range.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.060
But I mean, this is
such a great city.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.740
When you live
there, to just kind

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.370
of newly discover
different restaurants

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:28.200
and different finds that
are right under your nose.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.920
But Los Angeles is
also a fun city,

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.180
and that's an
upcoming food scene.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:39.380
Seattle, Portland-- those,
Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.490
is also part of
another kind of Enigma,

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:47.150
as far as kind of
the staffing dilemma

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.490
we have here in San Francisco,
which could be another talk.

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:53.190
But those are all three
great, west coast cities

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:56.345
to see a lot of good,
indigenous cooking, as well

00:51:56.345 --> 00:51:58.200
as some good global cooking.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.310
JENNA TAYLOR: So how did
you decide to stand here one

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:02.260
Michael Mina--

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.740
MICHAEL MINA: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.480
Because that's not
only a question,

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.800
it's been something
that chefs have had

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.190
to deal with for a long time.

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:16.910
And I have a very strong
feeling about that.

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.610
There's nothing wrong
with either one,

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.440
and that's my very
strong theory about it.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.940
It really used to upset me when
I was-- I waited a long time.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.800
I had Aqua for nine years before
I opened a second restaurant.

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.080
But it really upset me, when I
opened the second restaurant,

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.860
reading the press,
because I thought

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.400
it was some of the most unfair
press that I've ever seen.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.620
And it wasn't just
me, it was every chef

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:47.350
that was opening a second, a
third, or a fourth restaurant,

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:48.290
back then.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:52.742
Back in '98, 99, 2000.

00:52:52.742 --> 00:52:54.450
That's when it kind
of started happening,

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.720
where chefs that actually
said they would never

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.080
open a second restaurant started
opening multiple restaurants.

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:09.420
And I think that the press and
people had really boxed chefs

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:13.910
in, had forced
chefs-- there's so

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:17.740
many chefs that I can tell
you that, unfortunately, I've

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:27.040
seen them work for partner with
a lawyer, a business person,

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.490
and that person became
a restaurateur--

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:33.511
the person that funded the
restaurant-- then started

00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:34.510
becoming a restaurateur.

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.650
And the chef-- and it
was OK for that person

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.780
to go out and open
multiple restaurants.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.060
But it wasn't OK for the chef
to open multiple restaurants,

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:46.200
and it really affected the
quality of the food here.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.790
And I can tell you that
both ways are fine.

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:52.660
But the quality of the food the
United States over the last 10

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.280
years, since chefs started
really becoming restaurateurs--

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.910
and you see chefs, like Thomas
Keller, who, for a long time,

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:03.390
said he was just going
to have one restaurant,

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.160
has opened now
multiple restaurants.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.780
And every one of
them is amazing.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.650
They're amazing restaurants.

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.980
And not only are they
amazing restaurants,

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.960
the passion that's in
those kitchens allows

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.860
all these other chefs
to become amazing chefs.

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.941
So the more great
kitchens that you have,

00:54:19.941 --> 00:54:21.690
the more great chefs
you're going to have,

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:24.040
the better food you're going
to have in your country.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:30.780
And so I'm really--
neither way is wrong.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.230
I chose my decision,
because I wanted

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:35.990
all the guys that
worked in my kitchen

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.470
to get their own kitchens.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.120
And so I didn't
want to lose them.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.070
I wanted them to keep growing.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.710
And a lot of them now do
have their own kitchens,

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:46.729
and a lot of them
were chefs for me,

00:54:46.729 --> 00:54:48.770
and they've gone on to
own their own restaurants,

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:51.150
or even own their own
restaurant companies.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:58.650
But I feel like
there's nothing--

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:05.940
it was a situation that,
back in the late '90s,

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.440
it was a big topic.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.130
It was a big topic
when chefs started

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:10.970
opening more than
one restaurant,

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.240
about how you're not
cooking at your restaurant,

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.886
and you're not doing this.

00:55:14.886 --> 00:55:16.260
And at the end of
the day, you've

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.890
got to judge a restaurant
by what you eat.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.600
You have to, you
have to judge it

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.710
by what you eat, what your
service is, what it is.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:33.000
And so there is a
really talented team

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.500
of people back there
cooking, you're

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.791
still going to eat really
good food at that restaurant.

00:55:36.791 --> 00:55:39.560
And hopefully, there'll just be
more great restaurants, which

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:47.100
I think right now, this day
and age, you just see it.

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:51.040
You see so many chefs now that
have multiple restaurants,

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:55.160
and they have great restaurants.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.860
And I want them to keep
opening more restaurants,

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:00.940
because I want there to
be more great restaurants.

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.640
JENNA TAYLOR: Me too.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.440
Amen to that.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.042
Our time is up, I'm so sorry-
I've had such a great time

00:56:07.042 --> 00:56:07.750
talking with you.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.150
But thank you guys for coming.

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.150
PATRIC YUMUL: Thank you.

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.200
