00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.320
Here's the solution for

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.689
binding an adapter to a ListView within the PlaceholderFragment class. First,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.280
we find the ListView in the view hierarchy by using the findViewById call and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.510
then, we set the adapter to it. The adapter will supply list item layouts to

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.690
the ListView based on the weekForecast data. Note that the rootView here

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.840
refers to the root view of the fragment, which we just inflated up above here.
