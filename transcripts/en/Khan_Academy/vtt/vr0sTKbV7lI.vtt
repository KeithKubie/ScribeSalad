00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.160
Let's say I wanted to find the
volume of a cube, where the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.150
values of the cube-- let's say
x is between-- x is greater

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.350
than or equal to 0, is less
than or equal to,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.780
I don't know, 3.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.600
Let's say y is greater than
or equal to 0, and is

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000
less than or equal to 4.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.270
And then let's say that z is
greater than or equal to 0 and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.055
is less than or equal to 2.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:26.650
And I know, using basic
geometry you could figure out--

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.370
you know, just multiply the
width times the height times

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.340
the depth and you'd
have the volume.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.280
But I want to do this example,
just so that you get used to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.700
what a triple integral looks
like, how it relates to a

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.180
double integral, and then later
in the next video we could do

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.290
something slightly
more complicated.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.040
So let's just draw
that, this volume.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.780
So this is my x-axis, this is
my z-axis, this is the y.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.795
x, y, z.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.080
OK.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.910
So x is between 0 and 3.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.070
So that's x is equal to 0.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.120
This is x is equal to--
let's see, 1, 2, 3.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.570
y is between 0 and 4.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.180
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.450
So the x-y plane will look
something like this.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.520
The kind of base of our cube
will look something like this.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.770
And then z is between 0 and 2.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.350
So 0 is the x-y plane,
and then 1, 2.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.130
So this would be the top part.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.600
And maybe I'll do that in a
slightly different color.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.520
So this is along the x-z axis.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.360
You'd have a boundary
here, and then it would

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.316
come in like this.

00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:41.850
You have a boundary here,
come in like that.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.810
A boundary there.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.600
So we want to figure out
the volume of this cube.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.370
And you could do it.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.540
You could say, well, the depth
is 3, the base, the width is 4,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.920
so this area is 12
times the height.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.170
12 times 2 is 24.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.980
You could say it's 24
cubic units, whatever

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.630
units we're doing.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.990
But let's do it as
a triple integral.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.640
So what does a triple
integral mean?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.110
Well, what we could do is we
could take the volume of a very

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.670
small-- I don't want to say
area-- of a very small volume.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.770
So let's say I wanted to take
the volume of a small cube.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.810
Some place in this-- in the
volume under question.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.160
And it'll start to make more
sense, or it starts to become a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.860
lot more useful, when we have
variable boundaries and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.050
surfaces and curves
as boundaries.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.840
But let's say we want to
figure out the volume of this

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.780
little, small cube here.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.590
That's my cube.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.630
It's some place in this larger
cube, this larger rectangle,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.460
cubic rectangle, whatever
you want to call it.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.540
So what's the volume
of that cube?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.930
Let's say that its width is dy.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.010
So that length
right there is dy.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.810
It's height is dx.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.660
Sorry, no, it's
height is dz, right?

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.840
The way I drew it,
z is up and down.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.860
And it's depth is dx.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.940
This is dx.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.750
This is dz.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.720
This is dy.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.260
So you can say that a small
volume within this larger

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.830
volume-- you could call that
dv, which is kind of the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.750
volume differential.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.290
And that would be equal to,
you could say, it's just

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.990
the width times the
length times the height.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.950
dx times dy times dz.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.760
And you could switch the
orders of these, right?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.010
Because multiplication is
associative, and order

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.920
doesn't matter and all that.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.540
But anyway, what can you
do with it in here?

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.290
Well, we can take the integral.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.520
All integrals help us do is
help us take infinite sums of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.080
infinitely small distances,
like a dz or a dx or

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.240
a dy, et cetera.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.620
So, what we could do is we
could take this cube and

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.110
first, add it up in, let's
say, the z direction.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.330
So we could take that cube and
then add it along the up and

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.230
down axis-- the z-axis--
so that we get the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.410
volume of a column.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.550
So what would that look like?

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.930
Well, since we're going up and
down, we're adding-- we're

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.670
taking the sum in
the z direction.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.610
We'd have an integral.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.655
And then what's the
lowest z value?

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:08.310
Well, it's z is equal to 0.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.280
And what's the upper bound?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.070
Like if you were to just take--
keep adding these cubes, and

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.190
keep going up, you'd run
into the upper bound.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.770
And what's the upper bound?

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.100
It's z is equal to 2.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.010
And of course, you would
take the sum of these dv's.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.130
And I'll write dz first.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.170
Just so it reminds us
that we're going to

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.430
take the integral with
respect to z first.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.010
And let's say we'll do y next.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.200
And then we'll do x.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.430
So this integral, this value,
as I've written it, will

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.020
figure out the volume of a
column given any x and y.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.240
It'll be a function of x and y,
but since we're dealing with

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.130
all constants here, it's
actually going to be

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.600
a constant value.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.160
It'll be the constant value
of the volume of one

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.890
of these columns.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.580
So essentially, it'll
be 2 times dy dx.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.330
Because the height of one
of these columns is 2,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.710
and then its with and
its depth is dy and dx.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.570
So then if we want to figure
out the entire volume-- what

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.270
we did just now is we figured
out the height of a column.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.300
So then we could take those
columns and sum them

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.730
in the y direction.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.710
So if we're summing in the y
direction, we could just take

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.340
another integral of this
sum in the y direction.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.650
And y goes from 0 to what?
y goes from 0 to 4.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.180
I wrote this integral a
little bit too far to the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.300
left, it looks strange.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.000
But I think you get the idea.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.390
y is equal to 0, to
y is equal to 4.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.420
And then that'll give us the
volume of a sheet that is

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.290
parallel to the zy plane.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.250
And then all we have left to do
is add up a bunch of those

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.570
sheets in the x direction, and
we'll have the volume

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.210
of our entire figure.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.190
So to add up those sheets,
we would have to sum

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.750
in the x direction.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.060
And we'd go from x is equal
to 0, to x is equal to 3.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.660
And to evaluate this
is actually fairly

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.690
straightforward.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.020
So, first we're taking the
integral with respect to z.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.090
Well, we don't have anything
written under here, but we

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.740
can just assume that
there's a 1, right?

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.160
Because dz times dy times
dx is the same thing as

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.940
1 times dz times dy dx.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.500
So what's the value
of this integral?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.760
Well, the antiderivative
of 1 with respect to

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.650
z is just z, right?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.700
Because the derivative
of z is 1.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.640
And you evaluate
that from 2 to 0.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.210
So then you're left with--
so it's 2 minus 0.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.580
So you're just left with 2.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.390
So you're left with 2, and you
take the integral of that from

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.080
y is equal to 0, to y is equal
to 4 dy, and then

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.060
you have the x.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.280
From x is equal to 0,
to x is equal to 3 dx.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.440
And notice, when we just took
the integral with respect to

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.210
z, we ended up with
a double integral.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.830
And this double integral is the
exact integral we would have

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.440
done in the previous videos on
the double integral, where you

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.510
would have just said, well,
z is a function of x and y.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.880
So you could have written, you
know, z, is a function of x

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.230
and y, is always equal to 2.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.180
It's a constant function.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.980
It's independent of x and y.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.210
But if you had defined z in
this way, and you wanted to

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.985
figure out the volume under
this surface, where the surface

00:07:11.985 --> 00:07:15.370
is z is equal to 2-- you
know, this is a surface, is z

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.580
is equal to 2-- we would
have ended up with this.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.130
So you see that what we're
doing with the triple

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.030
integral, it's really,
really nothing different.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.060
And you might be wondering,
well, why are we

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.840
doing it at all?

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.730
And I'll show you
that in a second.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.320
But anyway, to evaluate
this, you could take the

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.070
antiderivative of this with
respect to y, you get 2y-- let

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.760
me scroll down a little bit.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.530
You get 2y evaluating
that at 4 and 0.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.150
And then, so you get 2 times 4.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.540
So it's 8 minus 0.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.070
And then you integrate
that from, with respect

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.340
to x from 0 to 3.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.430
So that's 8x from 0 to 3.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.430
So that'll be equal to
24 four units cubed.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.780
So I know the obvious question
is, what is this good for?

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:05.420
Well, when you have a kind
of a constant value within

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.400
the volume, you're right.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.230
You could have just done
a double integral.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.610
But what if I were to tell you,
our goal is not to figure out

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.670
the volume of this figure.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.550
Our goal is to figure out
the mass of this figure.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.660
And even more, this volume--
this area of space or

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.670
whatever-- its mass
is not uniform.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.190
If its mass was uniform, you
could just multiply its uniform

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.240
density times its volume,
and you'd get its mass.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.040
But let's say the
density changes.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.340
It could be a volume of some
gas or it could be even some

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.070
material with different
compounds in it.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.370
So let's say that its density
is a variable function

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.240
of x, y, and z.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.650
So let's say that the density--
this row, this thing that looks

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.720
like a p is what you normally
use in physics for density-- so

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.390
its density is a function
of x, y, and z.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.710
Let's-- just to make it
simple-- let's make

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.840
it x times y times z.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:06.020
If we wanted to figure out the
mass of any small volume, it

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.440
would be that volume times
the density, right?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.190
Because density-- the units of
density are like kilograms

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.590
per meter cubed.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.400
So if you multiply it times
meter cubed, you get kilograms.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.260
So we could say that the mass--
well, I'll make up notation, d

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.730
mass-- this isn't a function.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.230
Well, I don't want to write it
in parentheses, because it

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.230
makes it look like a function.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.490
So, a very differential mass,
or a very small mass, is going

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:35.860
to equal the density at that
point, which would be xyz,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.810
times the volume of that
of that small mass.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.780
And that volume of that small
mass we could write as dv.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:48.790
And we know that dv is the
same thing as the width times

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.670
the height times the depth.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.350
dv doesn't always have to
be dx times dy times dz.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.000
If we're doing other
coordinates, if we're doing

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.670
polar coordinates, it could be
something slightly different.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.160
And we'll do that eventually.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.280
But if we wanted to figure out
the mass, since we're using

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.550
rectangular coordinates, it
would be the density function

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.030
at that point times our
differential volume.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.330
So times dx dy dz.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.870
And of course, we can
change the order here.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.386
So when you want to figure out
the volume-- when you want to

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:19.000
figure out the mass-- which I
will do in the next video, we

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.290
essentially will have to
integrate this function.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:27.400
As opposed to just
1 over z, y and x.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.690
And I'm going to do that
in the next video.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.050
And you'll see that it's really
just a lot of basic taking

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.700
antiderivatives and avoiding
careless mistakes.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.280
I will see you in
the next video.
