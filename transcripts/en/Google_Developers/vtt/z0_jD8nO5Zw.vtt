PAUL IRISH: Hi, I'm Paul.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.420
PAUL LEWIS: Hi, I'm Paul.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.240
PAUL IRISH: We're going to
be taking a look at the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.250
performance of your sites
and apps that you've

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.260
submitted to us.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.400
PAUL LEWIS: Now, we've
taken a very quick

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.000
look at some of them.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.120
But we haven't spent that long
doing it, just so that we can

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.320
show you how we kind of come
at these things fresh.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.890
PAUL IRISH: So we're going to be
doing an audit of both the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.880
page load time--

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.130
PAUL LEWIS: --and
the run time.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.495
PAUL IRISH: And--

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:19.610
PAUL LEWIS: Well, let's
get on with i.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.970
PAUL IRISH: OK, cool.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.870
So these were the sites
that you submitted.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.340
And let's just-- we're going
to just take a few of them.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.760
So the first one to come
up is myunidays.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.560
Uh, Paul.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.049
PAUL LEWIS: Yes?

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.630
PAUL IRISH: I know that
you took a look.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.930
And it looked interesting.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.420
PAUL LEWIS: It did.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.790
It did.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.890
PAUL IRISH: Want
to drive this?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.320
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.240
So step one always for these
things, for me at least, is to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.910
do a timeline.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.170
So go into DevTools.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.520
Hit Timeline.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.100
Go to frames mode.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.560
And you can hit Command
E, which should

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.820
start things recording.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.670
And then normally, I'll just
do a bit of a scroll test,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490
maybe interact with a few
things, just kind of get the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.910
sense of what's going on.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.530
And oh, you've got an unusual
keyboard now.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.380
How do we get back
to-- there we go.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.920
PAUL IRISH: There we go.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.072
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:01:02.072 --> 00:01:02.720
That's good.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.620
Now um--

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.430
PAUL IRISH: So what
do we see here?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.710
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, so the first
thing that we really, really

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.780
care about is the fact that
we've got this 60 frames a

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.240
second line and then the 30
frames a second line.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.990
And you can see that that's
on the right hand

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.220
side of the top part.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.620
Now we never want our bars to
go above the 60 frames a

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.970
second line.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.190
This is kind of super
critical.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.850
If we want a 60 frames a
second app, which we

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.520
do, never go above.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.760
Now you can see, we are
obviously going way above on

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.750
some of these.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.850
So just by clicking in the
timeline, you start to figure

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.470
out what's actually going on.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.060
Now this is the thing that
really started to bother me,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.215
which is this little exclamation
mark what you can

00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:37.050
see on the left hand side.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.850
So if we spin this--

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.155
oh.

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:40.170
PAUL IRISH: Just click
around here.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.470
There you go.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.870
PAUL LEWIS: OK.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.100
Spin this down.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.520
You can see that we get
some recalc style,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.200
and we get some layout.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.110
And you can see that there's
this little exclamation mark

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.340
on the left hand side.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.000
And that's basically-- when you
roll over the exclamation

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.635
mark, you see this note. "Forced
synchronous layout is

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.650
a possible performance
bottleneck."

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.140
Now what's really happening here
is we've forced Chrome to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.490
answer a question about the
dimension or the position of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.280
an element when it wasn't
really expecting to.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.330
So it has to go off, and it has
to lay out a whole of the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.570
page-- probably, in this case--
plus the partial scope.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.895
So not the whole page, but it
still had to do some work that

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:14.680
it didn't expect to
do in layout.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.050
Then the next we're actually
going to do is probably change

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.670
some style, recalculate.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.270
Recalculate style suggests that
we then change things.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.060
And that invalidated the
previous calculation we did.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.160
So then we lay out against.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.010
So this is called layout
thrashing.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.390
And it's this idea of stepping
back and forth, going layout,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.100
change some styles, layout,
change some styles.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.130
PAUL IRISH: You'll see it--

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.730
it'll commonly-- in the
DevTools, it'll visualize as a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.010
number of just purple bars,
just a big kind

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.200
of cascade of purple.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.170
Often-- and on the left hand
side, you'll see a kind of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.640
recalc val layout going
back and forth.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.190
And hopefully, this little arrow
indicating that yeah,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.000
this is a problem.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.880
PAUL LEWIS: Now, don't be
confused by the fact that it's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.450
often wrapped in a yellow bar.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.900
It's triggered by JavaScript.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.500
But it's not JavaScript.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.320
Right?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.870
PAUL IRISH: Right.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.750
PAUL LEWIS: It can be triggered
by CSS as well.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.670
But it's the fact that when
it was in here, it was

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.665
triggered--

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:03.986
wherever it was.

00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:04.920
I forget now.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.820
PAUL IRISH: So next, what we can
do is we can take a look

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.590
at the actual code
of what happens.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.450
So we have a few options
for doing this.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.900
We can just click ahead in right
here on the link for all

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.420
JS line number 21.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.080
So let's do that.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.720
OK.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.260
So line number 21 is
the remainder of

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.320
the minified jQuery.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.625
So we'll use the prettify
function down here.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.150
[HUMMING]

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.140
All right.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.120
Now come back.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.405
And so what we'll see--

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:41.030
let's take a look
at this again.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.350
Oh, no.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.740
I'm going to record
another timeline.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.070
I'll just scroll like this.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.950
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.780
PAUL IRISH: Come back over, pick
a long frame, go inside.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.953
PAUL LEWIS: Still doesn't
like a bit-- does

00:03:55.953 --> 00:03:57.420
the stack trace change?

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.920
PAUL IRISH: No.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.860
What?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.040
Chrome Canary.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.010
Come on!

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.500
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
PAUL IRISH: So what I'd
like to see is--

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.240
what you'll normally catch in
this case is-- you'll catch an

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.010
instance where the pretty print
will adjust all the line

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.370
numbers for the entire
call stack.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.450
This means that after your
pretty print, you can dive

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.170
into the original location more
or less and figure out

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.050
what the story is.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.060
But the interesting part here is
that we're going to be able

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.920
to not only see kind of where
this came-- so let's try it

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.290
once more, pretty print, and
come back to timeline.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.190
PAUL LEWIS: Hey!

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.270
So this is stable.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.160
He switched to Stable, in case
you didn't notice that.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.595
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, yeah,
Chrome Stable.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:43.880
All right.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.110
So now we have a line
number of 3835.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.410
So if we click through
on this--

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.560
so we're inside of jQuery.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.910
PAUL LEWIS: What do you know?

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.860
Offset width, offset height.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.300
These are kind of classic
candidates for something--

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.250
obviously, this is something
that jQuery is using, which is

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.490
perfectly reasonable to use.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.470
But it's something that--

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.940
when you ask for the offset
width or the offset height,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.140
Chrome's going to have
to go off and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.945
figure out the for that.

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:07.290
Right?

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.930
PAUL IRISH: Right.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.720
And so if we want to figure out
why this happened, we can

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.420
look at the call stack
of this layout.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.360
And so typically, what you're
going to be looking at is this

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.700
Layout Forced section
down here.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.746
Now this is the location that
forced that layout.

00:05:20.746 --> 00:05:23.810
In our case, it is that offset
width, offset height.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.400
But we can walk back
to call stack.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.890
See, we're inside jQuery,
jQuery, jQuery.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.050
But we get back to here,
Get Size Info.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.530
Here on Get Size Info, we're
able to basically--

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.520
whoops.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.320
Let me try that again.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.710
I just want to make sure that
this is big enough for

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.350
everyone to see.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.440
How about--

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.340
there we go.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.790
PAUL LEWIS: How are
we doing now?

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.030
PAUL IRISH: There we go.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.710
Looking good.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.080
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.450
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.000
So Get Size Info, don't
think it's jQuery.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.476
I'll click over to it in here.

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:54.210
All right.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.690
So Get Size Info, we get
the view port width.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.740
We grab the wrapper.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.100
We walk up its parent
chain twice.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.000
And we get the width
of that parent.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.570
And so it looks like Get Size
Info is actually being called

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.660
inside of tick.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.820
And tick is being called
how often?

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.030
PAUL LEWIS: Every two
seconds, maybe.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.530
Maybe more.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.490
2,000, there we go.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.520
PAUL IRISH: Every two seconds.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.770
So that's--

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.380
[INAUDIBLE] intervals.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.590
PAUL LEWIS: Because we figured
this-- is this part of the

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.710
carousel or something
like that?

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.560
Do we know?

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.730
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, scroll
up a little bit.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.520
I think--

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.530
PAUL LEWIS: There we go,
function carousel.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.890
So there's a carousel
on this site

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.830
ticking every two seconds.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.980
It's kind of going into layout
thrashing for whatever reason.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.120
Yeah, it's probably that one.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.250
PAUL IRISH: There are a
few carousels there.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.860
PAUL LEWIS: OK, there
are a few carousels.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.430
OK.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.500
So it's probably several
carousels

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.080
that are causing this.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.320
So you're always probably in
some kind of recalc layout

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.360
thrashing kind of mode at
some points or other.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.010
PAUL IRISH: Right.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.980
In this case, there
are a few options.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.150
It's likely that actually the
width of that parent parent

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.330
probably isn't going
to be changing.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.200
You can-- so if you're seeing
this, and you want to avoid

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.230
this time spent layout
thrashing, you want to be able

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.990
to cache these values,
hold on to them.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.610
So you don't need to go back and
re-query the DOM while the

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.370
browser is trying to paint
updates to the user.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.270
You want to just let
it paint updates.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.440
And so give it all the
truth ahead of time.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.570
PAUL LEWIS: If it is a
responsive site, then you

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.580
probably want to do it in things
like the resize handler

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.975
or something like that, just
somewhere where you can

00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:32.350
actually say, look, I'm only
carrying when you actually

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.930
definitely resize this stuff.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.960
PAUL IRISH: So I
would disagree.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.470
PAUL LEWIS: Ooh, where
would you put it?

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:36.860
PAUL IRISH: [LAUGHS]

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.960
PAUL LEWIS: That's fine.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.980
What'd you do it in? rAF?

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.500
PAUL IRISH: I did it in rAF.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.220
PAUL LEWIS: OK, he's
just doing it--

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.380
OK, fair enough.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.900
Do the [INAUDIBLE] and just set
a rAF inside your resize

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.360
handler, at which point
you'll pick up the--

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.000
PAUL IRISH:
requestAnimationFrame.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.850
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.475
That's fine.

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:50.370
PAUL IRISH: So actually,
I want to

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.990
spend a moment on this.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.840
Resize events.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.000
There's only a few things that
you should ever do inside of a

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.300
resize event or a
scroll event.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.550
Let's take scroll because
it's a little bit more

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.370
common of an example.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:09.300
Inside a scroll event, you can
ask for, let's say, get the

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.120
scroll top, the scroll
top metric.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.100
You ca also ask for the
time, probably.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.900
And that's about it.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.620
You do not want to do any other
work inside the handler.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.750
So minimizing the amount of work
that you're doing in the

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.990
handler, do the work that you
actually have to do inside of

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.090
requestAnimationFrame.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.780
So that's where you're going
to do your work.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.880
And what this allows the
browser to do is--

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.130
it gets out of scroll.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.299
When you bind a scroll, what it
means is that when a person

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:42.230
puts their finger down on the
site, on your site, and

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.620
scrolls the page like that,
everything that you have bound

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.040
to a scroll handler means--

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:53.030
it has to execute that before it
can even update the page to

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.770
scroll it, reacting to
that finger move.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.250
PAUL LEWIS: The other thing
is you might actually get

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.540
multiple scroll events
per frame.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:08:59.780
Right?

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.140
So if you're doing work in the--
you only probably care

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.030
about the last one.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.365
Right?

00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:03.700
PAUL IRISH: Right.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.790
PAUL LEWIS: And the other things
you want to do is if

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.910
you do this debouncing--

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.290
which is what it's often
referred to as--

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.230
you want to make sure that you
don't shed your multiple

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.890
requestAnimaitonFrame
call backs.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.530
So you want to make
sure that--

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.010
however many scrolls you've got,
you just say, look, just

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.780
set requestAnimaitonFrame call
back, store the value.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.080
OK?

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.925
And then inside that
requestAnimationFrame call

00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:22.840
back, you say, well, what was
the most recent value?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.660
Now do my visual updates and
paint to the screen.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.800
PAUL IRISH: This is something
that's really important if

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.980
you're doing any sort of
scrolling parallax site.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.620
There are a few parallax
scripts that

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.010
do this exact technique.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.450
Stellar.js, I know
is one of them.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.870
But this is something to
watch out for, to make

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:36.600
sure that you do.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.030
Otherwise, the performance of
the scrolling in the parallax

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.080
is going to be really poor.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.620
They can get bad.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:42.970
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.790
Shall we roll on?

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.064
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, let's
take a look.

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:45.950
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.320
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.080
So I've got a few more here.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.670
There's one up here at the
top I want to take

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.500
a quick look at.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.580
So this Voos.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.910
It is a big, big
Wordpress site.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.180
They are using mod_pagespeed
already.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.860
Awesome.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.250
What else can we do?

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.420
So I opened this up earlier.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.970
It's taking a while right now.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.960
Actually, the domain was
br.staticcontent.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.570
So I think actually--
we're in London.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.820
It's coming over the
wire from Brazil.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.590
So transfer time is going
to take a while.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.560
CDN would help for us, but
not help for Brazilians.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.880
So all right.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.470
So it's a pretty basic
site here.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:29.040
So other than going into the
interaction speed of these

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.870
form controls--

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.120
but I thought it would be
interesting to look at it from

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.490
a network perspective.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.930
So I went to a WebPagetest just

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.460
before I started recording.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.660
A I dropped Voos in here.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.470
And WebPagetest usually
only takes a few.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.050
Minutes

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.440
PAUL LEWIS: But you changed
the location, right?

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.190
For up to--

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.850
PAUL IRISH: Oh, I did, yeah.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.570
So you can actually just say
in here what the test

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.600
location should be.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.010
And there's locations
all over the globe.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.520
So if you want to get kind of a
real world, over the network

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.130
experience--

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.990
PAUL LEWIS: So you set it to
Buenos Aires, so Argentina,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.080
which is not so far away.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.490
It's still in South America.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.850
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:03.265
PAUL LEWIS: OK.

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:04.410
So it's a little bit nearer.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.370
So it's not skewed by our
London-ness right now.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.730
PAUL IRISH: Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.380
So this is the report.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.810
And so WebPagetest is going
to give us a lot of data.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.210
And one of the most important
things is the waterfall.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.560
I'll show right after it.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.220
This is the connection view.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.210
This is pretty rad.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.410
So you'll have--

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.880
so it looks at TCP
connections.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.240
Sometimes a browser will share
the same TCP pipe.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:35.290
So actually it requested a
JavaScript file on a single

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.960
connection and then another
JavaScript file to share in

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.310
the exact same one.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.190
This can be helpful sometimes.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.950
But a lot of time, what you're
looking at is the waterfall.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.680
Now, so this at the very
top is just the

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.190
HTML that comes in.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.330
You can see we're
taking a while.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.760
We're waiting on the server.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.100
But then it's downloading
here.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.030
But what I notice immediately
is I noticed a lot of

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.500
JavaScript up at the top.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.830
So search box helper, functions,
jQuery, jQuery

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.650
templating plug-in.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.600
And since these are
up at the top--

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.170
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, because
you'd expect--

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.360
if this was in flow, you'd
expect all the images,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:11.990
everything else.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.440
And then best practice is
JavaScript at the end, right?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.206
PAUL IRISH: Yes.

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:16.260
So let's take a look.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.300
So we hop over.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.772
We view source.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.490
[HUMMING]

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.960
Find, I like just
bracket script.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.700
PAUL LEWIS: Make it bigger
for everybody.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.170
PAUL IRISH: Here we go.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.790
Actually, the most
important thing--

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.470
it's probably hard to see.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.420
But way over here on the right
is the scroll bar.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.790
And you can see, there's a lot
of matches in my scroll bar in

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.200
the very top right, whereas
there's not matches at the

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.650
bottom as much.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.510
But so if we look up here on
the top, you can see, yup.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.820
Here's all the scripts
in the head.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.280
And so we have jQuery and then
templating plug-in, base, all

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.480
these things.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.440
So a browser is going to have
to request and complete

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.760
execution of all of these files
before it even starts to

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.880
show this sort of content
to a user.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.830
That's just how it works.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.720
This could be mitigated
potentially with async

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.100
attribute up here.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.310
But generally, the best practice
is to throw all the

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.730
scripts at the bottom,
of course.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.260
Concat as much as you can.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.280
So that is the obvious
thing that I see

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.740
from WebPagetest waterfall.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.390
Anything else?

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.090
It looks like there's flag
images that are sprited.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.420
PAUL LEWIS: That's usually
a good thing.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.740
PAUL IRISH: Good thing.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.850
So the comment actually says
that mod_pagespeed is enabled.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.480
mod_pagespeed by default is
actually not too aggressive.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.710
So I would take a look at
configuring a few more filters

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.120
to be turned on by default.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.340
One of my favorites
is around images.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.210
There is a lot of
images of stuff.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.770
But yeah.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:02.650
Here, this one at the top.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.390
This is rewrite_images.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.010
So mod_pagespeed is a module for
Apache, also available for

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.920
EngineX, which is rad.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.040
This rewrite_images
does a few things.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.290
It in-lines images.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.530
So if an image is under some
threshold, it'll just do it as

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.340
a data URI.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.260
PAUL LEWIS: So we've now
removed the additional

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.010
request, right?

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.050
PAUL IRISH: Yup, absolutely.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.150
It'll recompress images,
losslessly recompress them to

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.010
be even smaller than
they should be.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.180
PAUL LEWIS: How does
it do that?

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.820
PAUL IRISH: Sorry.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.640
Losslessly--

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.160
it's the same quality,
visually.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:31.830
PAUL LEWIS: Oh, OK.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.220
PAUL IRISH: Get rid of
excess stuff that

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:33.830
doesn't need to be there.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:34.300
PAUL LEWIS: OK.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:34.770
Right.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.370
Does it transcode?

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.920
PAUL IRISH: Um, no.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.010
PAUL LEWIS: Is that a
different filter?

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:39.850
PAUL IRISH: Different filter.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:40.140
PAUL LEWIS: OK.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.110
So you've actually got options
of just optimizing your images

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.780
on the fly, but not transcoding
them over to, say,

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.320
WebP or-- assuming you've
started with PNT or JPEG.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.840
PAUL IRISH: Yes.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.900
And resize_images,
which is pretty.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.330
So resize_images will take
effect if you have an inline

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:57.230
width or height attribute
on the image tag

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.910
or an inline style.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.790
It will resize the image to fit
natively as that size that

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.860
the page is requesting
it be in.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.470
PAUL LEWIS: I like it.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.590
PAUL IRISH: Really powerful.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.190
So that gives you all those
things for free.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.530
So if you are digging into
mod_pagespeed or index page

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.510
speed, which you should, it does
all this work for you.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.110
So your build script does
not have to be as crazy.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.690
Dig into these filters, try
some out because there's a

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.500
lot, a lot power in there.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.410
PAUL LEWIS: I think that's
really good to point that just

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.850
by having pagespeed step
one, but step two--

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.070
PAUL IRISH: Definitely.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.930
PAUL LEWIS: Step two
is definitely

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.070
look at those filters.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.660
So they're not just a kind
of-- and you're done.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.686
PAUL IRISH: Yup.

00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:35.400
Yup.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.625
What's next?

00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:38.960
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.820
PAUL LEWIS: Do you want
to meet the Ipsums?

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.920
PAUL IRISH: Meet the Ipsums.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.950
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, let's
meet the Ipsums.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:43.310
PAUL IRISH: Let's do it.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.340
PAUL LEWIS: This is a great
little site, very amusing to

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.810
me, this whole site, different
forms of lorem ipsum.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.000
This one is featuring cat ipsum
and veggie ipsum, so

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.420
celery, seakale, all these
different kinds of veggies,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.430
corporate ipsum.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.610
I like this one.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.350
I've worked in those kind of
environments for a while.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.570
PAUL IRISH: That's nice.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.180
PAUL LEWIS: So I was
looking at this.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.260
And I thought, this is great.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.180
It's a really clean,
simple site.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.820
And so I was busy looking at
the time, as I always do.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.140
So I did a run.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.870
And then I was just scrolling
just like that.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.330
And it kind of felt janky.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.470
And I was like, but why?

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.570
And then--

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.915
so paint is a thing.

00:16:19.915 --> 00:16:20.370
PAUL IRISH: Yup.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:20.550
Big thing.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.190
PAUL LEWIS: It's a big thing.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.720
And you can see here, it's--

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.540
I mean, you can't see Chrome
so much in the background.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.170
But as you roll over this
record, you actually see a

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.810
blue area highlighted in Chrome,
which is kind of--

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.400
it's the area that had
to be repainted.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.650
And looking at the size
of this thing--

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.950
1526 by 882--

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.700
it's like, that's big.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.180
We want to reduce paint size
and paint complexity.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.970
And I'm thinking paint size is
a good first start here.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.710
Spin it down.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.980
There's a couple of paints in
here that we can look at.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.670
And yeah, there's a couple
of smaller ones.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.840
But clearly, there's
this big paint.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.570
So I'm thinking, well, this
is just scrolling.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.860
It doesn't seem to
be doing much.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:04.440
I get to end of the page and
there's this fixed position

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.319
element at the background.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.970
Now--

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.380
PAUL IRISH: Now one thing that I
was wondering-- so normally,

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.150
a paint, when you scroll, at
least on desktop, the paint

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.819
will just happen at
the bottom, right?

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.380
As I'm scrolling, the paint
will supplement the new

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.910
content as that comes in?

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.369
PAUL LEWIS: It is going
to paint whatever--

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:21.690
yeah.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.920
So if you're scrolling, yes.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.660
It's exactly-- if you're up or
down, it depends on which end

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.760
of the-- the page needs
to be kind of handled.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.950
PAUL IRISH: Yeah But what
we're seeing here is

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.300
that this paint is--

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.740
you can see kind of this
blue highlight.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.050
It is the entire page.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.900
And then this one again,
the entire page.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.370
PAUL LEWIS: Now the reason for
this is most likely that

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.670
Chrome is looking at all the
styles of all the elements,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.160
and it's grouping that fixed
position element with the

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.610
content that's scrolling.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.500
So as it scrolls, the that fixed
position element needs

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.230
to be repainted so that it can
fill up the view port.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.760
And then the scrolling content
sits over the top.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.320
So it's almost like it's
pointless because-- it's just

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.720
one of these things, definitely
looking at ways

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.160
that we can make this better.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.290
The fix for it, if you're
interested, would be to go

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:11.130
into the elements and would be
to promote the footer, which

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.145
is this fixed--

00:18:12.145 --> 00:18:14.280
you can see it over here,
position fixed.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.290
Would be to promote this
to its own layer.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.050
So that basically, all the
compositor has to do is just

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.030
leave that there.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.590
And the scrolling content
can move over the

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.460
top in its own layer.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.620
And the simplest way to
do that that I know--

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.050
whoops, put that back--

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.100
is to use the 3D transform.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.030
So use it sparingly.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.420
But this is a classic case for
it, where we're painting

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.230
something on every frame,
something that doesn't need to

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.790
be repainted.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.270
So let's do that web
kit transform.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.840
Why not?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.850
PAUL IRISH: Say it with
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:37.574
PAUL LEWIS: TranslateZ.

00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:38.382
PAUL IRISH: [SNAPS FINGERS]

00:18:38.382 --> 00:18:39.400
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
that's right.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:39.880
It's so catchy.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.310
I mean, I've even caught
my non-nerdy wife

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.040
talking about this.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.880
No, I haven't really.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.560
It's a lie.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.380
It's a lie.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:45.710
PAUL IRISH: [LAUGHS]

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.080
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.510
So I've translated it.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.490
Does it look any different?

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.200
Maybe, maybe not.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.830
Let's find out.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.670
Let's do a test and see what
happens when we scroll.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.510
PAUL IRISH: Oh, that
looks nice.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:58.540
PAUL LEWIS: So now we've much
reduced our paint costs.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.850
Now there are things
going on here.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.910
But that's the main thing
in this right now.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.460
PAUL IRISH: Can we take a look
at this with Show Paint

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:05.845
Rectangles?

00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:07.270
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.010
PAUL IRISH: Are we going to
see a difference between

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.025
before and after that?

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:10.340
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.890
So we don't need to do anything
other than-- we can

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.050
toggle the style on and off.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.690
So what that'll do is-- we'll
pop down onto the cog here.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.250
We can switch on Show
Paint Rectangles.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.310
And we do that.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.760
That's all we need to do.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.430
And [INAUDIBLE], let's
just close.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.810
Yeah, thank you.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.990
You know all the shortcuts.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.160
Aw.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:28.870
PAUL IRISH: Escape.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.530
PAUL LEWIS: Is that
what it is?

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.750
PAUL IRISH: Yeah,
there you go.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:31.520
PAUL LEWIS: Oh, I feel better
for knowing that.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.270
Finding that out on air!

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.935
That's good.

00:19:33.935 --> 00:19:35.230
It's good to go.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.900
So what I need to do is I need
to go back to the elements.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.460
I need to switch off
my translateZ.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.525
Now when I scroll, you'll see
that whole thing is bright

00:19:43.525 --> 00:19:45.970
red, as is the scroll bar
on the right hand side.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.590
And that's just Chrome saying,
you know what?

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.710
These are the things
I have to paint.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.530
So the scroll bar makes
perfect sense.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.510
That's normal.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.820
But seeing that whole thing,
oh, that's not so good.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.220
So when we switch on the
translateZ, and we push that

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.160
out to its own layer-- that
background out to its own

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.610
layer-- what's going to actually
happen, is the

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:04.070
content that's sitting on
the top is also going

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.060
to get its own layer.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.810
But we basically have
separated them out.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.670
We kind of forced Chrome's
hand a little bit.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.035
And now when we scroll--

00:20:13.035 --> 00:20:13.570
PAUL IRISH: There it is.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.840
PAUL LEWIS: There we go.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.180
So using Show Paint Rectangles
or even just DevTools, you'll

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.480
find that you'll actually see
when things are painting.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.626
And that's actually-- yeah.

00:20:23.626 --> 00:20:24.680
PAUL IRISH: [MAKES GUN SOUNDS]

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.550
PAUL LEWIS: So you can see--

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.150
yeah, including sound effects.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.120
When you get to the top,
obviously this is--

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.840
again, it makes sense for
this to probably--

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.620
PAUL IRISH: Oh, oh, oh.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.310
PAUL LEWIS: But they
could probably--

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.200
PAUL IRISH: Another
opportunity.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.610
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, there is
another opportunity.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.305
Instead of, I'm guessing, 2D
transforms here, if it were

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:40.810
me, I'd look at 3D
transforms again.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.980
These are the things that don't
want to interact with

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.340
each other.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.030
They just want to move around.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.010
They want their own layer.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.410
PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.970
We need two disclaimers here,
two separate disclaimers.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:50.680
PAUL LEWIS: OK.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:50.840
I like disclaimers.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.970
PAUL IRISH: OK, the first
one, you kind of

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.050
wrote about, I think.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.220
I'm just going to guess--

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:55.560
PAUL LEWIS: There it is.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:55.900
It just--

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.390
I--

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.050
PAUL IRISH: --layer
promotion, maybe.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:58.450
PAUL LEWIS: Try it.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.707
Let's see.

00:21:00.707 --> 00:21:01.870
PAUL IRISH: All right, yeah.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:02.255
OK, cool.

00:21:02.255 --> 00:21:05.300
It's a part of this blog post
about the layer promotion

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.890
translateZ, translate3d hack.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.150
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.180
It's actually one of about six
or seven rules that Chrome

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.930
will use when it's
deciding to put

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.850
something on its own layer.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.630
And translateZ is the most
well known of the family.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.640
PAUL IRISH: And so it is a
hack.k and we feel interesting

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.710
about recommend it.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.340
And this article explains some
of the downsides and some of

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.630
the things that you need
to be aware of.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.050
It's not just a silver bullet.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:31.950
It has downsides.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.070
So read this.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.350
And the other disclaimer,
I think, is about

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.740
cross-browserness.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.250
Of all the things that we're
talking about today--

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.770
PAUL LEWIS: This is the least
cross-browser thing, right?

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.600
PAUL IRISH: Is it?

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.270
PAUL LEWIS: Because it's
not going to--

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.690
PAUL IRISH: Oh, yeah.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.000
Even Chrome on Android,
it really

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.645
doesn't do these things.

00:21:47.645 --> 00:21:49.790
PAUL LEWIS: Chrome on Android
and also word on the street is

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.570
that Safari no longer honors
it as a layer creation, or

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.190
certainly won't do
in the future.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.616
And it's not-- you know, it's
a webkit prefixed thing, so

00:21:58.616 --> 00:21:59.770
it's not going to
work in Firefox.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.980
PAUL IRISH: But the networked
stuff that we should before,

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.940
absolute cross-browser.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.110
Layout thrashing--

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.320
the way that the specs are
written for HTML recalculation

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.680
style, browsers have a
lot of consistency

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.690
between how they work.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.590
So layout thrashing is
real everywhere.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.140
PAUL LEWIS: It's called
reflow in Firefox.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:19.700
PAUL IRISH: Reflow, yeah.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.680
It's the exact same thing.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.880
And so when you see reflow as
a term, it's this issue.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.880
So it's a cross-browser
situation.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.570
Anything else?

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.440
Expensive paints.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.674
Expensive paints can be--

00:22:33.674 --> 00:22:35.400
it's hard to say.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.730
And right now, there's--

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.880
for what's expensive to
paint in Firefox and

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.890
IE is a little unclear.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.450
We're hoping to find out
more about that.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.030
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.740
I think that's the thing.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.750
I mean, you have
to profile it.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.090
It's not always easy to do that
in a cross-browser way.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.240
And you obviously don't want
to do anything that is an

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.270
anti-pattern elsewhere.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.000
But generally speaking,
not painting is a

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.800
good pattern for everybody.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.230
Not paintings is not painting,
irrespective of your browser.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.570
So it's a good thing.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:01.666
Do you want to hear
another one?

00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:02.080
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.865
I want to show you this one.

00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:04.830
Whew.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:05.310
OK.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.270
Let's take a look.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.510
All right.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.800
So--

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.630
PAUL LEWIS: Oh wow, yeah.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.780
PAUL IRISH: There's a bit
of load time right here.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.420
Is that slow?

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.080
I'm just going to bump that into
a WebPagetest while we

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.280
kind of wait for it.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.390
PAUL LEWIS: It's like
two tests in one.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.750
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.280
Let's go for it.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.615
We'll use--

00:23:22.615 --> 00:23:24.860
oh, what's up?

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.372
PAUL LEWIS: Sounds like
it's got sound.

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:28.420
PAUL IRISH: We've got
sound coming here.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.560
I'm going to turn it off just
because-- whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.120
whoa, whoa.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.328
Chill out, guys.

00:23:34.328 --> 00:23:34.760
All right.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.150
We're in the front
of the queue.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:36.280
Good.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.690
Go back.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.810
What do we do?

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.450
PAUL LEWIS: Click.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.860
PAUL IRISH: Click.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.955
PAUL LEWIS: And then
you hit the--

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:45.700
I think it's--

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.020
PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.540
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, try
using-- there we go.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.340
OK, now you roll your
mouse around and--

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.760
now I don't know if you can
see this on the video, but

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.470
this is hideously janky.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.380
This is really bad.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.650
PAUL IRISH: This was submitted
by someone who wanted us to

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.040
talk about it.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.435
I mean--

00:24:02.435 --> 00:24:02.720
PAUL LEWIS: Sorry.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.930
PAUL IRISH: I feel like you're
being a bit mean here.

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.020
PAUL LEWIS: I mean, this is
taking upwards of a second to

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.570
update the screen.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:11.480
PAUL IRISH: These
are Voronois.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.886
There's a Voronoi
map behind it.

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:14.258
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:14.258 --> 00:24:15.870
Yeah.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:16.430
PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.978
So let's take a look at why.

00:24:19.978 --> 00:24:20.390
All right.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.130
So I'm going to Command Option
I into DevTools.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.267
We're going to head into
Timeline soon.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:31.950
Come on.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.670
Play nice.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.000
PAUL LEWIS: You making it mad?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.290
PAUL IRISH: I'm making
it very mad.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.354
Hey, we're just friends.

00:24:40.354 --> 00:24:41.270
PAUL LEWIS: Did you
crash the browser?

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.070
PAUL IRISH: We can--

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.590
and you can--

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.690
come on.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.440
Oh, it is really mad.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.220
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
you made it mad.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.400
PAUL IRISH: This is
what I get for--

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.650
PAUL LEWIS: Turning me off.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.310
The browser sided with me.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.990
PAUL IRISH: Oh.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.500
Let's kill that one.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.940
Oh, that was the one that
I didn't-- oh, no.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.160
PAUL LEWIS: You didn't
want that to happen.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.070
PAUL IRISH: I didn't want
that to happen.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.910
PAUL LEWIS: This goes to show,
profiling is not always the

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.170
easiest task [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.430
Sometimes these things break.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.060
All right.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.460
That looked good, looked
like you had it there.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:14.820
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.070
I think I got it.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.720
So let's give this a shot.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.800
We've got Timeline open.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.835
I got this.

00:25:25.835 --> 00:25:27.800
PAUL LEWIS: Maybe you
have to press a key.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.045
PAUL IRISH: Play with me.

00:25:29.045 --> 00:25:30.050
This is--

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.470
translate is trying
to take over.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.720
I don't want you, translate.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.800
PAUL LEWIS: We might need
to leave this one, then.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.470
PAUL IRISH: Leaving it.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.340
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.500
PAUL IRISH: I just--

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.820
before a movie theater, there
was this preroll.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.830
And it was advertising
movietickets.com.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.420
And there was this really funny
ad, where the woman--

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.560
they're getting out
of the minivan.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.290
And it's like a Mission
Impossible to get

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.580
to the movie tickets.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.810
And then the kid falls getting
out of the minivan.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.460
And the mom was like, leave
him, leave him.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.676
And my mom really loves that
commercial, which--

00:26:03.676 --> 00:26:04.520
PAUL LEWIS: I'm seeing
so much about your

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.710
upbringing right now.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.060
In that 20 seconds, I didn't
expect that, if I'm honest.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.000
Folks, I hope you enjoyed
that as much as I did.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.010
Well.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.172
PAUL IRISH: It's there.

00:26:19.172 --> 00:26:19.960
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.180
There's these paint
rectangles.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.290
PAUL IRISH: Show Paint
Rectangles is on.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.800
PAUL LEWIS: That's
probably why.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.630
It's probably mad.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.250
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, it's
really mad at us.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:26.660
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.480
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.870
So we're going to move
to something else.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.680
This is Behzad, designer
and developer.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.490
Let's take a look.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.800
So you can-- it says we can
use kind of the keys here.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.610
Down.

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.010
PAUL LEWIS: This is looking
pretty good, right?

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.840
This is looking pretty--

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.460
PAUL IRISH: Wow.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.970
Wow.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.050
Someone hire this man.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.930
All right.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.360
There's this kind of
playful, kind of--

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.690
the background is parallaxing
two directions as these kind

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.620
of play a little bit.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.270
PAUL LEWIS: And I'm seeing--

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.770
when I'm watching, say, the
phone here in this image, it's

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:01.990
kind of janking around.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.700
It doesn't feel like
it's smooth motion.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.130
PAUL IRISH: I don't know.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.150
PAUL LEWIS: I'm wondering
about this.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.720
PAUL IRISH: Do you think
we can improve it?

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.360
PAUL LEWIS: Well,
I don't know.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.150
Let's find out what
it's doing.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.470
PAUL IRISH: Honestly,
I think it's--

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.750
OK.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.020
So let's--

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.120
PAUL LEWIS: See, I'm seeing
paints, right?

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.660
PAUL IRISH: It's all paint.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.020
It's all paint.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:14.780
Paint Recs is still on.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.800
I'm going to make sure
that that's off.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.530
We want that.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:19.850
It's not going to
change anything.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.800
It's all the same.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.280
OK.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.840
I'm using Command D. It's fast.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.090
All right.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:25.880
So we look in.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.220
And we're all just--
we're in pain land.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:28.780
PAUL LEWIS: Image resize!

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.540
PAUL IRISH: Image resize!

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.720
PAUL LEWIS: 50 milliseconds.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.050
PAUL IRISH: Wow.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.120
PAUL LEWIS: Who knew?

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.720
PAUL IRISH: Wow.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.530
That's really good to know.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:37.990
OK.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.410
So image resize, unexpected.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.480
PAUL LEWIS: So decoding and
resizing alike, there are

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.750
dependencies for paint.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.210
So when Chrome hits something
that's it going to paint, it

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.030
goes, right, do I need
any images for this?

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.340
And it doesn't keep--

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.480
it keeps the PNG or the
JPEG in memory.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.380
But it doesn't keep the bitmap
for that, the expanded,

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.200
decompressed version
of that in memory.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.790
So it what it does, it goes
off on the fly and says,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.890
right, decode and decompress
that image out to a bitmap.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.420
And then resize it down.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.790
So because we don't see a decode
here, something that

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.130
was already decoded in resident
memory, but it had to

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.330
be re-sized.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.162
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:28:13.162 --> 00:28:14.520
So it's this image, clearly.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.012
PAUL LEWIS: You think?

00:28:16.012 --> 00:28:16.974
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:28:16.974 --> 00:28:19.250
PAUL LEWIS: I'm down with it.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.110
PAUL IRISH: I don't really
know where it is.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.910
But it's in here.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:23.780
Are you in here?

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.690
Yup.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.190
I'm using H to kind
of navigate the

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.090
DOM and hide parts.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.987
It's in there?

00:28:29.987 --> 00:28:31.210
Got it.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.380
OK.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.960
So oh, yeah.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.610
Naturally, 220 pixels.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.700
I mean, it's a big image.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.860
PAUL LEWIS: 2,200, right?

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.330
PAUL IRISH: Yes.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.810
The larger the image, the more
expensive the resize will

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.080
cost, which makes sense.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.030
But--

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.130
PAUL LEWIS: And this doesn't
actually make--

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.410
I mean, for me, I was
looking at this.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.220
And it's not resizing.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.420
It doesn't seem to
be resizing.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.410
As you were moving, it was
moving left and top or

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:58.990
translating.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.410
But it wasn't resizing.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.370
So I wonder why there's
a resize going on.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.950
PAUL IRISH: So it's
definitely--

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.010
yeah, left and tops.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.880
PAUL LEWIS: So maybe something
is resizing it.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.540
But it seems unusual to need
to resize it at all.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.070
I guess what I'm driving at is
it could be served up that

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.420
size potentially, and the
problem would be solved.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.040
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, OK.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.560
Let's--

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.990
PAUL LEWIS: I mean, just looking
at this profile.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.160
I mean, this is all
green, right?

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.450
This is all paint work
that's happening.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.820
PAUL IRISH: Yeah,
but I think--

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.750
I mean, it's triggered
off a mouse move.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.330
There's a mouse move that's
watching the work.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.584
Command uh--

00:29:33.584 --> 00:29:36.080
PAUL LEWIS: Command
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.120
What are you doing?

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.380
PAUL IRISH: I'm really
interested in what happens

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.190
inside this image.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.030
PAUL LEWIS: I don't blame you.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.405
I'm fascinated, too.

00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:43.300
PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:43.840
PAUL LEWIS: I'm just
trying to--

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.920
PAUL IRISH: BG01.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.786
PAUL LEWIS: All right.

00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:46.850
Because you're going quick.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:48.707
And I'm wondering if people
are going to follow what

00:29:48.707 --> 00:29:49.040
you're doing.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:49.550
PAUL IRISH: Well, OK.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:50.960
So I just found--

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.600
we grabbed the image.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.360
PAUL LEWIS: Can I--

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.190
he's got--

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.230
PAUL IRISH: We're in the
mouse move, right?

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.900
We're in the mouse move, inside
this start screen.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.820
So it looks like it's only just
mouse moves inside this

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.070
start screen, which
is good, rather

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.960
than the entire document.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.390
PAUL LEWIS: Yup, yup, yup.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.840
PAUL IRISH: But we re-grab
that element.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.860
So we're doing a jQuery
traversal every single mouse

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.700
move, which we don't
need to, obviously.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.670
We could cache that.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.840
PAUL LEWIS: I'm seeing width and
height all over the place,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.940
which feels like something
that wouldn't change.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.320
PAUL IRISH: Width and height,
probably not going to change.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.790
PAUL LEWIS: No.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:20.760
I mean, that's only--

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.120
you could do those off of
requestAnimationFrame, off of

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.250
window resize.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.410
PAUL IRISH: Then we just do a
bunch of math for the position

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:32.640
of the mouse and the current
width, height.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.310
And then we just set the
left top to get the--

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.130
oh, it looks like he tried
some animation.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.360
And that probably didn't
perform well.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.580
PAUL LEWIS: It's interesting
that there's a--

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.020
oh, a failed 3D transform
document.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.860
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.720
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, I would love
to know why that was--

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.250
PAUL IRISH: Come on.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.910
Live edit, bro.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:49.880
Live edit.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.348
PAUL LEWIS: I would
love to know why--

00:30:51.348 --> 00:30:53.220
that's smooth!

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.156
PAUL IRISH: That is smooth!

00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:55.180
PAUL LEWIS: That's amazing.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.620
PAUL IRISH: Let's go back.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.070
OK, Timeline looked like this.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.230
Command D. What the--
wait, wait.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.110
There we go.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.500
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.670
PAUL LEWIS: That's--

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:03.790
PAUL IRISH: Seems better.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:04.930
PAUL LEWIS: That seems better.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:05.240
PAUL IRISH: Seems better.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.010
PAUL LEWIS: That's breaking
through less often.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.290
Switch it back.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:09.500
All right.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.970
So we're seeing 60
frames a second.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.050
Boom.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.490
Yeah.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.760
PAUL IRISH: I bet this was
all set up for us.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.310
PAUL LEWIS: I kno.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.610
It genuinely wasn't.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.970
That's the best bit of this.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:20.970
OK, yeah

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:21.970
PAUL IRISH: I don't know
what's going on.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.470
PAUL LEWIS: That doesn't
feel like--

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.980
all right.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.890
Is that doing the right thing?

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.200
Did you save the change?

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.470
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, yeah, I did.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.220
PAUL LEWIS: Are you sure?

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.176
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, I'm sure.

00:31:30.176 --> 00:31:30.930
PAUL LEWIS: OK.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.240
PAUL IRISH: Here, I'm going to--
this is probably a better

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.180
way to do it.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.140
PAUL LEWIS: You're
going to relead?

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.400
PAUL IRISH: No, I'm
not reloading.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.620
Start, move.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.840
[HUMMING]

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.400
Come over here.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.010
Sources, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.580
Save, patch to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.270
Come back.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.396
And, and, go, and--

00:31:48.396 --> 00:31:49.320
hard to say.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.360
PAUL LEWIS: Very hard to say,
based on what you just did.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:52.790
PAUL IRISH: It does--

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:56.360
I mean, at first glance,
it looked like--

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.440
I mean, you saw what
I did, right?

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:57.990
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.960
PAUL IRISH: I mean,
it was just fast.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.070
PAUL LEWIS: It was
just, [YELLS].

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.170
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.740
Well, sorry.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.010
It does--

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:02.270
OK.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.160
PAUL LEWIS: That's what it's
like working with Paul Irish.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.970
PAUL IRISH: I think
I was making--

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.160
PAUL LEWIS: Some people
are slow.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.740
Some people are fast.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.440
And then there's Paul Irish.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.950
PAUL IRISH: I-- yeah.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.780
So it looks like it actually
was more costly.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.256
PAUL LEWIS: I would be
interested in spending a bit

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:16.430
more time on this if
I were the author.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.190
PAUL IRISH: I think Behzad--
he tried it.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.970
And he saw this.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.160
And then he went back and went
like, I'm just going to set

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.750
left top, which is cray-cray
because--

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.190
[LAUGHING]

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.910
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:27.690
PAUL IRISH: Anyways.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.830
PAUL LEWIS: But I
still think--

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.500
for me, I would look at the
3D transform again.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.600
It seems like that might be
the better option here.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.720
It's hard to say for sure.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.205
But it seems like it might
be worth trying.

00:32:40.205 --> 00:32:40.570
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.095
The other thing I think that's
probably important is--

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.460
we keep asking about the width
and height of this image.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.950
And it might that which is
causing the size, like the

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:56.920
browser is not terribly
confident in what

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.410
the actual size is.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.850
And so it's going
to ask again.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.030
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.826
I mean, there's no reason to
keep querying the width and

00:33:03.826 --> 00:33:04.100
height there.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:09.230
I think that's definitely
something to take a look at.

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.770
That's monster.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.920
That is monster big, isn't it?

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.465
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:33:14.465 --> 00:33:16.940
The other thing--

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.180
yeah.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:17.890
We should--

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.630
you want to show a continuous
paint on any of this?

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.670
PAUL LEWIS: I don't know.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.670
PAUL IRISH: So it's
hard to say.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.260
So these paints are big.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.190
And so we can go in and
turn on Continuous

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.420
Paint Mode down here.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.840
And I'll just re-dock
my DevTools.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.490
And so what it's going to do
is it's just going to paint

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.170
the page again and
again and again.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:38.900
And up here in the top right
of the page, we'll see how

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.570
long it takes to paint.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.430
And from here, we can just
toggle things on and off.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.750
Or you can use the H key.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.640
So I turned off the
background.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.610
And the paint performance
improves a little bit.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.120
PAUL LEWIS: It's not
noticeably so.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:51.990
PAUL IRISH: Not dramatically.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.245
PAUL LEWIS: So this
is-- so this taps

00:33:53.245 --> 00:33:53.940
into the other thing.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.950
When we were talking about paint
areas before, that's

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.250
like part one.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.220
Part two is paint complexity,
which is what this tool's

00:33:59.220 --> 00:33:59.720
trying to show.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.180
It's like if Chrome starts from
nothing, and it's got to

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.500
paint everything that's on
screen, how long does that

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.980
process take?

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.850
So it's kind of fluctuating,
what?

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.250
Roughly between somewhere
around the eight to

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.389
10 mark, I'd say.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.860
Which means it's not
terribly complex to

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.030
repaint at this point.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.530
PAUL IRISH: It's not that bad.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.600
I mean, it could
be much better.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:22.900
PAUL LEWIS: It could be worse.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.960
But sometimes you'll see huge
spikes in the actual paint

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.865
time from when it's painting
from scratch.

00:34:29.865 --> 00:34:31.690
PAUL IRISH: So I want
to try one thing.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:32.020
Here.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.710
We're going to turn on--

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.770
I like doing Composite Layer
Borders at the same time as

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.020
Paint Recs.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.826
PAUL LEWIS: You've got Show
Paint Rectangles on.

00:34:43.826 --> 00:34:44.620
PAUL IRISH: Do I?

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:44.960
PAUL LEWIS: I think.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.280
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:46.969
We have Show Paint Recs.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:47.610
PAUL LEWIS: But you
haven't got--

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:48.310
PAUL IRISH: Layer borders.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.260
PAUL LEWIS: You need to switch
on the first layer--

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:49.989
PAUL IRISH: Thank you.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:50.469
Thank you.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.580
Thank you.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.139
OK.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.729
Nothing's promoted.

00:34:54.729 --> 00:34:55.750
This is what I was thinking.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.990
I was thinking of promoting
these navs.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.560
Terrible?

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.273
PAUL LEWIS: I don't know.

00:34:59.273 --> 00:34:59.766
PAUL IRISH: I don't know.

00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:00.650
PAUL LEWIS: Let's find out.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:03.440
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.850
This guy.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.666
Yup, yup, yup.

00:35:06.666 --> 00:35:09.240
Webkit transform--

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.320
PAUL LEWIS: So the reason I
would assume you're doing this

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.930
is because it's over the
top of something else.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:13.810
PAUL IRISH: It's opacity.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.650
PAUL LEWIS: And you're concerned
that it's grouping

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:19.522
them together into a single
bitmap in memory.

00:35:19.522 --> 00:35:21.310
And you want to break it
down to its own layer.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.620
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.820
Because in Timeline, we did
see a good amount of

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.180
compositing costs, like
this composite layers.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.410
And I'm guessing that because
these nav items have an

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:37.540
opacity on them, it's having to
do the compositing against

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.300
the background on every
single move.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.640
So I'm guessing that if we drop
them out into layers--

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:42.880
PAUL LEWIS: Yup.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.290
Then it's just-- all it's got to
do is it's got to just let

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:48.680
the GPU deal with that for us.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.860
PAUL IRISH: That seems
pretty nice-ish.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.160
PAUL LEWIS: You want
to profile it?

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.372
PAUL IRISH: I'll profile it.

00:35:54.372 --> 00:35:55.980
PAUL LEWIS: Don't guess it.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.380
PAUL IRISH: Test it.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:58.790
PAUL LEWIS: Perfect.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:02.870
I couldn't have asked for--
you're just the best.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:03.020
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.790
I turned off those
two debug modes.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.730
And I'll turn it back on.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.161
Oh, come on!

00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:09.083
Nailed it!

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.470
Yeah!

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.860
PAUL LEWIS: And that's
how we do it.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.820
PAUL IRISH: That was good.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.020
PAUL LEWIS: This is genuinely
how we do this.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.130
This is why we didn't
look at these too

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.341
closely before we started.

00:36:21.341 --> 00:36:23.470
Hey, do you want to talk about
the transparent frame thing a

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.240
little bit?

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.580
PAUL IRISH: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:26.950
OK.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.830
So I'm going to start.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.080
And then you--

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.900
OK.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.040
If you're in timeline a lot,
you're going to see--

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.530
so these vertical bars, right?

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:42.620
And there's color at the bottom
of them, of course.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.300
But then there's empty space.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.740
There is this little dark
gray area here.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.570
And that represents
uninstrumented code.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.390
So we know that Chrome is doing
work, but we're not

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.900
exactly sure what
kind of work.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.320
We're improving that.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.740
PAUL LEWIS: So gray should
disappear over time.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.420
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.490
But then there's this case where
there's this kind of

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:02.730
this empty area leading
up to the 60 fps line.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:03.880
PAUL LEWIS: Now, we don't
care about those, right?

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.730
PAUL IRISH: It doesn't matter.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.220
That part really is
not a big concern.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.480
You are hitting your
frame budget.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.760
And Chrome's responsibility here
is to deliver a frame on

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.750
the Vsync of the monitor, which
means every time the

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.180
monitor's going to bring a frame
to my eyes, it wants to

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.250
have something ready for it.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.220
PAUL LEWIS: So this
is room to spare,

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.660
basically, what we're seeing.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.210
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.400
PAUL LEWIS: Empty space is like
Chrome saying, I'm done.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.860
I can chill out until the
end of this frame.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.250
But then there's the odd
frame that we're

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.370
seeing here, which is--

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.200
PAUL IRISH: This guy

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.810
PAUL LEWIS: Which is shooting
out of the top.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:36.450
PAUL IRISH: And it is
all empty space.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.530
And so there's two things
to look at here.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.900
One is--

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.550
so you see these gray bars
that are kind of in my

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.320
Timeline view?

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.440
PAUL LEWIS: No, you can switch
those on, right?

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:45.830
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:52.640
So inside Settings, somewhere
down here is showing CPU

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.770
activity on the ruler.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:55.760
And so it's off by default.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.350
You'll have to turn it on.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.900
But here, you'll get an idea
of, is the CPU active?

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.890
If the CPU is active-- maybe
something outside of Chrome is

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.750
doing a lot of work, which is
why Chrome had to slow down--

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.300
so you get an idea on what kind
of work is being done.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.660
PAUL LEWIS: So the thing to do
here is to make sure-- if

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.240
you're going to do these
profiles, and you see

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.470
something like this, and you
want to just rule out other

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.200
apps, do that.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.050
Close them down.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:17.900
Make sure Chrome is the only
thing that's running.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.620
Ideally, if you can really
do it, just go

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.260
into Incognito Mode.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.640
Make sure this is the
only thing that's

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.710
running in the tab.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.455
So it's just as isolated
as it can be.

00:38:25.455 --> 00:38:27.010
PAUL IRISH: Kill all of the
tabs, Incognito, no

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:27.310
extensions.

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:27.970
PAUL LEWIS: It's
the only thing.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:29.165
Yeah, nothing.

00:38:29.165 --> 00:38:30.280
So it's just running
by itself.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.190
So that kind of, as best as you
can, is going to eliminate

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.005
the kind of vying for
the CPU's attention.

00:38:37.005 --> 00:38:40.450
PAUL IRISH: But in this case,
I do not have CPU activity

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.140
exactly there.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.685
I mean, it's right here.

00:38:42.685 --> 00:38:43.935
Right here and right here.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:47.260
So what's--

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.440
can you tell me more about
what's going on here?

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:54.640
PAUL LEWIS: Sometimes it's going
to be Chrome waiting on

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.480
GPU, the simple version
of this.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.240
It's just Chrome saying, I need
the GPU to do its work,

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.290
do some composting for example,
just deal with some

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.430
stuff, finish its workload.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:07.690
And that, at the moment, is
currently showing as empty.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.210
So sometimes it's just
simply-- and again,

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:10.730
it might not be--

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.590
we've only got one GPU normally
in these things.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.380
So it might not be Chrome that's
waiting on the GPU.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.750
But it might be something else
on your system that's actually

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:18.540
using the GPU.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.100
So don't always assume
it's the browser.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.080
But it can be waiting on
CPU and waiting on GPU.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.950
PAUL IRISH: So one use case you
mentioned to me about this

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:28.240
was a lot of times in a WebGL
situation, you might be

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.510
uploading textures to the GPU.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.650
Uploading textures to the GPU
generally can take a good

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:34.980
amount of time--

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.620
PAUL LEWIS: Especially
on on mobile

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:36.440
PAUL IRISH: --especially
on mobile.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.650
So that might be an indication
of something that might be

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.360
happening here.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.210
I should point out that this
is something that DevTools

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:43.960
will get better at.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.690
And we'll be able to help give
you more insight into what

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.870
time is being absorbed
here and why.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:50.710
For now, that's a--

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.490
PAUL LEWIS: I don't think
there's anything as a

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.560
developer that's directly
actionable

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.800
typically here as well.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.520
If you're not dealing with WebGL
or Canvas or something

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.790
that's super GPU heavy, then
the chances are, it's just

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:07.590
something to do with Chrome's
overhead, probably the most

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.733
likely candidate.

00:40:08.733 --> 00:40:09.136
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:40:09.136 --> 00:40:09.540
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.505
PAUL IRISH: I think that's--

00:40:10.505 --> 00:40:11.820
I think we--

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.460
should we finish?

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.650
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah,
let's finish.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:15.160
PAUL IRISH: Thank you very
much for watching.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.160
If you want to dig in more into
these tools and what's

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.080
available, you can just
Google DevTools.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.640
The Chrome DevTools
documentation will come up.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.170
It talks a lot about Timeline,
continuous paint,

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:25.800
and things like that.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.370
We also just posted about a
lot of the new features on

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:32.070
HTML5rocks.com, including-- we
didn't show the flame chart.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.105
PAUL LEWIS: You want to just--

00:40:33.105 --> 00:40:33.940
give us a minute.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.220
We'll show you a flame chart.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:35.810
PAUL IRISH: Flame chart,
flame chart.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:36.880
PAUL LEWIS: He loves
the flame chart.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.396
I-- to be fair, Paul requested
the flame chart.

00:40:40.396 --> 00:40:42.160
It was his feature request.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.500
PAUL IRISH: Come on.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.340
PAUL LEWIS: He loved it.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.115
He's so happy.

00:40:44.115 --> 00:40:44.640
I'm so happy for him.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.720
PAUL IRISH: It is
my feature area.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.470
PAUL LEWIS: It's
just the best.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.880
PAUL IRISH: I'll give a really
good example for the flame

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.673
char too because it's
just worth it.

00:40:53.673 --> 00:40:54.540
PAUL LEWIS: Even
if he says so.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.380
PAUL IRISH: Come over
to your MathJax.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.410
It's a MathML polyfill.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.340
We're going to bring up
DevTools really quick.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.440
And I'm going to start
a CPU profile.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.850
So flame chart is a
visualization of

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.140
a JavaScript profile.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.620
Start, change to SVG rendering,
[STUTTERING]

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.370
go.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.330
Change to HTML rendering, go.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:16.060
SVG, go.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.240
Boom, done.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.690
Command D. OK, awesome.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:20.910
PAUL LEWIS: Now, it won't be
flame chart by default,

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:21.910
though, right?

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:22.170
No.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:22.740
PAUL LEWIS: You have
to switch this on.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.000
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.220
Thank you.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.500
Down at the very bottom
is the toggle.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.760
So it'll be probably
heavy bottom up.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.340
And this is the one
that everyone's

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.370
used to seeing, right?

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.440
PAUL LEWIS: Which to be fair, is
pretty difficult for a lot

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.290
of people to kind understand
and get that.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:36.260
PAUL IRISH: I think so too.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.030
I think so too.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.500
PAUL LEWIS: Which is why you
suggested the flame chart.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:38.840
PAUL IRISH: Hey-o.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.180
Flame chart.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.580
So we've got a flame
chart here.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.000
So the cool thing here is
it's Timeline based.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.220
So we're seeing from the
beginning of my reporting to

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.790
the seven seconds
that I recorded.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.270
And we can see that in the
mini map-- so this is the

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.780
first time that it's
changed to SVG.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.020
And I know because I've looked
at this before, there's a lot

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.580
of interrupted CPU activity.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.910
This is because there's network
activity kind of

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:03.680
interrupting this.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.900
That's something that-- but once
I had it in place, you

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:11.090
can see it's just straight
up stuff going on.

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.360
Let me try and maximize this
a little bit more.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.060
I'm going to have to
zoom out of touch.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.130
There is a lot of stuff
going on here.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.650
And the way to parse
these graphs is

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.340
y-axis is call stack.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.120
Call stack is not a bad thing.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.790
It's not a bad thing that
your call stack

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.550
is necessarily deep.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.680
So height is not terribly
important.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.190
Width is what soaks up time.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.470
PAUL LEWIS: Because this
is time, right?

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:35.100
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.330
Tighter on the--

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:37.170
PAUL LEWIS: The longer
it is, right?

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:40.610
PAUL IRISH: Longer is worse.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:41.712
PAUL LEWIS: Normally.

00:42:41.712 --> 00:42:43.680
PAUL IRISH: [LAUGHS]

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.570
OK.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.870
And so we can kind
of scroll in.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:51.460
I can zoom by just going up
and down on the track pad.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:55.880
I can also page just by
dragging over here.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.430
And we can take a look at kind
of where my time was spent.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.730
And the other nice thing is
that we can understand a

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.050
little bit about the execution
flow of the application by

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:05.500
seeing that things
started off.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.460
We went into Set Mode rendering
in MathJax.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.290
And we did a little bit of
prep work right here.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.690
We moved into this
removeChild.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:12.860
This is doing some SVG work.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.770
This removeChild took six
milliseconds, which is a

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:15.390
pretty long time.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:16.740
PAUL LEWIS: So I'll tell you
what because this is quite

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.756
different when you're looking
at these things and it's not

00:43:18.756 --> 00:43:19.660
your own code.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.630
If you run this against your
own code, you're going to

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:22.450
recognize the functions.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.000
You're going to recognize
the objects.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.980
You'll recognize everything
you see here.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.300
And you're going to be like,
oh wow, I didn't realize it

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.020
was spending so long
doing that

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.370
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.640
So flame chart.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.120
PAUL LEWIS: Awesome.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.350
PAUL IRISH: Good.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.440
Very useful when you identify
that you are spending a lot of

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.030
time in JavaScript
in particular.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.150
It's not appropriate when you
see that you're spending time

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.270
in paint, layout, recalc style,
things like that, but

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:45.030
should help quite a bit.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.360
PAUL LEWIS: Which is
always the case.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.980
Find your actual bottleneck
and fix that one, not the

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.890
thing you think is
the bottleneck.

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:51.270
PAUL IRISH: [SNAPS FINGERS]

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.800
PAUL LEWIS: Should
we close on that?

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.240
PAUL IRISH: Yes.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:52.680
PAUL LEWIS: Boom.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.120
PAUL IRISH: Boom.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.370
PAUL LEWIS: Thank you.
