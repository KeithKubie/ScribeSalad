00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.080
Hey there!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.210
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course
Theater, and today’s episode will take place

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.170
in one location, in one revolution of the
sun, and involve only one plot.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.200
Because we’re in early modern France.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.610
And if there’s one thing the French love,
it’s raw milk cheese, and rules.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.730
[[YORICK DROPS IN WEARING A PROFOUNDLY AHISTORICAL
BERET]] OH, right, and fashion.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.730
Good one, Cue Ball.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.260
Today we’ll be looking at the French embrace
of neoclassicism, the playwrights who rocked

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.189
it, and Le Cid, the play that scandalized
France by following neoclassical rules in

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.500
weird, absurd and possibly immoral ways.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.990
Allons-y!

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.710
INTRO
The Renaissance arrived pretty late in France.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.870
After political upheaval and religious wars,
the country finally settled down in the late

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.400
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries
with the help of the boy kings Louis XIII

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.400
and Louis XIV alongside their ministers, Cardinal
Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.860
All were enthusiastic proponents of the theater.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.860
Yay!

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.040
Still, French playwriting had a slow start.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.890
Editions of Terence appeared late in the fifteenth
century, followed by translations of Greek

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.040
tragedies and Aristotle’s Poetics.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.870
A few playwrights tried out some Latin dialogues,
and a couple of Seneca adaptations began to

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.870
circulate.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.050
Turns out, authors and intellectuals needed
about a century to think about Classical Drama

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.680
before they began writing Neoclassical drama.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.380
And the result of all that thinking?

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.000
That’s right: rules.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.460
The French framework for neo-classical drama
first arose around 1550, when a group of seven

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.820
French authors called Le Pleiade set up some
rules for writing.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.200
Many of their ideas were absorbed by the Academie
Francaise, founded in 1636, which created

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.850
more rules.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.050
Following Le Cid—which we’ll talk about
in a moment—the Academy standardized their

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.510
system, and articulated five main rules for
plays, allegedly based on classical models.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.110
Here are your neoclassical must-haves:
Number One: Verisimilitude.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.870
This means that the action onstage must be
believable.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.320
No gods cruising through to solve everything,
no ghosts, no monsters, or satyrs with enormous

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320
phalli.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.120
And Yorick, I hate to break this to you, but
no soliloquies.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.250
Breaking the fourth wall and talking directly
to the audience?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.090
That is UNBELIEVABLE.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.090
So instead we start getting a lot of friends
and maids as sounding boards.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.150
Plays are still in verse, though and still
depict some pretty outrageous situations.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.040
But they don’t violate spectators’ sense
of what should happen.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.520
Which brings us to NUMBER TWO, Decorum.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.480
From Horace, the Academy takes the idea that
drama has to teach and please.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.390
And not from Horace, that plays should uphold
and promulgate French morals.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.030
Good people have to be rewarded.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.709
Bad people have to be punished.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.410
No defaming people a la Aristophanes.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.410
And no violence.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.410
It’s tacky.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.960
NUMBER THREE: No mixing of dramatic styles.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.099
Comedies are funny.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.099
Tragedies are sad.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.099
That’s that.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.099
No fools for comic relief.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.890
No somber moments in the middle of some celebration.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.190
Shakespeare: I’m looking at you.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.489
Serious plays have to be about serious people,
which basically means: the nobility.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.650
And comedies about unserious middle class
and lower class people falling in love.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.500
Just stay in your lanes, everybody.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.140
NUMBER FOUR: Unities.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.849
The French rulemakers decided that what was
good enough for Aristotle was good enough

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:18.849
for France.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.140
So plays had to embrace the three unities:
Unity of time, unity of place, and unity of

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.140
action.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.629
Plays had to take place in one revolution
of the sun.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.130
In a single location.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.069
And follow only one plot.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.220
To be clear, though, Aristotle only makes
a big deal about unity of action.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.720
He does say in the Poetics that when compared
to the epic, “tragedy tends to fall within

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.300
a single revolution of the sun or slightly
to exceed that,” but he’s just making

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.300
an observation.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.010
And unity of place, he doesn’t mention that
one at all.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.660
The French were out-Aristotling Aristotle!

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.660
But in a country that finally had a strong
centralized monarchy after a long stretch

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.910
of ugly religious wars, it isn’t hard to
imagine why unity was attractive.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.900
And Number FIVE: Five acts.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.250
Each drama had to follow a five-act structure.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.250
Why?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.690
Because that’s how Seneca did it.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.080
And do you know better than Seneca?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.360
Didn’t think so.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.190
In the late 1500s and early 1600s, there were
some popular plays—early attempts at secular

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.900
tragedies and a lot of nymphy, shepherdessy
pastoral comedies—but no truly great works.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.050
Maybe the mystery play and medieval farces
were still strong influences; maybe playwrights

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.219
didn’t have the hang of neoclassicism yet.

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.219
Maybe all those rules make playwriting a little
weird and unwieldy.

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:40.659
But by the middle of seventeenth century,
two men had done it: Jean Racine and Pierre

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:41.659
Corneille.

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:43.449
Also Molière, but we’re going to get to
him next time.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.009
Let’s start with Racine, because he follows
the rules scrupulously and elegantly.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.569
He was born in 1639, orphaned young, and educated
by Jansenists who taught him a lot of Greek

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.569
and Latin.

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.710
Like most classical French playwrights, Racine
wrote in a metrical line called an alexandrine,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.309
a twelve-syllable line of iambic hexameter.

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.889
That’s a dodecasyllabic line if you’re
feeling fancy.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.969
And I mean, this is French theater so you
probably are.

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:10.729
The line has a pause, called a caesura, right
in the middle.

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.969
So a perfect twelve-syllable line is composed
of linked six-syllable thoughts.

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:20.699
As lines of verse go, the alexandrine is just
two syllables longer than Shakespeare’s

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.419
iambic pentameter, but it’s a lot less hurtling.

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.030
It feels… stately.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.430
But, a genius like Racine can harness that
stateliness and turn it into something awesome,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.729
and pure and furious.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.580
Racine’s diction is formal and his vocabulary
much narrower than Shakespeare’s, but this

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.900
gives his plays a feeling of concentration
and force.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.339
Most of Racine’s plays are simple stories
focused on tormented women.

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:55.400
They include long, wrenching speeches where
women explain to their maids just how tortured

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.830
they are.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.889
And not much else happens: they’re about
intensely observed feelings that overwhelm

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:02.889
the characters.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.129
Racine’s characters feel compelled to act
on their feelings even when they know better.

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.759
They can’t escape their emotions or their
fates.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.499
Other playwrights twist themselves into knots
trying to observe the unities, but Racine

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:17.970
makes it look easy.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.330
He sets his plays right before an emotional
crisis and most of his conflicts are internal,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.749
so upholding the unities of time, place and
action isn’t a struggle.

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:35.099
Voltaire called him “indisputably our best
tragic poet, the one who alone spoke to the

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:41.210
heart and to reason, who alone was truly sublime
without being overdone.”

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.310
Man these guys REALLY knew how to compliment
one another.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.729
Racine’s most famous play is the five-act
tragedy Phèdre, from 1677, based on the Greek

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.029
myth of, well, Phaedra.

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.139
Phaedra is married to the great hero Theseus.

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:01.059
But while Theseus is away, she develops an
overpowering passion for her stepson, Hippolytus.

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:06.289
She would rather die than act on it, but when
she gets word that Theseus is dead, she confesses

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:07.490
her love.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.900
Hippolytus is freaked out, because duh, but
also in love with another woman.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.520
So he rejects her.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.719
Phaedra wants to die.

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:21.069
She wants to die even more when it turns out
Theseus is alive and almost home.

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:24.550
Trying to save Phaedra’s life, her maid
makes up a story that Hippolytus tried to

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.219
rape Phaedra.

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:29.990
Theseus banishes Hippolytus and curses him.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.330
He dies, offstage, with some help from a sea
monster.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.119
Phaedra’s maid kills herself.

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:39.349
Phaedra confesses everything and then kills
herself.

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:41.800
Theseus adopts the woman that Hippolytus loved.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.009
So maybe that seems like a lot–because it
is–but in Racine’s hands, the compressed

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:50.159
action works, and actually doesn’t seem
ridiculous.

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:53.809
The unities of time and place feel like natural
choices.

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:58.879
Racine has an incredible gift for entering
into extreme psychological states.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:04.199
And Phaedra’s long speeches about her passion,
horror and self-disgust are breathtaking.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:08.330
But when Phèdre first premiered, it wasn’t
a success.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.939
Probably because audiences were so hyped up
about Racine’s rival Corneille.

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:16.719
Born in 1606, he trained as a lawyer before
moving on to playwriting.

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:21.099
Corneille had his first successes with comedies
before moving into tragedies.

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:25.830
While he was aware of the neoclassical rules,
Corneille never adhered to them as carefully,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.839
or as elegantly, as Racine did.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.509
And sometimes that got him into trouble.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.960
Corneille’s most famous play is the 1636
tragicomedy Le Cid.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.210
Remember how Racine is sublime but not overdone?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.210
Well, Corneille has overdone on lock.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.260
Le Cid is based on the youthful adventures
of a medieval Spanish military figure, and

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.460
hoooo boy did it cause some controversy.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.250
Before it pops off, let’s take a look at
the action in the Thoughtbubble:

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.350
Chimene, a noblewoman in medieval Seville,
likes Rodrigue.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.220
Rodrigue likes Chimene.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:03.210
Unfortunately, their fathers quarrel: one
slaps the other, and Rodrigue is forced to

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.640
duel Chimene’s father.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.700
Rodrigue kills him.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.700
WHOOPS.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.870
Chimene is understandably upset.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.290
Oh, and also: the Moorish navy is about to
attack.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.000
There’s a lot going on.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.230
Crushed, Rodrigue goes to Chimene’s house
and tells Chimene’s maid, Elvire, that he

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.410
wants Chimene to kill him.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.750
Elvire tells him to chill out, and he hides
while Chimene confesses that she both loves

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.200
and hates him.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.090
Her plan: Kill him and then kill herself.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.430
French neoclassical drama is real big on suicide.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.180
Rodrigue reveals himself and is like, great
plan, here’s my sword.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.040
But Chimene can’t do it, and Rodrigue has
to leave to go defeat the Moors.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040
Which he does.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.040
Offstage.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040
Very quickly.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.080
Even the Moors are impressed, naming him Le
Cid, or the Lord.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.230
But Chimene’s like—hey, great, way to
save Spain, but hello?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.810
We both still have to kill ourselves?

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.770
The other nobles are like, nuh-uh, and they
set up another duel—have they learned nothing!—and

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.210
force Chimene to agree to marry the winner.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.860
Rodrigue tells her he’s not even going to
try to win.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.101
But Chimene’s like, I know I keep saying
you have to die, but I really don’t want

00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:16.150
to marry the other guy, so make it happen
my dude.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:21.220
The other guy comes back all bloody, and Chimene
believes that Rodrigue is dead.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.520
She tries to become a nun, but it turns out
that he’s alive!

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.830
And now she can marry the man who killed her
dad!

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.800
After he kills some more Moors.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.050
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:36.970
So all of that supposedly happens in twenty-four
hours!

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.870
That is one busy day.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.290
Right away we can see how Corneille is different
from Racine.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:47.490
Corneille focuses on men with free will; Racine
is interested in women doomed by fate.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.050
Racine likes simple plots and complex characters,
and Corneille is the other way around.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:11:01.090
Le Cid was an immediate success and an immediate
scandal, launching a thousand angry pamphlets—the

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.490
seventeenth-century equivalent of a tweetstorm.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.920
“This play betrays the unities!!!!”, the
cranky pamphlets said.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.090
The battle is too short, they griped.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.790
There are multiple locations in Seville, they
groused.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.980
It’s mostly about Rodrigue and Chimene,
but other action happens!

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.410
It ends happily!

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.620
A woman can’t marry the man who killed her
dad!

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.570
French intellectuals were in a pamphleteering
uproar.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:30.190
So Cardinal Richelieu turned to the newly
created Academie Francaise and asked them

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.190
for a verdict.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:36.250
The Academy said look, we know people really
like this play, but it violates pretty much

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.620
all of our rules.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.190
It’s implausible, it’s immoral, it takes
a bunch of shortcuts with the unities.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:48.870
But Corneille was like, also look: I’ve
created awesome, virtuous characters and I

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:56.450
made the audience feel pity and fear just
like Aristotle wanted, so back off, Academy.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.180
Mic drop.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.930
But then he stopped writing plays for four
years, and, when he returned, he followed

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.250
the rules pretty closely.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.160
So I guess… mic pick back up.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.540
Neoclassicism in France held sway for more
than a century, and its austere style helped

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.380
make France the dominant European cultural
center of the day.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.350
Neoclassicism is persnickety, and it’s hard
to adhere to.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.870
But when it’s done well, the plays are incredibly
forceful.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.980
And if all you’re reading from this period
are the plays of Racine and Corneille, you’d

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.200
be forgiven for thinking the French Renaissance
had no sense of humor.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.870
But, ah ha mon cher, you’d be mistaken as
well..

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:46.350
Next time: jokes, but French.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:13:14.060
Until then… curtain.
