00:00:00.647 --> 00:00:02.658
- [Voiceover] So I have
the function F of X here

00:00:02.658 --> 00:00:05.872
and we're defining it using
a polynomial expression.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.479
And what I would like to do here is

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:09.493
take the derivative of our function

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:10.910
which is essentially gonna make us take

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.964
the derivative of this
polynomial expression

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:14.323
and we're gonna take the derivative

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:16.017
with respect to X.

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:17.429
So the first thing I'm gonna do is

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.910
let's take the derivative of both sides.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.846
So we can say the
derivative with respect to X

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:23.679
of F of X

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:25.664
of F of X

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.025
is equal to the derivative

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:30.577
with respect to X

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:32.908
the derivative with respect to X

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:34.325
of X to the fifth

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:37.576
X to the fifth

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:38.409
plus two

00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.478
plus two X to the third

00:00:43.678 --> 00:00:45.011
minus X squared.

00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:49.511
And so the notation, just
to get familiar with it

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:51.323
you could do this as
the derivative operator.

00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:52.698
This is, I want to take the derivative

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:54.928
of whatever's inside of the parentheses

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:56.956
with respect to X.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.342
So the derivative of F with respect to X

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:00.614
we could use the notation

00:01:00.614 --> 00:01:02.864
but that is just F prime of

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:05.562
F prime of X.

00:01:05.562 --> 00:01:08.719
And that is going to be equal to.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.318
Now here we can use our
derivative properties.

00:01:11.318 --> 00:01:13.123
The derivative of the sum or difference

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:14.224
of a bunch of things.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.911
The derivative of is equal to the sum

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.246
of the difference of the
derivative of each of them.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.290
So this is equal to the derivative

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.960
let me just, with the
derivative with respect to X

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.593
of each of these three things.

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:28.991
So the derivative with respect to X.

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:31.135
Let me just write it out like this.

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:32.821
Of that first term

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.228
plus the derivative with respect to X

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:38.012
of that second term

00:01:38.012 --> 00:01:41.716
minus the derivative with respect to X

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.785
of that third term.

00:01:43.785 --> 00:01:45.471
Of that third term.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.352
And I'll color code it here.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:49.135
So here I had an X of the fifth

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:50.364
so I'll put the X to fifth

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:51.921
X of the fifth there.

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:54.588
Here I had a two X to the third.

00:01:57.056 --> 00:02:00.386
So I'll put the two X to the third there.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.013
And here I have a X squared

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:04.147
I'm subtracting an X squared

00:02:04.147 --> 00:02:06.792
so I'm subtracting the
derivative with respect to X

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.068
of X squared.

00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:10.162
So notice all that's happening here is

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:12.298
I'm taking the derivative individually of

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.792
each of these terms and then I'm adding

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:15.396
or subtracting in the
same way that the terms

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:18.297
were added or subtracted.

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:20.625
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.658
Well, this is going to be equal to

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:23.787
for X of the fifth

00:02:23.787 --> 00:02:26.015
we can just use the power rule.

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:28.265
We can bring the five out front

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.743
and decrement the exponent by one

00:02:30.743 --> 00:02:32.410
so it becomes five X

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:36.678
we can say to the five minus one power.

00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:39.579
Which of course, is just four.

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.958
And then for this second one

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.007
we could do it in a few steps.

00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:45.991
Actually, let me just write it out here.

00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:47.666
So I could write

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.459
I could write the derivative

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.178
with respect to X

00:02:51.178 --> 00:02:54.196
of two X to the third power

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.047
is the same thing

00:02:56.047 --> 00:02:57.595
it's equal to

00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:59.498
the same, we could bring the constant out.

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:01.824
The derivative with,
two times the derivative

00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:02.946
with respect to X

00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:04.893
of X to the third power.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.093
This is one of our

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:07.660
this is one of our derivative properties.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.062
The derivative of a constant

00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:10.313
times some expression

00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:12.053
is the same thing as a constant

00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:14.561
times the derivative of that expression.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.053
And what will the
derivative with respect to X

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:18.798
to the third be?

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.946
Well, we would bring the three out front

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:22.736
and decrement the exponent.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.997
And so this would be equal to

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:26.282
this two

00:03:26.282 --> 00:03:27.532
times the three

00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.044
times X to the three minus one power.

00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:37.038
Which is, of course, the second power.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:40.795
So this would give us six X squared.

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:42.453
So, another way that
you could have done it

00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:43.866
I could just write

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.048
I could just write a six X squared here.

00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:48.538
So I could just, so this is going to be

00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:49.705
six X squared.

00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:53.098
And, instead of going through all of this

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:54.715
you'll learn as you do more of these,

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:56.717
that you could have done this pretty much

00:03:56.717 --> 00:03:58.148
in your head.

00:03:58.148 --> 00:04:00.749
Say look, I have the three
out here as an exponent.

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.483
Let me multiply the three
times this coefficient

00:04:03.483 --> 00:04:05.324
because that's what we
ended up doing anyway.

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:08.691
Three times the coefficient is six X

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:12.092
and then three minus one is two.

00:04:12.092 --> 00:04:13.650
So you didn't necessarily have to do this

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.722
but it's nice to see
that this comes out of

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.298
the derivative properties
that we talk about

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.688
in other videos.

00:04:18.688 --> 00:04:20.644
And then finally,

00:04:20.644 --> 00:04:22.185
we have minus.

00:04:22.185 --> 00:04:23.352
And we use the

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.370
power rule right over here.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.909
So, bring the two out front

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.221
and decrement the exponent.

00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:30.936
So it's gonna be two.

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:32.269
It's going to be

00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:34.270
two times X

00:04:35.857 --> 00:04:37.463
to the two minus one power

00:04:37.463 --> 00:04:38.963
which is just one.

00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:43.292
Which, we could just write as two X.

00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:44.840
So just like that we have been able

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.956
to figure out the derivative of F.

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:50.009
And you might say, well
what this thing now?

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.870
Well now we have an
expression that tells us

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.810
the slope of the tangent line.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.204
Or you could view it as the instantaneous

00:04:55.204 --> 00:04:57.322
rate of change with respect to X

00:04:57.322 --> 00:04:58.655
for any X value.

00:04:59.954 --> 00:05:02.426
So, if I were to say

00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:04.268
if I were to now to say

00:05:04.268 --> 00:05:07.101
F prime, let's say F prime of two.

00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:10.788
This would tell me what is

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:13.330
the slope of the tangent
line of our function

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.940
when X is equal to two.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.339
And I do that by using this expression.

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:19.365
So this is gonna be

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:21.698
five times two to the fourth

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:23.662
plus plus

00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:27.740
six times two squared.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.533
Six times two squared.

00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:32.438
Minus minus

00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:35.690
two times two.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.357
Minus two times two.

00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:41.290
And this is going to be equal to

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.060
let's see, two to the fourth power is 16,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.727
16 times five is 80.

00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:49.591
And that's 80, and then

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.236
this is six times four,

00:05:52.236 --> 00:05:53.236
which is 24.

00:05:54.402 --> 00:05:58.290
And then we are going to subtract four.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.623
So this is 80 plus 24 is 104

00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:04.171
minus four is equal to 100.

00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:07.858
So, when X is equal to two

00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:11.602
this curve is really steep.

00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:13.583
The slope is 100.

00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:15.154
If you look, if you were to graph

00:06:15.154 --> 00:06:18.024
the tangent line when X is equal to two

00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:22.270
for every positive
movement in the X-direction

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.966
by one you're gonna move
up in the Y-direction

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:25.875
by 100.

00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:27.674
So it's really steep
there and it makes sense.

00:06:27.674 --> 00:06:29.251
This is a pretty high degree.

00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:31.236
X to the fifth power and
then we're adding that

00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:32.422
to another high degree

00:06:32.422 --> 00:06:33.558
X to the third power.

00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:35.523
And then we're subtracting a lower degree.

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:37.870
So that's what you would expect.
