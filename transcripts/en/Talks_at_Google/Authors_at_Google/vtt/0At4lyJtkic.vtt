00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.300
NATALIE NUÑEZ: I
am Natalie Nuñez.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.815
On behalf of Talks at
Google, HOLA, Bay Area

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:14.190
Chapter, and the Hispanic
Heritage Month, we welcome you.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.500
And thank you so much for
being here, as well everyone

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.837
in the audience.

00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.545
We're very honored to
have a phenomenal--

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:19.860
ISABEL ALLENDE: Thank you.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.200
NATALIE NUÑEZ: --brilliant.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.502
ISABEL ALLENDE: I am honored.

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:22.710
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Aw, thank you.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.450
And give Isabel a
round of applause.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.604
It's very exciting
to have you today.

00:00:26.604 --> 00:00:29.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.230
So for other people
in the audience,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.550
and those who are live-streaming
in, a little bit about you,

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.050
Isabel.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.910
You've written 23
books, and it's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.105
been translated
into 35 languages.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.480
Your words have
literally reached

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.300
across all ends of
the earth, and have

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.331
been adapted into movies,
and ballets, and plays.

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.330
And we're just very excited
to see what more you

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.440
have in store for us.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.560
You've received the
highest civilian honor,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.040
the Medal of Freedom, by
former President Barack Obama.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.242
You actually carried the
torch in the Olympics--

00:00:58.242 --> 00:00:59.200
in the Winter Olympics.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.580
ISABEL ALLENDE:
That was a fluke.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.910
[CHUCKLING]

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.970
I have never done any
sports in my life--

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.480
nothing.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.240
I can't even walk.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.800
And I had to carry the
flag in the Olympics.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.734
Go figure.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:15.150
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Well, we were
happy to have you represent--

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.780
ISABEL ALLENDE: Thank you.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.280
NATALIE NUÑEZ: --Latin America,
and women all over the world

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.300
in that.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.880
You've received a lot of
awards and honorary doctorates

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.090
from universities, a very,
very successful woman.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.780
ISABEL ALLENDE: For someone who
hardly finished high school,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.569
all those honorary
degrees seem very ironic.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:34.360
[NATALIE CHUCKLING]

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.755
Yeah.

00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:36.670
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So it's to say
that we shouldn't have gone

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.295
to high school.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:39.236
[CHUCKLING]

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:42.390
But no, we're absolutely
thrilled about all the works

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.280
that you've given
us to the world.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.540
And you continue to give back.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.980
You give yourself back with
the Isabel Allende Foundation,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.030
that empowers women and
girls all throughout Chile

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.080
and California.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.560
And we're amazed by the
words that you have for us,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.557
and the actions that
you continually give.

00:01:57.557 --> 00:01:58.640
ISABEL ALLENDE: Thank you.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.410
Thank you.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.680
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So I think
I would like to start from

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.950
the beginning, from how you
became the person you became.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.080
Someone born-- a
girl born in Peru,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.500
a Chilean girl born in
Peru, and came here,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.554
and had stories of love, and
mystery, and coincidences.

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:16.220
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.390
ISABEL ALLENDE: Well,
I wasn't planning

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.430
to be a writer, really.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.170
I was born in the middle
of the second World War,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.210
in a very conservative Catholic
patriarchal environment.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.790
And I was supposed to be
somebody's wife and somebody's

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.620
mother.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.890
It didn't work out for me.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.050
I didn't have the raw
material for that job.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.480
No, not at all.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.280
So I was very rebellious
even when I was very young.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.600
I sort of realized that being a
woman was not to my advantage.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.950
Because I saw my mom--

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.190
I saw that my mama, in the
household where we lived--

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.830
we lived with my
grandfather and my uncles.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.590
The males had all the
privileges, and my mother,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.127
who was the only woman, didn't.

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:01.710
And she didn't have
any money, and she

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.330
didn't have any independence.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.100
I didn't want to be like her.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.070
So I think I became a
feminist around age 5,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.640
before the word was
invented in Chile.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.680
And then I became a
journalist in Chile--

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.120
worked as a journalist.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.940
I did everything except radio.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.340
I did television, newspapers,
magazines, you name it.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.560
And then we had a military
coup in Chile in 1973.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.560
And very soon, I had to
get out of my country.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.200
And I went as a
political refugee

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.740
to Venezuela, where I could
not find a job as a journalist.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.270
So I worked in all kinds of
odd jobs to make a living

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.520
and support my kids--

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.150
two kids, and at least one dog.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.860
And then by 1981, I was
working administering a school

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.260
in Caracas.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.640
That was not the job for me.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.960
I can't even add or subtract.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.260
And I had to deal with
checkbooks, and with money.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.450
And it was just
a total disaster.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.090
But they kept me
for like four years.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.820
And during that
time, in 1981, I got

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.440
a phone call that my
grandfather, whom I adored,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.220
was dying.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.730
And I could not return to my
country to bid him farewell.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.530
So I started a letter, which
was like a spiritual letter.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.600
I would write to him often.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.330
But this was a different
letter, because I wasn't sure

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.880
if he was going to
be able to read it.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.420
And I wanted to tell him that
all the stories that he had

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.420
told me-- and he was a
wonderful storyteller--

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.650
I remembered them.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.180
I had them all with me.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.200
It was my-- they represented
my background, my roots,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.300
my family, everything
that I had left behind.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.260
And I think that, in a way,
as a political refugee,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.080
I felt an overwhelming
nostalgia.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.020
You sort of idealized that
country that you left.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.770
There's a reason why
you left, because you

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.603
couldn't live there.

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:07.910
But still, one idealizes it.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.460
And the idea is to try
to go back all the time.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.890
So the letter for my grandfather
was about the stories

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.980
that he told me.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.240
And the first story was
the story of my Aunt Rosa.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.970
My Great Aunt Rosa was my
grandfather's first fiancee,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.270
and she died in
mysterious circumstances

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.310
before they could get married.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.960
So eight years later, he
married the youngest daughter

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.780
in the same family,
with the idea

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.790
that if he had
been accepted once,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.340
he would be accepted
the second time, too.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.860
So that's why he married
my grandmother, who

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.050
nobody wanted to marry,
because she was so weird.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.210
She was adorable,
but totally weird.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.840
She lived in another world.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.050
She was always experimenting
with the paranormal.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.520
So my first few years were with
this wonderful grandmother.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.310
And there was a table--

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.610
a very heavy Spanish
table where my grandmother

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.800
would have the seances.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.740
And she would call the
spirits with her table.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.980
And they say that the
table would jump twice

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.770
for yes, one for no.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.730
I have the table in my house.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.950
I've tried everything.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.240
[CHUCKLING]

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.610
You need two men
to move the table.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.960
So I don't know how she did it.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.630
But there must have
been some trick there.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.380
So with that background,
with that family,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.480
I think that it was
only natural that I

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.930
would have to write about it,
about that grandmother, who

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.380
is Clara del Valle in "The
House of the Spirits,"

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.686
my first novel.

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:48.030
So the idea was to tell
my grandfather that I

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.530
remembered what he had told me.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.860
And the first
story in the letter

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.190
was the story of
my Great Aunt Rosa.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.870
And then I kept on writing--

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.820
he died-- and I couldn't stop.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.980
And it was the
memories of the family,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.580
things that I invented,
that I made up,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.650
and the history of my
country for 70 years.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.370
So it was a micro-world of
the family that reflected

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.622
the macro-world of the country.

00:07:13.622 --> 00:07:15.330
And so that's "The
House of the Spirits."

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.070
Of course, I didn't
plan it that way.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.450
It just happened.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.850
Later-- this book was
written 35 years ago.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.740
And now that the book has
been studied and whatever,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.330
people tell me all this.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.765
Because I didn't plan it.

00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:31.500
So if you ask me what
the book is about,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.660
I'm telling you what
the reviewers have said,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.504
not what I had in mind.

00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:37.920
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So knowing now
the reach that that book has

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.570
had, would you have done
anything differently?

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.255
Would you have--

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.630
ISABEL ALLENDE:
Well, you know, I

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.260
was-- we were talking in the
car that I never read my books.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.410
Because there's so much
that you can correct.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.376
You can correct forever.

00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:55.900
Also, what was OK at the time
is totally politically incorrect

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.910
today.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.950
There are certain terms
and certain things

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.220
that you can't say
today, not even in Chile.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.600
In Chile, we have
very little idea

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.910
of what politically correct is.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.930
In Venezuela, even less.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.710
But still, there
are things that you

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.165
don't say anymore
in this century

00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:13.700
that we are living today.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.890
Too bad, because they were
very colorful, actually.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:22.050
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Do you think
that the Spanish language has

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.005
morphed the way that you
think, in terms of femininity

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.580
and masculinity?

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.730
And as that's being translated
to these other books,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.929
is there anything that's
lost in translation?

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.000
ISABEL ALLENDE:
Well, as we all know,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.780
in the Spanish language
you cannot change--

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.590
every adjective has
gender because it

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.680
applies to a noun
that has gender, which

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.820
doesn't happen in English.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.590
So for example, I
have a granddaughter

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.560
who is into the LGBT, et
cetera, and she has asked

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.380
me to change the pronouns.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.900
In English, being the
second language for me,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.110
it's pretty hard.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.960
But to translate
that into Spanish

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.630
is almost impossible,
because every adjective

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.405
would have gender.

00:09:08.405 --> 00:09:12.600
And so I can't handle
it in Spanish that well.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.670
In that sense, it's a
very different language.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.590
The other thing
with Spanish, also,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.030
is that it is a less flexible
language than English.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.850
In English, everything
can be turned into a verb.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.360
You can add other words.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.500
You can put words together
in wonderful ways.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.420
Spanish is very strict.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.410
So you have to stick to
grammar and spelling of course.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.930
NATALIE NUÑEZ: And you've been
called "the most widely-read

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.360
Spanish language author."

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.620
And you have García
Márquez, and Jose,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.910
and so many other
amazing authors.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.422
Now that you see your
name among those,

00:09:52.422 --> 00:09:53.880
does it change the
way you approach

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.124
new books and new stories?

00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:56.790
ISABEL ALLENDE: No
it doesn't, because I

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:02.250
try to write from the womb,
not from the brain so much.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.740
And I try to write
the best I can.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.550
Whatever the critics say,
or how many books are sold,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.700
or if they are compared to
somebody else's writing,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.820
I can't worry about that.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:21.400
And I don't even read the
reviews, because I get either--

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.490
I would say I get influenced.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.380
I don't get upset,
because I understand

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.780
that if you do
anything in public,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.880
people will criticize you.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.540
Some people will like you,
and some people will not.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.020
And I have to be ready for that.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:42.535
So I don't get all upset
because something is bad,

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:45.430
and I don't celebrate too
much when something is good,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.840
because everything passes.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.100
It doesn't matter.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.977
In the long run,
nothing matters.

00:10:50.977 --> 00:10:52.810
NATALIE NUÑEZ: And out
of all these authors,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.910
like José Donoso
and García Márquez,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.640
was there any on
author that influenced,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.900
and that you looked up to?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.220
ISABEL ALLENDE: I
was in my late teens,

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.740
early 20s when I started reading
the big names of the boom

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.510
of Latin American literature--
at least 25, all male,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.630
many of them with
mustache, males--

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.730
who wrote these fantastic books.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.700
There were different books in
different countries of Latin

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:25.580
America, but all of them
formed a sort of harmonic choir

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.240
that, in a way, told the world
what Latin America was about,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.340
and told us who we
were as a whole.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.889
So I grew up reading them.

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:38.680
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Yes.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.040
And did you ever
know-- you know them

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.200
being male authors, was
there anything about you

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.350
that you wanted to share
differently that would impact

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.145
Latina literature?

00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:49.520
ISABEL ALLENDE:
I didn't plan it.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.100
I didn't think that way.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.840
I just wrote what I knew.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.300
And I had been working
for women, and with women,

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.500
and being a woman all my life.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.210
So it was only natural that
my protagonists would tend

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.360
to be more female than male.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.570
So when my book, "The House
of the Spirits" was published,

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.370
they said that I was the only
female voice in the boom.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.270
And then they rapidly said, no,
she doesn't belong to the boom.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.760
She's post-boom.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.640
They didn't want a female
in the boom, of course.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.660
So I'm post-boom,
whatever post-boom means.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.310
And I never compared my
writing to what they wrote.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.070
Other people did, but I don't.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.809
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Your writing was
definitely influential to many

00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:37.100
other authors after this post--

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.630
ISABEL ALLENDE: What they say
is that, because my book was

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:46.720
so successful, even from the
start, publishers all over--

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.400
not only in Spain,
but all over--

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.470
realized that there is a
feminine readership that

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.380
wants to read female voices.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.370
So there was a market
for female authors

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.200
that before they had
not maybe noticed.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.400
And so in a way, that book
opened the door for other women

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.730
to be published.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.431
And I feel very proud of that.

00:13:13.431 --> 00:13:14.680
NATALIE NUÑEZ: It's wonderful.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.800
And within these books,
you have powerful women.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.679
Are these women portrayed from
real, live people in your life?

00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:24.470
ISABEL ALLENDE: Do you
know any weak women?

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.415
[NATALIE CHUCKLING]

00:13:25.415 --> 00:13:26.140
NATALIE NUÑEZ: I do not.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.040
ISABEL ALLENDE:
Yeah, you do not.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.539
OK, good.

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:29.244
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.060
No, I just pick up people
in the street, and people--

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.080
women that I know through the
foundation, extraordinary women

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.190
who are survivors of sometimes
the most horrible trauma.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.440
And they not only survive,
they become leaders

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.850
in their communities.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:52.480
So that kind of person, woman
or man, is always fascinating.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.090
And I'm always attracted
to those people

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:02.110
who stand outside the big
umbrella of the establishment--

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:07.870
immigrants, refugees,
people who have other gender

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.140
choices, people who come
from different races,

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.180
from different ages.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.330
I've been writing a lot
about very old people.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.370
And some readers
say, why do you write

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.050
about these people
who don't even read

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.270
because they can't even read?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.930
No, I am interested
always in what

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.870
is outside, not the mainstream.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.120
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So including
these diverse characters--

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.203
ISABEL ALLENDE: Of course.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.220
NATALIE NUÑEZ: --there
is a part of magic to it.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.440
Magic is not normal.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.990
You don't see that every day.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.490
And--

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.640
ISABEL ALLENDE: Well, let's--

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.486
what's magic to you?

00:14:41.486 --> 00:14:42.610
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Magic to me?

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.580
Or I guess the way I was I
was phrasing it is, you know,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.510
the fire, and the poof, and
the, you know, out there.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.570
But the magic that you see, and
that I read in your books is

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.090
natural, is in the real world.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.590
ISABEL ALLENDE:
What I understand

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.630
is that we know nothing.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.030
Maybe you here in
Google, you know more.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.320
But normal people
know very little,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.600
and normal people have
very little control

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.170
over their lives.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.130
And everything that stands
outside that control,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.310
that explanation of
life, is mysterious.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.720
And in some cultures, like
America and many places

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.210
in Europe, what
you cannot explain,

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.880
what you cannot control,
and what you cannot sell,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.890
you ignore.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.590
It's not in the
realm of reality.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.630
However, in most of the world--

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.090
and I would say all of Latin
America, all of Africa,

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.770
all of Asia--

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.327
we understand that there
are dimensions of reality

00:15:41.327 --> 00:15:43.410
that we don't control, and
we don't understand it,

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.880
but we accept them.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.700
For example, in
everybody's lives,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.200
there are coincidences, those
moments in which you think,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.890
I have been here before.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.170
And you-- I know this place.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.090
And you know that you
have never been there,

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.850
but somehow it's familiar.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.890
Or a person that
you meet, and you

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.770
have the idea that you've
met that person before,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.610
or I am thinking of someone,
and the phone rings,

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.140
and it's that person--

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.580
or dreams.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.590
That kind of thing that
happens in everybody's life,

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.730
you all ignore it,
because you don't need it.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.920
But in my life, in my country,
my culture, you use it.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.390
You use it in everyday life.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.280
It becomes part of--

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.260
it's integrated to life.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.890
For example, my mom
died two weeks ago.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:37.980
And she was wonderful, and we
had a very close relationship.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.190
And she would write to
me every single day,

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.340
and I wrote to her every
day for 40 years or more.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.490
So I have 40 years
of letters in boxes.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.560
And every box has between
600 and 800 letters.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.840
So multiplied by 40--

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.270
I can't multiply, but
you can Google it--

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.160
it's a lot.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.800
And now that she's
gone, I thought, well,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.869
why can't I write to her?

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.690
Maybe she cannot write to me any
more, but I can write to her.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.670
Why not?

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.920
And so then I've
started writing to her,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.319
and establishing
a connection that

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.670
is perfectly natural to me.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.869
And I know that if I
write about it in a novel,

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:25.410
it would be either
crazy, or magic realism.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.099
It's just life.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.820
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So do you like
when people say that your work

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.070
is part of magic realism?

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.680
ISABEL ALLENDE: I think that
my work is very realistic.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.590
It just accepts
what is mysterious,

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.540
but it's very realistic.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.290
You know, García Márquez,
the master of magic realism,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.470
explains it very wonderfully.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.510
He says that in his book, "One
Hundred Years of Solitude,"

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.780
he has Remedios,
[INAUDIBLE] who rises

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.580
to heaven in body and soul.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.880
The original story is
that in the village where

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.360
he lived, in the town where
he lived, a girl got pregnant,

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.960
and the family made her
disappear, sent her away.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.210
And the explanation
the family gave was she

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.610
rose to heaven in soul and
body, like the Virgin Mary.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.350
And nobody asked more
questions, because everybody

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.040
understood that no
questions were accepted.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.790
But when he wrote that in
the book, it didn't work.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.480
And he said he wrote it several
times, and it never worked--

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.605
until he had her hanging
the sheets to dry,

00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:42.120
and the wind came and
lifted her with the sheets.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.940
And then there is
sort of explanation.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.970
It's a parachute
that elevated her.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.730
With the sheets,
it's magic realism.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.572
Without the sheets, it's
fantasy, like Harry Potter.

00:18:54.572 --> 00:18:55.790
Isn't it interesting?

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.420
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Yes,
it is interesting.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.378
And it's interesting to
hear that magic realism

00:18:59.378 --> 00:19:03.150
within the Latino literature
is almost easier to understand

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.484
because we have spirits,
and we believe in--

00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:08.400
ISABEL ALLENDE: But we
have spirits here, too.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.860
I mean, all my
friends see psychics.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.650
They hang crystals here.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.610
They see the horoscope.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.770
Everybody has a sign.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.060
I mean, a zodiac
sign or whatever.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.370
So what's the difference?

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.427
It has a different name.

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:22.010
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.630
And do you speak
to them about that?

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.970
Do you connect those spirits
into the Latino community?

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.520
Meaning, for those that go
to psychics, and they speak--

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.450
ISABEL ALLENDE: Well,
we go to psychics, too.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.741
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Oh, that's true.

00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:38.400
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.670
Is there a way that
you use this to impact

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.620
Latino literature-- or
not Latino literature,

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.610
but literature globally?

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.360
Like this idea of, everybody
believes in the same things.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.065
Let me show you.

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.273
ISABEL ALLENDE: There are
wonderful literary devices.

00:19:52.273 --> 00:19:57.000
When you can't solve something,
you introduce a psychic.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.990
And it's wonderful.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.850
The only time that
didn't work for me,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.990
I was writing a crime novel.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.790
And in a crime novel,
everything needs to fit.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.895
So I couldn't introduce the
astronomer or the psychic,

00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:10.662
unfortunately--

00:20:10.662 --> 00:20:13.080
astrologer.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.170
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So I'm curious,
because you've had a lot

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.530
of impact in not just Latino
literature-- global literature,

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.860
in representing the Latino
culture and Chilean culture

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.130
and history.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.640
How do you see that
this is impacting others

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.260
in seeing Chilean history
in the books, and those--

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.580
ISABEL ALLENDE: I don't
know how it impacts others,

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.600
but I hope it does.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.220
Because I try to--

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.060
I have written several
historical novels.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.880
And well, when
you write fiction,

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.270
you have more freedom of
course, and that's wonderful.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:51.170
But I try to present
an historical event

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.560
from the perspective--

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.050
from another eye, not the
perspective of the winners.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.250
For example, I
have a novel called

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.060
"Island Beneath the Sea,"
and it is about the slave

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.190
revolt in Haiti.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.380
And of course all
the history books

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.050
were written by white men--

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.355
French, or American, whatever.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:14.480
NATALIE NUÑEZ: The winners.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.250
ISABEL ALLENDE: The
winners, always.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:21.020
We never have the perspective
of the poor people, the slaves,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.030
the people of
color, the children,

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:27.200
the people who really
experienced the event.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.310
So that's where I try to stand
as a writer and as an observer.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:37.780
When I research for a historical
novel, I go to, if possible,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.560
private documents.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.270
Because if I read
the history books,

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.270
that's the official history.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.510
And I want the other
history, what people

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.420
were saying in their letters.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.300
I have a novel
about the Gold Rush.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.100
We all know the Gold
Rush, because we've

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.190
read about it here,
written by the '49ers,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.610
or the people who
followed the '49ers.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.310
But long before the '49ers
arrived, people of color

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.120
were here.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.550
Native Americans,
Mexicans, Peruvians,

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.890
Chileans, we were all
in the mines before.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.420
And those voices have
been obliterated.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.780
They don't exist.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.470
And the women who came,
also, they don't exist.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:21.980
So for that book, I went
to the library in Chile

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.390
to research letters the Chilean
miners wrote to their families

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.720
in Chile in 1850.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.970
So I got a perspective
from another angle

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.709
that we never here
in the United States.

00:22:36.709 --> 00:22:38.750
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Yeah, that's
interesting to hear--

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.844
letters, the stories--

00:22:39.844 --> 00:22:41.010
ISABEL ALLENDE: The stories.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.190
A person-- in a letter,
for example, someone

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:49.310
can explain that a
bottle of champagne

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.390
was cheaper than
a glass of milk.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.470
You never see that
in a history book.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.280
And the reason is that there
was no one to milk the cows.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.400
They were all looking for gold.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.000
And champagne came
in ships from France.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.115
So that was available.

00:23:04.115 --> 00:23:05.270
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Interesting.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.410
So here at Google, similar
to you being a storyteller

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.790
and expanding the stories' reach
to people around the globe,

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.000
we write code, and
we make products,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.860
and try to make these products
accessible to the world.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.390
How do you see Google
being-- or yourself,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.880
reaching out to these
greater audiences

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.360
with stories that have these
little details that aren't

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.670
communicated in other ways?

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:36.320
ISABEL ALLENDE: I love the
process of building a universe,

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.780
of details.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:44.030
It is in the details that you
get the sitting, the theater

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.410
where the characters will move.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.410
And the more details I can
find to make believable, then

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:56.030
the better that the reader will
believe the unbelievable, which

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.350
is the fiction.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.660
So I create fictional characters
that move in a real world,

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.280
and that makes it more
believable for the reader.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.170
Now, how that reaches other
cultures, I don't know.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.750
But I love when I read a
book, for example, written

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.210
by an Indian author,
and I can see

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.910
how life is in India,
for that group of people,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.340
and learn about them.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.007
I find it fascinating.

00:24:21.007 --> 00:24:23.340
NATALIE NUÑEZ: And do these
stories impact your stories?

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.190
Stories from all over
the world, I mean--

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.140
you don't--

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.100
ISABEL ALLENDE: Yeah.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.840
My latest book--
what's the name?

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.406
[CHUCKLING]

00:24:31.406 --> 00:24:32.780
What is the name
of the last one?

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.650
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Your latest book?

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.941
ISABEL ALLENDE: Yeah, I forgot.

00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:35.729
Laurie.

00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:36.770
"In The Midst of Winter."

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:37.220
Sorry, because--

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.620
NATALIE NUÑEZ: This
is a memoir, right?

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.828
ISABEL ALLENDE: No, it's not.

00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:41.520
My latest book is fiction.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.030
And I forgot the name
because I write in Spanish.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.860
And I remember
everything in Spanish.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.260
I can't remember
anything in English.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.440
And in that book,
I have a character

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.980
that is a Guatemalan
undocumented migrant.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.300
She's a refugee.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.040
And she's running away from
the gangs in her country.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.120
They have exterminated
her family.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.120
I didn't have to
invent that character.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.700
I had to reconstruct her world.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.560
But that character,
we have cases

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.120
like that in my foundation.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.545
We work with refugees.

00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:17.060
And a story like that, I don't
have to create the story.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.900
I just have to recreate
the village, the house,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.880
the grandmother, the food,
the market, the voyage,

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.740
traveling all the way from
Guatemala, across Mexico,

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.170
to come to the United
States, the border,

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.950
living in clandestinity in the
United States, undocumented.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.810
That's the world I need to
construct very carefully,

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.030
and sticking to the truth.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:47.910
Because if I can be very
believable in that aspect,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:53.610
then the character of Evelyn
Ortega will emerge as real.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:57.160
NATALIE NUÑEZ: And in sharing
the stories of other people--

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.450
and you have memoirs of
your own life, "Paula,"

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.490
and a recent one.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.530
Is there a difference
in the way you

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:08.160
go about writing other
stories versus your own story?

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.750
ISABEL ALLENDE: Yeah.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.840
When I write a memoir, I'm
not writing about me alone.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.590
I'm writing about me and the
people who are around me,

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:20.270
my family and friends.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:24.345
And I ask myself, is
this my story to tell?

00:26:24.345 --> 00:26:26.970
Am I betraying someone?

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.120
If I have to choose
between betraying my mother

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.530
or telling the story,
I tell the story.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.310
Yeah, I can't resist.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.320
I tell the story.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.310
But I understand that there
is a limit to how much.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.880
So my way of handling it
when I write a memoir,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.110
first, the problem is,
I write in Spanish,

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:51.250
but once it's translated,
or I have a sort of idea,

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.100
I show it to the people who
are named by name in the book.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.360
And if they don't
approve, I take them out.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.030
I don't change it,
but I take them out.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.240
It has happened only once.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.010
And I-- with the latest memoir
that I wrote a long time ago,

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.417
I promised my son that I
would never write another one.

00:27:11.417 --> 00:27:12.000
And I haven't.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.980
So much has happened since then.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.750
I have so much.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.276
And I can't, because I
promised Nico I wouldn't.

00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:20.410
[CHUCKLING]

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.540
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So you
have your family here--

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.610
your son.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.680
Having your family
near, and having

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.080
your mother be a
huge inspiration,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.750
does that come across very
well in the love that--

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.680
Latinos are usually a very
communalistic community.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.690
ISABEL ALLENDE: Yeah, but I
don't have the extended family.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:41.470
I've tried to put together
an extended family.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.640
And it worked for a while when
my grandchildren were little.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.920
We sort of adopted friends
with their children

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.640
that were a part of this
almost compound where we lived.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.610
And kids would come to the pool.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.370
It would be an open house--

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.370
always open house.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.010
And I had the feeling that I
belonged in that little tribe

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.800
where we all belong
in Latin America.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.150
But now all that is gone.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.180
The grandchildren are older.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.660
They have gone to college.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.790
They finished college.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.060
They have their own lives.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.317
They don't remember me at all.

00:28:14.317 --> 00:28:15.650
NATALIE NUÑEZ: You can adopt me.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:16.402
[CHUCKLING]

00:28:16.402 --> 00:28:17.193
ISABEL ALLENDE: OK.

00:28:17.193 --> 00:28:18.460
You're adopted.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.310
Yeah, good.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.580
NATALIE NUÑEZ: And so
like you're saying,

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.990
a lot of us have
immigrated over,

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:30.060
and it's been the Bureau of
[INAUDIBLE] just recently

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.580
in the '70s and '70s started
using the terms, Hispanic,

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.150
Latino.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.560
And we've been here
long before then.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.100
So-- but we're still kind
of creating our identity

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.294
within the United States.

00:28:42.294 --> 00:28:42.960
How do you see--

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.790
ISABEL ALLENDE: Oh, I
think it's created already.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.710
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Yes.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.690
And so how do you see us showing
to the world that, you know,

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:53.085
we've been here long
before anyone else, and--

00:28:53.085 --> 00:28:55.210
ISABEL ALLENDE: You know,
I don't think it matters.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.230
I don't think it matters who
came first, because we all

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.140
came from somewhere else.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.720
Except Native Americans,
every single person

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.310
who lives in this
country has some ancestor

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.320
that comes from another place.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.640
So who came first and who came
second is not that important.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.080
I think that what is important
is how we sort of blend

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.920
into the culture without
losing our identity,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.000
and we contribute or not
to what this community is,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.570
this large country made of
so many different colors

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.080
and voices.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.270
So it is the diversity that
makes the United States

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.070
so powerful and so unique.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:40.620
It's a country
created on an idea.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.610
Most countries
emerge historically,

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.750
out of circumstances,
geography, tribes

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.770
that get together or not,
language that is common.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.915
But the United States
was created with an idea.

00:29:55.915 --> 00:29:59.930
And the idea of the founding
fathers was very clear.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.030
And it's a country
that, with those ideas,

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:09.480
has been so powerful, and
so important in the world.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:15.060
And we tend to forget what made
this country so extraordinary--

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.430
the ideas, the
values, the principles

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.570
on which the country was
built, and the people who

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.910
came from all over the world.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.410
All that is so
important to keep going,

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.147
to keep being what we are.

00:30:28.147 --> 00:30:28.980
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Yeah.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.590
That's inspirational,
and we're very

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.010
excited to continue
to build and show

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:38.060
the world our identity from the
American dream of coming here,

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:38.560
and--

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.393
ISABEL ALLENDE: Yeah,
but the American dream

00:30:40.393 --> 00:30:42.010
is not white supremacy.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.330
NATALIE NUÑEZ: It is diversity.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.121
ISABEL ALLENDE: No.

00:30:44.121 --> 00:30:46.040
NATALIE NUÑEZ: It is
all of us, absolutely.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.478
I have one funny question
that-- since we're here, Google.

00:30:48.478 --> 00:30:50.602
ISABEL ALLENDE: Yeah, no
incomplete questions, only

00:30:50.602 --> 00:30:52.230
incomplete answers.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.290
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Have you
ever Googled yourself?

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:55.880
And--

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.240
ISABEL ALLENDE: No.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.990
NATALIE NUÑEZ: No?

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.830
You've never Googled yourself.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:59.780
ISABEL ALLENDE: I
hadn't thought about it.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.595
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Interesting.

00:31:01.595 --> 00:31:03.260
Maybe we should try
to Google and see.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:03.510
ISABEL ALLENDE: However--

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.570
[CHUCKLING]

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.074
--I did Google a guy.

00:31:07.074 --> 00:31:08.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.560
Yeah.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.020
That's the only time
I've Googled anybody.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:18.710
I was separated from my husband
after 28 years of marriage--

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.670
and good terms.

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.590
It wasn't something
awful at all.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.180
But I was in a
sort of dark mood,

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.810
because I was 73 years old, and
I thought, the rest of my life,

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.240
I'll be alone, sleeping
alone with my dog.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.500
Not nice.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.360
Not that my dog is not nice.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.600
No, my dog is nice.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.100
And then a guy, out of the
blue, started emailing me.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.730
And there are a few
stalkers, but not many.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.720
As you get older, the
stalkers diminish--

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.240
--in number.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.620
And so he started emailing
me, and then I Googled him.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.780
But I had a wonderful
assistant, Chandra,

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:57.140
who was like Sherlock
Holmes in Google.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.210
She could get in
Google and get--

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:03.930
I mean, the brand of his
underwear-- everything.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.440
So by that time I met the
guy five months later,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.080
I knew absolutely everything
about his life, his family,

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.630
his kids, his car, everything.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.850
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Wow, so
Google has a big power.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.433
ISABEL ALLENDE: That
was the only time

00:32:16.433 --> 00:32:17.918
that I have used
Google for that.

00:32:17.918 --> 00:32:18.435
[CHUCKLING]

00:32:18.435 --> 00:32:20.060
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Well,
thank you so much.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.410
I think at this time we'd
love to open up the--

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:23.868
ISABEL ALLENDE:
That will be great.

00:32:23.868 --> 00:32:26.710
NATALIE NUÑEZ: --the floor to
questions from the audience.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.810
And we'll have to Google
yourself some time.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.560
See what comes up.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.851
ISABEL ALLENDE: I will do that.

00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:31.610
[CHUCKLING]

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:32.570
NATALIE NUÑEZ: It's
always interesting,

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.910
and sometimes flattering--

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.060
I'm sure, with you, often.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.410
ISABEL ALLENDE: I'm sure
it's not flattering when

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:37.701
you start seeing your pictures.

00:32:37.701 --> 00:32:38.262
[CHUCKLING]

00:32:38.262 --> 00:32:39.680
That's not flattering.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.250
Yes.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Monica.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.968
ISABEL ALLENDE: Hola, Monica.

00:32:42.968 --> 00:32:44.240
AUDIENCE: Hola.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.335
You used the word, blend,
in an interesting way.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.890
Blend-- to sort of
blend culturally, so

00:32:54.890 --> 00:33:00.290
that we are seen for who
we are and how we are.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:05.750
The way that I've experienced
blending as a Latina,

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:08.450
and trying to fit
in, is in contrast

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.310
to how you described it.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.730
And I'd like to know,
have you had experiences

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.840
of trying to blend that have
been at compromise or at odds

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.820
to who you are?

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:26.630
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Well, sometimes
I am asked to speak to Latino

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:32.180
youth, mostly, who have
either come recently,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.680
or they descend from Latino
parents who speak Spanish

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.900
at home, so it's a very
Latino culture at home.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.530
And they feel like outsiders.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.100
They feel that they are not
the blond kid with blue eyes

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.330
that is popular at school.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:52.040
And I keep telling
them, you don't

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.710
have to let go of anything.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.540
You can have everything.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.570
You can have your culture,
your language, your food,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.626
your music.

00:34:00.626 --> 00:34:02.000
And you can still
have everything

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.930
that this country offers.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.140
Why compromise for less?

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.730
You can have everything,
and keep what is your roots,

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:16.489
and makes you different,
and special, and richer.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.560
Because I speak two
languages, I feel

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.650
that I have two different
visions of world.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.770
When I read my
books in translation

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.199
because I have to check the
translation into English,

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:32.330
I realize that language is
like blood, so personal.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:37.409
It comes with your
upbringing, with your DNA.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.000
So keep it.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.130
Don't forget it.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.440
And just incorporate
more and more,

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.060
and it becomes a richer life.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.250
And when I say,
bland, it doesn't

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:51.510
mean that you forget or
renounce to who you are.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.957
Not at all.

00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:53.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.700
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Marisavel.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.990
ISABEL ALLENDE: Hi, hola.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.280
AUDIENCE: Hola.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.180
And yeah, thank you
so much for your talk.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.380
Several times, you
brought up letters,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.920
like how you have
written to your mom,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.980
and how you've researched
people's letters

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.170
from so long ago.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.990
And I worked in Gmail
for a while here,

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:23.130
so a lot of data privacy
things go through my head

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.450
about people's letters.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.340
But my question is about--

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.464
now that you have a
foundation, and you're

00:35:28.464 --> 00:35:29.880
working with some
of these groups,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.670
that each person has
some stories that

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:36.300
are important to our history.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.110
How can we empower those voices?

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.950
Do you, in your foundation,
tell these people,

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.371
even though this is
something difficult,

00:35:45.371 --> 00:35:46.620
we have to write some letters.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.380
We have to make a way
so that these voices are

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.897
heard 100 years from
now, 200 years from now?

00:35:51.897 --> 00:35:54.480
ISABEL ALLENDE: Well, there is
a program in the United States,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.390
Tell Your Story, in
which they record people.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.780
They Record migrants,
people who come here

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.820
from all over the
world, and they

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.990
go into this little cabin in
which they record their story.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.250
And all those stories are being
kept somewhere, and archived.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:15.270
So now, with all the media
that we have, with all the--

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:18.320
the fact that everybody's
taking selfies, and YouTubes,

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.030
and everybody is
in social media,

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.780
this is a huge way of
recording what before would

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.090
be lost without the letters.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.120
You know, I think that there
are three photographs of me

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.130
when I was a child.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:33.580
No one was taking pictures.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.300
To take a picture
was a major thing.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.004
Today, you take a picture of
a hamburger for God's sake.

00:36:39.004 --> 00:36:40.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.300
And everything is recorded.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.730
We have a baby that
was born in the family.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.850
And the mother, every single
day, sends out at least two

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.160
or three pictures of the baby.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.290
I mean, I know the
baby's butt by heart.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.590
That wasn't possible before.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.840
So I think we don't have
to worry about that.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.160
The voices are being
recorded better than ever.

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:04.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.560
So actually, my question
is kind of a continuation

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.570
of what you were saying.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.800
When everyone's taking a
picture, and everyone's writing

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.970
stuff, and making movies,
then it all gets lost.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.660
So what is that
piece of technology--

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.350
the printing press 500
years ago made literature

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.330
such an important
part of society.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.880
And now technology is
making it disappear,

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.260
because the attention spans
are under two minutes.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.460
We read more than ever before,
but only half-sentences,

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.400
or 140 characters.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.944
What is your take on where
it's going in the future?

00:37:43.944 --> 00:37:45.360
ISABEL ALLENDE:
You know, I'm very

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.370
optimistic about the future.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:53.400
I don't think that technology
will destroy culture.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.490
I think it contributes, and it
creates a new form of culture.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.690
And I think that
very soon we will

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.120
start filtering more the
information that we get,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.040
because we're
overwhelmed with trivia.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:12.540
And more and more, our brain
gets overloaded with things

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.470
that are not really important.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:18.240
So we will learn to handle that.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.370
We are in the process of change.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.380
Our brains have changed.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.600
Our children are born different.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:31.020
When I see a 3-year-old working
in a computer, playing games,

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.530
and I can't even turn it on.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:38.930
It's interesting how
humanity adapts to new forms.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.720
And I'm very optimistic.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.130
I don't think that the
stories will be lost,

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.480
or literature will disappear.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.520
We all need to hear stories.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.150
It's part of our human
heritage, like music.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.947
We need it.

00:38:51.947 --> 00:38:54.280
NATALIE NUÑEZ: And you can
say it's more accessible now,

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.130
because of the internet.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.720
You can get e-books,
and have them on you

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.750
at any time of the day.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.475
ISABEL ALLENDE: I travel
with 20 books in my iPad.

00:39:03.475 --> 00:39:04.410
It's great.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.420
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Marcos.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:10.930
ISABEL ALLENDE: Hola, Marcos.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:11.820
AUDIENCE: I'm very
glad to meet you.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:12.320
Hola.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.890
Hola, qué tal?

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.460
I have lots of questions, but--

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.460
ISABEL ALLENDE: No, one.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.626
AUDIENCE: One, yeah, I know.

00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:18.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.010
You were saying
that when you write

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:24.760
about a specific
person, a real person,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.220
you usually go and ask them.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.380
What happens with
big characters,

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.640
like [? Nedula ?]
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.094
that you wrote about?

00:39:35.094 --> 00:39:36.510
ISABEL ALLENDE:
They are all dead.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.590
AUDIENCE: I know, I know.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:44.290
But what I mean is, do you try
to put yourself in their shoes,

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.900
and try to imagine what would
they think about the way

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.610
you wrote them?

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.110
ISABEL ALLENDE: I
have never written

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:55.060
about someone like [? Nedula ?]
while that person is still

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.771
alive, and try to create
a fictional character out

00:39:57.771 --> 00:39:58.270
of them.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.530
I don't do that.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:02.830
If I'm writing about
someone who really exists,

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.670
I stick to the person,
whatever the person has said.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.990
I would quote that person,
but not invent something

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.430
that that person said.

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:16.630
Because it would be so
easy to prove me wrong.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:24.530
Usually, my historical
books are from the far past.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.900
It could be 200 years
ago, 100 years ago.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.440
I have a book about the conquest
of Chile, 500 years ago.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.240
But if I have someone who--

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.050
now I'm writing a book in
which one of the characters

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.020
is still alive.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.410
He's 103 years old.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.750
And he's my friend.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:49.180
And I used him for the
book as a character,

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.230
but not with his name.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:55.830
And I have used the information
that he has given me,

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.270
as he gave it to me.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:02.580
I didn't make up anything
about him, because he's alive.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.247
He'll be dead by the time the
book is published, but still.

00:41:06.247 --> 00:41:07.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.705
ISABEL ALLENDE: Out
of respect, I mean.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.630
Some of the things I
love about your books

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.760
is how they transport
me to a different time,

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.940
especially in Latin America,
being Latin American.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.790
My question is, it's been a
long time since you left Chile,

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.740
and a lot has
happened politically.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.360
What are the major
changes you see

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.420
when you get to go back there.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.900
Chile is another country
from the country I left.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.510
But that has happened
everywhere in the world.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:39.600
I mean, I left Chile more
than 40 years ago, in 1973.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:45.680
And I left a country that
was under a dictatorship,

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.670
half the population living
in terror, and the other half

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.580
very happy with what was
happening with the dictatorship

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.620
because they were in control.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:42:00.030
And 17 years later-- that's how
long the dictatorship lasted--

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.250
I went back.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:06.260
And I found a country that
still was a very cautious.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.200
Society people didn't
talk much at the time.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.360
Now, everything has changed.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.520
But the fabric of the society
had changed in those 17 years.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.930
Plus, the world
has also evolved.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.870
So Chile is another place.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:25.520
I go back with this
romantic, nostalgic idea

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.890
of the Chile I left, which
was a poor, sober country that

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.850
was struggling to find
its way in the world.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.440
And I find that totally
different society

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.290
that is a neo-capitalist
place, that sort of doesn't

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.560
fit my idea of Chile.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.127
But it's still Chile.

00:42:47.127 --> 00:42:47.960
People are the same.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.820
NATALIE NUÑEZ: So I do
have one last question.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.285
Are you writing another book?

00:42:55.285 --> 00:42:56.160
ISABEL ALLENDE: I am.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.910
I just finished it, like--

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:59.400
well, I will finish it tomorrow.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.530
I thought I had finished
it last week, but no.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.470
I will finish it tomorrow.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.870
Because I write in
Spanish, I don't

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:15.900
have the possibility to share
the writing with anybody.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.510
And when the book
is finished, I don't

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.910
have anybody to show it
to, because my mom died,

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.800
and she was the one who
would read the book.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.170
But I showed it to my
brother, and then I

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:32.040
showed it to my former
editor in Simon and Schuster,

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.900
who speaks Spanish.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.850
But she left Simon and Schuster,
so still I showed her the book.

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.710
And so I'm getting their
input, and by tomorrow, I

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.560
should have a clean
copy of the book.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.500
And the book is--

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.180
I won't say historical,
because it's very recent,

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:53.630
but it starts in 1936 in
the Civil War in Spain.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.729
And it ends many years later.

00:43:57.729 --> 00:43:59.770
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Well, we're
very, really excited--

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.210
ISABEL ALLENDE:
I'm excited, too.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:07.680
Because every book is
like a message in a bottle

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.390
that you put in the
sea, and you never

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:12.720
know what's going to happen, if
someone is going to pick it up,

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.540
if it's going to
be read by someone.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.960
I have written so
many books, and still

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.040
have that feeling of
total uncertainty.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.070
NATALIE NUÑEZ: But does
it help, that feeling?

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.120
Because I feel
like if you were--

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.660
ISABEL ALLENDE: I don't know the
other feeling, so I don't know.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.360
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Well,
we're very excited.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:30.570
ISABEL ALLENDE:
The other feeling

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.560
of feeling great about it,
I don't know that feeling.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.479
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:34.479 --> 00:44:37.020
NATALIE NUÑEZ: I think we're in
the same boat here at Google.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.300
We're always aspiring
to be great and perfect,

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.495
but we're very excited
to read the next book.

00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:43.620
ISABEL ALLENDE: And inventing
new things every day,

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:49.140
which is how I feel about
the writing, that every book,

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.400
you have to invent
everything again.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.840
And I try not to make the same
mistakes that I've made before,

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.000
but I make new ones.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.845
There's always new
mistakes to make.

00:44:58.845 --> 00:44:59.640
NATALIE NUÑEZ: That's always--

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.420
that's comforting.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:00.919
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:00.919 --> 00:45:02.503
ISABEL ALLENDE: Very
comforting, yeah.

00:45:02.503 --> 00:45:04.793
NATALIE NUÑEZ: Well, thank
you so much, Isabel Allende.

00:45:04.793 --> 00:45:06.480
It's really an honor
speaking with you,

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.532
and I'm very excited
that we had you here

00:45:08.532 --> 00:45:09.490
to speak with everyone.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.290
ISABEL ALLENDE:
Thank you very much.

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.165
Thank you for coming.

00:45:11.165 --> 00:45:14.540
