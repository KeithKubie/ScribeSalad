00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.859
This toy refuses to believe he's a toy, and
thinks he can fly. But rather than crush his

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.870
expectations, let's try using some chemicals
and craft supplies, to help get this little

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.530
space ranger, a little closer to living his
dream.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.550
To start this project I went to the hobby
store for some glittering foam sheets and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.039
a bottle of tacky glue. I also picked up a
couple of F-class rocket motors. And you can

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.320
see the code on the side indicates this
project really should not be duplicated. Now

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.120
we need a way to make our glitter sheets a
bit more rigid, so why not start by gluing

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.390
a scrap piece of cardboard to the backside
of the foam. Now this will start to curl up

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.640
as it dries, so we should probably use something
like a heavy book, to keep it as flat as possible.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.600
Ok, now that the red sheet is drying, let's
cut a rectangle out of the blue foam, and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.670
apply a liberal coat of glue to that one as
well. This piece is gonna wrap around the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.200
sides of the motor tube, so if we press it
flat and carefully roll it up, this should

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.969
form a cool blue rocket body. Now let's check
on the red piece to see how it's doing. I

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.540
decided to trim the excess material around
the edges just to make it a little more convenient

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.500
to work with, and now we can add glue and
fold one of the edges back on itself to get

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.990
a double sided glitter effect. This piece
is gonna be used to make the fins, and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.200
I'm gonna use the corner of a piece of
cardboard as a template. Now I'm sure you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.270
can already figure out how this is going to
work. I traced 3 pieces the same size, then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.060
cut along the lines, to get these sparkly
red fins that should all be about equal. Alright,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.520
let's try adding a bit of hot glue to the
ends, and pressing them onto the rocket body.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.520
Now, this typically isn't the best choice
to secure fins to a rocket, but the foam is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.130
porous enough to make a surprisingly strong
bond. The next step is to make a nose cone,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.900
and we can do that by cutting to the center
of a circle, then gluing it around the top

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.060
in a cone shape. This will help reduce the
drag a bit, but it's mainly just for looks.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.329
Now as a fun finishing touch, I picked up
a package of alphabet stickers, and pressed

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.430
them directly onto the body tube. At this
point, our little rocket-ship is ready for

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.780
action. All we need now is a pilot. My 3 yr
old son said I could use his Buzz Lightyear,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.950
so we used a bit of black electrical tape
to strap him on securely. Now this little

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.930
guy is sporting a powerful little rocket pack,
that's awesome, but the problem is that it's

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.209
extremely unstable. Now we might be able to
balance it out a bit with a long wooden dowel.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.519
Let's secure the rocket at the top of the
dowel with some packing tape, then strap our

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.650
rocketeer back into place. As we look for
the center of gravity, you can see that just

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.819
by adding the stick, we've shifted the CG
behind the rocket. Hopefully, that'll be

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.620
enough to get this to work, but in either
case, our test pilot looks excited and ready

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.739
to go, so let's push a fuse up into the nozzle,
and try lighting it, with sunlight. Unlike

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.010
the movie, however, this guys helmet can't
actually focus the sunlight by itself. But

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.900
I do have a 2" acrylic ball that certainly
can. All we need to do now is sit back, and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.940
enjoy the show.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.620
Now it looks everything just
exploded, but surprisingly our hero made it

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.510
back with hardly a scratch. It looks like
he wants more, so let's go bigger. I made

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.870
the bigger one by cutting a toilet paper tube
lengthwise, secured it to the motor with some

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.329
glue, then reinforced the tube with a few
wraps of packing tape. This made a compartment

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.659
just big enough, for a makeshift parachute.
I made this one from a garbage bag and some

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.249
dental floss. You can see here, I reinforced
the eyelet holes with packing tape to prevent

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.639
the plastic from ripping. Next, I glued some
of the blue foam around the rocket body, pushed

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.150
the parachute into position, then pressed
the nose cone to fit snugly at the top. It

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.290
looks ready, so let's give it one final pre-flight
check, then light it up and back away.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.449
Yeah, the parachute came out alright, but apparently,
we should have added a shock cord, because

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.329
dental floss isn't very flame resistant. Not
to worry though because it looks like our

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.609
action hero still wants more. I went to the
dollar store and got a pool noodle and some

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.239
flutter boards, then glued them together to
make "the biggest one". I tried building a

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.739
makeshift launch pad out of some wooden dowels,
and glued little PVC risers on the sides to

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.839
help guide it during the launch. Now let's
get ready for blastoff, making sure our captain

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:03.849
is nice and comfortable, give him a big salute,
and wish him the best, on his journey to infinity,

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.529
and beyond. If you were to ask him I'm sure
he'd agree, that flying a pool noodle rocket

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.949
was an epic way to end the day. Well now you
know how to use a few craft supplies to give

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.759
your favorite toys the ride of their life.
But, of course, you probably shouldn't.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.870
If you do wanna play with rockets though, try
searching for nearby rocketry clubs and see

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.720
what they're up to. Well that's it for now.
If you liked this project, perhaps you'll

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.660
like some 
of my others. Check them out
