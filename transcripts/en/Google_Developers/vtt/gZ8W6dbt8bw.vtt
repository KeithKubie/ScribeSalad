&gt;&gt;Ambarish Kenghe: But this is very cool stuff.
You can sort of see that we are bringing innovation

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.340
to the living room and allowing you to do
things that were just not possible before.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.299
And Google TV is an open platform.
It is -- it is you who maps it.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.989
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ambarish Kenghe: And because it is open

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.640
platform, you are the most important part
of it.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.390
We are looking forward to some really exciting
stuff from the developer community in the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.080
months and years to come.
Meanwhile, please sign up on google.com/TV,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.810
and we'll give you aware of all of the developments
at our end.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.730
We're looking forward to being in touch with
you.
