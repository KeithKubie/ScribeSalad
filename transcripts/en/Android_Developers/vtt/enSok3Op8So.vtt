MATTEO VALLONE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.540
My name is Matteo Vallone, and
I work in the Google Play Games

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.100
business element
team here in London.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.600
So now we're going
to talk about one

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.100
of the most
important topics when

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.129
it comes to running your
game as a service, which

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.940
is what users should
you run the service for.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.400
And what I mean by that
is that you monetize

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.280
your game with in-app
purchases and the game is

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.390
free to install, you always face
this challenge that on one side

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.240
you want as many
users as possible

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.840
to come in, download
your game, and try it.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.650
On the other side, the
more users you have

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.710
and the more-- sorry,
I need a-- yeah.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.240
The more users you have, the
more diverse they will be.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
You will find casual users,
hard core users together.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.130
Some will come for the PVP.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.240
Some will come for PVE, and
some will have bigger budgets

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.530
to spend and some will be a bit
more concerned about spending.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.190
So the wider the funnel,
the more difficult

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.782
it is to please everyone.

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:07.490
And that's what we're
going to talk about

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.690
in the next 30 minutes.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.590
So, first of all,
Adam, my colleague,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.120
who is a game
design expert, will

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.350
talk about the basics of
running your game as a service,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.180
and also some key
design principles

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.960
to make sure that every player,
regardless of their profile

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.010
and what they're looking
for, finds value in your game

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.690
and is engaged.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.520
Then Fred from
Space Ape will talk

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.020
about how they
approach monetization

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.889
for these different
cores of users.

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:37.430
How do they target
them and make sure

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.990
that they extract the LTV
that they bring to the game?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
They've been improving
this over time.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.790
And so, Fred will
give you an overview

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.530
of how all the different
steps that they

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.580
take and all the learnings that
they acquired in that process,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.050
and also give you a sneak
peek into viewing into what

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.030
is coming next for them.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.410
But Space Ape wasn't
built in a day.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.789
It takes time and effort.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.830
And so that's why I'm
going to come back on stage

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.570
and talk about
some tools that can

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.590
get you started right away,
applying this concept in a very

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.990
simple way, and also free,
which is always good.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.660
So lots of content, and so,
Adam, please take it away.

00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:20.290
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Hi, everyone.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.470
Thank you, Matteo,
for that lovely intro.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.570
Thank you, Shannon,
for hosting today.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.959
And thank you all for coming
out to Playtime London.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.500
I know it's a gorgeous
day in London,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.850
so thank you all for
spending it with us.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.402
I'm very excited
to be here today.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.860
This is my second Playtime,
second time in London for this,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.910
and LTV is one of my
favorite subjects,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.590
so super stoked to talk
to you about it today.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.864
As Matteo was
mentioning, let's go just

00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:44.280
through a little
bit of the basics

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.680
when it comes to LTV,
just so we can level

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.711
set before Fred from Space
Ape is going to come up here

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.210
and give you the
master class on it.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.650
So, let's do LTV 101 for a bit.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.290
Know your metrics.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.680
All right, what is LTV
and why does it matter?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.320
LTV simply stands
for Life Time Value.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.259
If you didn't know
that, now you do.

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.550
It's one of the key metrics
that everyone looks at when

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.900
it comes to game development.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.390
It's something that you
buy against when you're

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.040
doing your user
acquisition campaigns,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.410
and it's obviously what
you look to when you're

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.820
trying to monetize your games.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.670
This is the absolute value
of the average custom

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.110
in your game.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.240
Now, it's a bit
different in games

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.820
as a service, which you often
see in mobile, versus what

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.529
you would ordinarily see
in a packaged business

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.820
that you would see, say, in
GameStop or somewhere else.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.470
In a packaged games business,
you've got a binary outcome.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.160
You either have $0 or you have
$60 from your customer-- one

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.020
or the other,
nothing in between.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.790
With games as a service,
it's a bit different.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.370
There's no barrier to entry.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.030
People come in.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.585
It's free to download.

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:45.960
And then you have
this experience

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.450
where you're providing
a service as the player

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.720
goes through your game.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.620
So LTV is not a function
of a single price point.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.869
LTV is a function of
engagement times the value

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.660
that you offer your
customers and the value

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.040
that they give you back
in terms of dollars.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.980
So LTV in this case,
for games as a service,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.700
is engagement times value.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.360
So, Fred's going to come up in
a minute and talk about value.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.950
He's got some
amazing slides on it.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.033
I'm going to talk about
engagement really quickly,

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:15.418
just to talk about how do
developers drive engagement,

00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:16.709
think about it, and measure it.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.430
So let's think about
measuring it first.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.360
There's a few ways to
measure engagement.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.670
There is the traditional
ways of session length

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.430
and sessions per day, and
that stickiness factor

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.800
that you often hear
about-- daily active users

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.025
over monthly active users.

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:32.910
Hint-- that should
be at least 15%.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.780
But hard retention,
hard retention

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.760
is one that we look at all the
time-- D1, D7, D30-- absolutely

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.600
critical.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.635
And it's critical for a
very, very obvious reason,

00:04:42.635 --> 00:04:44.010
but I'm going to
tell you it just

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.190
to make sure it sticks
and you never forget it.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.177
You can't make money
from your users.

00:04:49.177 --> 00:04:51.510
You can't offer them value
and they can't give you value

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.670
back in terms of their
dollars if they're not

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.940
playing the game.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.620
So if your D7 and D30s are
low, if players are not

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.840
sticking around in your
game, simply-- again,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.770
very obviously,
you're not going to be

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.970
able to make money from them.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.950
This is why it's absolutely
one of the most critical things

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.760
out there.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.990
It's the number one predictor
of success in LTV is retention.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.370
Now, what about benchmarks?

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.790
People ask us this all the time.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.400
So, as a platform, we talk
to every game developer

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.672
out there that we can.

00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:21.092
We look at casual games.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:22.300
We'll look at mid-core games.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.390
We look at core games.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.514
And, yeah, take pictures
of the slide all you want.

00:05:25.514 --> 00:05:26.650
This is a good one.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.660
Retention is paramount,
but the benchmarks

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.930
are absolutely 100% paramount.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.982
You can be in this darker
area, blue at the bottom

00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:35.440
or-- but what you
really want to do

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.320
is be in the sky blue
on top, because that's

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.597
the cream of the crop up there,
the best games out there.

00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:42.930
Those are their retention rates.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.092
So if you're in the core genre
like a super, super core MMO,

00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:47.800
something like
"Hearthstone" or something

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.091
like that-- I'm not saying
this is their retention rate

00:05:50.091 --> 00:05:51.490
but something in
that core area--

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.850
you want to be at least 10%,
pushing above that even better,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.894
all the way up to casual.

00:05:56.894 --> 00:05:59.310
I have one developer who has
been working on a casual game

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.540
now, and they will not
ship the casual game

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.470
until their D30 retention
rate is 23%, best in class.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.436
Because they know that
that retention rate is

00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:09.810
the key predictor
of the lifetime

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.430
value of their customers
and of their game.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.090
Absolutely important.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.290
Oh, and by the way, we've got
tools to help you measure this.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.220
Who here uses Play Game
Services in their game?

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.990
Yeah?

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.900
Do you use the Player Stats API?

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.720
Some of you do.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.940
More of you should.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.380
Remember this.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.140
Player Stats API will actually
help you measure retention.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.359
One thing though, encourage
sign in for your game.

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:35.650
Have it in a really good
place, because the more people

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.170
sign, the more data
you're going to get.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.620
You want to be pushing 50%,
60% sign-in in your game.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.619
That way you can actually
measure as many people

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.750
as you can coming
through your game.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.650
OK, so, we've talked
about how to measure

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.850
engagement and retention.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.990
Awesome stuff.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.150
How do we actually engage
and retain players?

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
Let's do this really
quickly before we have Fred

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.140
come up and talk about value.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.930
Who here has played
"Clash Royale?"

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.790
I want all the hands to go up.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.370
Yeah, awesome, an amazing game.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.790
It's topical, because it
just launched this year,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.517
and everybody loves this game.

00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:10.600
Let's talk about the way
that they engage players.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.390
Now, a game shouldn't
engage players the same way

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.815
for every single player.

00:07:16.815 --> 00:07:18.970
A game should have
very different ways

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.490
to engage players, to engage
your more casual players,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.198
the players that play
maybe once or twice

00:07:23.198 --> 00:07:25.870
a day, the ridiculously
core players, the guy that

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.540
is glued to his phone or
has a battery pack walking

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.500
around playing "Pokemon Go"
because he can't put it down,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.340
and everything else in between.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.980
You want your game to engage
players in every different way,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.790
and every different cadence,
every different kind of play

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.490
style.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.420
So, let's look at
how "Clash" does it.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.870
Here on the left, you
see the card shop.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.680
This card shop refreshes
once every 24 hours.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.090
I know that, because I
get a little notification,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.241
and I go to the card
shop every 24 hours

00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:52.740
to see what they've
been serving me.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.240
And it's personalized to me.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.674
It's different to everybody.

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:58.090
And I want to see what's there,
because I might be looking

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.606
for that rare lumberjack
card, and it comes up,

00:08:00.606 --> 00:08:01.480
and I want to buy it.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.507
So, on the minimum
on a daily basis,

00:08:04.507 --> 00:08:07.090
I'm like, well, I got to check
what cards are new, absolutely.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.390
So I'm encouraged
to log in every day.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.300
Look at the rate.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.650
This is the battle screen.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.890
You got this on-demand mode.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.200
I can battle randomly a
player right now as many times

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.870
as I want, so it's on demand.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.370
It is for the most core players,
for the most casual player.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.430
It is on demand.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.177
It is not on a clock.

00:08:24.177 --> 00:08:26.010
But there's other things
here on this screen

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.110
that are actually on clocks.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.300
There's a couple of things.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.716
There's a chest
going on over here

00:08:29.716 --> 00:08:32.266
that's going to open in
two hours and 21 minutes.

00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:33.640
There's a free
chest that's going

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.169
to be available in three
hours and 21 minutes.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.210
So, you can kind of see
what they're doing here.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.120
You've got this daily
engagement mechanic.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.919
You've got this
on-demand mechanic.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.809
You've got these chests
opening at different times.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.390
Over here, you've got
tournaments that start and end

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.770
in various different cadences.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.630
And on the far
right here, you've

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.850
got this every two
weeks the season is up,

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.850
and you earn rewards for
yourself and for your clan.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.680
You can see what
"Clash" is doing here,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680
what Supercell is doing.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.040
They're trying to engage
players in every way

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.710
possible that they want
to engage with the game

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.160
to the most casual to
everything in between,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.570
all the way up to the most core.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.480
Thank you very much.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.730
I'm going to bring Fred Easey.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.090
Up here to talk about value,
master class, and LTV.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.326
Everybody, welcome Fred
Easey from Space Ape.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.110
FRED EASEY: Thank you, Adam.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.920
Hi.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.080
My name is Fred Easey.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.900
I head up the analytics
team at Space Ape Games.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.850
I should put my slide on.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.600
So, we are a mid-core
studio based just

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.700
around the corner
from here in Soho.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.891
We've got three live games.

00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:38.640
They're all in the
build and battle genre.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.665
So, if you've played
"Clash of Clans,"

00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:42.880
any of those kind of
games, you build a base.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.890
You attack other people.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.120
They attack you.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.170
Those are the types
of games that we make.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.850
And over the years,
we've had a challenge

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.590
trying to monetize
players in those games.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.169
And today, I want to talk about
the past, how we used to do it.

00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:57.710
I want to talk about
the present, how

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.210
we're doing things now.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.250
And we're going to take
a look at the future

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.210
as Matteo alluded
to, and what we're

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.714
going to be doing pretty
soon in terms of how are

00:10:05.714 --> 00:10:06.880
we going to monetize people.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.830
So, let's cast our
minds back to 2013.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.960
And we're launching
our first game.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.870
It's "Samurai Siege."

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.820
It was a fast follow
on "Clash of Clans"

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.960
with some additional
improvements added on.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.460
And this screen here is showing
you the shop in the game.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.940
So, this is how users
buy currency in the game.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.330
They go to the shop, and there's
a range of different prices

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.440
they can buy.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.980
And if you spend
more in the shop,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.992
if you're buying one of
these high-value ones,

00:10:36.992 --> 00:10:38.450
you get more in-game
currency back.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.700
You're getting a better bang
for your buck, in effect.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.100
So, we're trying to encourage
people to spend a bit more.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.180
So, with the shop, what are
the pros and cons of this?

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.910
So there's a range of prices.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.180
So players will generally
be able to buy a price

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.630
that they're willing to
spend at, which is good.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.310
Also, there's the bulk
discount that I mentioned,

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.207
which is going to encourage
players to maybe move up

00:11:03.207 --> 00:11:05.290
a notch in terms of how
much they wanted to spend.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.220
So, that's going to upsell.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.265
One downside is we
found with this system,

00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:10.640
players will tend
to stick around

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.056
the same sort of
transaction size.

00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:15.110
So, if they come
in, they spend $20,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.802
they tend to stay around
that level, generally.

00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:20.510
The other really bad
thing about the shop

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.800
is it's kind of tucked away.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.716
If you go into the game
and you want to spend,

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:25.274
it's two or three clicks deep.

00:11:25.274 --> 00:11:27.440
You've got to click on one
thing to bring up a menu,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.190
then there's another
click to get to the shop,

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.060
then you go to click
to get the buy screen.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:31.935
It's a lot of clicks.

00:11:31.935 --> 00:11:32.990
It's quite high friction.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.470
So you're going to lose some
spends there, basically.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.140
So, this system is
actually very popular.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.500
It's still used today by a lot
of really big games-- "Clash

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.110
Royale," as we've just
seen, "Pokemon Go."

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.796
These are number
one grossing games,

00:11:46.796 --> 00:11:48.670
and this is pretty much
how those guys do it.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.510
This way works really
well, so there's

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.132
no shame in having
a set up like this.

00:11:52.132 --> 00:11:53.590
But we want to try
to improve this.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:58.670
So one thing we added
to "Samurai Siege"

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.080
was time-limited bundles.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.880
So we're going
forward in time here.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.260
It's the Iron Age.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.470
And with these bundles, what
would happens is the player

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.920
would log into the game,
and this would pop up.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.004
It's a special offer.

00:12:11.004 --> 00:12:12.920
Now, you've only got so
long to purchase this.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.720
There will be a countdown,
so maybe there's

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.240
five hours, 24 hours,
something like that.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.590
So, there's pressure there.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.673
You've got to buy it now
or it's going to go away,

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:21.450
and it's gone.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.590
And it's really good value.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.240
So if we look at this bundle
here in "Samurai Siege,"

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.740
you're getting some diamonds,
which is the in-game currency.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.740
You can only get that
through spending dollars--

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.160
well, high amounts
of it, anyway.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.243
We've got onyx, which is
another currency which is

00:12:33.243 --> 00:12:34.460
very valuable to the players.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.710
It lets them buy camps,
which gives them troops.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.600
And we've also got this
sun dragon's tower,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.975
which is an actual
camp that they

00:12:39.975 --> 00:12:42.110
can deploy in the game--
quite a powerful thing.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.969
Each of these separate things
is worth about 10 pounds,

00:12:44.969 --> 00:12:47.010
something like that-- 10
pounds for the diamonds,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.820
10 pounds for the
onyx, 10 pounds

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.177
for the sun dragon tower.

00:12:50.177 --> 00:12:52.010
So, overall, they're
getting about 30 pounds

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.310
of value for 19 pounds, so
it's a pretty great deal.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.060
This is a term that we call
EV, or Estimated Value.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.870
And that's a percentage-- in
this case, about 150 to 200%--

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.220
of how much better it is than
what you'd get from spending

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.810
in the store.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.057
So, with this kind of deal,
you've go a lot of good things

00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:15.140
which are going to make
the player want to buy it.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.570
You've got the
timer ticking down.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.810
You've got the great value.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.160
You've got some nice art there.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.743
All of these things
are going to help.

00:13:20.743 --> 00:13:22.710
So we found when
we launched this

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.670
that we had a big uptick
in conversion and spend,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:30.070
so it was a great way to
try and convert people.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.970
A couple of dangers
with these things-- one

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.955
is that players can become
trained to wait for these.

00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:37.580
So what's the point
in buying in a shop

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.200
if you know that one of these
is going to spawn tomorrow?

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.150
You might as well
wait, get your value.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.810
So you'll tend to see that shop
spend is cannibalized a bit.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.470
The other thing you'll see
as well is content burn.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.237
You are giving away
more for the same price,

00:13:50.237 --> 00:13:52.070
so you're going to burn
through your content

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.528
more quickly than if players
are just buying from the shop.

00:13:54.528 --> 00:13:57.520
So there's that to
think about as well.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.186
And one other thing-- and this
is probably the most important

00:14:00.186 --> 00:14:01.310
thing I'll say about these.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.080
They work really well when you
combine them with a live event.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.740
By a live event, what I mean
is a special event in the game.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.960
So, for these build
and battle games,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.251
you want to have a special
event running on the weekend

00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:13.340
where you'll be competing
against other alliances

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.920
as part of your own can
trying to beat each other.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.880
And if you theme this
offer with the event,

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.434
you'll see a real big
surge in your sales.

00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:23.600
People love that, basically.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.280
They want to spend anyway,
because it's an event.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.930
You're showing them
a great bundle.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.971
A lot of people are going
to spend at that point.

00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:31.700
So, just to
illustrate that, this

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.415
is a graph of revenue over time
for "Rival Kingdoms," which

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:35.960
is the second game we launched.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.060
And what you'll see is
these two peaks in revenue

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.630
that I've highlighted
here and here, those

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.480
are events which were teamed
up with a great bundle,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.914
a great event, great bundle.

00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:48.080
And you can see that there's
a real surge in revenue

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.170
during that.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.670
One thing I'll say
is you don't want

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.836
to do that every week,
because otherwise you're just

00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:54.619
going to fatigue
players, and you

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:55.910
won't have as strong an effect.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.770
But it's something we
try and do something

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.980
like once a month
in our games is

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.190
we'll have one
these great bundles,

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.981
one of these great
events, and we'll always

00:15:01.981 --> 00:15:04.710
see a big surge in
sales as a result.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.640
So that's time-limited bundles.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.974
That's how we used to do things.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:11.306
We still run a lot of these
things in our games as well.

00:15:11.306 --> 00:15:13.920
These haven't gone away, but
we've added stuff over time.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.340
So, let's take up to the
present day-- Steam Age--

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.880
timeline bundles.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.644
So we've got a screenshot here.

00:15:21.644 --> 00:15:23.060
This is "Transformers
Earth Wars,"

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.160
which is the most recent
game that we've launched.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.576
This is an example of one of
the bundles which is popping.

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:29.630
We've got some nice
Transformer art on there.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.020
What is a timeline bundle--
no one said-- but I'm

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.020
going to answer that question.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.800
Here are some timelines.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.830
So each row on this table
represents a timeline.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:44.030
Now, it's a little bit
blurred, but on the left here,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.340
there's different spend
segments, in effect.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.519
so we've got non-spender, low
mid-spender, high-spender,

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:51.185
all the way up to
high-spender II, which

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:52.730
is the really big one.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.970
What this represents is
what a person's maximum

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.220
spend has been into the
game up to that point.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.870
So if you come in and you're
playing for the first time,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.430
you're going to
be a non-spender.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.030
If you go in to shop, for
example, you spend $20.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.880
Now, we're going to class
you as a mid-spender.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.980
And what happen is,
with this system,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.140
we've got a series of
bundles that we've worked out

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.510
that we think that will
be appealing to users

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.710
in those segments.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.220
And what will happen is, each
time they log in each day,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.670
they're going to get shown
one of these bundles.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.420
They might buy it.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.355
They might not.

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.480
They might buy it and move
up to a higher timeline.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.860
The next day, they're
going to log in.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.120
They're going to see another
one of these bundles,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.260
a different one.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.887
And sometimes at
these higher levels,

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:30.470
it will even go
faster than one a day.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.750
You might see a couple in a day.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.950
And this is much more effective
than the other version

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.750
I was showing you for
a number of reasons.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.529
So, why does this work better?

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:43.820
It's better upselling than
a single price point bundle.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.850
With a single
price point bundle,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.559
you've got this tension
where you've got

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.850
to decide what price to put up.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.267
So for those
time-limited bundles,

00:16:50.267 --> 00:16:51.766
if you are the guy
running the game,

00:16:51.766 --> 00:16:54.110
you are like I'm going to run
a $10 bundle this weekend.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.787
With a $10 bundle,
a lot of people

00:16:55.787 --> 00:16:57.620
will buy it, because
it's quite a low price,

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.920
so a lot people can afford it.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.261
But there are some guys
who wanted to spend 50.

00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:01.681
You know, the guys
loved the game.

00:17:01.681 --> 00:17:02.930
They want to play all weekend.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:04.069
They want a $50 bundle.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.849
And they're going
to buy your $10 one.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.579
So you left money
on the table there.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.599
And the flipside is if you run
the $40 bundle or $50 bundle,

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.560
there's a lot of
guys who don't want

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.900
to spend that much on a mobile
game-- most people, in fact--

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.233
and they're not going to buy it.

00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:17.329
So again, you're leaving
money on the table.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:21.670
With this system, your
showing the correct bundle

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.700
to the correct user.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.260
The non-spender's seeing
the low value ones.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.968
The high spender's
seeing the high value.

00:17:25.968 --> 00:17:30.137
So it's tailored to
what the customer wants.

00:17:30.137 --> 00:17:31.970
The other thing as well,
there's no curation

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.350
required after initial setup.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.130
So obviously,
there's quite a lot

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.960
of work in setting
up these timelines.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.310
Once it's done, it's done.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.540
With the other type
I was showing you,

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.310
those time-limited
ones, every week you'll

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.262
have new art created.

00:17:41.262 --> 00:17:43.470
You've got to decide what
bundle you're going to run,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.720
all that kind of stuff.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.090
With this, it's
essentially automatic.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:52.310
It's automated once it's set up
so no real intervention needed.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.060
What we found with this system
is the games make two to three

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.180
more in terms of lifetime
value when you add this.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.380
We'd actually run a split
test in "Transformers"

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.810
doing the soft launch, where we
had this system versus players

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:05.860
not having the system.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.222
And, yeah, it was 2 to 3x
increase in lifetime value.

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:09.680
So this is tried
and tested for us.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.180
It really works.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.680
The other thing as well
is this isn't instead

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.600
of the other stuff I
showed you, the shop

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.500
and the time-limited bundle.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.000
You can have all
three in your game.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.830
And in fact, we have
all three in our game,

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.840
and they serve
different purposes.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.652
The shop's there for the
really intense players who

00:18:26.652 --> 00:18:27.860
want to spend the whole time.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.240
They're not going to
wait for special offer.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.440
They want their stuff now.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.273
They can go to shop.

00:18:31.273 --> 00:18:32.300
They're going to spend.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.431
We've got these
timeline bundles,

00:18:34.431 --> 00:18:36.680
where players will log in
almost on like a daily thing

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.300
with a login, see the
bundle, and think, mm,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:38.810
that's a good one.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.170
Yeah, I'm going to buy that one.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.128
And then we've also got
the time-limited bundle

00:18:42.128 --> 00:18:43.705
which we'll set up
with those events,

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.830
as I was saying, where
they're timed with the event

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.705
and will get those big
spikes on the weekends

00:18:47.705 --> 00:18:49.105
and that kind of thing.

00:18:49.105 --> 00:18:51.230
The dangers with these ones
is pretty much the same

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.760
as the time-limited bundles.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.590
You've got that problem
about content burn.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.140
You've got that problem about
cannibalization from the shop.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.760
But net-net overall,
you're still

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.010
going to make a lot more
money using this system

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.720
despite those drawbacks.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.880
So this is one thing I'll just
mentioned in passing quickly.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.330
This is a correlation matrix for
people who know what that is.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.207
We're basically--
at the moment, we

00:19:13.207 --> 00:19:15.290
target these things based
on the user's max spend.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.690
So if you've spent
$20 ever, you'll

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.190
go into that middle
spender bracket,

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.440
even if you normally spend $5.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.891
You go, 5, 5, 5, 5, then 20.

00:19:21.891 --> 00:19:24.140
At that point, you go into
the middle spender bracket,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.090
and that's where
you're going to stay.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.590
We did a quick thing
where we looked

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.680
at the correlation between what
your next spend amount is going

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.760
to be, so this far-left
column, and all of these other

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.500
spend metrics, if we
know about the user.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.030
So we've got the mean of
all your previous spends.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.780
We've got the median,
the mode, for people

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.000
who know what that is,
the max the lifetime

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.140
sum of all of them.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.910
And actually, the
one which correlated

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.910
the best, although it wasn't
like a winner by miles,

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.320
was the mean spend.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.730
So that's one of
the things which

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.220
you're going to be doing in the
short term to improve these.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.040
We're going to switch
away from max spend,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.415
and we're going to move on to
mean spend because we think

00:19:58.415 --> 00:20:02.060
that will be better at guessing
how much people want to spend.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.940
So we've talked about
the present in our games.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.910
Now we're going to have a
little look to the future.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.600
So the Rocket Age--
targeted bundles.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.862
So imagine that we've got
all these different bundles

00:20:14.862 --> 00:20:16.070
that you can buy in the game.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.061
So there's some for
$5, some for $1, $10.

00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:20.060
There's different types.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.266
I've got a battle
bundle, which will

00:20:21.266 --> 00:20:22.550
help me battle in the game.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.050
I'm might even build
a bundle, which

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.420
is good for building
stuff in the game, all

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.260
that kind of stuff.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.977
So what we'd like to
do, and we've actually

00:20:29.977 --> 00:20:31.560
started work on this
already, is we're

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.230
going to development
a machine learning

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.160
approach, where we look at
a user's purchase history.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.340
We'll run it through a
machine learning algorithm,

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.897
work out what price
fits them really well.

00:20:41.897 --> 00:20:43.730
And that's going to
narrow down what bundles

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:44.240
we're going to show them.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.800
So if you think you
want to spend $20,

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.008
you can chuck away the
twenties, the ones, the fives.

00:20:48.008 --> 00:20:50.540
There's now going to be a subset
of these $20 bundles which

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.460
we know that you want to buy.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.681
Then we look at the
different types, so something

00:20:54.681 --> 00:20:56.180
like a resource
bundle, where you're

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.440
buying currency in the game.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.860
If the player is
running low on currency,

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.240
they're probably going to
be more likely to buy that.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.760
With a battle bundle, if
you're running an event where

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.250
you need to battle
a load, they're

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.970
probably going to be
more likely to want that

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:08.886
at that point in time.

00:21:08.886 --> 00:21:11.390
So we're then going
to factor that in

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.612
as well in deciding
which bundle to show you.

00:21:13.612 --> 00:21:15.236
And we're going to
choose the one which

00:21:15.236 --> 00:21:17.570
we think you've got the
highest chance to buy relative

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:18.130
to its price.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.265
So if you got a 10% chance
of buying the $100 bundle,

00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:24.056
that's better than if
you've got 20% chance

00:21:24.056 --> 00:21:25.660
of buying the $20 bundle,
if that makes sense.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.700
So we're going to see you
the one we think we're

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.505
going to get the most revenue.

00:21:29.505 --> 00:21:30.912
So that's the plan with this.

00:21:33.382 --> 00:21:35.090
As I mentioned, we
started building this.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.490
We tried a few
different approaches.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.448
At the moment, we're
trying a nearest neighbors

00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:41.010
model, which is working pretty
well for getting the price.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.010
And we think that
this is really going

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.470
to take things to the
next level in terms

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.950
of how well the system works.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.554
One last thing
I'll add on this is

00:21:51.554 --> 00:21:53.720
that you should include a
random element when you're

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.971
deciding which bundle to show.

00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:56.845
I know that sounds a
bit weird because you're

00:21:56.845 --> 00:21:58.880
like, why put all this
effort into deciding

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.890
what price we're going to show
and which type's going to sell?

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.600
But sometimes you can
refer to a random element.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.520
The reason is I found with
using these types of systems

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.540
in the past, is
if you just leave

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.304
it completely to the
algorithm, sometimes

00:22:07.304 --> 00:22:08.720
it would just keep
showing the guy

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.344
the same bundle,
which is kind of weird

00:22:10.344 --> 00:22:12.550
and not a good
customer experience.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.080
So it's good to have a
random element, some kind

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.580
of random element,
just so there's

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.320
some variety and
freshness that still

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.130
comes into what you're rotating
and showing to the user.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.240
So that's the Rocket Age.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.949
And now I'm going to
hand over to Matteo,

00:22:26.949 --> 00:22:29.448
who's going to talk about some
of the Google tools which can

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:30.944
help you do this kind of stuff.

00:22:30.944 --> 00:22:36.872
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:36.872 --> 00:22:38.720
MATTEO VALLONE: So
that's hard to follow.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.250
That's really interesting stuff.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.850
And as you can see,
it's not easy stuff.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:44.950
So that's why I'm here.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.660
I'm just relaxing.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.160
You don't have to be
in the Rocket Age.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.370
you can start with
some simple tools.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.930
And hopefully the
tools that we build

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.450
will get you started not
at the Stone Age, but maybe

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.500
the Steam Age.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.390
So you already have a way
to target users and optimize

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:05.172
your LTV without having all
this technology and resources

00:23:05.172 --> 00:23:06.130
already invested in it.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.480
So let's start with the
first tool that I think

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.640
is very relevant
here when it comes

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.730
to optimizing your game
design and engaging

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.080
different types of users.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.840
This is the Time Series page
in your developer console.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.460
You get this as part of
Google Play Games Services.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.091
And what it does, it's
a very clear picture.

00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:27.590
Maybe clear is not the right
word, because at the beginning,

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.730
it looks a bit confusing.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.886
But it gives you a very
clear picture of what

00:23:31.886 --> 00:23:35.090
your-- how players
interact with your game.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.710
Every symbol here has a meaning.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.150
Every symbol is a
different action

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.720
that a user has
taken in your game.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.010
So one symbol represents
a purchase event.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.840
Another symbol
represents completing

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.790
a level or an achievement.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.710
And you see the
sequence of actions

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.300
that every user has taken.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.330
This is a sample of your users.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.930
It's up to 100.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.240
And you can see
how they interact.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.640
The first thing you
can do with this report

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.160
is see what action lead
to what matters to you.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.680
For example, what have
they done before they

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.300
made their first purchase?

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.702
Or what have they
done before churning?

00:24:10.702 --> 00:24:12.410
And so you can optimize
your game overall

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.730
and see if you have any issues.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.580
But where it becomes
even more powerful

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.370
and relevant to this talk
is that you can actually

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.075
filter this report by
different types of users.

00:24:22.075 --> 00:24:24.700
So, for example, users that have
made a purchase and users that

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.110
haven't made a purchase or
that have spent some amount,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.030
and users that have spent more.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.392
And you can start understanding
the differences, what really

00:24:32.392 --> 00:24:34.100
are the different
behaviors, what they're

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.890
looking for in your game,
depending on what type

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.020
of category of users they are.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.540
So it's a very good way
to get some insights

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.780
and design your game based
on what type of users

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.830
you have and not just
one size fits all.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.260
In similar reports,
these similar insights

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.660
you can get from the
Funnel Report, which

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.240
is also available in
Developer Console for free

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.850
if you integrate Google
Play Game Services.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.620
And again, we take
these database

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.450
and them signing in through
their Google account.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.050
So you should make it
easy for them to do that.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:07.940
And what it does,
it shows you how

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.180
users go through different steps
of a funnel that you create.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.240
So you can set any
event you want.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.250
It could be steps in a tutorial.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.130
It could levels in your game.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.840
It could be a series
of random events

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.480
that matter to you as a
sequence in your game.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.920
And you can see
how they progress

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.300
through each of these
steps and where they leave.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.460
So that is, actually,
again, very powerful

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:36.570
overall for your game to find
friction points and roadblocks

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.840
that you can improve
and get rid of.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.540
But again, this is
much more useful

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.120
when you start filtering it
by different types of users

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.207
because you can understand
what users have problems

00:25:50.207 --> 00:25:52.290
in your game and what types
of problems they have,

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.620
depending on which
group they belong to.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.880
As you see here,
it's highlighted,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.030
the different types of audiences
that you can filter for,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:06.210
in this case, if they spent less
than $3, spent more than $10,

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:07.590
they haven't spent at all.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:11.290
And you can see what are the
key differences between them.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:18.080
So this is already on
itself a quite impactful way

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.770
to rethink your game.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.510
This is an example
from Max Games,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:26.280
who recently used this report to
improve the game "Stick Wars--

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.270
Legacy."

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.150
And they reduced churn
in level 6 by 40%

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.220
just by using these insights.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.500
But again, the
important thing here

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.410
is that these tools give
you a very simple way

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.820
to understand what are the
differences in your users, what

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.010
are they looking
for, and what are

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.870
the most important
types of users you

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.400
want to optimize your game for.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.620
So you can apply
the key principles

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.470
that Adam talked about, what are
the big things that they want

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.560
to look for and
how can we please

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.980
as many users as possible,
keeping one game and one on one

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.120
experience.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.680
But when it comes
to target them,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.410
you need much more
detailed information

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.260
about every user and not
just a sample of users.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.890
And that's where Players
Stats API comes into play.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.560
You can integrate
this for free again,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.960
and it's quite simple
I've been told.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.120
And you get a lot of
information about your users

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.610
not only basic stats
that you normally

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:27.870
expect from these kind of APIs,
like session, and suspense

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:32.280
percentile, and average session
length, and number of sessions,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.190
or days since last played,
all very important information

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.400
to understand what type
of user that user is,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.930
but also you get
predictive analytics.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.190
This is super cool.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.000
This is probability from zero
to one for the user to spend

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.200
and the probability from
zero to one to churn.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.710
We even recently introduced
two more granular metrics,

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.690
same predictive analytics,
so the probability

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.840
to become a high spender and
to spends in the next 28 days.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.310
And what is really
cool about this

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.500
is that this
information is not just

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.430
calculated based on the behavior
of your players in your game,

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.580
but your players on other games.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.050
So you get the power of
what our machine learning

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:21.262
and the information that
we get by them signing in

00:28:21.262 --> 00:28:26.230
in all these games, and you can
use it to better target them.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.630
What I mean by
better target them

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.840
is very clear in
this simple example,

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.320
but I think it's very powerful.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.500
This is Invent Venture.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.380
And they use the
Player Stats API

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.790
to make sure that as they grew
their rewarded ads revenues.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.170
They didn't cannibalize their
in-app purchase revenues.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.650
So what they did is that
they showed reward ads only

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.590
to the users that were
less likely to spend,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.570
and they didn't show
them to the users that

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.910
were actually likely to spend.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:03.630
So in a way, they tried to
monetize different users

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.920
based on their purchase
behavior and their propensity

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.520
to spend, again, without having
to do much on the analytics

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.920
side because they just got an
input from the Player Stats

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.780
API.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.460
And that input
was based not only

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.310
on those players'
behavior in their game,

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.290
but also on all the
other games that they've

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.180
played that add Google
Play Games Services.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.170
But that's just an example.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.180
You got some ideas
from Fred's talk

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.120
on how you can actually start
thinking about different types

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.720
of users and target them.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.430
Here are some other ideas
just how to use this data.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.830
You can, for example,
target high session length

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:49.440
and frequency, so basically the
most avid players on your game

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.100
with a reward.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.320
And you can get
information about them,

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.410
again, through the
Player Stats API.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.100
You can also target users
of that high risk of churn

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.430
with some time-limited
special item

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.740
that they can get if they
get back to your game

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.786
as soon as possible.

00:30:05.786 --> 00:30:07.410
You can reach them
with a notification.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.990
You know who they are because
they have a high probability

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.050
to churn, and you get that
from the Player Stats API.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.660
You can then target
users that are

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.060
more likely to spend
with a special offer just

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.960
to make sure that you
convert them and customize

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.210
that bundle or that
offer to be a bigger one,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.910
make a bigger value
with a higher price

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.360
point for the ones that are
likely to become high spenders.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.890
So you get the idea.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.770
Again, most of the ideas
will come from Fred's part

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.760
of the presentation.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.272
But now you have
the tools to start

00:30:38.272 --> 00:30:40.230
without having to do much
in terms of analytics

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.930
and understanding users.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.850
So the sky's the limit here.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:49.170
But I want to leave you with
the last very basic concept

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.710
that I saw many developers, even
the ones that are getting very

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.580
advanced in this,
sometimes they oversee this

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.550
and forget about it.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.050
The biggest difference
between users

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.660
is still where they're based.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.670
Country matters a lot.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.520
I know it sounds
intuitive, but sometimes

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.770
with machine learning
and analytics and all

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.230
that we forget about the basics.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.380
And especially when
it comes to pricing,

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.090
you need to make sure
that your price is

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.240
relevant for the country
where the user is based.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.780
And if you do A/B
testing for your pricing,

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.260
you should do it
at country level.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.860
We think that this is a very
important part of monetizing,

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.820
and that's why we've
been also addressing

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.310
this with introducing
new minimum prices

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.090
for some currencies
and some markets that

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:42.720
have different higher
prices, essentially to say,

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.820
and different purchasing power.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.970
And these are some
of the big ones.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.690
In total, we introduced
this for 12 countries,

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.450
both in EMEA and Asia.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.820
So check it out in
the Developer Console.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.640
You have access now
to a much lower price

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.140
that you can use
in those markets

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.420
where conversion
is more difficult,

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.200
but you can still
extrapolate value from that.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.160
So thank you very much.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.310
