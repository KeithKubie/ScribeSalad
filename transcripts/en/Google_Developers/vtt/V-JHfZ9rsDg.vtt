SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAN:
Good morning.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.900
Thank you for joining
us today to celebrate

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.330
International Women's Day.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.090
This is a global
event, so I want

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.890
to encourage you
throughout the day

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.094
to use the social media
to express your voice.

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:00.260
Please use #womentechmakers.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.090
I'm super excited to
be part of this event.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.210
I'm here because
like many of you,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.820
I have a degree in
computer science--

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.340
a master's in computer
science from the University

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.600
of Wisconsin, Madison and a
bachelor's from Mount Holyoke

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.590
College.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.540
Also I've been in the
industry for 15 years

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.070
since I graduated and one of
the senior women engineers

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.660
in YouTube engineering.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.670
And I love being in technology.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.530
This is not always the case.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.760
Many women drop out
technology in school

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.560
or even after they
start their career.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.860
Nearly 50% of women
within the first 10 years

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.880
of their technical career either
switch professions or quit.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.980
I have not, and I'm confident
each and every one of you

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.410
after listening to the
great lineup of speakers

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.530
we have today and the events we
have planned will not either.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.180
As technologists and thinkers,
we solve everyday problems.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.600
And we come up with innovative
ways to make things happen.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.890
Women make up 51% of
the world's population.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.630
Yet according to the
Department of Commerce,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.410
women make up only 27% of
all computer science jobs

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.930
in the US.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.800
And these numbers are worse when
it comes to leadership roles.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:02.740
Women are part of 14% of Fortune
500 executive committees,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.360
17% of Congress, and
11% of founder or CEO

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.670
positions in venture
backed US firms.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.010
The number of women
studying computer science

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.760
is on the decline.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.420
It's nearly 8% below where
we were nearly 10 years ago.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.600
And this is important.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.400
It's important to note
and recognize this

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.040
because time and time again we
have seen that diverse and well

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.010
balanced teams result in more
effective decision making

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.940
and in better product designs.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.350
According to McKinsey,
companies which

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.580
have a higher proportion of
women in top management roles

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.890
result in higher
returns on investment

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.180
and higher earnings
than average.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.880
Catalyst found
out that companies

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.340
which have at least
three women as part

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.640
of their board of
directors have on average

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.160
10% return on investment,
compared to only 6.2%

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.780
otherwise.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.040
Universities and companies
are recognizing this

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.070
and doing their part
to help bridge the gap.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.260
For instance, Google provides
a great work environment

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.660
for women and has strong women
leaders to serve as role models

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.990
within the company, many of whom
you'll be hearing from today.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.770
The Women at Google
network of over 5,000

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.200
women from 23 countries
is very active.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.940
And Google helps
organize events like this

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.245
to raise gender awareness.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.370
As part of our commitment
to advancing computing

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.290
and technology at all levels, we
have education and scholarship

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.390
programs for aspiring
computer scientists.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.360
Our Generation
Google Scholarships

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.040
are aimed at currently
enrolled high school

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.770
seniors, undergraduates,
and graduates

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.430
who are planning to be
full-time enrolled students

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.678
in universities in
the US or Canada.

00:06:36.678 --> 00:06:40.370
The Anita Borg
Scholarship is for women

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.110
across the world
who are pursuing

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.370
a degree in computer science.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.820
And the Women on
the Web program,

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.370
which started out as a
community based initiative

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.070
to encourage more
women participation

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.550
in Google for
Business groups, aimed

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.600
at increasing the number
of women entrepreneurs

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.440
in technology and
enabling women to succeed

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.620
by leveraging the
power of the internet

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.170
early on in their start-ups.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.410
This program that
started out in India

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.960
has now expanded to
Latin America, Africa,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.510
Southeast Asia, and
the Middle East.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.130
And it focuses on encouraging
women and empowering them

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.240
in emerging markets.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.340
From the very beginning,
Google's mission, goal,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.980
and mantra has been focus on the
user and all else will follow.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.090
It turns out our
users are 50% women,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.074
speak different
languages, and come

00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:52.490
from different
parts of the world.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.790
And in order to better
understand this diverse user

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.470
pace and build great products
and services for them,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.230
we need our teams
to be diverse too.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.700
So Google puts in
a lot of effort

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.090
to ensuring that we have
an all inclusive workplace,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:18.230
and that we reflect
what our users are,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.030
so that we can build out
better products and services.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.760
We also are proactively
looking at ways

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.210
in which we can make
the environment better

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.790
and empower women further.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.259
For instance, recently our focus
has been on unconscious bias.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.490
Research has shown
that when we are

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.789
aware of our
unconscious bias, we

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.390
can make more
objective decisions

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.970
and have better discussions.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.640
So over 20,000 Googlers
and 80% people managers

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.500
have been engaging
in workshops focused

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.400
on understanding the science
of how the mind works

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.650
to bring together
and have dialogues

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.740
across the company about
the unconscious bias

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.690
and the effect it has on how
we perceive others, how we

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.070
interact with our coworkers,
our clients, and the business

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.010
as a whole.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.590
Efforts like this allow us to
make ourselves into a better

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.655
company and become a better
workplace and environment.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.050
In honor of International
Women's Day,

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.750
Google offices
all over the world

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.940
have been hosting
events like this.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.150
I was honored to be a speaker
at an International Women's Day

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.310
event in Paris just
this past Wednesday

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.530
to around 200 plus attendees.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.830
It is just invigorating
and very energizing

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.130
to see and hear people's
aspirations and dreams

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.340
in those attendees and also
to hear stories from them

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.660
on how the number of
women in computer science

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.490
has been increasing in local
colleges and universities.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.680
So these efforts that we
are doing is paying off.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.890
In fact recently when I was
getting ready for these talks,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.650
I found out that in 2014 for
the first time in the history

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.060
of University of
California, Berkeley,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.480
an introductory
computer science class

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.130
has more women
enrolled than men.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:37.240
And the slight positive trend
is significant for women

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.090
in computer science and
women in technology.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.470
So we have a great
agenda planned for you

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.670
with amazing
speakers, some of whom

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.780
I have the honor of
working closely with.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.070
And I'm confident by hearing
the inspiring talks from them,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.440
by engaging and networking
with all the different women

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.520
engineers who are
here at the event.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.460
All right.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.470
To get started with
the day, I want

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.410
to introduce you to our
first keynote speaker,

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.780
the VP of Technology from
Nest Labs, Yoky Matsuoka.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.680
A little bit of bio about her.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.460
Prior to joining Nest, she was
Google's Head of Innovation

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.110
and a professor of
computer science

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.640
at University of Washington.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.730
She got her master's and
PhD in computer science

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.730
and electrical
engineering from MIT

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.510
and received the MacArthur
Genius Award for her work

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.750
in robotics and neuroscience.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.960
So let's welcome
Yoky to the stage.

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:45.603
YOKY MATSUOKA: Thanks.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.910
Well, good morning.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.245
ANNOUNCER: Good morning.

00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:55.120
YOKY MATSUOKA: Great.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.420
Well, thanks for being here.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.360
I am incredibly excited to be
here in front of so many women.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.500
This doesn't happen very often,
as you all know about that.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.480
I'm really excited.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.370
It's kind of interesting
to go through thinking

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.790
about-- what can I
talk about today?

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.962
And I looked at the title
today saying Women Techmakers.

00:12:15.962 --> 00:12:17.420
And I realized that
I didn't really

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.690
start out as a techmaker.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.340
I had many different
chapters, sometimes low.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.890
Sometimes I wanted to quit.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.510
I wanted to go through all
of those because some of you

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.570
might be thinking
something to do,

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.210
something to dramatically
change your life.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.210
I've gone through a lot.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.700
Here we go.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.780
Just like all of you
and 50% of people

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.120
who live on Earth are
supposed to be women,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.700
we are asked as
we grow up-- what

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.490
do you want to be
when you grow up?

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.500
Right?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.890
Somehow most of us didn't say
we just want to stay at home.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.860
I don't know why, but
that's what a lot of women

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.880
end up doing.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.770
I thought really hard
about it as a kid.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.811
I didn't even understand
what that question meant

00:13:09.811 --> 00:13:12.270
for a long time, but
I eventually found it.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.910
And it was this.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.270
I wanted to be a tennis player.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.830
I really loved it.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.570
I played four to six hours,
six to seven days a week,

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.340
and really trained for it.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.780
I went to Wimbledon
Junior tournaments.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.940
This was the funnest thing ever.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.880
So I didn't know
anything else, but this

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.820
is a picture taken by a
newspaper person in college.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.445
And if you look at
it really carefully,

00:13:38.445 --> 00:13:41.280
I'm wrapped around in a mummy
style in all different body

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.025
parts.

00:13:42.025 --> 00:13:43.999
It turns out my
body didn't keep up

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:46.290
with what I thought I wanted
to be whenever I was asked

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.800
the question of what you
want to do when you grow up.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.130
So as my body started
to fall apart,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.850
I wasn't sure what
to do with myself.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.290
I wasn't going to be Monica
Seles or somebody who's

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.010
absolutely at the
top of the world.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.130
Then I started to look
at other parts of my

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.552
what you want to do
when you grow up.

00:14:02.552 --> 00:14:04.510
And I thought, well maybe
I can do engineering.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.760
That could be exciting.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.990
I can build a robot.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.920
I don't know anything
about it, but maybe I

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.700
can build a robot that
can play tennis with me.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.600
Here it is.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.259
I drew a picture
of my tennis buddy

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:18.550
that could play tennis with me.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.430
And I imagined buttons and
everything on the chest.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.890
The days that I
was feeling good,

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.720
maybe I can challenge
myself-- tune the knobs

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.680
and then have really
good competition.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.830
And the days that I'm
feeling a little bit down,

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.600
maybe I can crank it down,
so I can beat the hell out

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.530
of this thing.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.040
So that's sort of
the idea that I had.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.250
And I got into it.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.870
I went to a lab when I was
an undergrad at Berkeley

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.080
and said, hey, can
I build a robot?

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.730
And the professor
didn't laugh at me

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.580
and took me on and
built the robotic legs.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.720
And I was crazy enough
to even go to grad school

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.124
and build this thing at MIT.

00:14:53.124 --> 00:14:54.290
I don't take all the credit.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.490
There were a lot of grad
students working on it.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.220
But something that I
was fascinated with

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.580
was robotic hands.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.150
How does it actually even
learn for us to do this?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.120
It's really amazing.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.870
We just don't even
think about it anymore,

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.450
but the brain is doing
something to send that signal so

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.329
that we can pinch.

00:15:09.329 --> 00:15:09.870
We can grasp.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.430
We sometimes don't
even look at it,

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.290
and we can do amazing things.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.410
So that's what I
was building, but I

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.520
felt like I ran
into a wall one day.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.840
I couldn't quite
figure out what to do.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.310
And I thought, aha.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.390
Artificial intelligence
is not solved

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.610
because we don't
understand the human brain.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.457
So I walked across the campus
and I went to neurosciences

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:32.290
and said, please take
me on because I really

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.200
need to understand
how the brain works.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.060
And that's what I ended
up doing for my PhD.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.500
After all of that--
tennis player robot,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.850
neuroscience-- I
thought, OK now I

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.330
have all the tools I need
to build this tennis buddy.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.540
But something funny happened.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.280
I kind of started
reflecting-- what

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.230
do I want to do when I grow up?

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.850
And following this
tennis passion

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.830
didn't quite get to where
I wanted to get to anymore.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.430
What I wanted to do by then
was to somehow really touch

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.682
different people in the world.

00:16:05.682 --> 00:16:06.890
A lot of women feel this way.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.540
Right?

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.169
Some inner woman in me came and
said, I want to help people.

00:16:11.169 --> 00:16:13.335
There are lots of people
with neurological disorders

00:16:13.335 --> 00:16:15.980
and physical disabilities
who could benefit

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.030
from things I've learned so far.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.980
So that's what I ended up doing
as a professor for a decade,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.970
building things like this.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.600
This is a robotic
prosthetic device

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.540
that is controlled
by human b signal.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.100
So whatever way we
can get the signals--

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.360
it doesn't have to be invasive
in a chip in the brain.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.550
Sometimes it is.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.330
And then we use that
signal to control

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.440
these sophisticated robotic
devices for those people who

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.130
lost their limbs.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.270
So this was my research area.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.870
And when I was in
academia, I really

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.930
wanted to push the
envelope of 30 years

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.020
down the line and the science.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.660
What kind of dexterous
movements can we really do?

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.050
What's the secret sauce that
we have that robots are somehow

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.900
still unable to do?

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.839
But at the same time,
I have this tickle

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:09.480
at all time which was really
about how can we do something

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.980
for people today?

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.460
Is there a consumer
product end of this?

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.260
So I worked with a company
called Touch Bionics.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.910
They deliver real robotic hands.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.810
Now thousands of people are
wearing this prosthetic hand

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.000
that is controlled
by brain signal that

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.089
eventually reach the muscles.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.690
And then that is
taken from the skin

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.120
and then is amplified to
control that prosthetic hand.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.270
I was really trying to
help them to decode it,

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.810
so that it can not only do open
and close-- which is mostly

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.760
the standard of a
prosthetic device--

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.890
but now be able to do
maybe a pinching movement

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:43.950
when it's appropriate.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.280
How do we decide
pinching versus grasping?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.350
What are the situations?

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.940
What are the
physiological movements?

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.320
What are the brain signals
that are different when humans

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.520
are thinking about
making those motions.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.450
So that's the kind of
things that I started to do.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.610
But this whole idea of the
brain and machine interface

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:06.020
doesn't have to be about
wearable devices or body parts

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.070
replacement.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.380
This is a picture of a robotic
device that can actually

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.360
reside completely
outside of your body.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.710
There are a lot of
population of people--

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.530
people who had strokes, people
who have cerebral palsy,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.020
people who have Parkinson's--
whose movements are getting

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.870
a little slower or just had an
injury and they need to recover

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.070
from it.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.340
They have some
injuries in the brain,

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:33.010
and by having those people come
in and just touch the robot,

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.630
through that contact,
we built the device

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.080
that can actually start to
understand what their brain's

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.920
recovery state might be.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.110
So anything from-- they're
not paying attention today.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.860
There's no use in doing this.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.720
They are getting tired.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.819
Maybe this is not good.

00:18:48.819 --> 00:18:50.110
They are really getting better.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.910
Let's challenge them a
little more-- to there's

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.340
a certain set of muscles
that are activating or not

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.180
activating in the right way.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.420
So that's the kind of
things that is also

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.120
part of this interaction
of human and machine.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.920
And the whole idea is about
having the machine side

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.520
understanding enough
about the human

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.660
so that it can build
a whole human together

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.750
with the help of technology.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.280
Then again I got a little itch
of getting out of the lab,

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.650
getting into people's homes.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.694
I started a company,
incredibly unsuccessfully,

00:19:24.694 --> 00:19:26.360
trying to build this
robotic device that

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.609
can sit in people's homes.

00:19:27.609 --> 00:19:29.150
I started to realize
those people who

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.700
need those devices can't
even come to the lab

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.310
because they're older.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.250
They can't move, so they have
to ask their son or daughter

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.920
to come and take a day
off to go to the hospital.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.150
And it was a big mess.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.350
I said, aha,
business opportunity.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.710
This is the way to go.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.590
So I tried to build
a robotic device that

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.540
could sit in the lab.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.400
Technology was
totally all right,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.850
but boy there are a lot of
other issues in executing

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.210
this to become a
consumer product.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.400
I learned through
this that I want

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.840
to get into people's homes.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.310
I'm really excited
to provide solutions

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.260
for people in the house.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.830
And what can I do to do this?

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.870
So this is sort of lots and lots
of different parts of my life.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.510
Through tennis to
my professor life,

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.900
I always came to this picture.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.100
What is that thing that
I always come back to?

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:23.620
It really is to me about
the intersection of machine

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.830
and human, and
both are learning.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.500
And because technology comes
in and learns how humans work,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.040
it allows humans to be whole.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.000
And I did this, as I said, in
more of the university domain.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.340
I built the center called the
Center of Sensorimotor Neural

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.250
Engineering.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.252
This is an effort
by over 100 faculty

00:20:45.252 --> 00:20:49.510
and over 300 students
across the country.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.816
The hub is in Seattle.

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.690
They're receiving tens
of millions of dollars

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.090
to do the research-- anywhere
from building the chip that

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.810
can go in a brain without really
harming people all the way

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.210
to animal studies, human
studies, robotic device

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.940
building.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.740
And then collaborating
all of that

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.150
together, so that it can spin
off companies to effect people.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.830
So that was a great effort.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.480
Another thing that I
built was a nonprofit.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.910
So this is a nonprofit
called YokyWorks.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:21.400
Throughout being
visible in this world,

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.480
I started to get emails
from people who said,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.620
well my son just got
in a car accident

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.409
and just lost all the
sensation from his hand.

00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:32.200
Is there anything you
can do because you're

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.000
doing research in this area?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.530
And I thought, there
are ways that maybe I

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.130
can help those people.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.950
And a lot of younger women,
even in junior high school,

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.760
they start to get
interested in solving

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.760
these problems in some way.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.890
So I got together a whole bunch
of volunteers, aged anywhere

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:56.590
from 12 to 60, doing finance to
management to engineering work

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.760
to physical therapy
as a team to solve

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.750
specific problems
for specific people.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.604
So this is actually
an incredibly place.

00:22:04.604 --> 00:22:06.520
And if you're interested
in efforts like that,

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.120
please do let me know
afterwards as well.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.360
Then on to-- of course you're
here sitting at Google.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.430
I'm here at Google now.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.900
I just want to how you about
how this yin-yang fits into what

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.600
I'm working on now
at Google and Nest.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.900
This is a picture of a
nice home where I said,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.280
I'd love to get in and do
nice things for people.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.650
This is a family who want
to achieve a lot of things.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.780
What are the things that
we can do with technology

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.230
that I can help with?

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.870
So I teamed up with the
co-founders of Nest-- Tony

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.040
Fadell, who was a
godfather of iPod,

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.620
and my student, Matt Rogers
from Carnegie Mellon,

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.260
who is also co-founder
of Nest, who

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.300
was kind of the key engineer for
building the iPod and iPhone.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.500
And they know how to
build beautiful things.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.910
I knew how to work with
people to make devices

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.730
to learn to enhance
what people can do.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.830
So we really became a
company that reinvents things

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.540
in people's homes--
important things,

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.260
essential even, but
pretty much ignored.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.420
They don't need to be ugly
or dumb, so ours aren't.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.436
Ours think, and they learn.

00:23:20.436 --> 00:23:21.810
And that's why
they're beautiful.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.740
So this is exactly
what we're after.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.870
We started off
with a thermostat.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.200
And this is certainly
pretty to look at.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.240
But the word thermostat--
even the first time

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.990
I heard from Tony and
Matt thermostat-- I said,

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.350
what, that dusty, yucky thing?

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.850
What are you talking about?

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.797
But I want you to watch
this video for a second.

00:23:47.797 --> 00:23:51.789
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:55.282
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.830
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.790
Thanks.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.790
You know what's interesting?

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.670
As we started off
saying thermostat,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.380
what I really
didn't know is that

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:16.750
in homes, the thermostat
that the human touches spends

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:21.350
about 44% of the US
residential energy bill.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.220
That's really, really big.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.432
We worry about-- oh,
I forgot to turn off

00:25:25.432 --> 00:25:26.390
the light in the house.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.530
Well, that's 11%.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.240
This fridge is making this
crazy, growling noise.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.660
Maybe I should set the
temperature little bit lower.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.310
That's 9%.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.190
This heating and cooling is 44%.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.050
It is a giant problem.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.220
And if we can do
this in a smart way--

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.780
because whenever I ask people,
do you want to save energy?

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.640
Everybody says yes.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.370
But somehow we might not
be doing the right thing.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.920
So why can't technology come
into the picture and help

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.160
people achieve who
they want to be?

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.950
So that's exactly what we do.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:01.800
And then throughout our
process, we can do updates.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.020
We released this
device over two years

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.890
ago now with features such as
Auto-Schedule and Auto-Away.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.350
Auto-Schedule is all
about understanding

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.340
when people around,
when people are not,

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.410
what temperature people
like, and come up

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:20.050
with the temperature profile
throughout the week that

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.530
saves energy for you as
well as to keep comfort.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.790
But people have different
schedules every week,

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.050
so having a rigid
schedule doesn't work.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.460
Not only does the Auto-Schedule
keep learning over time,

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.502
but also some
special night-- you

00:26:33.502 --> 00:26:35.210
go out for poker night
on Wednesday night

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.830
with your buddies--
Auto-Away kicks in.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.127
It says, ooh, unusual.

00:26:39.127 --> 00:26:39.960
I don't see anybody.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.810
I think we should
just save more energy.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.450
All of that together is working
well along with Nest Leaf.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.240
The leaf that you
saw on the video

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.580
encourages people to
actually try to see the leaf.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.780
It's like mini-gaming,
but it's not

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.750
in your face kind of gaming.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.710
It turns out something
like-- I can't remember

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.070
the exact number-- but something
like over 80% of people

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.380
check to see if they
have a leaf daily

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.170
on their app on their phone.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.030
So it's something
that just makes

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.506
you feel like I'm saving energy.

00:27:07.506 --> 00:27:09.130
Oh no, I should turn
a little bit more.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.360
Oh yeah, a see it.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:10.860
Great.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.420
I even saw texts going
across from friends saying,

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.060
I have one more leaf than
you this month, ha ha.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.740
So it's kind of a good thing.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.680
But you know what?

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.650
As we went in, and as we started
to get more data about how

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.870
the houses worked and how
the HVAC systems worked,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.209
we realized that the
opportunity is really big.

00:27:31.209 --> 00:27:33.250
There's a human behavior
aspect, but there's also

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.860
learning about people homes.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.004
So we released a
feature called Airwave.

00:27:38.004 --> 00:27:39.420
We noticed that
air conditioners--

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.919
and if we think
about it, maybe it's

00:27:40.919 --> 00:27:43.740
obvious-- the air conditioner
blows really cold air.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.130
And if the fan
and the compressor

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:47.975
both stop at the same
time, the cold air

00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:50.760
that's stuck in
the duct is wasted.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.500
So we found out through
an intelligent way

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.541
how long for each home to keep
blowing the air a little bit

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:57.040
longer.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.050
Sometimes it's
for eight minutes.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.600
And we actually end up using
much less air conditioner time,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.120
so therefore less energy
to cool people's homes.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.030
Also we kept learning
more and more.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.884
And we not only save energy,
but we bring comfort.

00:28:13.884 --> 00:28:15.300
When people say
they want it to be

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.456
70 degrees at 7:00
in the morning,

00:28:17.456 --> 00:28:19.330
we have this thing called
Early-On especially

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.090
for cold places.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.910
Maybe all of us don't
really appreciate

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.560
it living here as much.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.690
When a lot of people
wake up at 7:00,

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:26.790
they just want to be warm.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.140
Otherwise it's really
difficult to get of the bed.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.650
We have a feature
called Early-On.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.430
Again, we look at the
thermal profile of the home,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.500
know exactly how early
to turn on the heating.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.280
So by the time you
get out of the bed,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.230
it's at the temperature
that you like.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.570
So there's a lot of geeky stuff
inside this beautiful device

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.030
that we keep delivering
over and over.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.150
And even things called Sun
Block-- we saw in data one day

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.350
and said, wait a second.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.820
What's this crazy
spike of temperature

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.110
that just happens for 30
minutes in the morning?

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.590
And because the thermostat
thinks it's so hot,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.110
it was preventing
heating to kick in.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.490
Well of course when
the sun is directly

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.240
hitting that thing
on a wall, it just

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.500
doesn't know really how warm
or cool it is in a room.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.230
We found a way, again,
to counteract that.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.180
Therefore it knows the
real room temperature,

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.720
and the heating can kick in.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.300
So you can imagine, we
keep finding fun things

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.920
in the data that allow us
iterate over and over to learn

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.580
about people and learn about
houses-- to do the right thing.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.130
So what's interesting is that
we originally only sold it

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.550
in the US, but somehow people
managed to buy it and then

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.239
install it in their
own countries.

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.280
This number actually might
be out of date by now,

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.720
but quite a lot of people
installed it everywhere

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.580
in the world.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.600
Also people started to say
things that are weird like,

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.090
I love my thermostat.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.250
I mean, come on.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.180
Who would have said that before?

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.880
It's kind of nice to hear that.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.660
Also a lot of people realized
that bills are actually

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.986
getting smaller and smaller.

00:29:56.986 --> 00:29:58.860
I even got a text from
one of my best friends

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.460
in Boston three days ago
saying, thank you Nest.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.050
And then it just had a
snapshot of their bill.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.020
And those are the things that
really make me smile every day.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.430
Overall we are everywhere.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:19.600
You can buy this from Amazon,
Best Buy, Lowe's, Home Depot--

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.727
if you're a Google
employee get a 25 discount.

00:30:22.727 --> 00:30:24.310
Stuff like that, so
it's really great.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.710
We have saved over-- this
is kind of funny to read--

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.330
either one billion
kilowatt hours,

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.051
one million megawatt hours,
or one terawatt hours.

00:30:37.051 --> 00:30:38.550
It's sort of a funny
thing to count.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.320
But somehow energy folks like
to count it in kilowatt hours,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.720
so we go by one
billion kilowatt hours.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.290
And that's how much,
as of last September,

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.950
that Nest devices
together have saved.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:54.680
And that's about
equivalent to the energy

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.440
that Hoover Dam produces
in three months.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.680
That's pretty good.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.060
So as you can see, we are moving
toward helping people achieve

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.770
who they want to be through
just a thing called thermostat.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:13.490
But--

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:18.030
[ALARM]

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.660
Oh jeez.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.201
What is that?

00:31:19.201 --> 00:31:21.040
Where did it come from?

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.900
So we live with this device.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.400
Right?

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.710
You've experienced
this at 3:00 AM.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.200
And you go, oh come on, honey.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.430
Wake up and figure
out where that is.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.730
And take that damn
thing off the wall.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.370
Actually it's funny because
it happened to me last night,

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.190
but I was too tired
to even say honey.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.750
It wakes me up every
five minutes, but OK.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.430
So that tells you that I didn't
have my Nest installed yet.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:49.220
So it turns out people do worry
about fire and carbon monoxide

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.040
in the house.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.180
This is one of the big things
that people worry about.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.380
But even though
you worry about it,

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.920
you install this thing
which is annoying.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.640
You hate it.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.815
It's ugly.

00:32:01.815 --> 00:32:03.360
There are constant false alarms.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.850
You take a shower, and it rings.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.224
And you cook, and it doesn't
know that you have visitors.

00:32:07.224 --> 00:32:08.360
And it just goes off.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.555
So why isn't it done right?

00:32:10.555 --> 00:32:15.562
It seems like a ripe
opportunity for Nest to look at.

00:32:15.562 --> 00:32:16.270
Here's one thing.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.740
So if you look at all the
homes that burned down,

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.740
73% of the homes actually
had either missing, dead,

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.339
or disconnected batteries.

00:32:24.339 --> 00:32:25.130
That's what you do.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.330
Right?

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.330
If you get this annoyed,
you remove the battery,

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.020
or you take it off the wall.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.760
And then that feels good.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.371
It's like, OK, problem solved.

00:32:32.371 --> 00:32:32.870
Well, no.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.880
The problem is not solved.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.170
So we introduced Nest
Protect last year.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.565
And watch this video again.

00:32:39.565 --> 00:32:43.030
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.080
-Heads up.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.696
There's smoke in
the dining room.

00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:24.190
Smoke alarm hushed.

00:33:27.676 --> 00:33:28.672
Heads up.

00:33:28.672 --> 00:33:30.664
There's smoke in the bedroom.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:52.078
Emergency, there's smoke
in the living room.

00:34:13.492 --> 00:34:14.714
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:14.714 --> 00:34:17.130
YOKY MATSUOKA: It almost makes
me cry every time I see it.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.174
I don't know what it is.

00:34:19.174 --> 00:34:20.548
Our marketing
people are awesome.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.310
But let me just go
over some of the things

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.419
that we did overcome.

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:29.710
SMOKE DETECTOR VOICE: Heads up.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.850
There's smoke in
the living room.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.859
The alarm may sound.

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:35.400
YOKY MATSUOKA: Don't
you hate it when

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.909
the alarm is the first
thing that spears your ears?

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.110
So we warn you ahead of time.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.929
And how long we warn
you ahead of time

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.399
depends on the
profile of the smoke.

00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:47.690
SMOKE DETECTOR VOICE: Heads up.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.735
There's smoke in
the living room.

00:34:49.735 --> 00:34:51.630
The alarm may sound.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.402
Smoke alarm hushed
in the living room.

00:34:54.402 --> 00:34:56.110
YOKY MATSUOKA: Another
thing that we also

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:00.870
hate is to look for the
ladder, jump up, find a stick.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:04.395
We got rid of that with
the gesture recognition.

00:35:04.395 --> 00:35:06.770
SMOKE DETECTOR VOICE: There's
carbon monoxide in the den.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.550
There's carbon
monoxide in the den.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.530
There's carbon
monoxide in the den.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.890
YOKY MATSUOKA: And we
tell you which room it is.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.620
And then we are
interconnected, so you

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.430
can hear it from anywhere when
the dangerous situation is

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:19.346
going on.

00:35:19.346 --> 00:35:22.002
SMOKE DETECTOR VOICE: Smoke
is clearing in the kitchen.

00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:23.710
YOKY MATSUOKA: This
is a really good one.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.310
I love this because you know
that feeling of the hair

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.940
standing in your
back feeling like,

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.230
is it going to go off again?

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.580
I got rid of the bacon, but
is it going to go off again?

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.380
Well we got rid of that too.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.170
So again, looking
at the smoke profile

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.850
from many different
situations, we

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.170
found a good time to
basically tell you,

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.655
you know what, it's
going to be OK.

00:35:42.655 --> 00:35:44.030
You don't have to
worry that it's

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.470
going to go off for a while.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.070
So we also tell you that.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.300
Another thing you think
about-- that thing

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.340
you have on your ceiling-- and
say, is this really working?

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.110
I have no idea.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.530
We try to remove that
feeling completely.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.590
Some of the sensors are being
checked every 40 seconds.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.020
And we actually
specifically make

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.610
sure that you know about
this through the app.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.980
So whenever you're in doubt--
is that thing working?

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.590
You can go and
then you can indeed

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.180
see green circles, yellow
circles, or gray circles

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.780
depending on the status.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.690
As well as at night
time, every time you

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:25.964
switch a room light off, we
try to show a status light.

00:36:25.964 --> 00:36:26.880
This is a really nice.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.830
You don't have to
check on the app.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.140
Every night you turn off
the light, and you look up.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.600
And you say, OK, great.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.480
All the sensor checks throughout
the day have all worked out.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.105
And then when it's
orange, you actually

00:36:36.105 --> 00:36:37.280
walk up and wave again.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.900
And it tells you the status of
exactly what might be wrong,

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.500
including low battery status.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.820
And finally-- something we
didn't think we would love,

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.620
but that ones I have my house
I absolutely love-- it sort of

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.000
acts as a path light.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.160
It's sitting there.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.140
And why not?

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.020
It's in very perfect opportunity
places-- entrance to the bed

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.780
room, close to the
bathroom, in the kitchen.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.940
When I want to go and
get water at night time,

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.820
I used to just go in and
sort of go with the touches.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:09.070
Now I can actually see things.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.770
It's really nice.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.640
Finally-- this is something
from the machine learning

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.110
perspective that I actually
love-- now we can actually

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.800
get help for the thermostat
through the smoke detector.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.530
For example, now because there
are other smoke detectors

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:31.320
in the house that can also
see your general house status,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.940
we can do Auto-Away which is
to know when to go and start

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.580
saving energy much better.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.160
So it's not just
from one location

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.330
where the thermostat is.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.330
We can understand the whole
house situation better.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.970
As well as when that
carbon monoxide alarm

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.560
is going on the
Nest Protect side--

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.260
if the heating is
turned on and running,

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.337
that's over 50% of the cause
of the carbon monoxide.

00:37:55.337 --> 00:37:57.670
We can communicate that and
turn off for you right away.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.810
You can see the beginnings of
the benefits of having multiple

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.982
of those in your house
and start to understand

00:38:05.982 --> 00:38:06.940
what might be going on.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.870
As you can see, we are walking
toward this beautiful home

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.760
where people can
really stay smart, try

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:22.800
to achieve who they want to be,
and we're helping that happen.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.190
So I come back to
this picture and think

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.270
about all the questions
people asked before.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.370
Well, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.460
And I feel like I had many
different chapters in my life

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.810
where I ended up doing
different things.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:40.100
But what I'm working
on-- if they asked me,

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.980
and if I knew about this path--
this is what I wanted to do.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.590
And I'm really excited
I'm working on it.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.650
Also I now have four
kids, and the older two

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.180
are actually girls.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.680
And I just started asking
these questions to them.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.271
So I'm kind of excited to
see what's going to happen,

00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:56.770
how their answer
is going to evolve,

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:59.490
and how many chapters
they might end up having.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:00.775
Thank you very much.

00:39:00.775 --> 00:39:04.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.370
Questions?

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.530
I think there are
folks with microphones.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much for
this wonderful presentation.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.270
I really like the product
that Nest is doing.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.340
I think I've read a lot about
probably the interaction why

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.872
Google bought Nest, but
I want your perspective.

00:39:29.872 --> 00:39:30.830
Google is about search.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.680
It's about giving information.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.870
Now with this technology--
thermostats in the house,

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:40.210
getting all the coolness
of helping people

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.880
to manage their temperature,
what you should want

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.280
about carbon monoxide-- what
is Google after with Nest?

00:39:48.655 --> 00:39:50.780
YOKY MATSUOKA: I can't
answer what Google is after.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:57.180
But I think what we're after
is to make our life easier,

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.960
better, and smarter.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.270
And you know that's
what Google wants too.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.550
It turns out us working
together can really

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.871
get closer to that dream.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:18.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, a quick
question on the power

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.430
usage for both the Nests.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.950
I know you use the
Nest thermostat

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.870
to reduce energy
usage in the house.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:33.390
How much energy do each of the
Nests use in turn to operate?

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.700
YOKY MATSUOKA: The Nest itself?

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:39.830
The Nest itself uses
very little energy.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.090
It's 20 milliwatts.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:44.420
It's sleeping most of the time.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.300
So actually it is doing
what's called power stealing.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.060
And most of time it's sleeping.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.340
It has a rechargeable
battery that we slowly

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.200
charge as needed.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.370
So it's really, really small.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:04.180
Onto the energy bills--
actually for the HVAC portion

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.630
it's up to 20%.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.030
And then the overall bill
because it's about 50%

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.380
of energy costs, it's about 10%.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.330
AUDIENCE: So Nest is
made for the home.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.300
Do you offer commercial
products for office buildings?

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.024
Or have you thought about
energy use in data centers

00:41:28.024 --> 00:41:29.815
and tying into building
management systems?

00:41:31.845 --> 00:41:33.470
YOKY MATSUOKA: Thanks
for the question.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.130
I can't answer a
lot of the future,

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.820
but we're thinking
about everything.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.190
Things that are more
similar to people's homes,

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.780
like small business, is easier
to get into in the near future.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.260
AUDIENCE: Are there
any plans to integrate

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.400
Nest with home security systems?

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.880
Like people can
get notifications

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.590
from different angles?

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.647
YOKY MATSUOKA: That
sounds like a great idea.

00:42:00.647 --> 00:42:01.480
Thanks for the idea.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.760
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.770
All these devices-- you said you
see interesting things in data,

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:15.380
and I realize it's a research
stage-- when they are

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.500
installed, how do you
update your software inside?

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.520
If you do, do you collect
any data from devices

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.690
to continue to improve?

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.660
I mean is it centrally
collected somewhere?

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.280
Do you have access to devices?

00:42:36.796 --> 00:42:38.920
YOKY MATSUOKA: We handle
data very, very carefully,

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.310
so carefully that we even
have a hard time accessing it

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:43.560
sometimes.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.610
But yes, we have
sensors in the device.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.845
The thermostat has temperature,
humidity, occupancy, light,

00:42:49.845 --> 00:42:52.700
and proximity sensors.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.010
And then the smoke side
has similar ones as well--

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.852
carbon monoxide and smoke.

00:42:56.852 --> 00:42:58.310
And then we do
collect them and try

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.460
to understand thermal models,
people's behavior, and all

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.170
of that.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.950
Again, we do it in
a very careful way

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:09.450
so that the security issue is
minimized as much as possible.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:10.480
One last one.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.637
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:11.637 --> 00:43:12.970
I'm not going to ask about Nest.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.290
I'm going to ask
about what do you

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:15.456
want to do when you grow up?

00:43:15.456 --> 00:43:20.216
I had this conversation
my eight-year-old sister.

00:43:20.216 --> 00:43:21.465
And she was like, an engineer.

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.750
I was, awesome.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:26.820
But once we were talking
about time traveling.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.960
I was like, do think
we can do that?

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.680
She was like,
absolutely, of course.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.640
I was like, well
if it's absolutely,

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.640
why we don't have it so far?

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.260
She was like, well scientists
are busy with other inventions.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.250
And then they get busy
with other inventions.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.630
And then they put it on hold.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.255
And then they forget.

00:43:46.255 --> 00:43:48.480
I was like, then we're
never going to get it.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.540
And she's like, then
why don't we do it?

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.060
Me and you, let's form a team.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.040
I told her, how?

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.370
And she was like, we're going
to hire a genius guy to do it.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.600
I'm like, what?

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.510
Why?

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.680
Why not us?

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.150
And she is like, well
do you see a girl's lab?

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.330
I see Dexter's Lab on TV.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.090
I've never seen a
girl do science.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.130
I was like, if the
TV didn't show it,

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:18.510
it doesn't mean
it doesn't exist.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.450
She was like, I always wanted
to know more about space,

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.570
and I even searched YouTube.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.290
YouTube is not TV, and I
found guys going to space.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.970
I didn't find girls
going to space.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:35.160
And even though she is
interested in engineering

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.070
because I studied computer
engineering and my dad

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:42.510
is an engineer, she really
thinks her options are still

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:46.450
limited to what she's
seeing on TV, on YouTube,

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:49.720
or what other girls
around her doing.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.470
So what do you think we
should do towards this?

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:58.580
I mean eight-year-old kids
are thinking this way.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.450
YOKY MATSUOKA: I love the
question, and I love the story.

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:02.700
And it is so true.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.230
Isn't it?

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.410
One, I love the fact
that you came here

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.780
because this is one of the
big steps that we can take.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.120
We all know this problem.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.380
So I actually heard a
talk by Geena Davis,

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.920
who absolutely believes in
changing even from Hollywood.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.660
So Disney movies, the
things that little kids--

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.300
they don't mean to, but they
watch it and get influenced

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:28.450
by it-- she said only 17% of
the characters are female.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.480
17% percent of the leading
roles-- even in Disney movies,

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.880
even in animation-- are girls.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.370
When they hire extras in the
background, they are 17% girls.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.490
What's wrong with that?

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:41.360
Our eyes start to
get used to the fact

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.750
that the world is full of men.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.750
Something has to change.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:47.250
Right?

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.880
So all of us can
make those changes.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.950
And I think we've got to do it.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.650
One step at a time,
but I think we've

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.030
got to look from all angles.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:59.680
The other one that's interesting
is my girls are the same.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.370
They say they want
to become scientists.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.320
Apparently 70% of
girls and boys say

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.066
that around the age of
third grade and fifth grade.

00:46:06.066 --> 00:46:07.440
Then if you ask
the same question

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.870
by the time they get to the
ninth grade-- by the way,

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.330
the stats came from the
National Science Foundation--

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.950
only about 30% of girls say
they want to be scientists.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.930
For the boys side,
still 60% of them

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.510
say they want to be scientists.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.377
So something happens in that
span, some influence that

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:22.710
comes from outside that makes
them think that maybe they

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.110
can't do it.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:27.680
Maybe it's puberty, but maybe
it's something that they watch.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.300
I think we all
should pay attention

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.540
to that period of
time and make sure

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.789
that number doesn't become 30.

00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:34.430
It should stay closer
to the number of boys.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.910
And I love to work with that.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:37.900
Thank you very much.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.650
[APPLAUSE]
