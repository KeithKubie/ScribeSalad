00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:02.183
 Come to Pixtar in a box, 

00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:04.459
 a joint project of Pixar animation studio 

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.263
 and Cannes Academy. 

00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:08.516
 I'm Fran and I'm working on the technical part. 

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:09.816
 And I'm Alex and I work 

00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.565
 aesthetics and plot. 

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:13.081
 (Fran) Pixar in a box will introduce you 

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.257
 with some of the basic skills we use to create our films. 

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:17.319
 (Alex) There are examples of true film challenges, 

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.152
 which show how the artist's idea can start on 

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.979
 a wave of technical creativity. 

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.767
 and how the advancement of technology can inspire 

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:25.367
 artists to invent new ideas for the screen. 

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.875
 You will meet artists, scientists 

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.001
 animators, programmers, sculptors 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.590
 and many different people. 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.609
 The thing is, most of them use skills, 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.712
 which you may already be learning at school. 

00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:37.825
 But here, in the Box, you will see how 

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.296
 with these skills we create cool things. 

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:41.736
 Before you get into the lessons, 

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:43.865
 you better see how everything is tied to Pixtar, 

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:44.917
 the real Pixtar. 

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:45.780
 Come on, come see! 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.464
 At Pikar we are constantly working 

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:54.888
 on many films at different stages. 

00:00:56.868 --> 00:00:59.102
 But everything starts with an idea. 

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:02.134
 For example, "Toy toys" may have begun as follows: 

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:07.023
 When children leave the room, the toys come alive. 

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:09.949
 I have always known that my people are doing so. 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.478
 Our films start in the storyline department, 

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.122
 where with the director and screenwriter 

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.662
 we figure out what will happen with the help of sketches. 

00:01:23.662 --> 00:01:25.337
 (Fran) is like a comic book. 

00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:27.594
 (Alex) That's right, and while we paint, 

00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:29.359
 the team of designers begin 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.640
 to design the world and the heroes. 

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.198
 While they are painting and painting, 

00:01:40.198 --> 00:01:42.195
 our sketches go to the editorial, 

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:43.518
 where all our drawings 

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:45.167
 are grouped together. 

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.448
 We adjust their duration, add music, replicas and effects. 

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:50.979
 Only he knew what was going on ... 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.061
 Aaaaaaa! 

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.517
 By moving the frames through every stage of production 

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:57.164
 we renew the scene again and again. 

00:01:57.164 --> 00:01:59.765
 That's where science and mathematics go into action. 

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:00.741
 - Who knew what was happening ... 

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:02.436
 Aaaaaaa! 

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:07.477
 What next? 

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:10.240
 The Streamline - we're ready to start making the movie, 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.771
 who will go to the cinema, and this is in a certain order. 

00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:14.931
 It is time for our technical artist to invent 

00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:16.934
 how do we make the movie on a computer. 

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:19.408
 I have been working here for nine years, and I still have no idea 

00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:22.032
 how you turn our drawings into a ready-made movie. 

00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:25.097
 To be honest, in every movie we are stumbling something. 

00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:26.165
 Hi, Geylan! 

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:26.745
 Hello! 

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.463
 You have been here since the "Toys game". 

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:29.666
 What was the complexity of each movie? 

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.450
 In the "Toys game" - everything. 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.576
 I will show you. 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.595
 We developed "Toys' game" 

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:38.288
 the whole process from scratch. 

00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:41.121
 In "Monsters OOD" - the fur and the clothes. 

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.211
 In "Cars" - reflective metal surfaces. 

00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.762
 Every new movie has a new technical challenge. 

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:49.280
 In "Inside Out" we had a hero, 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.827
 composed of shimmering particles and needed 

00:02:51.827 --> 00:02:54.876
 many people to figure out how to achieve this. 

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:56.524
 (Alex) Wow, what's it done for? 

00:02:56.524 --> 00:03:00.239
 Its shape will be composed of dots and light particles. 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.965
 It was hard. This is the seventeenth option. 

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:06.604
 Heroes have to move, 

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.277
 so someone has to control the model. 

00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:10.652
 Like a puppet, right? 

00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:12.572
 Yes, but instead of strings, 

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.503
 our animators use a computer program, 

00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:15.935
 to move the characters in the digital world. 

00:03:17.653 --> 00:03:19.409
 The next step is the decor. 

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:23.667
 (Alex) So, for Car 2 you've built all of London? 

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.687
 We needed a large part of the city, 

00:03:25.687 --> 00:03:27.753
 because Meyer and McCain are quickly passing through it. 

00:03:27.753 --> 00:03:29.959
 We figured out how to build buildings 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.250
 with enough variety to look real. 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.643
 (Fran) And we're moving through this decor 

00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:37.128
 with their virtual cameras. 

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:38.753
 And now - the animation. 

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:40.433
 I know what animators are doing. 

00:03:40.433 --> 00:03:42.894
 They bring life to the heroes. 

00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:44.154
 (Fran) He sees how he moves, 

00:03:44.154 --> 00:03:45.657
 but her clothes and hair are missing. 

00:03:45.657 --> 00:03:47.846
 They will be added by someone else 

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:49.697
 down the line. 

00:03:50.407 --> 00:03:52.144
 And this one is me 

00:03:52.144 --> 00:03:54.698
 and about twenty other technical artists. 

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:57.700
 Where do you get all these T-shirts? 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.627
 We build everything we see, 

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:01.111
 including tissues and surfaces, 

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:03.850
 which make the world and the characters trustworthy. 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.567
 Next stop - lighting. 

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.197
 The lighting department is however very dark. 

00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:12.424
 So there are no lights when you start? 

00:04:12.424 --> 00:04:14.798
 No. We have to add 

00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:16.751
 each light source. 

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:20.765
 Only in this frame there are 230 lights. 

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:22.762
 (Fran) Last stop - processing. 

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:25.571
 The movie is a series of images, that is, footage. 

00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.274
 There is 24 per second. 

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:30.544
 (Fran) Here we draw the frames. 

00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:31.841
 Combine everything here - 

00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.302
 art, mathematics and science. 

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:38.040
 Processing a single frame can take over 24 hours, 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.805
 and this is for only one shot, 

00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:41.662
 if we have no obstacles. 

00:04:50.647 --> 00:04:53.486
 It is unbelievable to look at the finished footage. 

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:56.130
 And it's even cooler because I already know how they were made. 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.907
 It was the excursion. The next step is 

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.896
 jump back into the Box and choose a lesson. 

00:04:59.896 --> 00:05:01.447
 Did you like something? 

00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:03.838
 This one for building combinatorics robots 

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:05.440
 I find it cool. 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.251
 What about the scenery? 

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:09.543
 Or the one about the animation of The Incredibles. 

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.935
 Cruel! I always wanted to animate.
