00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.510
We're asked to compute
347 divided by 5.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.980
So let me just rewrite
it like this.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.490
We have 347-- let me
write it bigger.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.530
We have 347, and we want to
divide it by-- so I'll put the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.150
division sign here, maybe the
long division sign, depending

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.160
on how you want to view it,
and then I'll put the 5 in

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.299
blue-- divided by 5.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.040
So the first thing we do is
say does 5 go into 3?

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.440
No, it doesn't, so let's
add another digit here.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590
Does 5 go into 34?

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.590
Well, 5 times 6 is equal to 30,
so that goes into it, and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.290
if we go above that, 5 times 7
is equal to 35, so that's too

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.180
big, so it goes into
34 six times.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.260
Because if we went with 7,
we would've gotten 35.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.350
That's too big.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.340
So 5 goes into 34 six times.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.560
6 times 5 is 30-- we
saw that right over

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.960
there-- and we subtract.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.850
34 minus 30.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.670
Let me do this in a new color.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.090
34 minus 30.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.460
Well, 4 minus 0 is 4.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.040
3 minus 3 is just 0, and then we
can bring down this 7 here.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.310
5 goes into 47 how many times?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.890
Let's see, 5 times 8 is equal to
40, so that would work, but

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.240
let's see if we can go
in even more times.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.200
5 times 9 is equal to 45.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.780
That'll work.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.310
That's still less than 47.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.350
Then we have 5 times 10 is
50, so this is too big.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.410
So we want to go with 5 times
9 is equal to 45, or 5 goes

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.290
into 47 nine times.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.310
9 times 5 is 45, and then
you subtract again.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.410
47 minus 45 is 2.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.040
And then we're done.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.400
There's nothing else
to bring down here.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.480
One day, we'll learn about
dividing it into decimals and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.720
getting some kind of a decimal
representation, but we're not

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.280
going to worry about
that right now.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.670
We have nothing left
to bring down.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.025
So 347 divided by 5 is 69.

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:20.560
It is 69.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.930
It is equal to 69, but it
doesn't go evenly into 347.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.470
There's something left over.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.050
There's a remainder.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.960
There is a remainder
right here.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.710
So it equals 69, and sometimes
you'll see it written as

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.100
remainder 2, or sometimes
it's a capital R.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.640
Sometimes people will write out
the word "remainder." So 5

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.430
goes into 347 sixty-nine times,
but you're going to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.180
have 2 left over.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.580
Or another way to think about
it is 5 times 69 is 345, so

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.820
you're always going to have
2 left over in this

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.890
circumstance.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.700
So that is our answer.
