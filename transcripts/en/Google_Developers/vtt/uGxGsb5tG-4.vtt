00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.807
In this section, we're going
to take our sample

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.610
application that gives gifts
to our friends, and also

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.046
shows the gifts that we've
given them to show the gifts

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.116
that other friends
have given to us.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.085
The first thing we need to do
is make a small change to

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.155
our gadget XML, so that we
have a place to insert our

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.024
list of received gifts.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.859
Next we need to make two
small changes,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.861
one to "loadFriends,"
and one to the "giveGift"

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:31.798
function, so that we have a
request for our friends' data,

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.699
as well as our own.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.769
First, we modify "loadFriends,"
so that in addition to

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.671
requesting information on the
"viewer" and the "viewerFriends,"

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.307
as well as the viewer's
personal application data,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:45.678
we also need to request the
"viewerFriends'" application data.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:49.416
Next, we make the same change
in "giveGift" so that the

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.185
requests parallel each other.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.355
Third, we update "onLoadFriends,"
so that in addition to pulling

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.657
out information on the "viewer,"
the "viewerFriends,"

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.026
and the "giftData,"
we pull out information on

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.462
"viewerfriendData,"
which is the list of gifts

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.564
that all of our
friends have given.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.167
This function then iterates
through the list of friends,

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.169
displays the menus so that
you may select a friend

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.470
to give a gift to,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.507
updates the gift list which shows
the list of gifts that you have sent,

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.811
finally, calls the new function
"updateReceivedList," which

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.514
shows the list of gifts that you
have received from your friends.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.951
"updateReceivedList" closely
parallels "updateGiftList,"

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.320
but instead of iterating just
once through the list of gifts

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.190
that you have sent, it iterates
through each of your friends,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.393
pulls out the application data
just for that friend specified

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.763
by your friend's Id, then
converts the data that it

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.999
pulls out into a
javascript object.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.569
Once it has this list of gifts
that your friend have given,

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.438
it iterates through each of them,
comparing the friend Id that

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.707
the gift was sent to with your Id.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:52.612
If the Ids match, it adds that
gift as a gift that was given to you.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.180
Once the list of gifts
that have been given

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.283
to you has been completed,
they are inserted into the page.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.519
Here you can see the newly
created version of our gadget,

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.789
that displays not just options
for sending gifts to our friends,

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.024
and the lists the gifts that we
have already sent to our friends,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.961
but the list of gifts that
our friends have sent to us.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.130
