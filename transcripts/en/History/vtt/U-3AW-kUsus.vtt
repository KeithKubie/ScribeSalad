00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.710
There's the guy right there.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.540
Hey, you Clint?
- Yeah.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey, I'm Mike.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Hi.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.330
Nice to meet you.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.330
Talked to Danielle on the phone.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.460
Or your kids talk
to her on the phone.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.620
- Yeah.
- Frank.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.830
What's going on?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.170
I know that my son and
daughter contacted Danielle,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.040
because they've been
talking to me about, dad,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.670
you need to downsize.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.960
But it's hard to do.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.960
Was this the Ford garage?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.210
Danielle said you had a--

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.170
Yeah, it's the Ford garage.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.580
Built in 1919.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.040
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.790
This building originally
was a Ford dealership.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.540
It was called Meils Garage.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.670
And I'd be the third
or fourth owner.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.210
So when you
bought it, was there

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.540
any remnants of that in there?
- No.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.620
The guy said he never
kept into the advertising

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.330
because he just threw it away.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.620
It was worthless back then.
Yeah

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.880
Yeah.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.620
So I told myself I'd never
fill this up, but I did.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.880
And people have tried to sell
me other buildings here in town,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.040
and I said, no, because
I'd just fill them up.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.380
So I've tried to control
the habit a little bit.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.460
- Wow, this is cool.
- Nice building.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.880
- Can we look inside?
- Sure.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.460
All right.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.790
Wow.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
It's amazing how you can
roll into these small towns

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.460
where there looks
like there's nothing,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
and then walk into a
building with so much stuff.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.000
How many square feet
is this building?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.250
7,500.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.250
No kidding.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.420
Quite a bit.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.790
I've noticed over here
you got your workbench.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.920
- Yeah.
- So this is the hang, right?

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.080
Yeah.
I come down here every day.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.500
And people say, what do
you do down here all day?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.920
And I said, I don't know.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.880
But I don't get it done, so I
got to come back the next day.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.120
He's got 7,500
square feet, and he's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.710
got it packed to the max.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.460
I know my kids want me to
downsize, and I know I need to.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.920
But I still get a rush
when I buy something,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.080
and when I sell something
occasionally, you know?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.420
Sometimes people get
kind of ornery with me

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.420
that I won't sell them
something, but it's like, OK,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.920
you know.
It's my stuff.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.080
I get this say whether
I sell it or not.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.880
Is that sign right there,
is that metal or is it wood?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.620
- No, it's wood.
- Looks like a fiber board.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.960
- Yeah.
- Was that a local piece?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.750
I see it's Illinois.
- Yeah.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.790
I bought it at an auction.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.290
What do you value
the magic of that?

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.380
I really don't
want to sell it.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.170
You don't want
to sell that piece?

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.380
No.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.960
So do you have a 'I don't
want to sell it' price?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.500
Or no?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.790
$3,000.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.540
- That's a big number for it.
- Yeah.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.290
It's his 'I don't want to sell
it' number, but he's putting

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.330
a number on it.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.040
And when you put a
number on something,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.880
that opens up a conversation.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.460
What about this Chicago
Motor Club Service station?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.710
If you want my 'I don't want
to sell it' price, $7,000.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.670
Wow.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.000
So you're into the
gas and oil stuff.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.420
I can see some advertising.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.420
A little bit so.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.830
What do you value
the case sign at?

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.710
- Not for sale price is $3500.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.170
OK.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.750
It feels like we just taught
this guy a new negotiating

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.250
trick, and he really likes it.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580
I hope we didn't just
shoot ourself in the foot.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.000
- Clint.
- Yes.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.250
I found a table.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.330
This is the biggie.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.580
Where'd that come out of?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.830
Came out of a drugstore.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.830
No kidding.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.250
He's got this incredible
13 foot table.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.120
The bottom of it is all
grain painted, turn legs.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.040
It's beautiful.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.210
So what do you value this at?

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.170
My 'I don't want to
sell it' price is $2,500.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.170
Now is the table worth that?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.460
Absolutely.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.830
Yeah, you're right on the money.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.290
It's a good piece.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.380
But I can't pay that, and
he knows that. $2,500.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.250
Yeah, I can't.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.170
At some point, his I don't
want to sell it price might

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.790
be my 'I want to buy it' price.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.620
Clint, what have we
got going on those here?

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.920
It's a three piece sign, here.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.210
It's porcelain.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.330
Clover Farms Store And Meats.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.880
Thing about these
signs is, you've got

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.670
to have the right space for it.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.620
It's 15 foot plus sign there.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.540
Is it something you would sell?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.540
If you want my 'I don't want
to sell it' price, $4,000.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.380
$4,000.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.620
You really don't
want to sell it.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.540
Yeah.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.920
He's learned a
new catch phrase,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.750
but now he's taking
it to the extreme.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.170
My 'I don't want
to sell it' price.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.120
'I don't want to sell' price.
'I don't to sell' price, $2,500.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.880
I'm glad you didn't buy it,
because I want to put it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.080
on the front of the building.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.960
Because my very first store
was a Clover Farm store.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.000
Oh, you used to shop
when you're a kid or?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.420
No, it was--

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.830
I rented it for $25 a month to
start my first antique shop.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.580
That seems awful cheap.
Where was that at?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.420
Little corner grocery
store in Williamsburg, Iowa.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.540
1967.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.170
- Williamsburg, Iowa?
- Yeah.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.880
I just stopped and got
gas there a minute ago.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.830
So how did you end up there?
- I taught there.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.790
- At the high school?
- Right.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.920
OK.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920
How old were you when
you opened up the shop?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.330
I was 23.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.330
And I was 21 when I
first started teaching.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.750
So you were teaching
and running a shop.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.000
Yeah.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.420
So, just on nights and weekends,
and that kind of thing.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.380
Yeah.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.750
I tried to make
enough money to be

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.380
able to buy something to keep.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.880
So it was kind of like that's
how I funded the obsession,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.540
I guess.
- Retail's a monster, man.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.790
Oh, yeah.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.460
And whatever people wanted,
I didn't want to sell.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.790
And I always tell
them my 'I don't want

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.290
to sell it' price so--

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.790
it's not a good
business model, is it?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.920
Now that Clint told me
the story about the sign,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920
I don't blame him.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.920
I wouldn't sell it either.
