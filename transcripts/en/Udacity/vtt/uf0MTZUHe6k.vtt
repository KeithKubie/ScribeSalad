00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.880
What I'm showing here is what an architectural configuration of

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.460
a system might look like in practice. And as you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.560
can see, the configuration includes a set of components, which

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.200
are these rectangles over here. The components have various kinds of

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.460
ports, which are the ones marked here on the components

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.760
with different graphical representations. And

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760
the components communicate through various

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.860
types of connectors, which are the grey elements here which

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.570
as you can see are used to connect the different components.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.180
And something else that you can notice by looking at

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.720
this configuration is the fact that you can also have

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.980
hierarchically decomposable components. For example, if you look at the strategy

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.250
analyzer component, you can see that it has three subcomponents: one,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.110
two, and three and two internal connectors as part of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.832
it. And it is worth recalling here that a component

00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:47.152
diagram as we said when first discussed in UML in

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:51.230
the course, can also be used to represent an architectural configuration.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.920
So sometimes you will see architectural

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.250
configurations represented as UML component diagrams.
