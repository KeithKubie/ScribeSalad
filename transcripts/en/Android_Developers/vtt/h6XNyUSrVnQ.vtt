FRANCOIS DESCHENES:
The watch face

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.130
is one of the most
prominent UI components

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.810
of Wear OS by Google.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.990
As a developer, you can create
your own custom watch faces

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.020
and share your creations
in the Google Play Store.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.076
I am Francois, and
I will walk you

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:14.950
through the high level
design and development

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.630
steps of the watch face.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.600
To kick off, let's take a look
at the different components

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.800
of a watch face.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.890
At its most basic, a watch
face is an expression of style

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.230
and provides a way to tell time.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.032
Beyond this, there is also
what we call complications.

00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:30.490
It's a traditional
watchmaking term

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.650
denoting areas of the
watch face that show

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.050
information other than time.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.640
In this example, the watch
face is showing the date.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.330
With Wear OS by Google
being a connected platform,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.350
watch face developers
can take full advantage

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.120
of data supplied by
the system itself

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.150
or other apps
installed on the watch.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.460
This enables watch
face developers

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.180
to display bite-sized
information right

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.460
from the watch face, such
as the current temperature

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.020
or other information
that the user chooses.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.020
Although supporting
complications is technically

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.730
optional for watch
face developers,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.510
we have seen strong user
demand for this feature,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.000
and it is very much recommended.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.540
Lastly, Wear OS has two modes
of operations, interactive mode

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.430
and ambient mode.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.910
In interactive mode, the user
will expect the watch face

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.720
to be in full color and
ready for user interaction.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
In ambient mode, the watch face
should light up no more than 5%

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.380
of the screen pixels and should
avoid solid blocks of color

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.870
to prevent screen burn
in on OLED display.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.570
In addition, the
screen is not expected

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.380
to be updated more
than once a minute.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.860
So remember to remove any
indication of seconds while

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.610
in this mode.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.766
Now that you have a design,
it's time to start coding.

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.140
The easiest way
to get started is

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.960
to create a new project
in Android Studio.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.090
Select Wear OS as the form
factor, and select Watch Face.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.190
After you have completed
the setup wizard,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.070
you will have a startup project
with a functioning watch face

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.840
that you can customize.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.550
In the generated
code, I would like

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.744
to highlight three methods
that developers should

00:02:02.744 --> 00:02:03.910
pay particular attention to.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.740
The first one is
onSurfaceChanged.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.240
This method is run once at the
start of watch face creation,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.520
and it has access to
the screen dimensions.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.620
As a result, this
is the perfect time

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.480
to resize any bitmap
you might have

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.610
or adjust the size of
your watch face features.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.090
The second method is onDraw.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.520
This is where the watch
face rendering code lives,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.300
and it runs every
time a frame is drawn.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.540
As a result, you should pay
attention to its performance.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.250
Avoid expensive operations,
such as loading and resizing

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.220
resources.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.190
Last, but not least,
onAmbientModeChanged.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.400
This is called whenever the
watch face enters or exits

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.570
ambient mode.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.300
You can use this method to
change and swap paint objects

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.900
before rendering the screen.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.330
As we mentioned before,
Wear OS complications

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.490
are a powerful way
to help the user stay

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.160
connected by providing
bite-sized information

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.480
on the watch face.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.180
We have a suite of APIs
to enable your watch face

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.040
to connect to
external data sources

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.250
and help you render them
using complication drawables.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.700
To find out more,
follow this code lab.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.330
With great power comes
great responsibility.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.400
Watch faces are one of the
most prominent UI components

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.200
of the Wear OS platform.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.570
At the same time, this
means your watch face

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.170
will very likely be run for
most of the device uptime.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.120
Any inefficiency or
errors will severely

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.820
impact battery user experience.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.190
Before you publish your
watch face, please use it

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.030
extensively for a long period
of time to catch any issues.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.470
Pay particular attention to when
the watch is an ambient mode,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.960
that it is not doing more
processing than it needs to.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.170
Any rogue code could
severely impact battery life.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.360
Watch faces offer an
opportunity to create something

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.670
very personal, and there
is something special

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.130
about seeing your own watch
face for the first time

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.900
on your Wear device.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.819
Why not see it for yourself?

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.860
This might just be the
wearable platform for you.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.810
