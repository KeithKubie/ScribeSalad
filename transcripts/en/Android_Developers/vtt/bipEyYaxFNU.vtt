[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.790
MATT WEAR: My name is Matt Wear.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.670
I am a freelance
Android developer,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.450
just currently doing a bunch
of different projects right now

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.620
and loving it.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.130
So I've been doing Android
for about five years,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.440
and I've never been
into design really.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.540
So I've just recently
gotten into design,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.450
and I'm super excited to
share what I've been learning.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.610
So I guess we
should jump in here.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.700
Is everyone here a
developer, or is anyone

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.200
a designer, would you say?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.380
Awesome.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.355
Do you sketch?

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:41.980
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.700
MATT WEAR: You do.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.200
Right.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.340
Great.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.410
So Sketch 3, if you don't
know, is a design tool

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.790
from Bohemian Coders
that is kind of sweeping

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.920
the industry right now.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.610
It's a screen design tool,
so it's basically just

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.280
for static screens and
final assets or mockups.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.470
It's not interaction design,
so it doesn't do motion

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.450
like Pixate, and it's very
geared towards screen design.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
So if you need to
manipulate a photo

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.710
to airbrush it or
something, it's not

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.500
going to be as
good as Photoshop,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.150
but it's going to be 1,000
times better at designing

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.860
an app than Photoshop is in
my opinion, and a lot cheaper.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.010
Why talk about Sketch at all?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.290
And I think that this quote
from Roman Nurik really

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.050
kind of sums it
up of why I think

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.840
this is an important topic.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.380
And that's, "Designer
as chief curator."

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.270
And I think this is the way
we're seeing teams work more

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.340
and more, that everyone is kind
of bringing ideas together,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.960
and the designer
is the guardrails

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.210
and makes sure what
is getting put out

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.170
there is really cohesive
and solves the problem.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.850
On a lot of agile
teams-- I think

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.970
most people would say
they're doing agile--

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.280
I notice that the designer
is not embedded or included

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.580
as much as they should be.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.450
She's oftentimes kind
of given the problem,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.400
and maybe there's a
design meeting where

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.530
everyone comes together
and reviews the mocks,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.449
or maybe there's not.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.240
Maybe everyone just
kind of comes together,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.980
and the designs
get handed to you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.890
after the spec goes
to the designer.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.452
And the problem with that
is maybe it's good upfront,

00:02:31.452 --> 00:02:32.910
and in the design
meeting, everyone

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.118
thinks, oh, this looks great.

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:36.720
We can do this right away.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.530
But then once you actually start
programming it, you realize,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.440
this is maybe a
little impossible.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.150
And so you have to go back
to the designer and say,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.780
oh yeah, this was kind of
messed up here, whatnot.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.510
Well, they've moved on to
something else, potentially,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.710
and the problem is not
in their head anymore.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.085
And they've just got to
solve it really quick

00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:57.876
and get it back to you
so they can continue

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:02.240
working on their thing,
and usually the problem

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.980
doesn't get solved
in the cohesive way

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.930
that it was solved
the first time.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.710
And designer as curator
puts the responsibility

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.190
to design on everyone.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.710
So everyone understands
the design problem.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.000
Everyone can actually contribute
mocks and contribute assets,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.920
and I've kind of seen
that designers that

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.500
are embedded in
development teams

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.760
where developers are
also contributing,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.660
the end product
is much more rich.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.680
Designers, unfortunately,
in the Android world,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.170
you probably notice if you have
an Android-specific designer,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.220
I think you're in the
fortunate minority.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.135
But most of us, our
designers carry iPhones.

00:03:42.135 --> 00:03:44.010
They aren't familiar
with the coolest Android

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.430
apps and the interactions within
those apps, and it's up to us

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.200
to really advocate for Android
and make sure we don't just

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.170
have a port from the iOS app
or something that looks more

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.840
like a website or whatnot.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.480
So designer as chief
curator-- I think it's

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.430
a really important concept.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.060
I heard Roman Nurik
say it recently,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.770
and I think that's why we should
care about tools like Sketch,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.290
where we can actually
contribute more.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.690
Also, if you want to
build an app on your own,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.277
it's very hard
without a designer.

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:18.360
And maybe this will empower
you a little bit more.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.350
Let's jump in here.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.080
So if you only pay attention
for the next five minutes,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.500
I say pay attention--
or if you've

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.230
got five minutes to pay
attention to this talk,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.220
pay attention for the
next five minutes,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.500
and you might have
enough to actually

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.580
be dangerous in Sketch.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.540
So what we're going
to do is just kind

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.230
of get Sketch up and running,
and open an Android template

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.260
where we can just drag and
drop Android components

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.715
and actually create something.

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:51.340
So the first thing
you're going to need

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.560
to do-- oh, a magic
move-- is install Roboto.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.840
Roboto is the font Android uses.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.770
I'm sure you're very
familiar with it.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.860
Noto if it's a
non-Roboto script.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.244
But I like to get it from
here, just google.com/fonts.

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:10.660
It gives you the option to put
in all the different styles

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.340
and weights that
you want, and it'll

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.050
download a zip, which will be
a bunch of TTF files, which

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.620
is a font file, and you'll
just go into the Font

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.016
Installer for the Mac.

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:27.390
Sketch is only for Mac, so if
you have a Windows machine,

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.510
I'm sorry for more
reasons than just that.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.930
You can install your fonts here,
and then you'll open Sketch.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.520
You'll go to File,
New from Template,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.130
and just built in
straight from Sketch,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.700
you can select Material
Design Template,

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.020
and you'll get this really
cool artboard sheet here.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.620
It's basically just a page,
and it'll have just everything

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.460
to spec-- typography, the
system icons, the metrics,

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.170
the key lines, default
themes, components,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.360
global elements
like system icons

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.180
and dialogs, just all
kinds of great things

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.640
that you can just easily select
from right here, and paste

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.144
right into your artboard.

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:16.560
What I like to do is-- and
we're going to go into all this

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.260
in a little more
depth-- but I like

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.240
to select Create a New
Page from my Stickersheet,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.880
and then Create an Artboard,
which is just basically

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.670
a screen, and built
in material design

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.830
has mobile portrait,
mobile landscape, tablets,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.500
seven-inch tablets, nine-inch.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.820
You just select one of these.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.690
You can even build a website
in material or an iOS app,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.310
if you really want to
control your counterparts,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.855
and just create an artboard.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.629
And so you'll just have
this on your canvas here.

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.170
You can go back to
your stickersheet.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.160
Select something.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.140
I've selected a screen here.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.720
Paste it in.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.220
Bam.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.970
You've got an app.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.990
You could export
it, and go to town,

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.760
make a million dollars
off of your cool app.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.610
Probably not, but you can
kind of get the picture here.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.240
Super easy just to get started.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.250
So if you want to
download Sketch, it's $99.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.720
Search for a promo code first.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.860
You can probably save 20%,
and you can get going here.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.650
It's very cool.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.620
But in order to build
something really engaging,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.430
something that really stands
out on the Android platform

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.500
or fits cohesively
within the system,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.450
you're going to need
to understand material

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.867
extremely well.

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:36.283
And what parts of
material are you

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:38.544
going to need to
understand for Sketch?

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.210
Not as much of the
motion, although it's

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.640
important for
developing a great app.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.671
You will need to understand
the colors and the typography

00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:49.170
and just basically
everything that's

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.170
going to be on the
static screen very well.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.490
So the first topic that is going
to be really important when

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.350
you're going to
start a design is

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.190
going to be what colors
you're going to use.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.600
So the spec says that you need
to use bold hues juxtaposed

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.470
with muted environments, deep
shadows, bright highlights.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.120
And what that comes
down to is you'll

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.140
have a bunch of
different colors,

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.350
so you'll open up all
the color palettes.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.950
This is indigo here
with a pink accent.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.410
And you'll want to
pick three main colors

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.140
from the main
palette, and you'll

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.880
want to pick one color
from an accent palette.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.610
And what I like to do
is just-- I'm sorry.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.490
All right.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.809
I thought there was a question.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.370
But what I like
to do is just try

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.530
to get a feel for what
kind of app I'm making.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.710
Is it serious?

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.705
Is it more playful?

00:08:46.705 --> 00:08:49.080
If it's more playful, I'll
probably use a brighter color.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.570
If it's more serious or the
content really shines out,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.380
I'll probably use
a more muted color.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.780
But a bold color on
a muted environment--

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.780
pick three colors,
and just play around

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.126
with which colors you pick.

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:06.250
Typography is very important
and the color that you

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.890
pick on your typography.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.950
The spec lays this
out very clearly.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.470
If it's a light background,
you want to pick a darker text.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.090
If it's a dark background,
you pick a lighter text.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.090
If it's emphasized,
you don't want

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.930
to put any transparency
on the text.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.190
If it is just kind of like
a subtitle or something,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.510
you might want to put a little
transparency on the text.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.040
Imagery-- so imagery is
obviously very important.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.970
It's a powerful tool to help you
communicate and differentiate

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.150
your product.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.780
You want to use bold graphics.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.040
Intentional imagery
helps to engage a user.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.830
Apps that have a bunch
of images in them--

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.620
you want to use them more.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.940
So you want to be very
intentional with what kind

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.130
of images you choose.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.790
And you want to
choose ones that are

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.850
contextual to your experience.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.660
If you have a
travel app, you want

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.480
to show pictures of your
actual destination city

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.952
if you're showing like
a plane ride or whatnot.

00:10:06.952 --> 00:10:08.410
If you're showing
user information,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.000
try to show a picture
of that actual user

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.760
instead of just like
a random person.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.110
That seems contrived,
but you can always

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.080
kind of think contextually, what
kind of images can I show here?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.360
What can I not?

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.500
And there's a lot of
rules around images

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.090
in material design.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.120
You can use multiple
mediums, so if you

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.310
don't have a bunch of
actual photography,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.460
it's OK to mix in
artwork and drawings.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.870
So if you've got
a profile picture,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.020
you don't have to just use
a picture of that person.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.800
If you don't have it,
it's OK to mix it and show

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.770
a drawing of the person.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.630
But just really contextual to
your experience, immersive.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.230
If it's a big hero image,
have it bleed all the way

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.580
to the edge and
things like that.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.820
So you can really
humanize an app

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.580
by the imagery that's in it.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.940
And typography-- typography
is just such a huge topic,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.820
so it's really hard to go
over everything right now.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.102
But just know the fonts
that you want to use,

00:11:21.102 --> 00:11:23.310
generally, it's going to be
Roboto, Noto, because you

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.685
get those for
free, and you don't

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:27.269
have to get licenses for them.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.310
They match on the system.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.740
They're optimized
for the system,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.860
so they'll be able to render
them the fastest and whatnot.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:42.710
But just make sure to
use that and kind of look

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.285
over the typography spec
and learn a little bit

00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:47.285
about what you're doing.

00:11:50.844 --> 00:11:51.510
Here's the meat.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.840
Who's ready?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.390
I can just sense
it in this room.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.605
Just like everyone, yes.

00:11:55.605 --> 00:11:58.240
That's what I'm talking about.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.040
Sketch.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.880
Sketch is made by Bohemian
Coders, like I said, Sketch 3.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.920
It came out a few years ago.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.200
It just won the
Apple Design Award,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.430
and it's just a great
tool for screen design.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.710
So we'll just jump right in.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.390
As you can see, when
you open up Sketch,

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.520
this is what you'll see.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.110
This is a blank
document right here.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.450
One of the first things I
notice is it's not a cockpit.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.650
There's not a million things
like when you open Photoshop.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.320
Photoshop I've probably tried
to learn about 3,000 times,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.740
and I fail every single
time, because I'm just like,

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.886
I need to copy and paste this,
and I look up a tutorial.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.010
I'm like, why do I even
have to look up a tutorial?

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.030
It's copy and paste.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.930
And then 30 minutes
later, I just like

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.900
have flipped my table over and
poured gasoline on my computer,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.800
and I've just given up.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.020
So it's a tough crowd.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:58.640
No.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.720
It's just terrible jokes.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.300
The top menu here
is what you'll see.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.330
It's not a lot of tools,
but here's the toolbar.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.330
We'll go over all these
tools here in a minute.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.230
In the middle, you have
this infinite canvas.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.280
It goes out infinitely, so if
you ever lose your document

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.070
or what you're working on,
you can hit Command 1, or even

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.764
better, you can go to the View
menu and hit Center Canvas.

00:13:23.764 --> 00:13:24.930
Actually, that's not better.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.660
Use the key command.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.730
On the left here, you
have your layer list.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.830
This will help keep
your document organized

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.590
as you add shapes and group
them together and ungroup

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.180
them, whatnot.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.010
And on the right, you
have your Inspector,

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.430
and depending on what type
of layer you have selected,

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.630
you'll have different
attributes that you can edit.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.190
And I've got to say it's
extremely powerful in Sketch.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.500
Even though you don't have
as many options or abilities

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.750
in Photoshop, the Inspector to
adjust colors and everything

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.120
is quite powerful.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.180
So you pretty much have
everything you need.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.310
I've never met a designer
who's using Sketch

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:09.390
in their day-to-day for app
design that can't do something

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.780
that they used to be
able to do in Photoshop.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.720
They're usually
doing it much faster,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.980
and especially with
some of the integrations

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.680
I'm going to talk about
later, much more productive.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.590
And the developers
can be involved.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.030
So just to go over the
toolbar overview here.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.630
In the top left, you
have your Insert menu,

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.250
and these are going to be your
objects that you generally

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.250
place on the canvas.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.490
When you look at any app, and
I don't know why this eluded me

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.630
for so long, or any
software really,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.050
it's just a bunch of rectangles.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.980
And that's what
you'll be using a lot.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.360
They're just styled rectangles.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.040
They have images on them
and gradients and whatnot,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.680
so you'll come
here to this menu.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.680
You'll pick a shape, and you'll
pick a rectangle and draw

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.660
or an oval, or other shapes.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.960
Sometimes you have other
shapes and whatnot.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.790
But overall, you
have a vector, which

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.980
would be you can draw
anything you want

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.115
and make the line
go any which way.

00:15:05.115 --> 00:15:07.740
You have a pencil, which if you
have it on a wacom or something

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.850
you could draw.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.540
I'm not talented enough to draw,
but I can make an app kind of.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.120
Text-- obviously.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.420
A bitmap, artboards, which
I showed you earlier,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.910
are just basically canned
screens that you can use.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.660
A slice to help export
graphics and a symbol,

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.000
which we'll talk about here
in a minute in styled text.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.295
So here I drew a rectangle.

00:15:30.295 --> 00:15:32.711
You can kind of see what it
would look like on the canvas.

00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:36.800
Kind of get you oriented
to Sketch a little bit.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.290
Group and ungroup-- this
will help you kind of keep

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.290
everything organized.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.720
If you make, say, a
toolbar at the top,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:48.410
and it's got a rectangle
for the toolbar and icons

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.070
for all the menu items and
a home screen and whatnot,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.480
you might get unorganized.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.980
So you might want to select all
those things, and hit Group,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.480
and then in your
layer list, you'll

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.860
just see one group
that says Toolbar,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.690
and you can drill down into it.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.550
I think it'd be kind of
like a package in Java.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.430
Create Symbol--
extremely powerful tool.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.670
I like to think of this as
kind of like creating an object

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.030
or creating a class in
Java, where you can reuse it

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.130
everywhere, and when you
need to change something

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.447
in it, its behavior, you
can change it in one place,

00:16:18.447 --> 00:16:19.530
and it happens everywhere.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:20.988
And we'll go into
this a little bit

00:16:20.988 --> 00:16:25.510
deeper, but just know it's a way
when you're exporting graphics

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:31.680
that you can keep everything
organized and in sync.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.480
Zoom-- obviously,
like I said, if you

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.060
get lost in the infinite
canvas, the infinite abyss

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.050
of your canvas, you can
just quickly hit Command 1,

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.870
get everything centered.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.360
These are kind of your
standard tools here.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.720
You have an edit, where you
can move around your tools,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.650
or you can transform it as in
skew it, rotate, and flatten.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.120
One kind of thing
to keep in mind

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.880
with Transform, which is
kind of a hole in Sketch,

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.935
I feel like, but say you
had a group of a rectangle,

00:17:04.935 --> 00:17:06.690
and it had text on it.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.490
You can't actually
transform a group.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.740
You can only transform
individual shapes.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.599
I really wish that
you could put text.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.839
I was trying to put like a cover
flow album together one time,

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.880
where you would have like
an album in the middle,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.880
and you would swipe it, and it
would kind of transform out.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.190
And I had text on it.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.230
I couldn't actually
transform the text

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.320
on top of the rectangle
at the same time.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.487
I had to do them separately.

00:17:30.487 --> 00:17:31.986
I thought that was
kind of annoying.

00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:34.780
So maybe that's a little hole in
Sketch, but overall it's great.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.660
Here's a mask and scale.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.880
Mask is generally great if you
want a bitmap to fit around

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.200
a certain shape.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.820
So who's done graphics
programming on Android?

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.330
Oh, great.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:52.640
So you've probably used a mask,
like clipping a shape together,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.600
clipping a path to a bitmap.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.140
Here are your
Boolean operations.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.556
We're going to go into these
a little more in-depth later,

00:18:00.556 --> 00:18:03.490
but they are just extremely
powerful for creating

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.200
icons and whatnot,
especially in material.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.270
You'll notice that icons
are oftentimes very flat.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.010
That's the style.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.385
They're supposed
to face forward.

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.021
They're not supposed
to have depth.

00:18:15.021 --> 00:18:17.270
Most of them are just made
up with a bunch of polygons

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.830
that you put together and
you intersect in a union.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.590
I know that seems
kind of obvious,

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.340
but to me it was like
magic when I learned

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.640
that, oh, wow,
this clock is just

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.120
like four ovals and
four rectangles,

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.710
and they're positioned together.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.920
So very cool.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.750
We'll go over that in a minute.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.460
Move things forward
and backwards,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.490
so like this circle here
is on top of the square.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.130
If I move the circle
backwards, then the square

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.850
would be covering the circle.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.720
Pretty standard stuff.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.740
And interacting with layers--
so you can select a layer,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.430
and it'll show its handles.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.090
You can resize by
dragging a handle.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.604
You can use the arrow keys.

00:18:58.604 --> 00:18:59.770
I think this is pretty cool.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.810
You can use the arrow
keys and move it.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.340
If you hit the left arrow,
it'll move it to the left by one

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.340
pixel.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.506
If you hit the right key,
it'll move it to the right

00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:08.180
by one pixel.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.100
If you hit Shift, and
you hold the arrow key,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.710
it'll move it by 10 pixels,
which is pretty nice.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.550
But embedded in that
little statement

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.175
there is something
that's kind of cool,

00:19:17.175 --> 00:19:19.690
and you get to design in pixels.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:20.940
You don't have to do any math.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.476
You just design
in MDPI, and when

00:19:23.476 --> 00:19:25.350
you need to move something
over a little bit,

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.740
you just move it by a
pixel, and everything

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.550
gets scaled up when you export.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.140
And I'll show you how to
do that here in a minute,

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.930
but I think that's very nice.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.510
You can develop in a
different density if you want.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.935
You could design in XXHDPI.

00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:42.270
You just have to do more math.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:47.690
I just like the pixels, and
that's pretty cool, I think.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.480
So keep moving along here.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.600
Oh, yeah, and if you
need to actually move

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.790
an object or a layer by
a specific amount that's

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.119
kind of a strange
amount, you don't

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:02.160
have to use your mouse to
drag it by that amount.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.260
You can actually put expressions
in your Inspector right here,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.360
so I put plus 13 right here, and
it moved it over to the right

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.090
by 13.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.280
And if I needed to move it 13
also down, I could do that.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.565
That's really helpful for
when you have two layers,

00:20:15.565 --> 00:20:17.440
and you need to move
them at the same amount,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.130
and you could put
expressions in there.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.610
I think that's very cool.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.190
You can also duplicate
a layer, which

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.250
becomes very powerful, as
we'll see when we're creating

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.890
an icon here in a minute.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.410
You can hide and
show a layer, as you

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.320
see this little eyeball here.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.174
That's pretty helpful if
you've got a very busy design,

00:20:38.174 --> 00:20:40.340
and you need to focus on
this one little piece here,

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.090
you'll hide a bunch of layers.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.190
It's a pretty standard
tool in most design tools,

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.869
but I just kind of want
to give an overview.

00:20:47.869 --> 00:20:48.910
And you can lock a layer.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.040
This is really important
for background layers

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.774
is what I find,
because everything

00:20:53.774 --> 00:20:55.690
is going to be on top
of the background layer,

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.390
and when you start selecting
around with your mouse,

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.870
you'll oftentimes accidentally
select your background layer

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.870
and move it, and then
it's in the wrong spot,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.330
and you have to Control
Z, and blah blah blah.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.817
So very important to
lock the background

00:21:09.817 --> 00:21:11.400
layer or any layer
that you don't want

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.220
moved while you're
moving stuff around.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.130
So just continuing with
interacting with layers here,

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.710
as you can see, I've
grouped these two, this oval

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.360
and this rectangle
here, and it creates

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.845
a folder on the layer list.

00:21:27.845 --> 00:21:28.970
Kind of keeps it organized.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.150
And here's my Inspector.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.910
If I select a layer, I
get all kinds of options.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:43.420
I can put an inner shadow, an
outer shadow, a border, a fill,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.690
all the various join
types can be edited here,

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.640
which are kind of a
complex way to say

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.970
like how it's drawn together
when you intersect our Boolean

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.340
objects.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.940
And you can edit the
colors by dragging.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.890
You can select a color
with an eyedropper.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:06.010
Just the power of their
Inspector is really incredible.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:11.127
For how cheap this tool is and
just that it's such a new tool,

00:22:11.127 --> 00:22:12.710
they've really got
everything covered.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.310
Gaussian Blur-- they don't have
a lot of different filter types

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.870
you can put on an object.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.880
So a filter type would be
like I filled this circle here

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.640
with red, but I could do
it like a Gaussian Blur,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.390
and it would put a
gradient in a certain way.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.770
It would kind of look fuzzy.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.896
Well, you can also
put a texture on it,

00:22:33.896 --> 00:22:37.390
and there's not a lot
of textures in Sketch.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.870
So if you needed like
a special texture,

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.430
you might actually have to
use Photoshop in that way.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.410
They only have a very basic one.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.574
Boolean operations--
so this is kind

00:22:49.574 --> 00:22:51.990
of what I was talking about
where when you need to develop

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.990
something like an icon and
how they're just polygons

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.100
that you kind of put together.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.699
So you have union, which
will just take two objects

00:23:00.699 --> 00:23:02.740
and put them together,
and the left will win out,

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.500
and they'll be the same color.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.110
You have a subtract, which
will take whatever is on top

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:13.830
and erase that from
whatever's on the bottom.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.930
There's an intersect.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.775
I think that one's
pretty obvious

00:23:16.775 --> 00:23:19.107
if you remember set theory.

00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:20.940
And there's a difference,
which it basically

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:25.380
does the same thing as a
union but on the right.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.630
Actually I might've said
that wrong for difference.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.350
But here's something I made
here with Boolean operations.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.412
Does anyone know what this is?

00:23:34.412 --> 00:23:36.300
AUDIENCE: A clock.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.170
MATT WEAR: Yes.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.470
It's a clock.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.610
I got it right.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:41.630
People knew.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.530
That's awesome.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.800
So yeah, like I said,
this is just four circles

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.530
and four rectangles.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.720
What I did was I just
created an oval here.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.240
I just filled it with
black, removed the border.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.160
And then I made a copy of it,
so I made a copy of that oval.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.910
It's the same size right on
top, and I went in the Inspector

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.090
and just resized it
about 20 pixels down.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.420
So you can't see it, because
it's also filled here,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.760
but there's another circle
in the middle that's black,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.880
and then I unioned
them together.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.050
I select both ovals, and
I union them together,

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.140
and it creates the outer rim.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.080
Then I've made a copy
of the big circle

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.090
and scaled it down,
moved it up to the right,

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.470
made another copy, moved
it over to the left.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.120
And I just moved my hands to
the right and said to the left.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.140
That's awesome.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.210
And I was able to
union those together,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.840
and now I have what
looks like a mouse.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.180
I made two rectangles on the
bottom, unioned those together,

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.880
and now I have my two
legs, and then made

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.650
two rectangles in the middle
that are the same size.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:53.200
I resized the one on top, and
then hit the Rotate button.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.920
Selected it and hit
the Rotate button.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.750
As you can see,
there's a little target

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.690
at the bottom of the hand.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.370
That'll show up right in the
middle actually of the object

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:03.530
when you hit Rotate.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.530
You can just drag it with
your mouse all the way

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.310
to the bottom, and just type
in 45 degrees or 15 degrees

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.390
or whatever angle you
want to rotate that,

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.490
and then it'll rotate it
at the new point instead

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.080
of rotating it in the middle.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.200
Pretty cool.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.050
And you rotate it.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.690
You union it.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.340
Change the radius, and you
have an awesome alarm clock

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.630
that you can export and
put in your menu item

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.070
for setting an
alarm, and the range

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.470
of icons you can make, with just
simple polygons is incredible,

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.510
and there's lots of great blog
posts about how to do this.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.140
It's a lot of fun.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.380
So remember, I told you
earlier about creating symbols.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.790
Symbols are really important,
because oftentimes, you'll

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.650
have a symbol like,
say, this alarm

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.446
clock was used on five
different screens in my app.

00:25:52.446 --> 00:25:54.570
I could make a copy of it,
and then I would have it

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.190
in five different places.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.400
And then we could go
to the design meeting,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.596
and the designer as chief
curator would be like, Matt,

00:26:01.596 --> 00:26:02.471
I'm really impressed.

00:26:02.471 --> 00:26:04.929
I'm actually a little afraid
I'm going to lose my job here,

00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:06.590
but you made this
great alarm clock,

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.350
and it needs to be
edited a little bit.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.590
Can you go edit all of them?

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:15.280
So if I created a symbol by just
clicking Create Symbol here,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.070
it'll turn this alarm clock
purple in my layer list.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.390
And that means I can insert
this symbol anywhere else

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.170
in my document.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.525
So let's say I did it right.

00:26:25.525 --> 00:26:29.350
I inserted this symbol
in five different places.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.680
If I edit any one
of those symbols,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.280
it will update all of them.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.140
It's very powerful.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.810
That's why I say it's good
object-oriented design

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:39.425
in design.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:43.330
Very important.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.130
Mask-- like I said, if you need
to clip a bitmap to a shape,

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.200
it's really handy,
as we'll see here.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.330
Here is our favorite
designer at Google,

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.850
Matias Duarte in his awesome
shirts that cost $300,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.390
I looked up, because
I wanted one.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:04.100
And I'm like, $300
is kind of expensive.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.060
So I'll just stick
with Old Navy.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.160
So as you can see
here in my layer list,

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.030
I've got a bitmap in
the back, Matias Duarte.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.120
Say that eight times real fast.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.320
And I have a little rectangle
in the front, and in my design,

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.420
I only have the room for the
rectangle for the bitmap.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.350
So what I need to do is select
both of these as I have done.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.170
You can see them highlighted
in the layer list.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:36.850
And resize that bitmap,
and as you can see, now

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.590
that I've masked it, the
bitmap of Matias Duarte

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.440
is in the middle here.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.290
And that's actually the
rectangle that I clipped to.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.840
And the bitmap is still kind
of visible on the outside

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.110
with the rectangle, and I
can resize those corners,

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.590
and you just kind of have
to picture that there's

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.920
a little window
you're looking through

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.110
to see the bitmap as
you're moving it around.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.530
So just really powerful for if
you needed a profile picture

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.200
in the shape of a circle.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.300
You would just draw an oval,
and put the bitmap behind it,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.280
and then mask them, and then you
can move it around and get it

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.212
right in the face.

00:28:14.212 --> 00:28:15.670
Although when you
go to develop it,

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.220
the bitmap never looks right
and the face is half cut off.

00:28:21.674 --> 00:28:23.590
Then you've got to use
the facial recognition,

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.420
but then it's slow,
and I'm just kidding.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.250
My jokes are great today.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.600
Let's see here.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.690
Text-- so like I said,
text is a huge subject.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.080
But I found two really
helpful things with text.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.320
The first was-- so I
developed an app recently.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.490
It was a children's cartoon, and
they had a very small budget,

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.300
so I got to do the design.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.320
I got paid to do design for
the first time in my life.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.690
I was ecstatic.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.410
And I came, and I presented my
design to their head designer,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.560
because he didn't
have time to do it.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.530
Then he said, you
know, this is great,

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.250
but your text is just
all over the place.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.810
I had 10 different
text sizes, and they

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:11.230
were all different fonts
and weights and styles,

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.830
and he's like, here's
what I would do.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.540
And I'm an expert designer,
so you should listen to me.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.400
Pick three.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.120
Pick three styles, and
just see if you can make

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.750
the whole design with that.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.810
And if you can't, if you
need a fourth, that's fine.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.420
If you can only do it with
two, that's even better.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.110
But just having that
idea-- like every time

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.160
I went to go make new
text, I had a new style.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.510
So just limiting it to three.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:42.325
And then the other one is
to create shared styles.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.650
And with shared
styles, you basically

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.710
have to think about it
like styles in Android.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:58.540
If you know you're going to
use a header style everywhere,

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.440
when you create your text,
go over to the Inspector menu

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.000
here, and create a style.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.550
As you can see, I wrote
header style for this style.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.200
And then when you're out
developing something else,

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.970
you can select the new
text that you're doing,

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.470
and then come here in
the Inspector menu.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.420
And like I said, I've got footer
text here as another style.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.140
It'll actually show you what
it looks like in the Inspector.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.580
And I choose header
text style here,

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.940
and I can reuse my styles.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.740
Really powerful.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.030
And one minor thing with
text-- when you insert text,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.200
you can do it as
auto, and that means

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.700
that when you type
your text, it'll

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.340
just keep going all the
way out to the right.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.339
If you hit a new line,
it'll come back this way,

00:30:36.339 --> 00:30:37.790
and you can type again.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.680
Or you can have it fixed length,
and you just drag a rectangle,

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.180
and as you type,
it'll automatically

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.710
do line breaks on the end.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.480
So if you know in
your design, I only

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.280
want this text to take up
200 dips or 200 pixels,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.700
then you will just
make it fixed.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.980
Exporting-- exporting
is my favorite topic.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.840
I don't know why.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.250
Maybe because I always had to
ask people to export for me,

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.352
and they would take a long
time, and I would just

00:31:05.352 --> 00:31:06.560
have to go surf the internet.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.330
I had no other choice.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.580
So I guess I had other choices.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.660
So exporting is a big topic, so
we'll just start with slices.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.200
And you'll see this little
knife here in your layer list,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.270
and if that's highlighted,
you can see all of your slices

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.460
in your layer list.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.790
I don't have any slices right
now, so we don't see any.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.930
But you want to make sure
that's highlighted if you

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.834
want to be able to see them.

00:31:33.834 --> 00:31:36.250
So to insert a slice, you'll
just come here to your Insert

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.920
menu, and you'll select Slice.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.934
And that will give
you a little rectangle

00:31:40.934 --> 00:31:42.850
that you can drag around,
and you just kind of

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.450
get it perfect on what
you want to slice.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:50.910
And once you drop it,
that'll create a slice.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.466
But what you'll
notice here is I've

00:31:52.466 --> 00:31:53.590
got this purple background.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.520
I don't want to export
the purple background.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.310
I just want the icon,
because it's awesome.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:04.390
So I need to select this
Export Group Contents Only.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.740
But the problem with that is I
haven't organized my document

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:15.060
in my layer list in such a
way where that is actually

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.530
a layer separate from my
background with which I

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.080
can only export that
group's context.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.790
So I just need to reorganize my
layers over here on the left.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.430
As you can see, I put the
background rectangle outside

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.040
of my group of icons, and then
I can select this Export Group

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.240
Contents Only.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.150
And as you see,
the preview shows

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.200
that there's no purple
background that's

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.660
being exported.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.910
So like I said, here's the
actual children's cartoon

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.950
that I did-- app.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.410
And the first episode is free,
and then you scroll down,

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.480
and the other ones were $1.99.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.830
And I designed this whole thing.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.470
I presented it.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.240
It got accepted.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:53.770
Great.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:54.269
All right.

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:57.750
Now I get to develop it, and I
need to export these graphics.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.530
So I searched around on
the web to kind of come up

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.940
with a good strategy
to export designs,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.430
mostly so I could
present it here.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.630
But also just because I
want to be a good designer,

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:12.720
and I came up with this strategy
from reading various blog posts

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.810
that what a lot of
people like to do

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.800
is they like to create a
new page called Exports.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.700
You see my pages here
in my layer list,

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.640
so I create a page
called Exports.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.000
And then I add an artboard
to it that's a big artboard.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.130
So I put an A4 size,
and I renamed it to Res.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.940
So whatever your artboard
name is, when you export,

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.252
it'll put them in that folder.

00:33:34.252 --> 00:33:35.710
So I put Res,
because that's what's

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:38.210
going to be in Android Studio.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.421
And I created symbols for my
Play button and my Disable Play

00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:44.170
button, because those
are used everywhere.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.780
And when I update them, I want
them to update everywhere.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.760
And I created a bunch of slices
for all the other graphics,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:56.190
for the logo, for all of my
episodes, for my background.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:00.680
And I select all those just
by hitting Shift and clicking

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.970
on all my layers, and
then I can go down--

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.730
you see there's an Export menu
available on the bottom right

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.750
now, and all I do is
I just go down here.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.300
So this tool, if there's
anything that's wrong with it,

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.050
it's a little more
geared to iOS.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.619
You have this mirror
option here up

00:34:18.619 --> 00:34:20.469
in the toolbar that I
didn't discuss about,

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:23.389
but that's to mirror your
design on an iOS device.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:28.280
So I spite that icon every
time I look at, but anyways.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.590
And I love iOS actually.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.060
I used an iPhone
once, but then I

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.210
had to go back to
Android right away.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:38.020
So I have an Export menu
here, and what I'm saying

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.179
is I want to export all
these graphics at 1x size

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:46.620
and I want to append-- put
a suffix on the end of MDPI

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.980
for that file.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.280
And then I want one
that's 1.5, which is HDPI

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.050
so the file needs to be
named HDPI, and a 2x and a 3x

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:57.550
with the corresponding density.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:01.320
And then I just hit
Export, and it puts

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.150
all those files in one folder.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:09.200
So I've got four of
each one of my files

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.930
that I exported, which isn't
great for Android Studio,

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.050
because you need them
named a certain way.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.270
So I have this
quick shell script

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.580
here that I just paste
to wherever I put it--

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.020
in this case, the desktop.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.380
I switch directory to the
desktop, and I just go through,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.250
and I name all the
XXHDPIs and put them

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.830
in a drawable.xxhdpi folder,
and the same with all

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:34.982
the other densities.

00:35:34.982 --> 00:35:36.440
And then I just
have one Res folder

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.760
with all of my density folders.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.990
I drop it right in
Android Studio, and bam.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.620
I'm ready to develop.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.550
I got this idea
from this link here

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.160
at the bottom of the slide.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.180
But there's actually an
even better way to do this,

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.680
and everyone who is using
Sketch in their design process

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.350
should absolutely be using
this, because it's awesome.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:01.540
And that is-- unless you don't
want to-- that is Zeplin.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.930
Zeplin is a tool to help
designers and developers

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.330
collaborate.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:09.110
It's amazing.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.830
So you can download it.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.620
It's a Sketch plug-in, and so
when you go to Export, instead

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.190
of doing the whole menu like
I did earlier, all you do

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.970
is come over here to Plug-ins,
and hit Export Selected

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.290
Artboards.

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.990
And then you'll open up Zeplin.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.470
It has a web interface if
someone doesn't have a Mac,

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.720
but this is the Mac app.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.160
And you can see
all the artboards

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.740
that you've exported
for this project.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.080
So I'll jump in here
to the Res artboard.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.480
And you can put comments,
so I put a comment here.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.219
Make sure to put this
without a margin.

00:36:39.219 --> 00:36:40.510
So your designer could do that.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.343
If you didn't understand,
you could respond.

00:36:42.343 --> 00:36:43.930
It'll give you a notification.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.600
You can respond.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.920
It's a great way to collaborate.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.590
But you can see all
of your assets here.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.650
You can see the colors that
are involved and whatnot.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.790
Probably the most powerful
feature I've found

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.630
is you can see the
exported screen,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.900
and you can just kind of
hover around with your mouse,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.170
and you can see exactly how
many dips each piece is apart

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.620
from each other.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.680
I have grown so weary
of contacting designers

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.040
to make sure I've got the
right spacing and whatnot,

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.160
and obviously, a lot of times
I just kind of eyeball it.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.320
But this is amazing.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.310
The designer is an expert
at what they're doing.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.060
They're getting
paid a lot of money.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.080
On your team, they're
a crucial aspect,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.220
and they know how much
they want things spaced.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.990
And now you can just
easily come here

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.200
to Zeplin and kind
of hover around

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.490
and see how much space
is between everything,

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.940
how big icons are, and whatnot.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.030
And you can just click
on the Assets tab,

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.920
and it'll automatically
let you download

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.940
all of the exported
assets for every DPI

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.900
and put them straight
into Android Studio.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.320
This tool is just so powerful.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.740
I highly recommend it.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.450
So just kind of an overview
of what we did today.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:38:00.030
We talked about what Sketch is.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.560
We did a quick and dirty
how to get into Sketch

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.690
and do a material template and
pull things into an artboard

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.976
and kind of have something
that's kind of working.

00:38:07.976 --> 00:38:09.350
And then we went
into a deep dive

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.940
of all the features of
Sketch and how to navigate it

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.530
and what to do with those
quick and dirty pieces

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.930
you pulled in, and then
how to export it and get it

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.880
into Android Studio so that
you can create a great app

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.230
or contribute in
a design meeting.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.290
So I really appreciate
everyone listening today,

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.990
and I hope that if you
have any questions,

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.910
contact me on Twitter.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.660
I'm Parallelcross
or there's my email.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:39.260
And hopefully, you will have
gained a little more interest

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.390
in Sketch, and
maybe it'll help you

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.580
one day in communicating
with your designers,

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.440
so I appreciate it.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.835
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:51.440
Are there any questions?

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.028
Yes.

00:38:58.028 --> 00:39:01.444
AUDIENCE: I've used Sketch
for about 15 minutes.

00:39:01.444 --> 00:39:04.616
When you drag around it has
kind of suggestions for where

00:39:04.616 --> 00:39:06.146
you can anchor certain things.

00:39:06.146 --> 00:39:06.812
MATT WEAR: Yeah.

00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:08.276
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any suggestions?

00:39:08.276 --> 00:39:09.496
Because I feel
like a lot of times

00:39:09.496 --> 00:39:11.204
it doesn't anchor to the object
that I want it to anchor to.

00:39:11.204 --> 00:39:12.329
Can you tell us about that?

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:14.350
MATT WEAR: Right.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:14.850
Yeah.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.170
So the question was
like when you're

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:19.540
dragging around
something in Sketch--

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.650
how about I open Sketch
here, and we'll just do it?

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.000
So I've opened Sketch.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:33.030
So the question was basically,
say, I've created a rectangle,

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.470
and say I've created an oval
just by hitting O and X,

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.980
and I need to organize
these so they're lined up.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.510
And you can see
there's guidelines

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.075
as you move stuff around.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.890
So you can see how sometimes it
could be hard with the mouse,

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:50.820
because a mouse
isn't super precise.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.750
So one thing you can do is
select multiple objects,

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.930
and you have this
little menu up here--

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.760
you've got to hit Shift--
in the right that'll

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.030
help you kind of align things.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.820
So these will both align them
to the left, side, the middle,

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.610
to the right, the tops are
aligned, and stuff like that.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.380
And obviously, you can look
at the Inspector too and see,

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.765
OK, this one is 286
high, and I need

00:40:15.765 --> 00:40:19.480
it to be 290, so you plus 4.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.181
And then you can make
this one 290 also.

00:40:23.181 --> 00:40:25.430
Now they're the same size,
but they're not necessarily

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:29.930
lined up, so you want to select
it here and line their tops,

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.640
and now they're the same.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.570
Pretty cool.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.400
And of course, the
questioner said they've only

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.650
played with it for 15 minutes.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.180
It's a very intuitive
tool, and you

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.560
run into little things
like that all the time,

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.520
and it's pretty
easy to figure out.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.485
Yes.

00:40:46.485 --> 00:40:51.410
AUDIENCE: Other than Zeplin,
what other plug-ins do you use?

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.330
MATT WEAR: I haven't
gone too deep.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.990
So the question was, what
other plug-ins besides Zeplin

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.530
do I use?

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.363
I haven't gone too deep
into other plug-ins,

00:40:58.363 --> 00:41:02.220
but the plug-ins around
Sketch are numerous.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.180
I mean there are so
many that you can use.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.360
And it's built in, so if
you come File here, and New

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.220
from Template, you can pick
Material Design, iOS, Web,

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.340
and all that.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.600
And you can actually export all
your styles built in to CSS,

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.110
but there's tons
of other plug-ins

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.382
too that you could use.

00:41:22.382 --> 00:41:24.215
That's built in, but
there's other plug-ins.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.500
Anyone else?

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.260
Yes.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.126
AUDIENCE: So I've
used it a little bit

00:41:32.126 --> 00:41:33.834
and one of the things
that I've struggled

00:41:33.834 --> 00:41:37.387
with is trying to understand or
figure out how I should lay out

00:41:37.387 --> 00:41:39.720
artboards and whether I should
do [INAUDIBLE] artboards.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.400
MATT WEAR: Yeah.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.233
AUDIENCE: What is the
flow you use for that?

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:44.054
How do you work around that?

00:41:44.054 --> 00:41:45.470
MATT WEAR: That's
a good question.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.220
I don't know if I have
a good one or not,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.910
but one thing that
I like to do is it's

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.920
like you're reading a book.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.430
What happens first is top left
corner, and then as it happens,

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:01.950
it goes bottom, down, right,
and that's how I organize it.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:02.900
But I don't know.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.359
There's probably
better strategies.

00:42:04.359 --> 00:42:06.233
That's a good question,
but the question was,

00:42:06.233 --> 00:42:07.920
how do you organize
your artboards?

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.950
And that's my strategy.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.300
Just like reading a
book, top to left.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:16.030
Say the first screen
is a master detail,

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.260
and there's a list
on the first screen.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.121
I would put my detail
to the right of it.

00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:21.620
And then if you
scroll down to that,

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.410
it might go down
one on that level.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.992
But I don't have a
good strategy honestly.

00:42:25.992 --> 00:42:27.575
AUDIENCE: The part
where I had trouble

00:42:27.575 --> 00:42:31.940
is the different states,
like the tree that it becomes

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.880
if I have to go through
different [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.016
in the same screen and figuring
out what the best way is

00:42:36.016 --> 00:42:36.557
to show that.

00:42:36.557 --> 00:42:37.600
MATT WEAR: Yeah.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.920
That's a good point.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.514
Yes, sir.

00:42:39.514 --> 00:42:41.930
AUDIENCE: Do you use a different
artboard for each screen?

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.762
Like if you open the
master [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:48.080
do you use a different
artboard for that?

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.190
MATT WEAR: Yes.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.520
So the question was, do
you use different artboards

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.040
for different screens?

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.420
And that's exactly what I do.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.700
So I'll like insert an artboard.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.670
You can actually just click
on the canvas and hit A.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.390
And so I'll put a portrait
here, and let's say this

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:08.460
one's-- and I could rename it
here in the menu as a master.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.970
I can either just copy it
here with the Control Paste,

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:16.640
and it'll move one over, or I
could just click on the canvas

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.112
again, and hit A, and
then pick another one,

00:43:20.112 --> 00:43:21.070
and it'll put it there.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.528
And I could rename
this one Detail.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.730
And then paste wherever
I want there and whatnot.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.380
I am not a designer at all, so
this is really a powerful tool

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.360
to be able to get in
here really quickly.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.442
Yes, sir.

00:43:37.442 --> 00:43:39.750
AUDIENCE: I came in half way.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.500
MATT WEAR: Are you a designer?

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.990
I apologize.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.910
He said yes.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.637
AUDIENCE: So is
this a good tool--

00:43:47.637 --> 00:43:52.547
I'm just getting my feet wet in
even learning code or anything

00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:54.020
like that so [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.240
MATT WEAR: Oh, awesome.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.080
That's great, man.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.395
That's really cool
that you're doing that.

00:44:01.395 --> 00:44:02.436
AUDIENCE: It's all right.

00:44:02.436 --> 00:44:04.654
It's really overwhelming.

00:44:04.654 --> 00:44:07.124
Is this something
that would be easier

00:44:07.124 --> 00:44:09.100
to use in workflow
than something

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.534
like Illustrator or Photoshop.

00:44:11.534 --> 00:44:12.200
MATT WEAR: Yeah.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.866
So the question was,
is it easier to use

00:44:13.866 --> 00:44:15.930
than Photoshop or Illustrator?

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:19.340
And I think for screen
design, it's way easier.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.190
But that's just from
personal experience

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:24.120
of trying to learn Illustrator
and trying to learn Photoshop

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.890
and failing
miserably every time.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:29.120
So I was able to
pick this tool up

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.550
in an afternoon, where
Photoshop and Illustrator

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.060
I've tried dozens of
times to do simple things,

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.120
and I fail miserably.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.730
So I think it meets the use case
a lot better of like designing

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.020
a screen than Photoshop.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:49.136
I think if you're going to like
brush up skin or something,

00:44:49.136 --> 00:44:51.010
then it might be a lot
harder than Photoshop,

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:55.060
or if you're going to make
a really intricate design,

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.760
maybe not as good
as Illustrator.

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.389
Is that all the questions or?

00:45:05.389 --> 00:45:07.680
When you ask it that way,
it's kind of like, all right,

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.820
are you all done yet?

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.010
Well, I really appreciate you
all listening to the talk,

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:18.060
especially since there are other
great talks going on right now.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.060
You all have a good day.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:19.660
Thanks.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.860
