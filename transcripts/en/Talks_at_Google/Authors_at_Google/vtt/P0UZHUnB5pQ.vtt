00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:07.770
MALE SPEAKER: OK, then.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.530
Now we today have the
honor or welcoming

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.430
a man who knows more
about stories than anyone

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.620
else I can think of and
who recently also chose

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.120
to share his knowledge
in this book.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.610
So it's a great opportunity.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.550
John Yorke is the
managing director

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.950
of Company Pictures, the
UK drama independent,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.310
producing "Skins,"
"Shameless," "The White Queen,"

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.640
and "Wolf Hall."

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.890
For many years, he's been
responsible for a vast array

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.730
of British drama, as both
head of Channel 4 drama

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.880
and controller of
BBC drama production.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.490
In 2005, he created the
BBC Writers Academy,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.860
a year-long in depth
training scheme which

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.040
has produced a generation of
successful television writers.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.690
He's also worked as
editor of "The Archers."

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.840
He is currently a visiting
professor of English language

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.660
and literature at the University
of New Castle upon Tyne.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.190
So I would like for us all
to give a round of applause

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.696
as a welcome to John Yorke.

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.612
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.980
JOHN YORKE: Thank you so much
for those generous words.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.370
I shall begin with a
thank you and apology.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.590
Firstly a thank you.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.470
I'm hugely flattered to be asked
to come and talk here today.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.962
It means something
very much to me.

00:01:19.962 --> 00:01:21.420
And second an
apology, because what

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.560
I'm going to try and
do in the next 35,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.750
40 minutes is tell the
whole history and mechanics

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.314
of how all
storytelling has worked

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:30.480
since the beginning of time.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.210
So if I rush through that
slightly, please forgive me.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.150
I'm going to take
loads of shortcuts,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.230
make loads of absurd
generalizations, loads

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.090
of things where you may go, ahh.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.900
But if you feel like
going ahh, then please do.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.550
Please do stop me
and ask questions.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.450
It's absolutely fine.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.600
I'll try and leave
some time at the end.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.950
But in the interest of
brevity and moving on,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.240
what I'm going to
talk about today

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.600
is what I'm going to
call story physics.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.980
I'm going to talk about
how the narrative works

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.170
and explore the similarities
between narrative

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.020
in film and television,
but also hopefully touch

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.600
on theater, novel, and
narrative in life, about how

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.310
we tell stories about
the institutions

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.260
we work in, about our history,
and how perhaps, arguably, they

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.675
all work in exactly
the same way.

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:23.920
And perhaps that has something
to do with the laws of physics.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.589
OK, so that's really what
I want to do in a nutshell.

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.880
So I want to begin with a
quote from Andrew Stanton who

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.800
worked for Pixar, and
some of maybe will know,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.576
directed the film,
"Finding Nemo."

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:38.004
And I came across this
quote some years ago.

00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:39.420
He said, "You often
hear the term,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.310
'You should have something
to say in a story,' but that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.600
doesn't always mean a message.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.810
It means truth, some
value that you yourself

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.124
as a storyteller
believe in and then

00:02:48.124 --> 00:02:49.540
through the course
of the story be

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.260
able to do the
debate that truth.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.120
Try to prove it wrong.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.020
Test it to its limits.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.190
This is the stuff I
really geek out on.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.980
I call this 'Story Physics."

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.600
And story physics,
that whole subject

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.280
of something confronted
by its opposite,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.010
is really the heart
of what I want

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.900
to talk about this afternoon.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.360
Now I want to begin
with a clip, if I may.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.820
The first clip, it's from
"EastEnders," which some of you

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.910
may be familiar with, from about
20 years ago, which ages me.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.560
Because I was the script
editor on this very clip.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.190
I suspect half of you probably
weren't even born or not

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.180
allowed by your
parents to watch it.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.950
But shall we have a quick look.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.617
It's about two minutes long.

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:35.950
Hopefully it's self-explanatory.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.930
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.405
-Talk to me.

00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:44.365
-I've got enough problems
without that, Bianca.

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:45.220
Oh come on.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.345
Don't look at me like that.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.639
-I just keep making such a
stupid fool out of myself.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.954
-No you don't.

00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:57.650
It's all right.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.191
I understand.

00:03:58.191 --> 00:03:59.698
Don't worry.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:00.572
-I'm embarrassed now.

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:03.130
-Don't-- don't cry.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.630
It's nothing to
be embarrassed of.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.340
It's only me.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.590
I'm not going to say anything.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.296
-I feel really stupid.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.262
-Oh, come here.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.770
Oh, you're a silly
thing, aren't you?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.270
Hey.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.269
I'll sing you a lullaby.

00:04:22.975 --> 00:04:24.923
Hmm?

00:04:24.923 --> 00:04:26.871
-No.

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:27.845
Kiss me.

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:32.715
-There.

00:04:32.715 --> 00:04:34.663
That do?

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:36.611
Feel better?

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:39.464
-Now kiss me properly.

00:04:39.464 --> 00:04:40.953
-No.

00:04:40.953 --> 00:04:43.494
I don't think that's-- I don't
think that's such a good idea,

00:04:43.494 --> 00:04:43.994
Bianca.

00:04:43.994 --> 00:04:44.919
-Why not?

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.085
-Look, Bianca, you're drunk.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.140
You don't know
what you're doing.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.560
-Why don't you like me?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.206
-Yes.

00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:52.080
Yes, I do.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.836
I like you a lot.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:55.782
Don't do that.

00:04:55.782 --> 00:04:56.282
Hey.

00:04:56.282 --> 00:04:58.210
Don't do that.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.060
Bianca, stop it.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.560
Look--

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.227
-I like you too.

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:00.726
-Stop it.

00:05:00.726 --> 00:05:02.230
This is something
you will regret.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.938
Now just stop it.

00:05:02.938 --> 00:05:03.830
-No, I won't.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.240
-Bianco, cut it out, will you?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.090
Just cut it out.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.105
I'm sorry, but this ain't on.

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:11.530
Do you know what I mean?

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.065
-No, I don't as it goes.

00:05:13.065 --> 00:05:14.780
-It's nothing personal.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.290
-That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard you say.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.630
-Yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.533
It is.

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:21.640
-But then why not?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.848
I mean, what's wrong with me?

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:24.440
Why's no one like me?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.756
-I do like you.

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:26.430
I do.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.950
I like you very much.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.180
-Well then why--

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.320
-We just can't.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.980
OK?

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.810
We can't.

00:05:35.128 --> 00:05:37.498
-But I want you, David.

00:05:37.498 --> 00:05:38.650
-No, you don't, Bianca.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.650
Look, really, you don't.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.701
Believe me.

You've been drinking, darling.

You don't know what
you're-- what you're doing,

00:05:44.908 --> 00:05:46.380
alone what you want.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.310
-I do.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.170
I want you.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.902
You want me as well, don't you?

don't do this to me.

trying to drive me insane?

Bianca, you can only
push a bloke so far.

Do you know what I mean?

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.380
-Well, why?

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.220
What have I done?

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.392
-You know what you did.

00:06:09.392 --> 00:06:10.374
-Well, damn, why not?

00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:12.829
I mean, what's your problem?

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:14.302
-I'm your father, all right?

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.208
-No, you ain't.

And I am.

I'm-- I'm really, really sorry.

00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:48.034
You shouldn't have
found out like this.

Yeah.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.924

00:06:52.924 --> 00:06:54.391
-Don't.

00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:58.320
Don't touch me.

00:07:07.744 --> 00:07:09.410
JOHN YORKE: I'm not
sure you're supposed

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.840
to laugh quite that much.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.730
It's fine.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.730
It's rather dated.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.050
And it is what it is.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.270
But what I want to use it
to, say, illustrate hopefully

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.290
a deeper point.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.320
For years, I set up the
BBC Writer's Academy.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.570
And my job has been to
teach people storytelling.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.850
And I developed this
ridiculously shorthand,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.690
ridiculously simplistic
way of trying

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.750
to analyze how a story
works if you get stuck.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.630
And I came up with a system,
which if you ask 10 questions

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.420
and you could answer them all,
probably that will give you

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.590
a story shape.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.030
And as those 10 were
questions, very quickly,

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.400
whose story is it?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.630
What's the flaw in
their character?

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.470
What's the inciting incident?

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.730
What do they want?

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.220
What obstacles are in their way?

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.430
What's at stake?

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.220
Why should we care?

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.820
What do they learn?

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.135
How and why do they change?

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:03.890
And how does it end?

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.930
OK, so very simple,
again, simplistic

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.940
for obvious reasons-- brevity.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.471
But you take those 10 questions.

00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:14.470
Let's have a look at that
scene we've just seen.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.870
Because it applies
to whole stories.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.940
it applies to
episodes of stories.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.690
But it also applies
to scenes themselves,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.800
because dramatic
structure is fractal.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.290
So it's the same units
enlarged time and time again.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.300
So if we take David's story,
and again simplistic answers,

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.049
who's story is it?

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.500
Well, it's David's, obviously.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.330
What's his flaw?

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.809
Well, he has a knowledge
the he hasn't imparted,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.070
which is I'm your
father, obviously.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.600
This was before "Star Wars," I'd
like to make this quite clear.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.080
What's the inciting incident?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.080
What's the event that sparks
off the problem, the catalyst?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.250
Bianca tries to kiss him.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.270
What does he want?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.000
Well, he wants to
stop her kissing him.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.730
Sort of.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.700
What obstacles are in his way?

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.420
Well, obviously, Bianca.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.560
It's very simple.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.120
And then we move
on, what's at stake?

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.220
Well, his mental state,
I think we can probably

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:11.630
say, a few laws perhaps as well.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.210
Why should we care?

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.080
Well, hopefully we like
the character-- not like,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.210
but there's something about
him that we care about.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:19.910
He's vulnerable.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.430
We empathize with him.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.856
What does he learn?

00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:24.590
He learns to tell the truth.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.970
How and why?

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.690
Bianca pushes him to
the point of no return,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.817
sexual arousal, et cetera.

00:09:30.817 --> 00:09:32.400
Because at some
level, clearly there's

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.070
something going on that he's
very uncomfortable with.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.870
How does it end?

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.900
The knowledge is imparted.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.080
OK, so very
simplistic, but it will

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.160
do as a kind of rule of thumb.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.980
Let's have a look at Bianca
and what Bianca does.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.227
Because what if
it's Bianca's story?

00:09:48.227 --> 00:09:49.060
And what do you get?

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.810
Whose story is it?

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.750
Well, obviously, it's Bianca's.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.736
What's her flaw?

00:09:52.736 --> 00:09:54.735
Well, it's a lack of
knowledge of the situation.

00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:56.460
It's her innocence.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.220
What's the inciting incident?

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.200
He rejects her.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.230
She wants to sleep with him.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.810
What obstacles are in their way?

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.135
Well, David and
David's behavior.

00:10:08.135 --> 00:10:09.590
What's at stake?

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.980
Her mental state.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.300
Why should we care?

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.270
Arguably, she's vulnerable.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.145
Two, what does she learn?

00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:19.680
She's going to learn
to deny the truth.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.270
How and why?

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.640
David pushes her to
the point of no return.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.710
How does it end?

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.300
Truth rejected-- "No you ain't.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.190
Get away from me."

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.500
OK, so again, very
simple, I've brought it

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.380
right down to absolute basics.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.020
But clearly, there's
a pattern going on.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.220
And what this pattern,
I think, introduces to,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.360
which is really the heart of
the physics and the physics

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.290
that underpin story
I want to talk today,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.180
is about this, this
extraordinary universe

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.600
of opposites.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.790
So here's the pitch document
for "The Wire," which

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.992
David Simon wrote
and sent to HBO.

00:10:55.992 --> 00:10:57.450
And in the pitch
document, he says,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.870
"Suddenly the police bureaucracy
is amoral, dysfunctional,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.730
and criminality in the
form of the drug culture

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.320
is just as suddenly
a bureaucracy."

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.860
All of "The Wire," all of
five series of "The Wire,"

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.555
are built on exactly
the same engine.

00:11:12.555 --> 00:11:18.879
It's two sides slowly changing
places over five seasons.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:21.170
What I'm going to answer--
hopefully by the end of this

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.670
I'll come some way
to convincing you

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.657
that opposites are the
root of everything.

00:11:27.657 --> 00:11:29.490
And you can see this,
I think, quite clearly

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.590
by just looking of any drama
you've seen in the last week,

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.620
the last month, any book you've
read, any image you find,

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.550
opposites.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.642
Opposites again.

00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:44.550
I'm sorry, that's a
very bad quality images.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.280
That is a shark.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.501
And apparently I once looked
a bit like him as well.

00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:49.500
Anyway, so there you go.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.060
So opposites again,
complete opposites.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.630
So on a story level-- I
just plucked these at random

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:03.180
this morning-- every character
is thrown into a world which

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.710
is absolutely
opposite of the world

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.915
they start in-- not
just vaguely opposite,

00:12:08.915 --> 00:12:11.740
but absolutely opposite.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.290
So Avatar are
captured by natives.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.580
James Bond, Goldfinger,
classic opposites.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.360
The Queen has no empathy.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.530
Diana dies.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.340
She's thrown into a world
where she has to feel.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.760
"The King's Speech,"
classic opposite.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.200
Mad Australian, in his
view, I should add.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.150
"120 Hours," a man who
believes in absolutely freedom,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.800
running through the
wilderness, trapped.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.650
"The Social Network,"
Jewish insecure

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:46.280
geek thrown into big WASP world
of unimaginable privilege.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.380
"12 Years a Slave," of
course, is absolutely

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.820
built on the dialectic
of freedom and slavery.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.730
"Rush," Nikki Hunt and
Lauda, obviously opposites.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.590
"Gravity,"
companionship, solitude.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:05.820
OK, they all very clearly
embrace these two states

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.814
and are about the transition
from one state into another.

00:13:09.814 --> 00:13:11.230
On a scene level,
for those of you

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.329
old enough, on "EastEnders,"
probably the biggest

00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:15.370
moments in "EastEnder's"
history, or one of them,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.620
"You can't tell me what to do.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.850
You ain't my mother."

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.610
Kat, "Yes, I am."

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.110
OK, it's very simple.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.402
They're absolutely opposite
in every conceivable way.

00:13:26.402 --> 00:13:28.110
And then if you go to
British television,

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.940
if you go back in the history,
that's about 30 years old now,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.830
"Edge of Darkness," Bob Peck.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.396
His daughter's been murdered.

00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:35.770
He goes and looks
in her bedroom,

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.540
because he can't
understand what's happened.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.640
And he finds a teddy bear.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.480
And he finds a gun.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.090
And the whole of the series is
about how does that make sense.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.150
In the end, he finds
out why and how.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.710
"Line of Duty"-- apologies
for the image-- but again,

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.021
very clear opposites in
those two characters.

00:13:56.021 --> 00:13:57.520
That's series one
of "Line of Duty."

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.920
Forgive, these are largely
BBC and British examples.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.620
So forgive me.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.550
"Line of Duty," series
two, those two, very clear

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.800
emotionally opposites.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.250
And if you go back again
to one of the great shows

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.000
of British television, a
man with terrible psoriasis

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.370
lying in a hospital
bed, fantasizing

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.545
of being the coolest
detective this side

00:14:17.545 --> 00:14:20.450
of Humphrey Bogart in the 1930s.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.640
He fantasizes the opposite
state for himself.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.070
And then we get to sidekicks.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.900
I mean, this could go
on for a long time.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.600
But clearly they're built
on something more than just,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.550
oh, well that's interesting,
says the writer.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.020
I'll do that.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.960
And they always, if you go back
as far as [INAUDIBLE], which

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.985
is 1973, I believe--
I can go back

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:45.740
as far as I could in
television terms--

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.520
what you start to
realize is story physics,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.910
this whole thing of
opposites, is everywhere.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.680
So why?

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.545
What is going on?

00:14:55.545 --> 00:14:58.130
It doesn't make sense.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.460
So any of you who've studied
screenwriting at all,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.960
or have a vague or parting
interest in screenwriting,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.490
may have heard of this guy,
Syd Field who in the 1970s

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.130
wrote this book.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.060
And Syd Field was
the first person

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.010
to try and articulate
how storytelling

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:19.300
worked in Hollywood.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.530
And he basically came up with
an archetype, a paradigm,

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.240
with three acts.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.100
He certainly wasn't the
first person to notice it.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.960
But he was the first person to
write it down, articulate it,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.130
and use it as a
teaching tool, which

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.070
allows him to create an
industry, which has grown

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.330
insanely to the level of today,
where screenwriting teaching is

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.370
one of the biggest industries
outside of cinema making

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.470
itself.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.430
So he created a simple paradigm.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.940
There's a three-act structure--
setup, confrontation,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.990
and revolution.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.830
Revolution?

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.490
Resolution.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.240
That would be interesting.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.190
OK, and between each
stage, a turning

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.520
point at the end of each act.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.280
So act one, set up;
act two, confrontation;

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.595
act three, resolution.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.731
Now, this carried
on for 20 years,

00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:13.230
and there were
thousands more books,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.850
notably by people like
Christopher Vogler and Robert

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.050
McKee, in 2000.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.170
And they largely
stick to the adherence

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.130
to the three-act form.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:27.980
But what's interesting about
all these books is none of them

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.770
say why.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.930
There is no articulation of why.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.940
They say, you must have an
inciting incident on page 12,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.660
but they don't tell you what
font size you're writing in.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.890
So it can't make any sense.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.495
It doesn't have any
intellectual rigor.

00:16:44.495 --> 00:16:47.120
And it seems to me that the most
important thing about studying

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.650
narrative is if you say these
things, you have to prove them.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.630
It's basic science.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.020
You have to approach
it like science.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.330
But one of two people
did make a breakthrough.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.250
There's a man called [INAUDIBLE]
he was a Hungarian theater

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.740
critic in the 1960s, and then
later the American playwright

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.930
David Mamet started to realize
that there was a pattern.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.680
And it was a pattern
that is effectively

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.160
based on the act of perception.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.924
So how do we perceive the world?

00:17:18.924 --> 00:17:22.200
There's a babe-- forgive
the graphics-- snatched.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.880
Slightly random.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.390
There's a baby.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.420
And there's a match.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.740
If the baby touches
the match, the baby

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.450
learns not to touch
the match again.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:30.990
Isn't it?

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.760
It's very simple.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.880
It's I exist.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.650
I perceive the world.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.940
I change.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.180
You come to this talk today.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.610
You listen to me.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:46.580
And you decide what you
think of me, what I'm saying.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.807
You may think I talk rubbish.

00:17:47.807 --> 00:17:48.640
I may think I don't.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.740
That's absolutely fine.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.630
But the process will happen
whether you like it or not.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.870
You can't help but
come to some conclusion

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.967
about what you perceive.

00:17:56.967 --> 00:17:58.550
I'm sure you do
this-- well, of course

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.170
you do this in your
jobs every day.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.220
OK, so fundamentally,
what we're saying

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.430
is we think dialectically--
thesis, antithesis,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.070
and synthesis.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.975
So it's all built around
Hegel's theory of dialectics.

00:18:13.975 --> 00:18:17.290
Though it goes back
much further than that.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.480
So the fundamental process
by which humans assimilate

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:27.320
knowledge-- we exist, we find
something new, we explore it,

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.080
we assimilate it, and we change.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.140
And of course, what we're
doing because of that is

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.040
we're ordering the world.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.380
We're turning the
world into narrative.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.790
Because the world without order
is overwhelming, and scary,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:49.080
and unimaginable, and
terrifying, and makes no sense.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.120
So we tell ourselves
stories to make it safe.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.200
And there is no better example
of the company we sit in today,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.820
in ordering, sifting,
making sense of the world

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.300
in an extraordinary way.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.030
So every act of
perception, therefore,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.180
is an attempt to impose order.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.590
So every time we come across
alien phenomena, we explore it.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.840
We find its essential truth.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.330
And then we assimilate it.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.650
So we test it, hopefully
scientifically,

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.250
but often with the prejudices
we've already learned.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.350
We just bring those to
bear and change again.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:29.200
And that's how that
process changes us.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.320
So fundamentally,
storytelling therefore

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.110
is a manifestation
of this process.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.246
This is three acts.

00:19:35.246 --> 00:19:36.620
It doesn't have
to be three acts.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.030
And I'll come back
to that later.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.310
But fundamentally,
each stage is an act.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.480
Something confronted
by its opposite

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.550
learns, and assimilates,
and changes.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.160
So typically in
Hollywood, what you see

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.260
is a character with a flaw.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.040
And in the second
act, you confront them

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:04.090
with their absolute opposite,
so King George VI, Lionel Logue,

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.530
learns not to stutter.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.935
It sounds simplistic,
doesn't it?

00:20:07.935 --> 00:20:12.390
But fundamentally, that's
sort of how structure works.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.780
So you take any Pixar film.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.530
I picked three at random.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.200
Obviously you have Woody in the
first "Toy Story," benevolent

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.020
dictator, controlling,
thrown out of the window

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.090
into a world he
can't control, has

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:29.280
to make friends and ask
other people their opinion,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.950
gets back home.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.530
"Finding Nemo," again, Tom
Hanks controlling father,

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.530
child disappears,
thrown into chaos,

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.680
learns to allow
the child to play.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.740
"Cars," Lightning McQueen,
arrogant, brattish sports

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.330
car, lost in the middle
of a small American town,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.120
learns the values
of friendship, love,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.250
and you don't have to
drive very fast everywhere.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.210
It's very simplistic,
but when it's done well,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.827
it's very effecting as well.

00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:02.660
So I picked those at
random, because they're

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.701
very good examples of good
commercial properties.

00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:06.830
But you will find this
in art house movies

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.186
absolutely as well.

00:21:08.186 --> 00:21:09.810
But fundamentally,
what we're saying is

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.420
the Hollywood
archetype is dialectics

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.820
in its most simplified form.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.080
So act one, you
establish a character.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.250
Act two, you confront
it with their opposite.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.960
And act three, you synthesize
the two to achieve balance.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.390
And yet again, if you want to
talk about art house books,

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.370
you take something like
the film David Hare

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:31.905
adapted of the Schlink
book "The Reader."

00:21:31.905 --> 00:21:34.190
And you have a young
boy who falls in love

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.170
with a woman who's
older than him.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.810
She suddenly disappears.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.600
Years later she
discovers she's been

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.030
arrested for being
a Nazi camp guard.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.510
And in the third act,
he condemns her utterly.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.050
And in the third act when
he starts to understand why

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.510
and what happened to her,
he starts to forgive her.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.800
So the same shape resolves
itself again and again.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.970
It's not just in Pixar films.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.820
And so something that was
going on long before someone

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.689
came along and
codified it has been

00:22:01.689 --> 00:22:03.230
going on since the
beginning of time.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.480
Because of course you
see the very same pattern

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.650
in "Antigone."

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.600
It's Antigone and Creon.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.910
They're opposites, aren't they?

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.920
You see it in Socratic dialogue.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.492
It's all built on
opposites, like I'm sure

00:22:14.492 --> 00:22:19.280
an awful lot of what you do
build on opposites as well.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.980
So it forms the basic
structural model, not just of

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.080
every feature film,
but what I would argue

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.537
is all narrative as well.

00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:29.120
So storytelling
becomes a codification

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.950
of the essential method
by which we learn,

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:36.840
expressed in a three
act dramatic shape.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.550
OK.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.770
So if you're drawing
the Hollywood paradigm,

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.950
that's what it looks
like, fundamentally.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.490
What you also notice is
the symmetry in this.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.890
And you find this in [INAUDIBLE]
perfectly structured films.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.750
Act two, handedly divided
straight down the middle there.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.160
It's double the length of
the first and last act.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.890
There's something about
human beings' attraction

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.310
to symmetry when
they create narrative

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.810
that becomes very attractive.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.160
But also if you're doing
difficult narrative,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.640
you can bust that symmetry up.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:15.620
And you create dissonance, which
has its own effects as well.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.314
So the closer you look,
the more these rules apply.

00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:20.730
But there's one
area in particular

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.520
that I wanted to dwell on
to show how deep this goes.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.070
Because I think it's probably
the most unseen area of all,

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:33.333
and that is the area of
character and characterization.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.810
So there we go.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.000
Some of you may
recognize this chap.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.400
He was head of [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.585
Paul Flowers.

00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:49.420
He was a Methodist
minister, highly respected

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.730
member of the establishment.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.470
And then "The Daily Mail,"
with typical "Mail" gusto,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.400
exposed him as a man hiring
rent boys and buying crack

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.260
with them, and hence collapse
of career, shame, et cetera, et

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.010
cetera.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.180
Same person, obviously.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.910
It's a common trope.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.160
So really what I want to
talk about before I come back

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.940
to narrative is a bit
about us as people

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.174
and how we work as people.

00:24:16.174 --> 00:24:17.840
So there's a
contradiction, isn't there,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.790
in the heart of our being.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.246
You'll see this in the
search engines you use,

00:24:22.246 --> 00:24:25.740
which reveal sides about
people that they would never

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.170
admit to publicly.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.570
That's fundamentally
the contradiction.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.200
We are all animals,
yet unlike animals, we

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.780
are all capable of rationality.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.760
So we all have our
own survival at heart,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.110
yet we have to live
in a society where

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.100
we have to repress some
of our survival instincts

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.820
to survive and live
with other people.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.275
So we all have a fundamental
biological urge to replicate

00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:56.950
our genetic material, yet we
cannot always express that,

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.070
because the worst case scenario
is you end up in court.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.380
You have to control your
urges to live in society.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.420
And most people manage
that very successfully.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:10.450
But some may go online instead
and express them that way.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.614
So you look at the behavior
on internet forums,

00:25:12.614 --> 00:25:14.030
and I probably
have "The Guardian"

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.900
more in mind than
anyone else here.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.910
But when societal
restrictions are removed,

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:23.910
the absence of identity allows
the inner animal off the leash.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.940
So there is nothing more
enlightening, I think,

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.520
than the forums of
a liberal newspaper.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.325
Because the comments underneath
are largely grotesque,

00:25:31.325 --> 00:25:36.350
and offensive, and deeply
just horrible, basically.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.240
They're probably the
same on every newspaper.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.560
But there's something
that speaks more

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.024
about that kind of newspaper,
which I read myself.

00:25:44.024 --> 00:25:46.190
But I think it's no accident
that these websites are

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.590
the homes of offensive material.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.110
Because when you strip
away the need for exterior,

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.710
when you strip away the need
for identity-- and of course

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.290
you do this all the
time in what you do.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.980
You let loose the true feelings
of impotence, and anger,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.310
and rage that can lurk
underneath a caring exterior.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.520
So publicly, again,
familiar I'm sure,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.680
we tend to present ourselves
as models of civic virtue.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.470
So in France, after
the war, it was

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.070
almost impossible
to find anyone who

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.540
said they supported
the Vichy regime.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.390
And after Mandela was freed
from jail in South Africa,

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.490
no one ever voted nationalist.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.980
Understandably, because if
you admitted to those things,

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.720
you'd be in trouble.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.000
And it would be uncomfortable.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.440
So you'd have to perversely be
brave to admit to those things.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.700
And it's hard.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.870
So the darker feelings,
the rage or shame

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.746
that fills those websites and
our innermost thoughts when

00:26:44.746 --> 00:26:46.120
we're rejected,
when we're angry,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.460
when we're not given the job
we want, when we're humiliated,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.445
are hard to show publicly.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.130
Which is why at
this most extreme,

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:02.180
you end up with gun
rage in America.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.490
So this conflict between
what we really think

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.200
and how we want to
be perceived fuels

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.600
every second of
our waking lives.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.910
If you think of the first time
you meet your group of people

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.940
you work with, you
think about what

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.500
you're going to
wear that morning.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.875
You think about
what you're going

00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.560
to talk about that will make you
feel them like you, hopefully,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.260
or not like you, if
not liking's your goal.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.680
But fundamentally,
you're creating

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.560
an image about yourself that you
want to be perceived publicly.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.330
And obviously,
that's the wellspring

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.590
of the whole guilty pleasures
phenomena, when you actually

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.780
gleefully let that whole
thing go and realize

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.000
it's OK to make a tit of
yourself occasionally.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.482
So what is Facebook
but an advert

00:27:44.482 --> 00:27:45.690
for how we'd like to be seen?

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.230
OK, I'm sure this
will be familiar.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.563
Or as my friend said, "What
are the unwatched programmes

00:27:49.563 --> 00:27:52.290
on your Sky+ but taunting
reminders of who we might

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.520
really like to be?"

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.920
You tend, by default, to watch
the ones that are the easiest

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.850
ones to watch, unless yo you're
a particular kind of person.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.410
So detour back to where I was.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.646
How does this inform
characterization?

00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:11.020
And how does this
form narrative?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.403
And how does this
inform opposites?

00:28:14.403 --> 00:28:18.310
Well, an interesting
thing about storytelling,

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.110
going back to its
very beginning,

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:26.110
is just the prevalence of
paradoxical characters, many

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.670
in history and in literature,
forgive me, many of whom

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.250
sought fame or glory to
still the conflict within.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.669
So from real life, I just
chose a number of options

00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:35.210
in real life.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.834
So here we are.

00:28:35.834 --> 00:28:38.080
We have an insightful
liberal, champion

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.570
of the underdog,
author of "Huckleberry

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.860
Finn" and "A Connecticut
Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.650
one of the most enlightened
men of American letters,

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.570
but also champion of
free market capitalism,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.377
avert racist, and
declared Philistine.

00:28:55.377 --> 00:28:56.460
Of course it's Mark Twain.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.250
It was Mark Twain
and Samuel Clemens.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.280
And that's always a telltale
sign, when they have two names.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.130
But you know, extraordinary
character, wonderful writer,

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.130
complicated.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.370
Let's take another
one-- socialist,

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:14.600
religious, campaigned for rights
of the individual, championed

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.680
free market economic
policy, invaded

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.310
Iraq, removed countless
democratic freedoms.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.260
Where am I going with that?

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.440
There's endless, endless
fascinating paradoxes

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.470
in that character.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.640
Appearance-- champion of the
underdog, perfect marriage,

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.620
athletic alpha male.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.530
Reality-- scion of privilege,
serial philanderer,

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.130
crippled with Addison's
disease-- Kennedy, obviously,

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.360
isn't it?

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.860
An extraordinary
character as well--

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.510
the richness of these characters
is always incredibly striking.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.170
But what's
interesting is the war

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.500
that's going on between their
public and private selves

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.090
continually.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.700
But what's
interesting too is how

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.720
this applies to
fictional characters.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.684
You see this with
big, dramatic tropes.

00:30:01.684 --> 00:30:03.600
If you make soap opera
for any length of time,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.890
you see these things are again--
the trope of the vicar revealed

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.930
as the child abuser,
the preacher who's

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.650
the love rat, the union
leader who's the demagogue.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.570
They come across
my desk about once

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.320
a month in stories
pitched to me.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.950
And you see it all
the time if you

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.930
look at the great characters
of fiction on television.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.840
So a man of substance,
well-versed in the finer things

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.160
of life, a man
who prides himself

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.600
in his aptitude for
service, a man who

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.870
hates the working class--
he's a hen-pecked husband

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.970
running a cheap B&amp;B in Torquay.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:40.940
Isn't he?

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.010
It's very simple, isn't it?

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.000
But that's where the
drama comes from.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.350
That's where the
story comes from.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.220
A soldier, successful
public figure,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.590
model of respectability, in
reality, a figure of fun,

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.060
a Provincial bank manager,
hopeless marriage.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.350
It's Captain [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:02.611
Again, and his absolute opposite
is, of course, Sergeant Wilson.

00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:05.114
Appearance-- [? the ?]
rich, sophisticated

00:31:05.114 --> 00:31:06.530
playboy in charge
of everything he

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.651
surveys, a man who
has everything.

00:31:09.651 --> 00:31:12.640
Dirt poor, white
trash, a lost soul,

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.110
a man who has nothing,
not even his name.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.657
Because he's not even
Don Draper, at all.

00:31:19.657 --> 00:31:21.490
And you could do the
same with Tony Soprano.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.640
You can do it the same
with most characters.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.210
So in real life and in
fiction, and, of course,

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.000
us too, if we're
honest, conflict

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.700
is at the heart
of our character.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.410
And it's the conflict between
the facade a character chooses

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:37.414
to project and their deeper
internal vulnerabilities

00:31:37.414 --> 00:31:40.080
between the mask they adopted to
be a socially acceptable member

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.575
of society and the inner
feelings of vulnerability

00:31:43.575 --> 00:31:46.460
that lie underneath.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.120
But what's
interesting about this

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.940
is how it resolves itself
in dramatic structure

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.740
and narrative structure and
how narrative structure works.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.660
Because there's a pattern.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.560
So here's a story.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.510
There's a story arc.

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.460
So from beginning to end,
there's our narrative.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:09.670
A character starts off as
Don Draper or Tony Soprano.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:10.900
And he goes on a journey.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:17.360
His facade over time slips away
to reveal the hidden person

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.260
underneath.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.440
And the inner person
hidden away at the start

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.140
obviously rises to the fore.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.310
And something very
interesting happens

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.580
in exactly the
middle of the story.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.130
King Lear would be
a very good example.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.990
Starts as king, exactly
halfway through, naked

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.267
in a hovel in the
store on the heath.

00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:44.350
I shall come back to that.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:48.600
So we call that the midpoint
of any story, so hence the

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.780
look that most characters have
in a quintessential dilemma

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.770
in the middle of any narrative.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.720
Let's have a look,
a clip, of how

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.970
that works in probably one
of the most famous examples

00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:59.470
of all.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.180
Can we have "The
"Godfather" clip?

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.900
This is exactly halfway through
the first "Godfather" movie.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.894
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.889
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:34:47.022 --> 00:34:49.517
[GUNSHOTS]

00:35:06.982 --> 00:35:08.479
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:08.479 --> 00:35:10.020
JOHN YORKE: OK.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.590
So it is what it is.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.730
Exactly halfway through
the story, the old self

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.910
and the new self meet,
battle, and change sides.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.380
So if the law abiding
soldier learns his father

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.300
has been shot.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.230
If you break "The
Godfather" into five acts,

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.730
saves his father
in hospital, learns

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.600
he's not scared of
working in that world,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.480
kills Soliozo and
McCluskey-- we've

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.945
just seen-- sacks Tom
Hagen, makes his father

00:35:34.945 --> 00:35:38.070
his consigliore, kills everyone.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.790
It's really simple--
it's a bit simplistic,

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:45.030
but fundamentally, bang in the
middle, war hero, you know.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.420
It's a good thing.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.142
But what's even more
bizarre, if you're

00:35:48.142 --> 00:35:50.225
as sad as I am and you sit
there with a stopwatch,

00:35:50.225 --> 00:35:52.180
and you work these
things out, what

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:56.650
you get in regular 20 minute
intervals, excuse the slightly

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.550
jumpy graphics, is you get that.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.600
If you break it into
Shakespearean five act

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.486
structure, you get a very,
very clear physical pattern

00:36:07.486 --> 00:36:08.110
of how it work.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.780
And I don't believe
for a Francis Ford

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.160
Coppola thought about that.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.180
He just did it.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.170
Because exactly the
same pattern exists

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.170
in "MacBeth," which to
all intents and purposes,

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.980
is the same story.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.350
The modest soldier hears
the witch's prophecy.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.005
Angst ridden and pushed by
Lady MacBeth, he kills Duncan.

00:36:24.005 --> 00:36:25.270
he murders Banquo.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:26.220
Fleance escapes.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.960
Macduff defects.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.860
Murders Lady Macduff
and her children.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.860
He's abandoned by all.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.040
Lady Macbeth goes
mad around there.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.160
Believes himself invincible--
"I cannot be killed."

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.440
It's a tragedy, so he's killed.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.600
So he goes from modesty--
he's talked about

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.520
as being modest at first-- to
absolute arrogance at the end.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.700
So from war hero into monster.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.560
And very clearly each
Shakespearean act,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:58.090
at that point, you see
that physical change.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.210
So sorry, that was a bit
of a quick-- there we go.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:06.150
So from there to there, just
the parallels are endless.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.012
Again, I secretly love
"Legally "Blonde."

00:37:09.012 --> 00:37:10.980
I think it's rather marvelous.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.260
As it starts, Elle, or
Reese Witherspoon character,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.560
is all pink with a loud hairdo.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.790
so that's how she starts.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:19.670
Let's have a look at her again.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.970
96 minutes later, her
hair is immaculate,

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.550
and there's a small splash
of pink on her collar.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:30.450
And exactly halfway
through, she gains entry

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:34.100
into the law firm,
exactly halfway through.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.340
I don't think they
planned that either.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.790
But what you're seeing is
this extraordinary thing

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:43.710
about character design,
about how two opposites meet

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:48.710
and undergo a reaction dictated,
we think, by the artistic muse,

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.390
but actually by the
laws of physics,

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:55.030
and then digested through
the laws of biology.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:58.240
So if it's a book, we
can read it over time.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.960
In cinema, it'll be
an hour and a half.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.515
In theater, there'll
act breaks which

00:38:01.515 --> 00:38:04.040
allow us to go to the toilets,
and in previous times,

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.480
to allow for daylight
and standing, et cetera.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.009
So Andrew Stanton, who we
started with in the beginning,

00:38:12.009 --> 00:38:14.300
in the same letter he was
talking about there, he said,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.370
"Good storytelling
never gives you four.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.950
It gives you two plus two.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.000
If you construct
your story correctly,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.630
it compels the audience to
conclude the answer is four.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.290
This works with every
aspect of filmmaking,

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:30.410
down to a molecular level--
editing, plot lines,

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.650
relationships."

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.950
And I think it's true of
every kind of narrative,

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:38.140
and certainly of PR, is if you
tell someone what to think,

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.850
they won't think it.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.740
But if you allow
them to work it out,

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.040
obviously, they'll
do it themselves.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.020
And if you tell a story, in
which that message is embodied,

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.670
obviously that will have
extraordinary power.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.000
But at every level, down
to a molecular level,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.780
you see this universal
theory of two plus two.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.910
So it's David and
Bianca once again.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:05.080
And if you look at that
David and Bianca scene,

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.900
you'll see that pattern,
as Bianca learns the truth,

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.070
follows exactly the
same plan again.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.690
It's a law of physics.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.440
So all character, all
structure, all drama

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.430
is built on the war
between opposites.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.020
And again, how long have we got?

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:33.251
I could just-- every Shakespeare
play is absolutely archetypal.

00:39:33.251 --> 00:39:34.750
Think of what you
watched last week.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.920
You'll find exactly
the same pattern.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.310
Going on, there's
some more Shakespeare,

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.150
back to "EastEnders," forgive
me, Tony Soprano, Jennifer

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.360
Murphy, "NYPD Blue,"
Steptoe and Son.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.850
Obviously sitcoms are a
classic, very clear example.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.930
Hancock and Sid James.

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:54.650
Go back to [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.887
Again Pixar, "Homeland,"
"Starsky and Hutch,"

00:39:57.887 --> 00:40:00.220
"Criminal Justie," "Appropriate
Adult," "Downton Abbey,"

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.610
"The Line of Duty," or "The
Village," on BBC One recently.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.650
So you say, yeah, well, why?

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:14.370
And the answer is probably
really simple and staring us

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.120
in the face.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.590
It's that, isn't it?

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.880
It's Newton's
Third Law, which is

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.039
when one body exerts
force on a second body.

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:22.955
The second point
simultaneously exerts a force

00:40:22.955 --> 00:40:26.870
equal in magnitude and opposite
in direction of the first body.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:28.660
And so if you're
starting at one place,

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.900
and you know you've got
to end at home again,

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.660
it will tend to
follow that pattern.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.640
Now obviously there
are exceptions,

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.340
because great filmmakers, just
like great jazz musicians,

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.440
will come and smash that up.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.510
But when they smash it up,
they create a dissonance

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:50.310
that you only know as dissonance
because of its relevance

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:52.590
to the shape itself.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.150
So that shape, that
desure for symmetry,

00:40:56.150 --> 00:41:00.250
seems to have an
extraordinary pull on us.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.210
Seven years ago when I
started writing this book,

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.210
I came across this quote
from Hilary Mantel, who

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.640
I'm sure you know,
who wrote "Wolf Hall."

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.320
She was writing a book about
the introduction of fairy tales.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.690
And just to wrap
up, she said this.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.390
She said, "The journey
into the wood"--

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.190
she noticed that this story
exerted itself and recurred

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.350
again and again.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:19.840
"The journey into
the world is part

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.590
of the journey of
the psyche from birth

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.090
through death to rebirth.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.170
Hansel and Gretel, the
woodcutter's children,

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:28.280
are familiar with the wood's
verges but not its heart.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.550
Snow White is abandoned
in the forest.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:34.190
What happens to us in
the depths of the world?

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.670
Civilization and its
discontents give way

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.930
to the irrational and half-seen.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.070
Back in the village with
our soured relationships,

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.050
we are neurotic.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.850
But the wood releases
our full-blown madness.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.750
Birds and animals talk to us.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:47.950
Departed souls speak.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.840
The tiny rush-light
of the cottages

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.640
is only a fading memory.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.870
Lost in the
extinguishing darkness,

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:56.530
we cannot see our
hands before our face.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.620
We lose all sense of
our body's boundaries.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.760
We melt into the trees,
into the bark and the sap.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:10.150
And from this green blood, we
draw new life and are healed."

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.790
That's Hilary Mantel
on fairy tales.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.760
But what she's
describing, of course,

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.070
is that, the classic opposite.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:19.770
You start at home.

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.590
You go on a journey
into the heart

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:24.160
of the woods where
you find the opposite.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.580
It's exactly what
Al Pacino does,

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.000
exactly what "King Lear" does,
exactly what "Macbeth" does.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.350
And then you bring it
home, and you've changed.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:35.580
It's thesis, antithesis,
synthesis again.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.310
OK, that's the book, by the way.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:40.930
But I think before I
do that, let me just

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:42.730
go back to that a second.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.320
It's worth saying,
obviously I've

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.510
talked about
narrative a lot today.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.860
But I think what's
also fascinating

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.440
and probably a session
for another time

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.067
is how this applies politically.

00:42:55.067 --> 00:42:57.400
Obviously all governments are
interested in establishing

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:57.980
narrative.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.685
All political
parties in opposition

00:42:59.685 --> 00:43:01.810
are interested in establishing
a counter narrative.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.930
It's all about this
is the narrative.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:04.860
I write the story.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.230
I'm the winning side.

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:08.540
What's fascinating
is how in life

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.350
from the Israel-Palestinian
conflict,

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.790
to North and South
Korea, to Sunni and Shia

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:19.040
that we see today, what we do
is we create those opposites

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.540
again.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.270
And if you look at how
those various sects divide

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:26.290
themselves, you see the
same pattern emerging.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:30.830
So we process real life for
better largely through fiction,

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:35.040
but also with caution at
the same time as well.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.452
Which I think brings me
exactly to 3 o'clock.

00:43:38.452 --> 00:43:39.410
So I should stop there.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.602
But thank you very much.

00:43:41.602 --> 00:43:44.548
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:47.179 --> 00:43:49.220
MALE SPEAKER: Well, thank
you very much for that.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.400
It was fascinating.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.620
We don't have time for
Q&amp;A now, because we

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.000
have another thing
we have to do.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.470
But I'm going to send
a question that you

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:58.830
can answer if you want
to via email later.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:00.560
And that is, what
Shakespearean drama do

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.327
you think Google is in?

00:44:02.327 --> 00:44:03.410
I would like to know that.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:04.760
And I hope it's a good one.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.140
So with that said, thank you
for a fascinating lecture.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.800
And thanks for coming out to us.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.133
JOHN YORKE: Thank you very much.

00:44:11.133 --> 00:44:12.123
[APPLAUSE]
