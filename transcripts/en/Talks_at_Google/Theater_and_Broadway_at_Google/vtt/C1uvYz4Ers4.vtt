If you all could just go

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.470
and who you play.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.325

I play Mickey Stevenson, who's

Temptations, Paul Williams.

And I cover Stevie Wonder.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.920
And I also am on

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.510
JAWAN JACKSON: Hello,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.020
Also I'm one of The
Miracles in Smokey Robinson

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.620
and The Miracles.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.230
And I also am one of
the Brick House singers.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.281
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.780
CHARL BROWN: My
name is Charl Brown,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.354

So I'm all the women.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.013
MARK DOUGLAS: You
don't cover me, girl.

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.471
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
And that's what?

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:22.985
20 women?

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:23.690
KRISHA MARCANO: 12.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.898
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: 12 tracks.

00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:26.220
OK, that's a lot.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.695
I'm Krystal Joy Brown
and I play Diana Ross.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.330
JARED NEWS: And I'm Jared News.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.590
I'm also one of the
male swings of the show.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.390
So I cover 25 different
tracks in the show,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.095
including Smokey
Robinson and Marvin Gaye.

00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:42.720
And I'm also going
to be playing Marvin

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.173
Gaye on the new national tour.

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:47.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.360
MARK DOUGLAS: So
let's start generally.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.740
As we said, the show last
night was incredible.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.527
It looks like a ton of fun.

00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:56.110
I've never seen
people in the audience

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.412
having that much fun in a show.

00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:59.120
You guys look like
you're having a blast.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.940
It's a big cast.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.172
Is it as fun as it looks?

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:02.880
CHARL BROWN: Yes.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.760
TODD WOMACK: Be honest.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.200
MODERATOR: (SARCASM) No.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.810
CHARL BROWN: No, it really is.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.907
I mean, listen.

00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:08.240
We've all done a lot of shows
and done a lot of theatre.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.889
And you get upset
at yourself when

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.320
you find yourself humming
the tunes at home usually.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.290
But with this show, when you're
singing the songs at home,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.090
you're actually happy.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.460
You're like, yeah I'm
gonna keep singing it.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.001
I don't care.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.280
I love this music.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.050
Also hi-jinks and
hilarity that happens

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.100
backstage is what
keeps us really going.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.440
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Or onstage.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.540
CHARL BROWN: Or onstage.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.350
Shh don't tell.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.900
Our stage manager is here.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.660
Yeah we have a lot
of fun as a cast.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.130
We're actually a
really big family.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.090
We feel like we are the next
generation of the Motown

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.530
legacy.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.420
TODD WOMACK: I saw you guys do
something really funny onstage.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.303
Somebody's wig was just a little
bit-- the piece was coming off.

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:38.170
CHARL BROWN: I saw
that last night.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.860
TODD WOMACK: And you
guys were doing a scene.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.834
And you're all doing
your lines and stuff.

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:42.542
MARK DOUGLAS: It was
just a nice little--

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:45.390
CHARL BROWN: We try and help
each other out, when we can.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.195
MARK DOUGLAS: But it felt real.

00:02:47.195 --> 00:02:47.890
It felt natural.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.414
It didn't feel like--

00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:51.580
DONALD WEBBER: They definitely
did that in the '60s.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.829
MARK DOUGLAS: Of course, yeah.

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.490
Yeah the wig budget for this
show must have been huge.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.364
CHARL BROWN: We have 150 wigs
that appear onstage nightly.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:03.530
In the building, with all
the swings and everything,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.080
we have over 300, around
350 wigs all together.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.115
And our wig department--
props to them--

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:11.490
they have to actually restyle
the wigs before every show.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.870
We do eight shows a week.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.380
They have to make sure
that they're maintained.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.756
They have to refit
them on people

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:17.088
if they're coming into the show.

00:03:17.088 --> 00:03:19.380
So there's a lot of work that
goes into the wigs alone.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.792
MARK DOUGLAS: Are they the
busiest people on the show?

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:22.250
CHARL BROWN: They are.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.500
Costumes is very busy, too.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.340
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
Costumes and dressers, too.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.100
MARK DOUGLAS: Have there
ever been any wig mishaps?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.860
Like you've got
come out, oh my god!

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.601
I'm '70s Smokey!

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:30.463
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:30.463 --> 00:03:31.490
In the '60s!

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.240
JARED NEWS: It happens
in Swing-Land a lot

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.750
because we have to go
on for different people

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.650
at the drop of a hat.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.070
Someone can call out at
the beginning of a show,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.030
midway during a show.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.920
So the customer department has
to go down into the basement

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.500
to get your costumes
and your wigs.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.610
And sometimes you may
have a different wig

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.750
on than is correct
for That period.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.190
Also we forgot someone.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.980
Alvin Huff, Jr. Alvin
over there on the keys.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.220
MARK DOUGLAS: Let's get
you a mic, here's a stool.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.144
ALVIN HUFF JR: Thank you, Jared.

00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:04.560
I'm Alvin Huff, I'm one of the
keyboard players in the pit

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.220
every night.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.884
I'm also one of the
now four conductors--

00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:09.050
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Stand up.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.580
MARK DOUGLAS: Were you
conducting last night?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.870
ALVIN HUFF JR: Well I was
not conducting last night--

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.700
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
Isn't he handsome?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.460
ALVIN HUFF JR: But I was
playing keyboard for you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.780
down in the pit.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.310
So all those good things you
heard on the piano were me.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.799
MARK DOUGLAS: I didn't
hear any wrong notes.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.739
ALVIN HUFF JR: Good.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.350
CHARL BROWN: The one
thing about Alvin

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.510
that we love, too,
when he's conducting,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.960
is he actually is acting
down there in the pit.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.170
He has reactions to
what's going on onstage.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.410
So it's great to have him
down there connecting.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.880
TODD WOMACK: So
last night, we were

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.279
watching the musical director.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.320
Is that what he's called?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.486
MARK DOUGLAS: The conductor?

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:36.530
Yeah, I don't know.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.760
That guy was having a blast.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.490
He was bopping along to
every single song for what?

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.490
A two-hour show?

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.502
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Two
hours and 45 minutes.

00:04:43.502 --> 00:04:45.460
TODD WOMACK: He's working
harder than you guys.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.180
Is that every night?

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.930
CHARL BROWN: Yeah.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.400
I mean, look.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.440
The music is infectious.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.192
And so, if you're in
charge of the music,

00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:52.650
it's really infectious
and you have

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.899
to be grooving along with
it and staying in the groove

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.110
that we're setting.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.840
MARK DOUGLAS: So
let's get into some--

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.256
TODD WOMACK: Let's
get back, yeah.

00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:01.150
MARK DOUGLAS: Let's
really start now.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.220
So I've seen some pictures of
Smokey Robinson, Berry Gordy,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.190
Diana Ross showing up
to the actual show.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.180
Do they do that a lot?

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.652
How many of you have performed
the person to the person?

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:15.600
CHARL BROWN: Well, I
will take this one.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.800
Smokey Robinson was just
at our show on Wednesday.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.449
It was his birthday, and
he came he decided to come.

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.490
He comes to New York every
year for his birthday.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.560
But this year, he
decided to come

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.520
to see the show with his wife.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.890
It's also her birthday as well.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.250
And they came to the show.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.250
We knew they were
there beforehand.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.430
And we had cake with
him that was provided

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.910
our wonderful SpotCo
team that's back there.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.490
And we had a party for him
backstage after the show.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.270
So for me it's always
a little nerve-wracking

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.690
to know that he's there.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.260
Luckily though, he's been
there a few times now,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.130
so it wasn't as nerve-wracking
as the first time.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.463
But they all came opening night.

00:05:45.463 --> 00:05:48.650
Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson,
Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.610
I mean everyone pretty
much who was still

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.950
with us was able to be there.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.710
MARK DOUGLAS: Were
the Pips there?

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.210
CHARL BROWN: I don't think we
had any Pips there on opening.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.580
But we did also have a Friends
and Family Night the week

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.770
prior to opening, where a
lot of the other Miracles

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.226
and other members of groups--
The Temptations-- and family

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:04.100
members came as well.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.690
So everyone who's been involved
in Motown-- who is still

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.980
with us-- has come to see
the show at some point.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.265
MARK DOUGLAS: Wow.

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:12.770
TODD WOMACK: Do you have
any Diana Ross stories, KJ?

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.686
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Well
I just joined the cast

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:16.870
three weeks ago.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.290
So I have not met her yet.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.570
But I have murmurings
that she's coming.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.340
And I asked, please
don't tell me.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.420
Please don't tell me.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.820
Tell me as soon as I
walk offstage because I

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.980
think I will poop myself.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.930
Because, if you go
into my dressing room,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.120
literally it's a shrine to
Diana Ross at this point.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.000
She has kind of
taken over my world.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.470
And I literally have dreams
about her most nights.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.680
I actually did just last night.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.890
Yeah meeting Smokey
Robinson was already crazy.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.770
Sitting with Berry
Gordy and going over

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.271
notes from the first
day that he saw me.

00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.770
And just sitting there and he's
like, OK I'll be Berry Gordy

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.686
and you be Diana Ross.

00:06:56.686 --> 00:07:00.256
And I'm like-- what?

00:07:00.256 --> 00:07:02.484
TODD WOMACK: He's like,
let's go to the sex scene.

00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:04.650
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: We're
doing these scenes together

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.500
and I'm like, what?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.980
Oh my god.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.655
And he's so nice.

00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:11.960
But it's really amazing
to meet these legends

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.810
and also to kind of know
this is how we got our start.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.100
This is how we knew we
could become entertainers.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.660
These people have
created the path for us

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.590
as black entertainers to even
have a platform to stand on.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.166
So it's not just meeting
these amazing icons.

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:30.540
It's kind of meeting the people
that inspired you to even

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.069
have the ability to have
this kind of a dream.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.110
MARK DOUGLAS: Well, as
far as meeting Diana Ross,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.026
I don't think you have
anything to worry about

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:40.300
because you become her.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.160
I mean we're talking about
what you do with your mouth,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.220
when you sing like her.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.886
TODD WOMACK: You sound
exactly like her.

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:49.590
MARK DOUGLAS: I don't
know how you get that.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.200
You have that same glow
that she kind of gives off.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.110
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: I watch
a lot of YouTube of her.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.080
Honestly, hours of
YouTube watching her.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.360
And photos, and googling her.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.037
But seriously just
constantly watching her.

00:08:09.037 --> 00:08:10.620
And whenever I start
to feel like I've

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.640
become too much of this
century, or right now,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.130
I just start to watch her again.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.429
Because it is easy to
fall into, oh yeah,

00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:19.720
well they laugh when I do this.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.303
But that's not
something she would do.

00:08:21.303 --> 00:08:24.020
So I have to really
make sure that it

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.780
stays within the period,
and how she does things,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.234
and how she moves.

00:08:28.234 --> 00:08:30.400
MARK DOUGLAS: She's definitely
one of the top divas.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.608
So you've got to do it right.

00:08:31.608 --> 00:08:32.980
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Yeah.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.309
To me, she's the first
black female megastar.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.460
And that's just
kind of like, wow.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.200
MARK DOUGLAS: And
Charl, you have that.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.470
I mean you become
Smokey, as well.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.982
And that voice that you do.

00:08:46.982 --> 00:08:47.906
Can you give us--

00:08:47.906 --> 00:08:48.368
CHARL BROWN: (BREATHY
VOICE) Yeah, man.

00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:49.951
I had to become
Smokey to play Smokey.

00:08:49.951 --> 00:08:50.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.560
It's true, though.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.520
Like she said, we
luckily live in an age

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.470
where we can Google things,
and look them up on YouTube,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.730
and try and research them.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.650
Fortunately, and
unfortunately, there

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.105
wasn't a lot that was
captured of them, especially

00:09:03.105 --> 00:09:04.730
in the black and
white era in the '60s.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.688
But there are a few key
things that we actually

00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:07.740
portray in our show.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.690
So I went back and I
just did my research.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.050
I also read his autobiography
just to get a sense of him.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.950
And we also have
a great resource.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.360
Mr. Gordy, we should mention,
wrote the show himself.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.450
He's our book writer.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.670
This is the story being
told from his point of view,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.970
how he remembers things.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.850
So we also have
him as a great tool

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.620
because he's bringing in--
he recorded everything.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.410
All the meetings
they had, everything

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.530
it was going on at Motown.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.980
Luckily, he recorded everything.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.870
And his sister, Esther,
actually encouraged

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.170
him to keep things, as well.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.250
So now they have
artifacts and things

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.250
that they wouldn't normally
think were important

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.499
because they didn't know how
big this was going to be.

00:09:40.499 --> 00:09:42.150
So I got a chance
to listen to some

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.290
of the recordings of the
quality control meeting

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.860
that we have in the show, and
other things about the way

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.650
things were going on
behind closed doors.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.020
Because we're telling
the full story,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.228
not just what's in front
the cameras or on the stage.

00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:54.900
We're telling the story of
what happened in his house.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.230
And so we luckily have
Mr. Gordy as a resource

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.730
to actually tell
us how things were.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.785
And Smokey is a very
nice and wonderful man

00:10:00.785 --> 00:10:03.160
in front of the cameras, and
he is behind the stage, too.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.590
But also they had some really
serious, heated arguments

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.070
because it was about the art
and the passion came out.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.550
So I got a chance to
hear all the sides of it,

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.626
not just the side of a fan.

00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:14.250
TODD WOMACK: Smokey
getting mad, like--

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.030
CHARL BROWN: Smokey getting mad.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.484
TODD WOMACK: (BREATHY
VOICE) Hey, man.

00:10:15.484 --> 00:10:15.983
Back off.

00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:16.846
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.846 --> 00:10:19.180
CHARL BROWN: He
definitely got mad.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.282
MARK DOUGLAS: We're obsessed
with voices and doing voices.

00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:25.500
Is there a struggle
to do that soft voice

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.480
and still project to a theater?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.830
I mean you're miked, but still.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:29.676
CHARL BROWN: Yeah.

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:31.300
Definitely, there is
a technique to it.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.130
I mean I just had
to kind of train

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.392
myself to find where Smokey
meets Charl as the performer,

00:10:36.392 --> 00:10:37.850
and I can do it
eight times a week,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.891
and not hurt myself, and
be able to actually come

00:10:39.891 --> 00:10:41.250
to work every day.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.940
So yeah I've been doing it
now for almost a year so it's

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.240
kind of second nature to me.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.650
But it definitely took me
awhile to develop that sound.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.370
TODD WOMACK: I know this
is a hugely talented cast.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.145
The impressions are outstanding.

00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:56.520
You're doing some of the most
famous people in the world.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.380
Stevie Wonder, Marvin
Gaye, Smokey, Diana.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.170
Do you all do any
other impressions

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.440
that you'd like
to share with us?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.750
CHARL BROWN: I don't.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.640
TODD WOMACK: Nobody?

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.969
CHARL BROWN: Donald?

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.010
DONALD WEBBER: All right.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.294
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:11.294 --> 00:11:13.210
ALVIN HUFF JR: He's being
so modest right now.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.630
DONALD WEBBER:
All right, listen.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.655
I actually don't.

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:20.040
But I'm in improv and you
can see me at any time.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.950
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.815
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.440
MARK DOUGLAS: Let's
get a running start

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.815
and see what happens, right?

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.523
TODD WOMACK: We'll
come back to that one.

00:11:26.523 --> 00:11:30.360
MARK DOUGLAS: Well I think a
lot of times in the songbook

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.030
musicals-- that would
technically be what this would

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.670
be sort of--

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.795
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Jukebox.

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:37.170
MARK DOUGLAS: Jukebox, songbook.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.360
Sometimes the popular songs will
get a little too Broadway-ed

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.730
up for my tastes.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.090
Like, every rose has its thorn.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.400
That kind of thing.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.586
And it sort of takes me--

00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:49.210
TODD WOMACK: Guns N'
Roses The Musical?

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.501
MARK DOUGLAS: Well what was it?

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.330
Oh, "Rock of Ages."

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.580
But you guys did
a really good job

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.410
of sort of honoring the way
the songs were originally sung.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.400
And it's still very
much a Broadway show.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.020
But it didn't have that thing
that sort of can take me out

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.270
of it sometimes.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.510
But I think sometimes
that happens

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.110
I guess to protect the voice.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.930
It's an easier way
to sing over time.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.260
Do you have-- no?

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.010
CHARL BROWN: Well I'll
tell you this, too.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.926
Mr. Gordy was also very
adamant about the fact

00:12:15.926 --> 00:12:17.740
that he didn't want to
Broadway-ize Motown.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.590
He wanted to bring
Motown to Broadway.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.310
And so luckily,
like I said, he was

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.050
involved so much
that they made sure

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.620
that the sound remained
authentic and true,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.350
and that we kept the
soul of the music.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.210
But we were telling the
story in a Broadway format.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.380
MARK DOUGLAS: Is
that vocally taxing?

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.685
CHARL BROWN: Yes.

00:12:35.685 --> 00:12:36.551
It is.

00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:38.800
DONALD WEBBER: I'm going to
put the spotlight on Brian

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.360
for a second.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.400
He sings "What's Going On?"

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.000
And I think out of all the songs
in our show, that's probably

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.780
the song that sounds the least
like it does on the record.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:52.120
And it was changed
specifically for our show.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.780
And anyway I'm just
going to kind of--

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.738
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: I
think that the way music

00:12:55.738 --> 00:12:59.330
functions in-- I'm
kind of like you.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.240
Don't kill me.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.511
I hate Broadway music.

00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:04.260
MARK DOUGLAS: This is
your Broadway debut!

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:04.760
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK:
It's my Broadway debut

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.520
but it's so corny.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.977
And it's cheesy.

00:13:07.977 --> 00:13:09.560
MARK DOUGLAS: I
didn't want to say it.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.310
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK:
You know what I mean.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.830
And I mean there have been some
breakthroughs and some changes

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.160
in Broadway music, I think,
just as time and history has

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.870
changed.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.111
The first time I heard
"Rent," I went, oh yeah!

00:13:22.111 --> 00:13:22.610
Uh-huh.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.120
Like that.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.180
I like that.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.770
But again, like you,
I couldn't stand it.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.420
And the idea that this show was
going to be authentic to Motown

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.410
was interesting.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.040
But it's tricky because the
way music functions in our show

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.600
is really in three
different forms.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.670
You've got the
concert performance.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.390
So it might look a little
bit like what you just saw.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.490
So "Grapevine" in
the show, I mean.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.390
Marvin's at a concert.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.366
And then you've got
music in the studio.

00:13:48.366 --> 00:13:50.740
We've got a "Grapevine" version
that Gladys Knight sings.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.709
And she's recording the song.

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:54.250
So that's two ways
that they function

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.550
but the third is storytelling.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.280
And that's the way that "What's
Going On?" ends Act One.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.090
Martin Luther King is shot.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.060
And it was a crazy
time in Detroit.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.490
There were riots,
there were fires.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.500
It was a violent time,
it was a scary time,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.740
it was a heightened
emotional time.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.420
And "What's Going On?" was
not created until after that,

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.970
in terms of the real timeline.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.060
But it was just the perfect
song to kind of emote

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.740
and kind of tell the story of
what's happening on the stage.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.590
And so the orchestration of
it, and the way it's sung,

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.710
and the way it's
portrayed is more

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.200
about telling the story of
what's happening in the moment

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.375
on the stage, as opposed to
it being about a performance.

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:35.710
If that makes sense.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.600
So the way that the
music works in the show

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.760
is really in those
three different ways.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.885
There's a live performance,
the studio performance,

00:14:40.885 --> 00:14:43.160
and then there's storytelling.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.440
MARK DOUGLAS: I really enjoyed
your Marvin Gaye moves,

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:45.951
by the way.

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:48.242
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: Thank
you, it's all in the pelvis.

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:50.325
ALVIN HUFF JR: Actually,
I want to add on to that.

00:14:50.325 --> 00:14:53.140
From the orchestral
side of things,

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.470
there's actually an
18 piece orchestra

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:00.290
in the pit under the
stage playing every show.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.645
Early on, well it still
happens, but early on, I

00:15:02.645 --> 00:15:06.120
used to get really upset
and frustrated when people

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.920
would lead over the front row.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.951
And were like, oh my god,
there are people down there!

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:11.450
Were you?

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.866
Were you there the
whole-- Yes, we

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:14.280
were there the
whole three hours.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.110
Yes, there are
people in 2014 that

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.420
can play music that was
written 50, 60 years ago.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.460
Of course we can.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.189
But everyone says, oh it sounded
so much like the recording.

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:23.480
And I used to be upset by that.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.682
But now I take it as the utmost,
the highest of compliments.

00:15:26.682 --> 00:15:28.890
Because that's what Mr.
Gordy wanted from the get-go.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.510
He wanted it to have the
Motown sound in your face.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.990
Not to sound like Broadway.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.290
Not to be mixed different way.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.790
For it to actually
sound like you're

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.410
listening to the
actual recording

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.790
that people have in their
living rooms from 50 years ago.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.360
So I love the fact
he has remained

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.810
true to keeping that
sound every night.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.030
And it's something
that makes coming

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.687
to do the show every
night so much fun.

00:15:50.687 --> 00:15:52.520
I could speak for every
guy down in the pit.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.810
We have so much fun.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.085
Well 17 guys and one girl.

00:15:55.085 --> 00:15:56.460
For all of us down
in the pit, we

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.389
have so much fun every night.

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:01.930
TODD WOMACK: Let me
tag this question

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.388
on to Brian, to
what you're saying.

00:16:03.388 --> 00:16:04.630
This is your Broadway debut.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.528
And your first time at Google.

00:16:06.528 --> 00:16:08.010
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: Yeah.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.530
I want to live here.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.530
TODD WOMACK: You do until
you work here all day.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.240
I love it here, if
my boss is here.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.720
But out of all the
shows out there,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.260
I want to just propose
this to everybody here.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.250
Start with Brian.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.750
Out of all the
shows, I would think,

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.170
as a performer-- Like many,
people I love this music.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.050
I love Motown music.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.930
It looks like you
guys do, as well.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.300
It's clear as day.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.870
Was this a little extra
special, getting this show?

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.230
Can you tell us about
the audition process?

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.320
Maybe getting the
call that you got it?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.320
If it doesn't endanger--

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.690
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK:
You asked the right one.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.160
It was really hard.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.300
We did workshops
about two years,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.570
I think it started about
2 and 1/2 years before.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.070
They had a reading in LA which
is almost three years before.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.612
But I kind of came
into the process

00:16:55.612 --> 00:16:57.320
when they were still
developing the show.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.350
So I was a Temptation.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.430
I was shoo doo-wop
popping in the back.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.940
And it was great and I loved it.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.109
I'm in the pictures still.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.609
If you look really close, I'm
still there's as a Temptation.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.579
But I had my eyes
on Marvin Gaye.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.410
I mean he was my favorite
of the Motown artists.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.130
And I got an opportunity to
audition for the workshop.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.150
And I got it.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.940
And for three weeks I was
kind of like obsessed,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.921
the same way KJ was
with Marvin Gaye.

00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:25.420
Well I was obsessed before that,
but you know for that time.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.040
And then we finish the
workshop, and we found out

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.869
we're going to Broadway.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.952
And they were like, we're
going to go and audition

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:32.335
everyone else in
the country but you.

00:17:32.335 --> 00:17:34.750
We like what you did,
but we don't know.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.550
You're kind of perfect but
we don't-- you're good,

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.550
but we're going to look.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:46.300
And the way you feel when
you have to pee really bad?

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.960
I kind of felt that
way for months.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.911
Did you go to the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:51.640
I didn't.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.410
There was nobody to go to.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:53.390
Because I was just waiting.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.723
I mean if you've ever had
that dream job, that one thing

00:17:55.723 --> 00:17:59.720
that you've just always wanted,
and someone says to you,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.540
Almost but not yet.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.530
Fast forward.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.446
The first rehearsal of
the Broadway production

00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:09.230
was going to begin on a Monday.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.920
It is now Thursday.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.930
They said, oh we're going
to do promotion shots

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.180
and we'd like you to come
in and take these pictures.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.310
So I go in and I'm
like, who am I playing?

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.220
Who am I dressing up?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.150
And they go, we're
going to put you

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.316
in The Temptations' costume.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.500
Rehearsal starts on
Monday, it's Thursday.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.450
So they bring me to
the front and they go,

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.440
just in case you're the lead
singer of The Temptations,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.780
we want to put you in the front.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.930
And I went, no, I'm
going to be Marvin.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.307
And so I did the
whole thing as Marvin.

00:18:34.307 --> 00:18:35.890
So I'm taking pictures
as a Temptation

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.980
but I'm doing Marvin Gaye moves.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.892
And the choreographers
are laughing.

00:18:39.892 --> 00:18:41.100
They brought me in on Friday.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.058
I didn't hear anything.

00:18:42.058 --> 00:18:45.290
Friday before the Monday
that rehearsal starts,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.410
they said, Berry Gordy wants
to see you again at 6:00

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.670
p.m. at night.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.470
So I go in, I audition.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.720
And at this point,
I'm almost feeling

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.040
like the pee is going
to run down my leg.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.000
And I left there.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.180
And I went to go see a show.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.590
I don't really
remember what show

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.173
it was-- I know
Scarlett Johansson was

00:19:03.173 --> 00:19:06.100
in it-- because my
brain was just in a fog.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.380
And at intermission, I got
a call from the director

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.180
and he goes, Yeah you left
something at the audition.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.449
He goes, can you come outside?

00:19:15.449 --> 00:19:16.990
So I've go outside
and I'm like, he's

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.419
going to tell me I got this job.

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:19.710
He's going to tell me I got it.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.293
And he's standing
there with this look

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.280
of utter disappointment
on his face.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.310
And he's like, man, listen.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.220
You're so close to
Marvin and it's great.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.690
But Berry Gordy is looking for
his friend that's passed on.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:35.780
He's dead, and that's what's
so hard about finding Marvin.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.280
A lot of the other
people are alive.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.490
Marvin is not here.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.725
And you did your best, man.

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:41.350
You did your best
and you're fantastic.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.814
And we love you.

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:44.605
And he's walking outside,
and it's raining.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.820
I'm literally about to cry.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.700
And then the producer,
Kevin McCullum,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.910
walks around the corner
and he goes, Byron.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.722
And I was like-- He
goes, your name's Bryan.

00:19:55.722 --> 00:19:57.180
It's that Y in your
name that makes

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.146
me want to call you
Byron instead of Bryan.

00:20:00.146 --> 00:20:01.590
But here is a better name.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.350
What if I just called
you Marvin Gaye?

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.280
And I fell out on the floor.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.620
MARK DOUGLAS: And peed the
greatest pee you've ever--

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.786
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: And
peed the greatest pee ever.

00:20:08.786 --> 00:20:10.910
No one could tell because
it was raining outside.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.160
And it was one of those
moments because they lifted me

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:13.840
off the ground.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.030
And right across the
street, they just

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.400
put up the marquee for "Motown."

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.280
It was lit up.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.905
So they literally
picked me up and they

00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:21.560
were like, that's
where you'll be.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.760
And I just was crying
and it was a mess.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.030
But it was the best
gift in the world

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.197
to kind of start my
Broadway run that way.

00:20:28.197 --> 00:20:29.131
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:32.400
MARK DOUGLAS: A little messed
up that they did that to you.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.961
A little sadistic
but still cool.

00:20:34.961 --> 00:20:36.335
TODD WOMACK: On
the marquee, it's

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:38.304
like, And Byron as Marvin Gaye.

00:20:38.304 --> 00:20:42.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.110
MARK DOUGLAS: Oh, man.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.530
Not to focus on
you too much here,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.820
but there's an amazing
performance of "You're All I

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.700
Need to Get By," which is
probably one of my favorite

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.430
song of Marvin Gaye's.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.390
There's an amazing
duet that you do

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.060
as Diana Ross with Berry Gordy.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.160
Now did you feel kind of
jipped out of that song?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.470
Because that's Marvin's song?

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.803
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: Man, I
wanted to set stuff on fire.

00:21:08.803 --> 00:21:12.334
But again, no, I
didn't feel jipped.

00:21:12.334 --> 00:21:14.500
It goes back to the way
music functions in our show.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.640
So it's one of
those things where

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.200
it's more of a
storytelling moment.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.250
And it's one of
those things where

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.027
it's one of the most
powerful love songs.

00:21:21.027 --> 00:21:23.110
I mean, to me, it's one
of my favorite love songs.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.820
And so, it just made sense to
tell the story of this love

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.330
affair that Berry Gordy had
with Diana Ross using that song.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.560
Even though they
didn't sing it, it just

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.200
makes sense in the moment if
you come and see the show.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.440
But I think that what's magical
about the show, in terms

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.117
of the way music works,
is if you've ever

00:21:42.117 --> 00:21:44.450
seen Berry Gordy really look
at Diana Ross in real life,

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:48.930
which we've had the privilege
to do, he is obsessed with her

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.222
and he loves her.

00:21:51.222 --> 00:21:54.309
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Even just
the way he talks about here.

00:21:54.309 --> 00:21:54.850
It's obvious.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.390
CHARL BROWN: His face lights up.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.210
MARK DOUGLAS: Does he like that
shrine that you have to her?

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.126
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Well
he hasn't seen it yet.

00:22:00.126 --> 00:22:01.694
Because I just did it.

00:22:01.694 --> 00:22:03.360
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK:
So whatever musical

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.770
is going to support a look
in a man's eye like that?

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.100
I mean do it, man.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.880
TODD WOMACK: We'd be remiss
to not mention, is it Brandon?

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.470
Who plays Berry Gordy?

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.760
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Yeah.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.680
CHARL BROWN: Brandon
Victor Dixon.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.350
TODD WOMACK: Really incredible
in that moment between you

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.530
guys.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:16.029
That duet.

00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:19.220
I don't think I've ever
anything that beautiful live.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.750
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Wow,
that's a huge compliment.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.044
TODD WOMACK: I don't get
out of the house much.

00:22:24.044 --> 00:22:26.944
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Well, in that
case, it's an OK compliment.

00:22:26.944 --> 00:22:29.069
MARK DOUGLAS: He just
recently regained his hearing

00:22:29.069 --> 00:22:29.804
a few years ago.

00:22:29.804 --> 00:22:30.970
TODD WOMACK: It was amazing.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.640
MARK DOUGLAS: Speaking of
people who aren't here today,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.790
the kid that plays
Michael Jackson-- there's

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.400
two of them-- we saw Prince?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.040
His name is Prince.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.930
Hey, he's destined
for greatness.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.610
But how old is he?

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.262
CAST: 12.

00:22:47.262 --> 00:22:49.595
MARK DOUGLAS: And he played
Michael Jackson like to a T.

00:22:49.595 --> 00:22:50.780
It was incredible.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.290
Is he at school right
now or something?

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.040
DONALD WEBBER: They
have school every day.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.020
They're actually at the theater.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.490
CHARL BROWN: It's backstage
for them at the theater.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.610
Everyday, yes.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.040
MARK DOUGLAS: How-- What
were you going to say?

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.123
TODD WOMACK: The same thing
you were going to say.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.480
MARK DOUGLAS: Have you had
to replace a Michael yet?

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.094
Because at that age, one
day you turn six feet tall.

00:23:12.094 --> 00:23:14.010
CHARL BROWN: We still
have two, like you said.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.720
One of them, Raymond Luke
Jr, has been in the show

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.511
from the beginning.

00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:19.070
He's actually the
one on the posters.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.540
Besides him, we've now had
three other Michael Jacksons,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.040
I believe.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.530
Prince is the third of those.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.790
Our first one, Jibreel,
just got too tall

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.776
and his voice started dropping.

00:23:28.776 --> 00:23:31.590
JAWAN JACKSON: (DEEP VOICE)
He was talking like this.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:35.170
CHARL BROWN: We had Darius,
and now we have Prince.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:35.752
Puberty hits.

00:23:35.752 --> 00:23:38.210
MARK DOUGLAS: That's gotta be
a constant struggle to find--

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.770
CHARL BROWN: But I
keep telling Jibreel

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.103
he's going to go back as Smokey.

00:23:40.103 --> 00:23:40.710
So it's fine.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.320
MARK DOUGLAS: Yeah,
he was amazing.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.190
He was so good.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:47.350
Where am I?

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.340
Well speaking of
Michael Jackson,

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.410
the show starts and ends with
the Motown 25th Anniversary

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.280
Concert.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.830
And I'm old enough that I
remember sitting and watching

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.330
that.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.420
It was in 1983.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.700
Sitting, watching that, and
it was incredible concert.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.790
But the most amazing
part of it was

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.880
when suddenly Michael
Jackson shows up

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.340
and does a magic trick for
every one and shows the world

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:13.940
the Moonwalk.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.356
No one had ever
seen the Moonwalk.

00:24:15.356 --> 00:24:16.760
He gets up and does it.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.660
And as an audience member,
I was like, is he gonna?

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.560
Is he gonna come out?

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.950
And then, did they
ever toy around

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.804
with maybe putting that in?

00:24:24.804 --> 00:24:26.220
CHARL BROWN: We
did have a version

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.969
in the workshop we did a
couple years ago, where

00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:30.510
we did have one of
our cast members--

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.929
I think it was Ephraim at the
time-- who did the Moonwalk.

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:34.220
He was able to do the Moonwalk.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.620
We're not actually sure as to
why that was cut from the show.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.480
That's not in our lane, so--

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.650
MARK DOUGLAS: It really is not
a Motown-- it's not on Motown.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:42.938
BRYAN TERRELL
CLARK: I think it's

00:24:42.938 --> 00:24:45.100
that we just have so
much music to cover.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.540
I mean the show is two
hours and 45 minutes long.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.220
I think the first reading
was something like six hours.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.290
Once it was kind of
in workshop form,

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.970
it was like three
and a half, four.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.480
And then, it was almost four.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.550
And then in previews, we
were at a little over three.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.410
Three, fifteen.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.300
And so we needed to cut-- I
mean it's a great thing to say,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.930
what a legacy Motown has in that
it's got so much music that you

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.280
can't fit it into a show.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.742
But somebody's
going to be upset.

00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:15.200
CHARL BROWN: We're inevitably
going to disappoint somebody.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.105
There are things
that have been cut.

00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:19.230
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: But I
will say I have definitely

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.890
heard that there have been
murmurings of potentially

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.740
trying to put that
Moonwalk moment back

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.680
into the end of the show.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.030
Mr. Gordy is always coming
back and adding things,

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.430
changing lines.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.300
Only a week ago he
added the "I Wish"

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.800
ending, because he
was like, I think

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.590
audience wants to
get up and dance.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.160
TODD WOMACK: That
was incredible.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.390
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
That just got added.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.790
Like a week and a half ago.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.915
MARK DOUGLAS: We have a
question from the audience.

00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:42.770
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.640
My name is Jessica, I
work here at Google.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.610
I'm a huge Motown fan and
I've seen the show two times.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.266
It's fun to see you guys not
in costume and as yourselves.

00:25:54.266 --> 00:25:57.970
But my question was, I know that
so many of the characters you

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.020
play-- being such
a big fan-- have

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.650
such interesting back-stories.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:05.580
And like Paul Williams
battling alcoholism

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.470
and Marvin Gaye being
murdered by his dad.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.810
How do you take those things
that you knew, at the time

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.000
you're playing, are going
to eventually happen

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.230
to your characters?

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.360
And how do you bring
them into your acting

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.227
and how you portray
them at a younger age?

00:26:22.227 --> 00:26:24.060
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: I
mean it's interesting

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.150
how art imitates life,
life imitates art.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.460
But speaking specifically
to Marvin Gaye,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.670
who was murdered by
his dad with a gun.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.000
Again, I was obsessed with
studying it and studying it.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.590
And so it was kind
of all up here.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.850
And I was acting it.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.534
I even would honestly say
from a place that was up here.

00:26:40.534 --> 00:26:41.950
But the first week
of rehearsal, I

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.160
got a phone call that my
cousin was shot and murdered

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.380
in Baltimore.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.120
He was hanging out with some
friends and his phone died.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.030
So he went out to
the car to charge it.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.180
And his friends heard
gunshots, and ran outside,

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.330
and he was just
laying on the ground.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.930
Dead.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:02.502
And so, in a strange
way, everything

00:27:02.502 --> 00:27:04.460
that we were singing
about-- "What's Going On?"

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.130
Dr. King being shot-- it
all just got a lot closer.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.630
And it kind of moved
from a cerebral

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.080
placed to kind of a gut place.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.220
And so it became a lot
easier because every time

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.900
I sang "What's Going On?"
it moved from that place.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.560
But then a lot of things in
the country, just like Motown,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.570
began to happen.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.120
We had the whole Trayvon
Martin situation that happened.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.070
And we found out the verdict
of Trayvon Martin right

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.450
before we sang
"What's Going On?"

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:32.380
And it was a magical,
amazing, tragic moment onstage

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.660
when we sing this song.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.159
And I kind of just turned to
my right and turned to my left,

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:40.129
and the whole entire stage
is sobbing singing this song.

00:27:40.129 --> 00:27:41.670
And so it's one of
those things where

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.274
I think we're kind
of experiencing

00:27:43.274 --> 00:27:44.940
a little bit of what
Motown experienced.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.170
We're out there
to sing and dance.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.610
We want to make
people feel good.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.520
And we want to make people leave
with the love of music the way

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.464
we have it ourselves
as performers.

00:27:52.464 --> 00:27:54.630
But there's some stuff
that's going on in the world.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.130
And so when that begins
to affect the music,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.409
you can feel it change.

00:27:58.409 --> 00:27:59.950
And that's what
happened with Motown.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.050
I think they really
kind of started off

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.780
in this entertainment,
song-and-dance place.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.340
And as the civil rights
movement began to develop,

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.730
and we had everything going on
in Europe and the Vietnam War,

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.771
as time progressed, you can
hear it change in the music.

00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:15.270
So we've been
experiencing that even

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.920
as a cast just
over the last year.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.330
CHARL BROWN: So we've come
a long way from the '60s,

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.560
and we're still in the
same places sometimes, too.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.450
We're still in the middle of the
civil rights movement, as well.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.866
So there's a lot
of things that we

00:28:24.866 --> 00:28:26.804
can address in the
show that are still

00:28:26.804 --> 00:28:29.220
going on in our everyday lives,
as well, that we can bring

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.490
to the stage.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.510
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: And
I'll just say that,

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.530
as some of these
characters start from-- I

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:40.700
know Diana Ross starts from 17
and goes to her mid '30s, '40s.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.150
And I think just kind of
playing in the moment what

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.600
the ambition, what the
motive is at that moment.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.137
OK, just to get a record deal.

00:28:51.137 --> 00:28:52.720
And then it's like,
get closer to him.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.980
And then it's be a star onstage.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.930
And then, oh god.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.060
And playing every
moment as it comes.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.589
That kind of helps to pace the
journey and the arc of what

00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:04.630
everyone's going through.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.110
Because there is so much.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.120
Your motives do change
as the music changes,

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.870
as Motown changes.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.286
And as everyone
grows, you kind of

00:29:11.286 --> 00:29:16.020
try to stay in tune with
that, as far as like your age,

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.740
and what your ambition is,
or what their ambition was.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.610
It helps reading
their autobiographies

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.520
or getting to talk to them,
and seeing chronologically

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.240
what they were mentally
going through at that time

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.635
and then kind of trying
to get where they were.

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:34.370
ALLISON SEMMES: I
play Florence Ballard.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.220
And her life was kind of tragic.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.660
She started off in the Supremes.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.440
And then she was kicked out.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.060
And then she was suffering from
all sorts of mental illnesses

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.500
and alcoholism.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.040
And so I think it's
all about balance,

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.590
how Mr. Gordy wanted
to nod his head to it.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:58.980
But he didn't want to
disrespect her in any way.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.780
There's one scene where I leave
in the middle of the song,

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.950
or at the end of the song
I just kind of walk off.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.750
And Shelley, who is one of
our associate directors,

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:12.770
was saying how she didn't want
me to stumble off, just kind

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:16.700
of hint at it and still
have some type of dignity.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.397
But then at the same time,
mentally as the character,

00:30:20.397 --> 00:30:21.980
I'm going through
that with each song.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.100
I'm excited in beginning
as the Primettes.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.920
And then, as we get
through the songs,

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.620
I become less and
less excited about it.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.440
And finally, at the
end, there's this point

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.000
where my actor mind
has made up that I'm

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.730
done with being a part of it.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.360
And so it's a balance of being
true to the story but then,

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.494
at the same time, knowing
what they went through.

00:30:41.494 --> 00:30:43.410
AUDIENCE: Well you guys
do it very, very well.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.155
CHARL BROWN: Thank you.

00:30:45.155 --> 00:30:46.530
JAWAN JACKSON: I
also want to say

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.070
the thing with me and Donald.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.600
As a Temptation
at the Motown 25,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.110
we're kind of aging backwards.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.014
So we're old.

00:30:54.014 --> 00:30:55.680
AUDIENCE: There are
so many Temptations.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.555
JAWAN JACKSON: Right.

00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:58.350
The Temptations
and the Four Tops.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:02.260
And so, at that
point in our lives,

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.290
our career is
almost on the cusp.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.070
We're trying to reintroduce
ourselves to the world.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:11.230
And that was our moment where
we get to show we still have it.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.280
And so it's kind of
like the motivation of,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.065
we have to re-prove ourselves
to these people and the world

00:31:16.065 --> 00:31:17.690
that we still have
it, and we can still

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.610
go out there and sing, though
we're slower in little older.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:25.470
And then as the show progresses,
you see the younger Temptations

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.800
and they have more life.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.645
And they haven't been going
through the situations,

00:31:30.645 --> 00:31:33.250
the alcoholism parts,
and things like that.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:38.590
But it's a mind
thing where we have

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:42.520
to remain conscious of what
these people went through.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.630
And Melvin Franklin
in particular

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.760
was going through all
kinds of health issues.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.450
And, after shows
he would have to go

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.860
and his feet were
bloody because he

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.170
has blisters and all
kinds of ailments.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.860
And I feel like,
in the show, that I

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.318
took on some of those ailments
because I feel like my knees

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:04.410
and-- It took me out.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.990
Literally.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.650
I kind of like
subconsciously go into that.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.360
And I'm like, no, lord.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.550
I'm 26, I'm not 56.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.880
Let me get it together.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.255
MARK DOUGLAS: It's
amazing to see

00:32:15.255 --> 00:32:17.450
how young you guys
are in person.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.230
I swear to God, by
the end of the show

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:24.600
I have these images of you
guys as being kind of run-down.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.701
But I'm like, oh these
guys are younger than me.

00:32:28.701 --> 00:32:31.970
They look great.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.672
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Run-down?

00:32:33.672 --> 00:32:34.380
MARK DOUGLAS: No.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.038
Except for you.

00:32:35.038 --> 00:32:35.538
Diana?

00:32:35.538 --> 00:32:37.580
Never.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.270
TODD WOMACK: Talking
about connecting reality

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.570
to the characters, KJ,
here's a question for you.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:48.110
There's a moment in the show
where you, as Diana Ross,

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.810
come out and sing "Reach Out
and Touch Somebody's Hands."

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.620
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Just
"Reach Out and Touch."

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.600
TODD WOMACK: "Reach
Out and Touch."

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.100
Sorry.

00:32:54.575 --> 00:32:56.950
MARK DOUGLAS: The outfit you're
wearing during that part,

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.800
you've got be careful what
they reach out and touch.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.759
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Some
people get very touchy.

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:03.091
TODD WOMACK: That's my question.

00:33:03.091 --> 00:33:04.450
Because you bring up somebody.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.200
First of all, it's
after the intermission.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.010
You come out and it's this is
great interactive moment where

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:12.020
that you bring the audience
back into the show.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.060
Energy is way high.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.350
And then you bring
somebody on stage

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.940
and have them sing
along with you.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.410
Last night, it was two people.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.430
It ended up being two really
different but beautiful,

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.810
touching moments.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.880
Is it always that perfect?

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.910
Tell us the spectrum
of things that happen.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.050
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Perfect.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.224
No, it's a broad spectrum.

00:33:33.224 --> 00:33:34.140
You don't really know.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.684
Sometimes I'll be like,
who wants to come up here?

00:33:37.684 --> 00:33:39.350
And sometimes there
will be a volunteer.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.530
Sometimes they'll be like,
please don't look at me.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.370
People will look down.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.780
Luckily, it can be
terrifying for some people

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.090
and I want to find
that terrified guy.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.670
I think that they're
the sweetest.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.180
And I'm like, come on up here.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.150
Play with me.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.630
And then they'll
kind of ease into it.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:04.400
I feel like it makes the
audience really comfortable.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.690
And then sometimes you get
people that are super eager

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.280
and they know that they
have a fierce voice.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.946
And they're auditioning
to be in Motown.

00:34:09.946 --> 00:34:12.379
And you don't know that until
they take the microphone out

00:34:12.379 --> 00:34:15.572
of your hand and you're
like, OK and I still

00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:16.530
have to sing this song.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.132
Thank you very much, sit down.

00:34:19.132 --> 00:34:20.840
MARK DOUGLAS: The guy
that you brought up

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.989
last night it
almost looks like he

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:23.197
could have been in the Mafia.

00:34:23.197 --> 00:34:25.710
He was like, reach out
and touch somebody's hand,

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.409
forget about it.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:30.219
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.752
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: I don't know.

00:34:31.752 --> 00:34:33.210
They seem to love
it and I love it.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.060
And it's personally one of my
favorite moments in the show.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.940
Because I do in my own shows,
in solo shows, or whatever,

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.949
I am so in the
audience and I really

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:45.420
want to connect with people.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.760
And as I've been
watching Diana Ross

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.730
and how she loved
to sing that song--

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.650
she really loved to go
out into the audience

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.670
and sit on their
laps and kiss people.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:57.154
And she was very personable.

00:34:57.154 --> 00:34:59.320
And I think that's such a
good representation of her

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.650
and the kind of performer
that she wanted to be.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.660
MARK DOUGLAS: Was that
something that she

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.340
would do that literal
part of the song?

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.923
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
She would literally

00:35:05.923 --> 00:35:07.930
go out in the audience,
go out to your table,

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.130
or go into the audience.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:09.980
Sit on your lap.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.796
Talk to you.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.010
It was typically
about a 10 or 15

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.651
minute moment in her concerts.

00:35:17.651 --> 00:35:19.900
She would, at the end, have
everyone raise their arms,

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.020
and sway, and sing.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.490
That was her standard
thing in the '70s and '80s.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.400
It was a big part of her gig.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.330
TODD WOMACK: Thank you
Do we have any more

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.597
questions from the smart,
beautiful people in here?

00:35:34.597 --> 00:35:35.930
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Don't be shy.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:36.810
TODD WOMACK: Just
approach the microphone

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:38.060
because they are recording it.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.940
And I'll fill it with
some filler music.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.422
AUDIENCE: Would you like
to sing another song?

00:35:46.422 --> 00:35:47.880
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
We have to think

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.425
about 30 something,
40 songs tonight.

00:35:52.425 --> 00:35:55.240
So why don't you come
and see the show?

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.455
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:57.455 --> 00:35:59.080
MARK DOUGLAS: You
really should see it.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.040
It really is incredible.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.180
We were talking about the
pressure of not only performing

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:07.730
for some of the people that
are still alive that you're

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.330
actually playing, but
when I was coming back

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.560
to sit down in my seat,
I heard an old guy

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.710
like talking to the usher.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:21.620
He was like, I saw the Supremes
in 1957 in Oakland, California.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.040
And then in 1958, I
saw them in Washington.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.740
And the guys is like,
uh-huh, OK, great.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.925
But then I started
looking around

00:36:27.925 --> 00:36:29.420
and it sort of
seemed like there's

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.920
a lot of that type of
person in the audience that

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.320
have lived through this.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.650
And you're kind of representing
their youth in a way.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.460
Is there a lot of pressure
to kind of live up

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.656
to people's memories?

00:36:41.656 --> 00:36:44.030
CHARL BROWN: I think we feel
the responsibility to uphold

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.654
their memories.

00:36:44.654 --> 00:36:47.920
And our thing is, like it
says at the Motown Museum,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.840
live it again.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.590
For a lot of people,
they're coming out.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.870
For a lot of people
actually, we've

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.550
experienced that this is
their first Broadway show.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:55.850
So not only are they getting
to relive their youth,

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.310
but they're also
being introduced

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.800
to the theater, which is
something that I personally

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.634
love about our show.

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:02.091
That people who would not have
normally come to the theater

00:37:02.091 --> 00:37:02.610
are.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.700
But also, I just think
we feel the importance

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.580
of the legacy of
Motown that we try

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.600
to do our best to represent
these people so that we can

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.240
uphold the things
that they remember.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.698
So they don't walk
away being like,

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:17.840
well that wasn't really-- They
stand at the stage door nightly

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.540
and thank us for our portrayals
of the people they love.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.500
And they're like, you
were just like Smokey.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.060
And that means a
lot to me actually

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.900
when they do that, because
that's what we're up here.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.690
That's why we're doing it.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.250
As an artist, that's
what you strive to do,

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.220
is to make people happy.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:30.840
DONALD WEBBER:
Something that's really

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.300
cool to me is, you
look into the audience

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:38.320
and you see someone who's 80
sitting next to someone who's

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.310
50 who's sitting next to
someone who's 20 who's

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.695
sitting next to
someone who's 10.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.370
I remember growing up
listening to this music.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:48.100
I'm 27.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.764
My mother listened
to this music.

00:37:49.764 --> 00:37:51.180
Her mother listened
to this music.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.310
And so it's such a
big responsibility

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.710
to be able to kind of
pass it on in this form.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:58.862
And on Broadway.

00:37:58.862 --> 00:38:01.320
TODD WOMACK: You're not thrown
off by people singing along?

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.890
I swear, the lady
two rows behind me

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.574
was singing all the
parts to "My Girl."

00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:06.430
She was going, my
girl, my girl, my girl.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.266
All the parts.

00:38:08.266 --> 00:38:10.390
I looked back at some point,
because we were fairly

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:11.015
near the front.

00:38:11.015 --> 00:38:14.962
And every fourth person
is singing along.

00:38:14.962 --> 00:38:16.670
CHARL BROWN: There's
a moment in the show

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:17.990
that I have to mention.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.900
When I'm singing "You Really
Got a Hold on Me," uh-oh.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.590
MARK DOUGLAS: Sing
it, Charl, sing it.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.620
CHARL BROWN: (SINGS)
But I love you.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.411
There you go, baby.

00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:27.182
That was for you.

00:38:27.182 --> 00:38:28.807
MARK DOUGLAS: Tony
nominee Charl Brown.

00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:30.182
CHARL BROWN: So
we're doing that.

00:38:30.182 --> 00:38:31.260
It's a very tense moment.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:32.802
We're in the South
and it's the '60s.

00:38:32.802 --> 00:38:35.051
And you know what was going
on in America in the South

00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:35.680
in the '60s.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.130
It was very racially
charged and we're

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.504
trying to have a
dramatic moment.

00:38:38.504 --> 00:38:39.909
I start the song very timidly.

00:38:39.909 --> 00:38:40.950
I'll do it again for you.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.380
(SINGS) I don't like you.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.150
And then I pause.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.337
And then I'm going to
pick back up later.

00:38:46.337 --> 00:38:48.420
Meanwhile the audience,
depending on who they are,

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.202
has going onto the chorus.

00:38:51.202 --> 00:38:53.410
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: And
they're good and happy, too?

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.398
CHARL BROWN: They're like--

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:56.523
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: (SINGS
LOUDLY) But I love you.

00:38:56.523 --> 00:38:57.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:57.732 --> 00:39:00.190
CHARL BROWN: And they're like,
you really got a hold on me.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.330
I'm like--

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:04.350
(SINGS) But I love you.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.790
This is my gig.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.540
They're paying me.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.840
No, but we do have some people
who are very responsive.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.690
But actually it's
all in good fun.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.849
I do love it.

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:13.390
It's fun to have to
take back control

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:14.710
of the audience in that way.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.430
But a lot of
people, like I said,

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.340
it's their first
time on Broadway.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.280
They come to have a concert
and have a good time.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.620
The ushers constantly have
to ask them to sit and remain

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.204
in their seats so the
people behind them can see.

00:39:24.204 --> 00:39:25.620
We do have a
standing room section

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.670
if you want to come and stand.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.560
So it's a fun time,
and we love being

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.387
a part of that for people.

00:39:31.387 --> 00:39:33.470
ALLISON SEMMES: That's the
thrill of live theater.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.730
It's not a movie where
there's a screen.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.289
But when the audience is
involved, it's like, yes,

00:39:38.289 --> 00:39:39.330
we're all in it together.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.057
And it kind of just
puts down the wall.

00:39:41.057 --> 00:39:42.890
MARK DOUGLAS: It makes
it new again for you.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:44.473
JAWAN JACKSON: I had
a person my first

00:39:44.473 --> 00:39:46.400
like the first
month of previews.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.470
She would stand outside every
day, everywhere we went.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.390
Melvin, Melvin!

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.230
And I'm like, who?

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.106
You!

00:39:54.106 --> 00:39:55.730
Oh my god, I love you!

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.380
Literally everywhere I went.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.514
I would go to the grocery
store, Good Morning America.

00:40:00.514 --> 00:40:02.430
She'd just scream my
name and would stand out,

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.110
just scream my name, and
ask me to hug her and take

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.400
a picture every time.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.490
These people are
invested in this show.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.370
And they really think
that we are these people

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.257
that we portray.

00:40:12.257 --> 00:40:13.090
I'm like, I'm Jawan.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.029
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:15.029 --> 00:40:18.200
TODD WOMACK: No, you're Melvin!

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.450
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: I just want
piggyback on the responsibility

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:23.810
the show and the connections.

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.920
Last night, I went out the stage
door at the end of the show.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.700
And I met these two
women from the South,

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.050
and they were like 70 and 71.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.910
And they were talking
about how they

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.640
were school teachers
in the '60s,

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.970
and how they would see the
first black-- she's like,

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.580
I had the first black
child in my class.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.620
And I just know
how tense it was.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.420
I'm so glad you
guys really talked

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.540
about how tense
it was down there.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.970
Because she was
from South Carolina.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.830
That is a real thing and we
would listen to this music.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.530
And it really
brought down walls.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.500
It really opened up-- She
was like, I went to a concert

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.400
for Marvin Gaye.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.900
And it was the first
time I had ever

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.190
seen black women and
white women screaming

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:11.530
for the same person at the
same time in the same building.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.600
I was like, Oh my.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.020
It just reminds you
how real this is.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.750
Being young and
not really having

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.140
lived that kind of segregation?

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.480
You're kind of like, holy--
when someone can come up to you

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.720
and tell you and cry
to you about seeing

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.962
that first black child who
was terrified in the room.

00:41:27.962 --> 00:41:30.170
She's just like how do I
make this child feel better?

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.430
No one needs to feel like this.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.140
And for her to relive that.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.010
And also get relieved that
this is where we are now

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.702
by watching the show, it
just touched me so deeply.

00:41:39.702 --> 00:41:41.910
I stood there and talked to
them for like 30 minutes,

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.520
because it just felt so good
to hear how this moved them

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.330
and how remind
them of a time that

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.672
was so vulnerable for
the entire country.

00:41:51.672 --> 00:41:53.130
MARK DOUGLAS: That's
great that you

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.780
get to see it happen
every night, you know?

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.420
Everybody is brought together
by this music before your eyes

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:58.920
every night.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.740
It must be a great feeling.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:01.520
TODD WOMACK: Yeah.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.270
We have about four
minutes left but I just

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:07.134
want to ask you guys
about the end of the show.

00:42:07.134 --> 00:42:09.550
Having been a performer and
stuff, seeing tons of Broadway

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:10.290
shows.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:15.130
I have never seen anything
like the end of the show.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:17.550
Everyone in the audience
is on their feet clapping.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:18.580
And you don't make them.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.390
Everybody's just giving
a standing ovation

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.586
in the big concert part.

00:42:23.586 --> 00:42:25.210
MARK DOUGLAS: You
feel like something's

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.220
about to start, not end.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.324
TODD WOMACK: I mean it
was late on a work day.

00:42:29.324 --> 00:42:30.990
You've got older
people in the audience.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.190
That place is thriving.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.180
On their feet.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.100
So much fun.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.610
The show ends and people are
like, all right let's go!

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.995
There's so much energy.

00:42:38.995 --> 00:42:40.862
MARK DOUGLAS:
Let's start a band.

00:42:40.862 --> 00:42:42.570
TODD WOMACK: Is it
like that every night?

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.180
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Every
day, matinees, every day.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:45.900
It's shocking.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.540
It's amazing to see because you
aren't always a part of shows

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.024
that do that.

00:42:51.024 --> 00:42:52.440
That's what I love
about the show,

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.731
that people are going to leave.

00:42:53.731 --> 00:42:56.990
And no matter what is going on
their life, even from the cast,

00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:00.430
I think it's a moment where
you just kind of check out.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.330
And you feel really good.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.890
It just kind of motivates
you to be happy.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.600
There's something really
joyous about this show.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.370
And Mr. Gordy and
Charles Randolph-Wright,

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.450
my mom's fiance had passed
away the day before I started.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:23.509
And so they were supposed
to come that weekend.

00:43:23.509 --> 00:43:25.300
And she decided to come
the following week.

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.020
And they were like,
have her come.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:33.222
Charles said that Trayvon
Martin's mom came twice.

00:43:33.222 --> 00:43:35.680
She had to come twice because
it just made her feel better.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.179
She was like, this
is the first time

00:43:37.179 --> 00:43:42.550
I've really smiled and laughed
since my son was killed.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:47.210
And so it's amazing to me
how it does transform you.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.910
And even going
through that myself,

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.320
and losing someone-- and
lots of people in this past

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.790
have had a lot of personal
drama-- but for some reason,

00:43:53.790 --> 00:44:00.310
that building and this show
has such power to uplift.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:01.800
And I think that
is transcendent.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.170
And we watch it every
single day as the audience

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.340
stands up, and is
screaming, and clapping,

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.270
and just wants to
have a joyous moment.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.370
And I've never seen that.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:15.609
This is my fourth Broadway show
and I've never seen it happen.

00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:17.150
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK:
It's infectious.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.569
I mean it really is kind
of like a sugar high.

00:44:19.569 --> 00:44:21.360
You might think, I've
been at work all day.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.170
The last thing I want
to do is come and sit

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:26.220
for 2 and 1/2 hours or
2:45 and watch a show.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.750
And literally it's like
getting a shot of adrenaline.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.310
It's like whatever that juice
they give to Honey Boo Boo

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.290
Child.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:34.492
TODD WOMACK: Go-go juice!

00:44:34.492 --> 00:44:36.950
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK: I mean
even as performers, you come in

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.110
and you're like, woo!

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.220
We were at Google all day
and we did interviews,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.250
and we did this.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:41.970
I'm so tired.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.093
And then that music
starts and by the end,

00:44:44.093 --> 00:44:46.400
you're like, woohoo!

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.970
It's one of those things.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.300
Come to the show,
it's so infections

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.416
that literally people have flown
their relatives out to see it.

00:44:53.416 --> 00:44:55.040
We've gone outside
and people are like,

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.850
I live down the street.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.570
I've seen this show four times
but I flew out my whole family.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.410
I mean it really is
one of those shows.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.950
So come and see it.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.180
It'll literally uplift you.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.340
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN: Especially
if you're in a bad mood.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.560
MARK DOUGLAS: It's
musical go-go juice.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.880
BRYAN TERRELL CLARK:
It's musical go-go juice.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.480
TODD WOMACK: We want to thank
you guys so much for your time,

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.618
and your effort,
and your dreams.

00:45:11.618 --> 00:45:13.159
CHARL BROWN: Thank
you for having us.

00:45:13.159 --> 00:45:14.133
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
Yeah, it's our pleasure.

00:45:14.133 --> 00:45:14.900
MARK DOUGLAS: Go
warm up your voice.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:15.330
Drink some tea.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.630
TODD WOMACK: Drink some tea.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:18.165
MARK DOUGLAS: Get in character.

00:45:18.165 --> 00:45:20.541
Thank you so much for coming
out and talking to us nerds.

00:45:20.541 --> 00:45:22.165
TODD WOMACK: Yeah,
the show is amazing.

00:45:22.165 --> 00:45:22.940
Go see it.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.780
It's a lot of fun.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.450
It's so much fun.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.980
KRYSTAL JOY BROWN:
Thank you, guys.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.380
CHARL BROWN: And
thanks for lunch, too.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.790
That was great.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.470
MARK DOUGLAS: Thank you so much.
