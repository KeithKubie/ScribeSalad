00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.935
 - So when you were
 a young deaf girl,

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:04.637
 what kind of access
 to information

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.672
 and technology did you have?

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.241
 - To be honest,
 I was closed off.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.009
 I spent
 my whole childhood lost.

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.577
 I would be sitting
 next to my parents

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.346
 as they watched a movie or TV.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.714
 They'd be laughing at the TV

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:15.848
 and I would just be looking

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.517
 trying to guess
 what was going on,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.485
 and if I needed
 to call my parents,

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.254
 I would have to walk up
 to a stranger,

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.756
 tap them on the shoulder
 and hand them a note saying,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.957
 "Would you mind calling
 my mother

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.559
 and having her
 pick me up here."

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.661
 Then I'd just have to stand
 next to this weird stranger

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.263
 and watch them blabber
 on the phone

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.766
 and then look at me like,
 "Okay, your mom's on her way."

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.401
 - Yeah, well, I mean,
 it's a good thing

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.003
 they weren't calling, like,
 their other kidnapper buddy.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.571
 Like,
"Hey, I got this hot deaf girl.

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.339
 Bring the van."
 - Ha, ha.

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:41.874
 You know, you get used to it.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.410
 You just kind of accept
 that that's your lot in life.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.146
"I guess I'll just have limited
 access to communication."

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.149
 - So did the Internet remove
 some of those limitations?

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:51.517
 - Absolutely.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.886
 The Internet and technology
 gave me freedom.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:57.023
 I feel more intelligent,
 more confident,

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.325
and I feel better about myself.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:00.560
 - And when you were young
 and you wanted to,

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.528
 like, call a friend,
 how would you do that?

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:05.331
 - I would actually have to ask
 my mom to call my friend's mom

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.667
 and set up an appointment
 for the two of us to hang out,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.435
 and then we'd drive 30 miles
 or something

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:10.670
 to go meet my friend.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.738
 - Right, so now
 you can finally just call her.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.640
 - Right.
 I could do that right now.

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:17.276
[line trilling]

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.611
 Hi, I can't talk.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:21.147
 I'm on TV doing an interview
 with Moshe.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.049
 Look, look, look,
 here's my best friend.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.283
 - Hey, everyone!
 [scattered laughter]

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.685
 - So then I decided,
 "You know what?

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.520
 I'm going to get
 a cochlear implant.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:28.921
 One of those robotic ears,

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.124
 and that
 really changed my life.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.359
 - You ever see those videos
 of deaf people turning on

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.061
 their cochlear implants
 for the first time

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.562
 and everybody gets
 all emotional?

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.498
 Like, I realize we never got
 a chance to do that,

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.199
 and I've always been
 kind of disappointed.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.468
 Do you think we could try it?
 - Okay...

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.704
 - Okay, now fake turn it on.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start size:28% position:72%
Hey, Mom.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.541
 - Is that your voice? 
- Mom, here's my voice.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.076
 [laughter] 
[mouthing]

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.844
 - Oh, my goodness.
 [mimics crying]

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.246
- [mimics crying]
 - Oh, I can't believe

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.448
 that's your voice.
 [laughter and applause]

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:56.616
- [mouthing]
 - [mimics crying]

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.453
- [mimics crying]
 - I'm so happy.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.588
 [scattered laughter]

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:05.591
[violin screeching]

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:12.598
â™ª â™ª

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.800
 - Thumbs down.
 Sorry.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:18.104
 Yeah, look, I'm deaf
 and it still sounds terrible.

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:19.739
 You know,
 I remember when I first got

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.341
 a closed-captioning device,
 like, a subtitle machine,

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:23.943
 and I would put it on
 and sit with you

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.444
 and we would watch
 "Sesame Street" together,

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.580
 watching the subtitles.
 I had captioning

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:29.949
 and I could finally understand
 what was going on.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.584
 I missed what was happening
 when I was a kid,

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:32.852
 but I didn't have to miss it

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.388
 when you and your brother
 were young.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.657
- Well, thanks for coming, Mom.
 I love you.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.892
 - I love you too.
 - Now, uh, go.

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.325
 Seriously, go.
 Get out of my house.
