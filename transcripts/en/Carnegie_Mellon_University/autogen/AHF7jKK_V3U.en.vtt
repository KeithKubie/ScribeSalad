University of Chicago so when he was
 

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.100

grading a test paper this year and I
 

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.930
grading a test paper this year and I
asked my students that I teach what is

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:10.940
asked my students that I teach what is
 

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.520
asked my students that I teach what is
the age of the universe and someone

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:12.530
the age of the universe and someone
 

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.810
the age of the universe and someone
wrote 14 billion years in two weeks and

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:15.820
wrote 14 billion years in two weeks and
 

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.450
wrote 14 billion years in two weeks and
I try to teach them you know accuracy

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:19.460
I try to teach them you know accuracy
 

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.250
I try to teach them you know accuracy
and what you can say so I marked it

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:21.260
and what you can say so I marked it
 

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.919
and what you can say so I marked it
wrong and the student came to me and

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:23.929
wrong and the student came to me and
 

00:30:23.929 --> 00:30:26.650
wrong and the student came to me and
said how can this be wrong for two weeks

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:26.660
said how can this be wrong for two weeks
 

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.540
said how can this be wrong for two weeks
ago you told us the universe was 14

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:28.550
ago you told us the universe was 14
 

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:34.250

the universe today is different than the
 

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.340
the universe today is different than the
universe of billion years ago so this is

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:44.350
universe of billion years ago so this is
 

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.210
universe of billion years ago so this is
a theory however we can show that this

ways in at least two ways one way we can
 

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.690
ways in at least two ways one way we can
determine the mass of a galaxy is just

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700
determine the mass of a galaxy is just
 

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.170
determine the mass of a galaxy is just
by seeing how bright it is if we see how

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:06.180
by seeing how bright it is if we see how
 

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.960
by seeing how bright it is if we see how
bright the galaxy is we can get a good

the galaxy we understand the masses of
 

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.300
the galaxy we understand the masses of
stars so we can weigh a galaxy determine

its mass by seeing how bright it is we
 

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.600
its mass by seeing how bright it is we
can also determine the mass of a galaxy

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:23.610
can also determine the mass of a galaxy
 

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:28.760
can also determine the mass of a galaxy
by measuring how rapidly it spins the

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:31.609
that this is not the answer and the best
 

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:34.180
that this is not the answer and the best
answer today seems to be that the mass

explanation for this phenomenon that we

00:38:59.560 --> 00:38:59.570
explanation for this phenomenon that we

so let's explore the idea that the dark

so let's explore the idea that the dark
 

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.160
so let's explore the idea that the dark
matter is a new elementary particle or a

that dark energy has nothing to do with
 

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.400
that dark energy has nothing to do with

going to be something fundamental and
wonderful so maybe it's not a

wonderful so maybe it's not a
 

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.450
wonderful so maybe it's not a

will be even more interesting than a

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:47.450
 
dark energy since so the question is

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:47.460
dark energy since so the question is
 

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.000
dark energy since so the question is
does dark energy density appear to be

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.010
does dark energy density appear to be
 

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:53.240
does dark energy density appear to be
constant over time and that is the 1

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:53.250
constant over time and that is the 1
 

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:57.020

billion dollar question this is the

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.030
billion dollar question this is the
 

01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.210
billion dollar question this is the
question that we want to know the answer

01:01:59.210 --> 01:01:59.220
question that we want to know the answer
 

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:02.599
question that we want to know the answer
to is it in fact a constant or is it

01:02:02.599 --> 01:02:02.609
to is it in fact a constant or is it
 

01:02:02.609 --> 01:02:04.520
to is it in fact a constant or is it
something else that's changing with time

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:04.530
something else that's changing with time

something else that's changing with time
and the only handle we have to study

01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619
and the only handle we have to study
 

01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:10.340
and the only handle we have to study
this now is to study how the expansion

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:10.350
this now is to study how the expansion
 

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:12.859
this now is to study how the expansion
of the universe changes with time that

01:02:12.859 --> 01:02:12.869
of the universe changes with time that

of the universe changes with time that
we use telescopes to try to study space

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920
we use telescopes to try to study space
 

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.800
we use telescopes to try to study space
missions and that is the billion dollar

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:18.810
missions and that is the billion dollar
 

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:21.470
missions and that is the billion dollar
question perhaps the answer to that

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480
question perhaps the answer to that
 

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.859
question perhaps the answer to that
question will guide our theoretical

01:02:23.859 --> 01:02:23.869
question will guide our theoretical
 

01:02:23.869 --> 01:02:26.390
question will guide our theoretical
understanding of the nature of dark

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400
understanding of the nature of dark
 

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:44.040
understanding of the nature of dark
energy see there was a question yes sir

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:44.050
 
 

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:49.660
 
so so dark energy provides the usual

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:49.670
so so dark energy provides the usual
 

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.580
so so dark energy provides the usual
explanation for dark energy is that it

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:51.590
explanation for dark energy is that it
 

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:54.460
explanation for dark energy is that it
provides an energy of space a mass of

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:54.470
provides an energy of space a mass of
 

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.880
provides an energy of space a mass of
space that acts in such a way that it

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:57.890
space that acts in such a way that it
 

01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:01.570
space that acts in such a way that it
has a pressure a negative pressure that

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:01.580
has a pressure a negative pressure that
 

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.970
has a pressure a negative pressure that
pushes spaced apart in the cosmic

pushes spaced apart in the cosmic
expansion that's about all we know about

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:07.190
expansion that's about all we know about
 

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:10.690
expansion that's about all we know about
it whether it's a constant or not we can

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:10.700
it whether it's a constant or not we can
 

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.480
it whether it's a constant or not we can
only put limits on whether it's related

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:13.490
only put limits on whether it's related
 

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.640
only put limits on whether it's related
to a cosmological constant or something

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:15.650
to a cosmological constant or something
 

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:18.430
to a cosmological constant or something
else whether it's gravity that's the

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440
else whether it's gravity that's the
 

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.830
else whether it's gravity that's the
problem that our Einstein did not have

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:20.840
problem that our Einstein did not have
 

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.020
problem that our Einstein did not have
the last word on gravity we don't know

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:23.030
the last word on gravity we don't know
 

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:25.570
the last word on gravity we don't know
the answer to so the only thing that we

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:25.580
the answer to so the only thing that we
 

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.030
the answer to so the only thing that we
know is that the expansion of the

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:28.040
know is that the expansion of the
 

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.100
know is that the expansion of the
universe is doing something strange

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:30.110
universe is doing something strange
 

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:33.190
universe is doing something strange
that's unexpected and we attribute that

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200
that's unexpected and we attribute that
 

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:40.890
that's unexpected and we attribute that
to dark energy that's the mystery yes

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:40.900
 
 

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:50.740
 
I'm sorry say again I still didn't hear

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:50.750
I'm sorry say again I still didn't hear
 

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:53.980
I'm sorry say again I still didn't hear
it it's 0 entry it was a question about

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:53.990
it it's 0 entry it was a question about
 

01:03:53.990 --> 01:04:01.609
it it's 0 entry it was a question about
entropy

01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619
 
 

01:04:01.619 --> 01:04:05.009
 
so entropy is something that's well

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:05.019
so entropy is something that's well
 

01:04:05.019 --> 01:04:08.099
so entropy is something that's well
understood in a thermodynamic setting

01:04:08.099 --> 01:04:08.109
understood in a thermodynamic setting
 

01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:10.229
understood in a thermodynamic setting
and measures the disorder of the system

01:04:10.229 --> 01:04:10.239
and measures the disorder of the system
 

01:04:10.239 --> 01:04:13.680
and measures the disorder of the system
what's not well understood is how do how

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:13.690
what's not well understood is how do how
 

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:16.469
what's not well understood is how do how
to understand entropy when gravity is

01:04:16.469 --> 01:04:16.479
to understand entropy when gravity is
 

01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:20.459
to understand entropy when gravity is
included so entropy tells us that's not

01:04:20.459 --> 01:04:20.469
included so entropy tells us that's not
 

01:04:20.469 --> 01:04:22.529
included so entropy tells us that's not
your question it was a good answer

01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:22.539
your question it was a good answer
 

01:04:22.539 --> 01:04:26.549
your question it was a good answer
though well why don't you see me after

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559
though well why don't you see me after
 

01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:29.130
though well why don't you see me after
and I'll uh I'll come up with the answer

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:29.140
and I'll uh I'll come up with the answer
 

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:33.049
and I'll uh I'll come up with the answer
to maybe the question that you're asking

01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059
 
 

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:36.239

the implications of finding out in fact
the speed of light is not constant the

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119
the speed of light is not constant the
 

01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:41.849
the speed of light is not constant the
implications of the speed of light is

01:04:41.849 --> 01:04:41.859
implications of the speed of light is
 

01:04:41.859 --> 01:04:44.910
implications of the speed of light is
not constant would overturn that one of

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920
not constant would overturn that one of
 

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.589
not constant would overturn that one of
the basis of Einstein's theory of

01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599
the basis of Einstein's theory of
 

01:04:46.599 --> 01:04:48.359
the basis of Einstein's theory of
gravity you would yield a new theory of

01:04:48.359 --> 01:04:48.369
gravity you would yield a new theory of
 

01:04:48.369 --> 01:04:51.359
gravity you would yield a new theory of
gravity a new either understanding of

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:51.369
gravity a new either understanding of
 

01:04:51.369 --> 01:04:53.370
gravity a new either understanding of
nature a misunderstanding of nature

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:53.380
nature a misunderstanding of nature
 

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.380
nature a misunderstanding of nature
depending upon your point of view it

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:55.390
depending upon your point of view it
 

01:04:55.390 --> 01:05:01.979
depending upon your point of view it
would be a profound discovery and it

01:05:01.979 --> 01:05:01.989
would be a profound discovery and it
 

01:05:01.989 --> 01:05:03.660
would be a profound discovery and it
would it would overturn so many things

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:03.670
would it would overturn so many things
 

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:20.529
would it would overturn so many things
it would be great thank

01:05:20.529 --> 01:05:20.539
 
 

01:05:20.539 --> 01:05:22.599
