00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.900
The answer as to which way you should work

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.180
it is, well it all depends, that there is

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.660
no real correct answer. because it's possible for your

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.980
home to work with either model. If the thermostat determines

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.260
how hot the heater is, then the first answer

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.530
is correct. you know, set it high first. That'll

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.830
get you to the correct temperature as quickly as

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.920
possible. But, you know, that's not how most homes work.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.100
In most homes, the second answer is correct, because

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.020
the home heater either turns all the way on, or

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.670
all the way off. We call that bang, bang

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.420
control, all the way one way or all the way

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.870
the other. The thermostat turns the heat on full

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.760
until it reaches the set point, at which point it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.590
turns it off. So, setting the temperature too high doesn't

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.330
do any good. It doesn't speed things up and worse,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.230
if you forget to turn it back, well the house keeps getting hotter and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.970
hotter and hotter. Wasting energy and maybe

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.370
making you uncomfortable by now being too hot.
