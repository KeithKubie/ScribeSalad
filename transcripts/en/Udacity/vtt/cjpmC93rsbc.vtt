00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.840
For ant questions, it was fine to convert our numbers from scientific notation

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.912
to being normal decimal numbers, and then multiply them together. But what if

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:12.797
the exponents were much bigger? We'd probably get lost in all the zeroes we'd

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:17.602
have to write, or at least I would. I think we need a better strategy. When

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:20.626
we're multiplying two numbers in scientific notation together, we can use

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:25.008
something we learned about very early on in this course. It's the commutative

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.960
property of multiplication. Let's see how this works. Let's say that we want to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.250
multiply 2 times 10 to the negative 4th, by 3 times 10 to the 3rd again. Well,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.378
the commutative property of multiplication says that we can rearrange the order

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:42.520
of any of these things we're multiplying together. What we actually have over

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.095
here, even though we have some grouping by parentheses right now, Is just four

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:51.638
numbers multiplied. Either ignore the parentheses and just say 2 times 3 and

00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:57.350
then multiply that by the 10s but they're exponents. We can rearrange this so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.842
that instead we multiply the 2 and the 3 together. And then we multiply the two

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:06.610
factors with the bases of 10. Now what is this equal to in scientific notation?

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.278
Think back to the start of the course again, when we talked about how to

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:12.069
combine exponents, when the base is the same.
