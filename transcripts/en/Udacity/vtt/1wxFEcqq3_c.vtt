00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's talk about a problem that often occurs in robotics called a "systematic bias."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It goes as follows.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When you ordered your car, you believed the front wheels were 100% aligned,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but your mechanic made a mistake, and he aligned the wheels a little bit at an angle.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, for people that isn't a big concern. When we notice this we just steer a little bit stronger.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But let's try this out with out our proportional controller.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm now adding a line that sets the steering drift to be 10 degrees,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which in radians is this expression over here, using setsteeringdrift command.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I now want you to run my proportional controller with parameter 0.2,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and for now we're going to set the differential controller to zero.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
When you do this, what happens?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It works just as before or it causes a new, big crosstrack error?

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Go try it out.
