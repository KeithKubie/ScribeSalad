GIRIJA SUREKA: Welcome everyone,
welcome to the

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.570
Authors at Google talk.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.680
It is my pleasure to
introduce Dorie.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.180
I'm Girija Sureka, by the way.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.810
A brief introduction
about Dorie.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.420
She is considered as the
branding expert.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.840
She is a former presidential
campaign spokeswoman.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.850
She is also a frequent
contributor to "Harvard

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.920
Business Review," "Forbes," and
other publications, and

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.340
she's also given lectures
all over the world.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.420
She's here to talk to us about
her book, "Reinventing You."

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.320
And without any delays,
I'll let her begin.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.570
Please welcome.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.100
DORIE CLARK: Hi everyone.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.370
I'm really glad to be here
at Google today.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.480
My journey toward writing
"Reinventing You" actually

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.490
started because I was
a journalist.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.850
That was my first job after
graduate school.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.830
And as you can see I worked
for possibly the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.170
coolest paper ever.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.430
We had rock stars wearing
cat masks on it.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.340
It was an alternative weekly
paper in Boston called the

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.660
"Boston Phoenix."

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.560
So I got to go to any
event I wanted.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.460
I got to ask people obnoxious
questions.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.570
It was a fantastic career.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.130
But a year into my career
I got laid off.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.400
And we probably all know
the root cause for

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.030
some of these things.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.060
You probably recognize this
ransom note like interface.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.410
And between the years 2001
and 2009 nearly 40% of US

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.370
journalists lost their jobs.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.310
And so at first I thought, you
know, I'm just going to get

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.050
another job.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.640
I'm going to get hired
on at another paper.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.440
And I slowly began to realize
that that was, in fact, not

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.770
going to happen.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.450
And so I needed a plan B. And
over the course of the ensuing

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.870
decade I feel really fortunate
that I was able to do some

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.690
very cool things.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.930
I was a presidential campaign
spokesperson,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.560
as Girija was saying.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.150
I ran a nonprofit.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.170
I made a documentary film.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.930
And seven years ago I started
my business doing marketing

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.310
strategy consulting.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.760
But one thing that I have
learned over the course of

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.180
time when I was changing these
jobs and careers and was so

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.690
excited, because I would have
something new going on, and I

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.120
sent out emails and
let people know--

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.910
and people would still ask me,
when I'd run into them, a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.380
question about the job that
I had like four years ago.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.920
Oh, so, what campaign
are you on now?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.240
And I had already moved
on to the next thing.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.300
And so ultimately I think we all
live in a world where we

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.140
may be on the verge of at least
feeling like there's too

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.910
many connections.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.910
We have 1,000 Facebook friends,
10,000 Google+

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.220
friends in our circles.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.570
And there's just too much
to keep up with.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.660
And so for most people, and
maybe some of you guys have

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.590
had this experience, I feel like
their perceptions of us

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.040
may well be out of date by
two years, three years.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.600
You run into people, and it's
like, oh, and you've had a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.340
baby in the interim since
I've seen you.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.780
People are not keeping up.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.090
And so ultimately that's
not their fault.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.750
We have a lot of things
that we need to be

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.110
keeping on top of.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.340
But what it does mean is this
that if we want to be the ones

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.470
considered for new
opportunities, for promotions,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.150
for the chance to do the really
awesome projects, then

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.490
we need to make sure that
somehow or other people hear

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.060
about and know about what
we're doing, what we're

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.300
capable of, where we are now.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.900
But the trick, of course, is
that as with all things

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.670
personal branding, you can't
do it in an obnoxious way

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.520
where you're just sort of
foghorning your way into

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.760
people's consciousness.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.990
You've got to find a better
and more subtle way of

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.530
conveying your value, and
your worth, and what

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.710
you can really do.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.485
And so that's what I tried to
capture in "Reinventing You"

00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:10.810
is someone who had been through
that process a lot.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.380
Whether you're reinventing
yourself in a really dramatic

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.880
way, by having a totally
different career, or whether

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.779
you're moving around.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.079
I mean I know at Google, for
instance, you're encouraged to

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.210
get new positions and new jobs
every couple of years.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.090
You have the opportunity,
working at a place like this,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.680
to move to different country
offices, to do rotations, to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.170
move into new areas.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.110
This is a company that wants
you to learn and grow and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.440
reinvent yourself.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.040
But when you're doing it you
also need to be perceived in

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.430
different ways.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.560
People look at you in a
different context when you're

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.600
a software engineer, versus
when you're doing

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.460
philanthropic projects, or
when you're working in

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.870
advertising sales.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.690
And so that's the question.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.050
How do you really determine
how you are viewed

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.200
professionally?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.775
And how do you make
sure it lines up?

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:06.980
And so I'm just going to see
if this magic large clicker

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.360
actually works.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.040
Maybe not.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.860
So I'll keep strolling back
and forth periodically.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.080
So that's what led to my book,
"Reinventing You." So there's

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.410
three basic phases to the
reinvention process.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.960
The first one is really drilling
down and figuring out

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.210
how you're perceived
by other people.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.120
That's kind of the
starting point.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.470
The second step is determining
what you want to be known for.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.730
What's the brand that you really
would like to have in

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.690
the world, and setting
that out.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.520
And then thirdly finally, which
we'll be talking about

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.270
each in turn, is how do you
manifest that brand?

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.740
Because once you've settled on
something, you don't just kind

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.910
of come up to people and
say, hi, I'm Dorie

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.970
and my brand is XYZ.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.810
We don't put it out
there like that.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.780
What we do is, we are
in the world.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.770
We do things.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.160
We participate in activities.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.430
We interact with people.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.050
And from that, people
extrapolate what our brand is.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.660
It's not something we say.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.370
It's something that we live.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.430
And so the question is, how can
we live in such a way, how

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.890
can we do things so that people
are more likely to get

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.600
the right impression of us?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.820
I know sometimes even the
concept, even the phrase of

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.170
personal brand is something
that kind of gets people's

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.660
back up a little bit.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.690
And maybe that's the
case first for some

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.910
of you guys, even.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.930
Really where it comes from, in
1997, a gentleman named Tom

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.550
Peters, a well known management
thinker, wrote a

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.340
famous cover story for "Fast
Company" Magazine called "The

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.860
Brand Called You." And it sort
of launched the modern era of

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.960
personal branding.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.570
But when I used the phrase, I
want to be clear, what I'm

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.860
talking about is simply a
synonym for your reputation.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.160
This is not some new-fangled
shenanigan where we're trying

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.040
to spit-polish you
and package you.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.100
It's about being conscious
of your reputation.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.220
And I think for anyone who cares
about their career, you

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.010
want to figure out, how
are you viewed?

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.105
How do you want to be viewed?

00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:17.350
And if there is daylight between
those two things,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.180
hopefully you want to try
to close that gap.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.470
And I should also point out the
other thing that I hear

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.640
often, when we're talking
about personal brand, is

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.160
sometimes, for some people,
it connotes phoniness or

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.660
inauthenticity.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.810
And I also want to be very clear
that that is not what

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.920
I'm talking about.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.605
It's not a question of sticking
your finger to the

00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:43.980
wind, and trying to figure out
what the world wants, and then

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.240
molding yourself to that, or
trying to get to reinvent

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.720
yourself as something you
think other people want.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.070
We're actually, I would argue,
exiting the era where what

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.810
mattered most was,
do you fit in?

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.670
Do you color inside the lines?

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.820
Are you the same as
everybody else?

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.800
And we are moving more and more
toward a world where what

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.320
matters is the exact opposite.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.280
What matters is your difference,
and what you can

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.360
bring to the table that
no one else can.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.260
And if you can articulate that,
if you can be clear on

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.440
that value, then that actually
is your career insurance.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.840
That is the thing
that makes you

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.740
indispensable to your company.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.870
So that's what I wanted to
talk a little bit about.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.230
So how do you go about
discovering your brand?

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.419
This right here is my favorite
quote in the entirety of

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.990
"Reinventing You."
This is an angel

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.750
investor named Judy Robinett.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.950
And when I was writing the book
I was talking to her on

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.920
the phone, and she said, Dorie,
this is fantastic.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.110
This reminds me of a
Hungarian proverb.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.930
And so this, of course, if three
people tell you you're a

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.850
horse, buy a saddle.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.610
And what this means, the reason
I like this, is that

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.350
ultimately your brand is
not what you say it is.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.580
It's not what you want it to
be, what you wish it were.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.880
Your brain is what other
people say it is.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.140
And so the starting point,
always, is figuring out what

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.320
other people think.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.530
And then, if it is not matching
up, taking the

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.360
actions you need proactively
to get control over that.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.960
So incidentally, I was in London
last month, and I spoke

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.930
at the Google offices
in London there.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.800
They're a great group
of folks.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.450
But the night before, my
publisher, Harvard Business

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.700
Review press, did an event, sort
of a big open event where

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.830
people came in.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.950
And a woman came up to me
afterward and she said, I

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.310
liked your talk very much.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.940
I am from Hungary.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.390
I do not know this proverb.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.210
So we will attribute it to
Judy Robinett, but the

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.000
sentiment stands.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.230
So there's a few different ways
that you can begin to get

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.050
a handle on it.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.950
The first, obviously, which
you people invented is

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.310
Googling yourself.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.150
And hopefully, all of you guys,
you're paid to do this.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.040
So hopefully you do it
every day anyway.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.080
Google alerts are like the
greatest gift to personal

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.580
branding ever.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.870
But I will ask you, the next
time you do this, do it with

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.470
one question in mind.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.150
That question, that frame,
is if this were the only

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.500
information that someone knew
about me, what would

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.330
they make of me?

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.010
Because more and more we are
moving to a place where that

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.030
is the case.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.140
You're dealing with people,
you're working with colleagues

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.010
internationally, people
who you've never met.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.760
And literally, even though we're
three dimensional, fully

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.450
fleshed out characters to
ourselves and in our own

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.090
minds, to them, you're
your Google search.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.380
And so you have to pay special
attention to what's coming

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.970
across and what's being
presented there.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.970
The next thing, many of you
perhaps have had the

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.560
opportunity to work with
an executive coach.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.940
If you have, that's a fantastic
thing, because

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.370
having that outside
perspective can be

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.380
interesting or useful.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:26.190
But if folks haven't, because
oftentimes companies may not

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.610
be able to provide the
opportunity for everyone, it

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.210
doesn't mean that we can't
gain that knowledge.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.940
The first thing that an
executive coach will do,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.810
generally, is a 360 interview.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.700
So like a circle, they will
interview your boss, your

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.180
peers, your employees, and
they will try to get a

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.850
holistic picture.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.900
What's Dorie really like?

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.570
What's she like to work with?

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.650
Tell me about her.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.270
And they'll anonymize the
findings and then they'll

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.370
present them back to you, so
that hopefully you can hear

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.190
them with an open mind.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.250
And obviously that's a good
way of doing it, because

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.690
people feel more free to speak
if it's anonymous, if it's to

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.770
somebody else.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.410
But even if you are doing this
on your own, I would suggest

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.370
you can get a lot of
value out of it.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.590
If you find trusted friends or
colleagues and go to them, and

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.870
you could almost make it like
a parlor game-- you ask, if

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.980
you only had three words to be
able to describe me, what

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.480
would they be?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.050
And if you ask four or five
people, you are going to begin

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.780
to see patterns, both of what
they say and also what they

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.400
don't say, which can be
incredibly illustrative.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.240
And so that's one way that you
can begin to get a sense.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.150
And part of why this is
useful it that we

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.400
all have blind spots.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.140
One story that I tell in
"Reinventing You" comes from

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.100
an executive coach who told
me about a client that

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.410
she worked with once.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.070
And this guy, when she started
doing the interviews, the

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.260
stuff she heard was
actually terrible.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.370
He doesn't respect me.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.310
He's haughty.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.920
He's a jerk.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.180
He's arrogant.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.640
He's full of himself.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.830
And so she started to try to
dig, like what was he doing

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.440
that was provoking this?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.060
Because it sounded egregious.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.570
And so she dug a little, and she
asked questions, and what

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.670
she ultimately discovered
was that he was not

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.110
any of those things.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.580
He was not haughty, he was
not arrogant, he did not

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.820
disrespect other people.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.140
But he did have a problem.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.700
And that's that he
had a bad habit.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.530
He interrupted people.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.210
And because he interrupted
people on a regular basis,

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.370
that was the story that
they constructed.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.660
That was how they understood
it and made meaning

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.120
of what he was doing.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.480
And as a result, his career was
really being held back.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.550
Because people thought
he was terrible.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.850
When we think about our personal
brand, about change,

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.880
things like that, we often
think that it has

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.630
to be a huge thing.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.370
It's going to take me years.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.830
Changing your reputation,
it's so hard.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.940
It's so big.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.520
Don't get me wrong,
sometimes it is.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.200
But sometimes it's as simple
as getting feedback, and

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:17.270
listening, and knowing when to
keep your mouth closed or when

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:21.770
you open your mouth,
whatever it is.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.820
But for him, when he got that
information, almost

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.910
immediately he was able to make
changes that led to him

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.470
being perceived in an entirely
different way by his

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.370
colleagues.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.950
So part of this can
be very powerful.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.880
I also wanted to tell you the
story of a woman that I know

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.770
in Boston named Mary
Skelton Roberts.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.470
This is not for everybody.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.910
This is not for the
faint of heart.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.820
But I love it as a thought
experiment.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.560
Mary, when I was talking to her,
during writing the book,

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.880
she said, you know, this
is so great, Dorie.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.170
I love what you're saying about
the 360s, and getting

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.810
the feedback, it's
so valuable.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.820
It reminds me of that
time I had a

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.295
focus group about myself.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.980
I said, that's fantastic,
Mary.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.270
Tell me more.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.700
And so she was at a career
crossroads, and she had a

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.520
friend named Don.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.550
And Don said, I know what
we'll do for you.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.310
We will have a focus
group about you.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:22.070
And so she invited about a dozen
of her friends, and she

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.840
was not allowed to say a word.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.970
She had to sit in the corner.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.480
She could only ask a question
if there was a point of

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.030
clarification.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.600
And for a couple of hours, Don
asked her friends questions

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.090
about Mary.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.850
If you didn't know what
job Mary had,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.850
what would you guess?

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.910
Mary's greatest gifts are?

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:49.500
The world would be a better
place if Mary did what?

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.130
On and on, Mary said that it was
one of the most revelatory

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.360
experiences of her life.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.030
Getting to hear at a 30,000 foot
perspective the things

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.700
that her friends thought
about her.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.750
She said that it was a
completely new way of looking

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.850
at herself that really helped
unstick her and move her on to

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.400
a new phase in her life
in her career.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.640
So those are few ways that you
can at least begin to get the

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.392
juices flowing.

00:16:17.392 --> 00:16:21.450
And so next I wanted to talk a
little bit about creating your

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.210
narrative, proactively, how
do you set it apart?

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.400
How do you know what you
want to be known for?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.230
So you all know these
characters.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.790
I have them up here because
I used to work in

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.260
presidential politics.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.410
And one of the first things that
you learn is that there's

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:44.490
a million pieces of information
that voters could

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.430
learn, that you could push out
to people about candidates.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.450
And maybe 1% of all the people
who are reading Politico 23

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.280
hours a day.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:52.960
They love it.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.310
They can't get enough of it.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.990
But for everybody else, what
they want to know is, break it

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.930
down for me.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.430
What is the difference?

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.510
How are these guys different
from each other?

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.230
And how does that line up with
what I'm interested in?

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:12.599
And so if you can be clear, as
we're thinking through our

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:16.790
brand, on your difference,
that's really

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.130
what's going to matter.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.700
About a month ago I wrote a
blog post for the "Harvard

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:29.750
Business Review." And it was
spawned because an executive

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.340
reached out to me.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.170
He was a senior partner at one
of the big consulting firms.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.540
And he wanted to talk with
me because he just

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.060
had his 50th birthday.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:44.090
He was starting to think
about legacy projects.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.320
He wanted to write.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.450
He wanted to teach.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.890
He wanted to start doing
some different things.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.910
But he came to me,
because he said

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.390
Dorie, I have one problem.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.010
I don't know what
I want to say.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.240
And it's not because he didn't
have anything to say.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.480
In fact, to the contrary,
this was a guy that

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.300
had almost too much.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.360
He knew tons about the industry
verticals that he had

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.830
consulted in, telecom,
biotech.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.170
He had massive global
experience.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.120
He had philanthropic interests
that he was involved in.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.650
Any of these things, he
could've opined about

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.060
articulately.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.630
But he wasn't really sure
where to start.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.700
He wasn't sure what the core
of his message was.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.960
And so what I told him, and
what I will suggest to you

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.670
guys, is take a morning.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.130
Take a Saturday morning.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.900
Go plunk yourself
a coffee shop.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.310
And if you really want to get
clear on your brand, you

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:46.070
really want to know what's
driving meaning in your life,

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.980
start to write down some
of your war stories.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.720
And what I mean by that is, we
all have stories that we come

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.580
back to, things that are
particularly vivid, things

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.030
that are particularly memorable,
meaningful.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.100
Maybe it's the time you first
learned what leadership really

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.380
looked like.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.260
Maybe it was the time that you
failed and you had to pick

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.560
yourself up after failing.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.430
Maybe it was when somebody
showed you what

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.420
a real friend was.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.750
Whatever it was, you can
probably ask your spouse.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.850
Because we all have things that
we probably say over and

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.020
over again, oh, that story.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:33.140
But what we really are
is accumulations of

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.660
the stories we tell.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.910
That's how we make meaning
in our lives.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.480
And I'm willing to bet that if
you write enough of them down,

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.400
if you write down a few,
you are going to

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.220
begin to see a pattern.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.620
You are going to begin to see
a thread that connects them

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.300
about why those things are
meaningful to you.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:57.120
And that is how you can begin
to tease out, authentically,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.720
what your brand is and what
you feel passionate about.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.530
And we had Romney and Obama
up there a minute ago.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.800
I mean, I know how messages
are constructed

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.200
in political campaigns.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.205
I've sat in the rooms.

00:20:10.205 --> 00:20:13.300
If you look at the polls, and
you say, oh, what do other

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.200
people care about?

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.730
OK, we'll be that.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.290
That's not, as a real person,
maybe not even as a

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:25.700
politician, how people should be
constructing their message.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.690
I think we should be starting
from the ground up, with our

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.630
own experiences, our own
passions, the things that

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.520
matter to us.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.600
And along those lines, I wanted
to just talk to you for

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.800
a minute about a woman I know
named Libby Wagner, who I

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.890
write about in "Reinventing
You." She has a pretty unusual

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.060
background.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.310
She's a poet.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.350
She has an MFA.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.810
She's published numerous
chapbooks of poetry.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.390
She was a tenured community
college professor of women's

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.540
studies and creative writing.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.480
You're probably getting a vision
in your head of what

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.950
Libby Wagner is like.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:06.450
Libby Wagner became a management
consultant.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.990
She decided, you know what, I
don't want to do that anymore.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.940
I want to become a management
consultant.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:18.300
And so she started, and when she
first got into it, she was

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.910
extremely nervous and almost
embarrassed that

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.810
she had been a poet.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:28.670
Because the business professors
on her campus had

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.920
been so contemptuous
of the poets.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.930
They thought, ach, we
can't talk to you.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.410
We don't have anything
in common.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.510
And so she kept being paranoid
that people would ask her,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.640
where's your MBA?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.760
What makes you qualified
to do this?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.800
And after a few clients, she
realized no one was asking her

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.580
where her MBA was.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.770
She could do the work.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.990
In fact, what she realized is
that she had skills and

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.530
knowledge that a traditional
MBA would not.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:59.750
Because she was a poet.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.810
She had, for years, learned to
study the nuances of language.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:07.840
If you are a manager
communicating with your team,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.290
if you are a company
communicating with your

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.820
customers, you need
to understand

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.210
the nuances of language.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.090
And she did.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.130
She was able to work
for companies

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.820
like Nike, like Boeing.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.740
For a long time she hid that
she had started as a poet.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.720
But eventually she came to
realize that that was actually

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.360
where her strength was.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.150
And so today she has an email
newsletter called "The

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.650
Boardroom Poet," her Twitter
handle, @boardroompoet.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.540
She's not afraid to be out
about her identity.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.060
And I think that for me, it's
an important lesson for us.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.180
That the place where we are
different is sometimes the

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.000
thing you want to sand down,
the thing you want to

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.720
minimize, the place where you
feel like, I'm not sure if

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.570
these people would really get
where I'm coming from.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.730
But that is often the source of
the place where you can add

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.400
the most value.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.680
So I wanted to talk just a
little bit moving into the

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.470
final piece, about how
you manifest that

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.100
value in the world.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.140
How you show what you can do.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.250
How do you live it?

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.480
So I wanted, I'm going
to try to not set

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.960
off this loud noise.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.230
There we go.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.530
Just checking in on timing, so
we can keep a good beat here.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.640
I also want to say as well that
throughout the course of

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.540
this, if you have thoughts,
questions, stories you want to

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.630
share, please feel free to
dive in at any point.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.270
At the end we'll take questions
too, but I want to

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.560
make sure that we're grabbing
things and getting your

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.270
experiences.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.320
Because those are some
of the best parts.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.100
So I want to leave you with a
few strategies, talk about

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.330
actual take home tips,
as it were.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.100
So the first thing that
I wanted to mention--

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.440
there is a sociologist at the
University of Chicago named

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.760
Ronald Burt.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.960
And his research, he uses a
phrase which, as sociologists

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.680
are wont to do, he talks about
bridging structural holes and

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.280
the importance of that.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.840
But what that means, basically,
to boil it down, is

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.190
that one of the most effective
things that you can do in your

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.190
company to build a strong
career, to get known and

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.200
recognized by your peers as
someone with something to

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.790
contribute is to become
the dot in the middle.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:44.990
In any organization, no matter
how hard you try to eradicate

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:50.290
it, there are going to be
silos between campuses,

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:56.750
between buildings, between
departments, between projects.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.100
People, they just,
they're human.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.780
They don't talk.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.900
They don't communicate.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.950
It's a lot easier to talk to the
people next door than it

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.160
is the people on the other side
of the country or the

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.900
other side of the campus.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.460
And so if you can be the person,
if you can find ways

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.170
to insert yourself and to build
relationships across

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.590
those boundaries, you can learn
things that other people

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.970
don't know.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:28.520
I know that one of the central
tenets, party of the ethos of

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.050
Google, is the importance of
learning new things and

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.210
sharing it with your
colleagues.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.130
And ultimately the research
bears out, that's one of the

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.540
best things that you can
do for your career.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.730
You'll be viewed
as a connector.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.570
You'll be viewed as someone
in the know.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.810
You'll be viewed as
someone helpful.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.430
And that can be incredibly
powerful.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.700
There's Robert Putnam,
the Harvard

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.880
sociologist, breaks it down.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.770
He talks about two different
categories of relationships.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:02.260
One he calls bonding capital,
the other is bridging capital.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.740
And you need both.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.680
Bonding capital is where you're
interacting with and

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.680
relating to people who
are just like you.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.480
Maybe there are people who
are in your department.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.550
Maybe there are people who are
fellow women, or fellow people

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.360
from a certain area, or fellow
Yankees fans, or

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.590
whatever you are.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.680
But you've got the bond with
your tribe, as it were.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.850
But what is equally
important--

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.270
and if you want to
be balanced, you

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.600
have to have both--

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.350
is bridging capital.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.410
Are you the person that reaches
across and builds

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.280
relationships with other types
of people and people who are

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.480
doing different things?

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.930
If you can balance those,
that's one of the most

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.340
powerful things that
you can do.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:53.550
So we all know from all the
great media reports and

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.660
pictures of Bono and Angelina
Jolie, Davos, the World

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.590
Economic Forum.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:03.540
And part of the reason that I
love to think about and talk

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.500
about the World Economic
Forum is that now

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.820
it's this brand event.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.020
Every year, every January,
all the poohbahs gather.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.610
It costs $100,000 for your
company to be a member of it.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.990
It is an international event.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.160
It is an event that
was started by a

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.460
business school professor.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:31.310
It was not something that began
on high as the most

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.400
powerful gathering
in the world.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.630
It was a business professor,
Klaus Schwab, who said,

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.620
wouldn't it be great if we had
an annual conference talking

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.920
about the European economy?

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.980
And he did it, and it
became a phenomenon.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.510
And it might seem sort
of ridiculous to say,

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.450
you can do that too.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.300
You can start your own Davos.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.360
But I want to take a moment to
tell you a story about my

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.050
friend Robbie.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.170
Robbie is a nonprofit
fundraiser.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:05.040
And like a lot of people, he
noticed, ah, going back to

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.020
Ronald Burt's research,
the nonprofit

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.090
community was really siloed.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.430
All the environmental people
knew each other, but they

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.020
didn't know the health
care people.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.600
And all the health care people
knew each other, but they

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.450
didn't know the anti-poverty
people.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.210
Why is that?

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.050
Is there any way to fix it?

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:24.060
And so Robbie decided to
do something creative.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.110
He thought, how do we bring
people together in a way that

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.930
doesn't feel like homework?

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.050
In a way that doesn't feel
like eating your spinach?

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:36.020
And so he created a Meetup
group, free, just started a

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.865
Meetup group.

00:28:36.865 --> 00:28:40.070
It was called Socializing
For Justice.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.400
Socializing for Justice was
a monthly gathering, where

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.490
people from the nonprofit
community and their friends

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.830
could get together and do
bowling for justice, cocktails

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.810
for justice, trivia
for justice.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.520
They would do fun activities
and in the

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.490
process solve the problem.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.730
They'd get to know each other,
be friends, and it naturally

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.730
breaks down the silos.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:13.850
Six years later the group
has 2,200 members.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:17.040
They declared it Robbie Samuels
day in Boston last

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.520
year on his birthday.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.322
The Boston nonprofit community
is not that big.

00:29:23.322 --> 00:29:27.740
And I would posit that most of
the communities that we are

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.115
in, the communities that matter
to us, in the end

00:29:31.115 --> 00:29:34.250
they're not that big.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.890
If you take the initiative to
start something new and

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:43.040
different, and really own it,
you can become the connector

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.260
who is adding tremendous value
to your community.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.240
And every month, multiple times
a month, all of those

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.270
2,200 people are getting emails
with Robbie's name on

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.870
it sending them invitations of
things they want to do and

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.440
making sure that they
remember who he is.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.650
I can guarantee you that anytime
he wants to get a job

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.930
there are going to be dozens
of people that know exactly

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.110
what he's capable of and want to
bring them on to the team.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.500
So taking the initiative to
dive in and get started,

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.770
whether it's cross-departmental

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.890
initiatives, ways to meet
people, Google is especially

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.140
good at this.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.560
I know with the Authors at
Google series, bringing in

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.910
musicians, anything you care
about or are passionate about,

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.990
there's a way to plug in and
int the process build

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.780
connections, not just with cool
people outside Google but

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.220
within the company so that your
ties are strong and that

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.790
you are becoming a hub.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.050
It's far more possible
than you might think.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.060
So I also, since we're here in
Silicon Valley, wanted to tell

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.650
you a Silicon Valley story.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.760
So as I mentioned I worked
in campaigns.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.530
In the 2004 cycle I was the New
Hampshire communications

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.020
director for Howard Dean.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.900
His campaign, of course, is
famous for being the first

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.570
really internet savvy
campaign.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.000
And that was great.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.360
Why?

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.200
Why were we the internet
savvy campaign?

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.450
We had had good staffers, we
had all these nice things.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:18.120
Howard Dean certainly let it
happen, but Howard Dean is not

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.790
Mr. Internet Savvy.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:24.790
This is not him staying up late
at night and tweeting.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.190
That's not his deal.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:31.360
The reason that we were the
internet campaign is because

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.050
Joe Trippi, who was our campaign
manager, went to San

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.300
Jose State.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.780
And that might seem a little bit
random, but he was there

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:48.340
in the late 1970s when all of
this was starting to burst,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.900
when all this was starting to
happen and to take off.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.890
And he noticed and he watched.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:32:04.010
And 20 years later, he was there
and said, how can I take

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:08.930
this blogging phenomenon which
was a niche thing at the time,

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.180
it was early 2003.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:17.300
It was still a niche hobby, web
blogging, live journaling.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.970
How do we take it and turn
it into something?

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:24.130
I remember being there late at
night, knocking on the door,

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.660
trying to get statements
approved, that

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.200
CNN needed a statement.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.540
And he waved me off and
yell, come back later.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.910
I'm like, what is he doing
that's so important?

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.980
What is he doing that's more
important than this

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.640
statement for CNN?

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.110
And he'd be, like, working
on a blog post.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:47.580
And so ultimately, sometimes, we
find ourselves in positions

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.170
where we are able to see things
that other people are

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:56.090
not, where we are in a place
where things are happening.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.060
And if you watch, and
if you notice, you

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.820
can pick up on them.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.520
And it can lead you to
ideas that other

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.300
people are not having.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.270
Now, a lot of people in Silicon
Valley know that

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.830
computers are great and
blogs are great.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:15.970
Very few people in presidential
politics in 2003

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.750
knew that connection, and knew
that is was something that

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.090
could actually help a
presidential campaign.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:26.640
So being able to understand
what's going on, to see those

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.410
trends, and to get what makes
them important, and to be able

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.080
to translate them to
the outside world--

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.050
you are at the hub right now.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:39.520
You are at ground zero, where
things are happening.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.470
So looking around and finding
out where that wave is going

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.160
to be incredibly powerful.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.300
Part of the reason why I wanted
to talk about this, go

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.680
where the wave is going, this
all came up because a few

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.160
months ago I was
interviewing--

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.580
I do a blog for "Forbes," and
I was interviewing Robert

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.190
Scoble, who many of you guys
may know, the great tech

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.320
opinion leader.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.990
And I asked him, how did you
get your start, Robert?

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.650
How did you get into all this?

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:11.210
And he said, oh, that's funny.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.969
I was at San Jose State
in the '70s.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.489
Sometimes things are
in the water.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.600
And I think, when it comes to
Google and being here right

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.850
now, things are in the water.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.530
And if you're watching, and
finding the places where it

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:32.449
starts, you can move forward
exponentially fast.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:37.540
So one of the tips, one of the
strategies that you guys can

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.960
use today, one of my favorite
parts of the book--

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.210
I interviewed Professor Robert
Cialdini, who is an eminent

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:47.030
psychologist from Arizona
State University.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.920
And one of the things that we
know about human nature, about

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.510
how to express your brand, how
to let people know that you're

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.840
expert in a certain area is that
if you just try to tell

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.070
people, if you say, well, I
really know a lot about this,

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.020
and let me explain why.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.220
People are going to tune you
out immediately, right?

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.330
They'll think you're
a braggart.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.920
They'll think you're a jerk.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.200
It's not going anywhere.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.850
That doesn't work.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:16.600
But Robert Cialdini shared a
strategy with me which is, as

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.180
you could say, maybe a
work around for it.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.980
That is the email strategy.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.290
It turns out that through a
quirk of human nature, we can

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:31.350
get away with writing things
that we can't necessarily get

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.420
away with saying.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.840
And so if you're going to be
meeting someone for the first

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.100
time, in advance of that
meeting, you can send them an

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.910
email and say, Joe, I'm really
looking forward to meeting you

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.410
next Thursday.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.880
In advance of our meeting, to
make it as productive and as

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.390
efficient as possible, I wanted
to tell you a little

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.820
bit about my experience with
regards to XYZ that we're

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.150
going to cover in the meeting.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.790
And then at that point, you
can share your experience.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.160
Share your results.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.590
Share what you've learned.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:09.170
And it is all in the context
of making a better meeting.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:13.810
When you walk into that room you
do not have to say a word,

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.350
because your expertise has
already been established.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.630
You don't have to prove
yourself because

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.130
they already know.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:24.500
And it means that you're far
more likely to have a good

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.630
experience and to have
your opinions

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.560
respected from moment one.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.000
So that was one of the
things that I really

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.200
liked about that tip.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.100
Along similar lines--

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.330
we all know it's awesome
whenever you can have a Top

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.580
Gun slide--

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.380
you can't just say how great
you are, does not work.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.310
But similarly, the research of
Professor Cialdini and Jeffrey

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.830
Pfeffer, just down the road at
Stanford Graduate School of

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.690
Business, they've done research
into the wingman

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.790
phenomenon.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:04.400
And basically what this means
is that if I tell you about

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.860
how great I am and how
wonderful, you're going to

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.150
think I'm a jerk.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.710
But if Girija tells you how
great and wonderful I am,

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.680
you're going to think
I'm fantastic.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.640
So certainly this means that
if we all want to hire a

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.040
publicist, why not?

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.630
That's a great thing to do.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:25.070
But most of us probably can't
hire a publicist.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:30.300
So the alternative, the way
around this, is that we can

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.040
have a wing man.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.160
If you have a trusted friend or
colleague, someone that you

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.060
like, that you respect, that
you would not hesitate to

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.930
promote, make a deal
with them.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.070
Make a pact.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:49.600
And say, if I talk you up,
will you talk me up?

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.790
At the next reception, at the
next cocktail party, at the

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.840
next conference, at the next
meeting, you don't have to

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.650
worry about promoting
yourself.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:01.660
This is great for those of you
who are shy, who worry about

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.450
looking a little too
self-promotional, just set

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:06.130
that aside.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.940
You don't have to promote
yourself.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.350
Because it's in someone
else's hands.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.570
You're job is to promote your
friend and to let the world

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.220
know how great your friend is.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.890
Oh, that's so interesting that
you mentioned China.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.920
My friend just got back from
China and she wrote a

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.310
fascinating white paper about
the latest economic trends.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:26.660
I should introduce you guys.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.176
Here you go.

00:38:28.176 --> 00:38:29.580
Look for opportunities.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.340
Look for ways to bring them
into the conversation, for

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.350
ways to help them shine.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:38.370
If you can do that, you are
being a good friend and

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:40.240
they're doing the same
thing for you.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.860
Between the two of you, you
can make sure that your

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.470
virtues are known.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:54.630
Now I would be remiss here at
Google if I did not mention

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:58.650
social media, if I did not talk
about the ways that our

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.380
digital footprint is shaping
our personal brands.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.290
This is a blog post I wrote for
HBR last year called, "If

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:10.310
You're Serious About Ideas, Get
Serious About Blogging."

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:14.120
And the reason that I say
this, you, creators of

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.450
Blogger, is that ultimately
blogging

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.340
is not so sexy anymore.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.870
It's like this old thing.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.800
It's like 10 years old, 15,
years old, oh, who blogs.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.330
But that is also part of your
competitive advantage.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:35.400
Everybody's thinking about the
newest, latest, flashiest

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.200
thing, the six seconds videos
or whatever you got.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.090
I think that something that is
in short supply in the world

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.090
of knowledge workers, of people
who are known for their

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:54.220
ideas, is people who are able
and willing to contribute to

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.550
the discourse.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:00.220
For all of us, we're in roles
where it's often very hard for

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.340
other people to really know
if we're good at our jobs.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.030
I mean, if you're a graphic

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.710
designer, you have a portfolio.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.380
Sure, if you're a software
engineer you probably have

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.830
your lines of code people
can look at.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:14.570
That's great.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.360
For many of us, I
do marketing--

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.930
how do you know if
I'm any good?

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.280
Well, one of the ways that you
could put a stake in the

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:29.300
ground is to be that person who
shares ideas, who writes,

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.260
who is contributing to moving
the discourse forward.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.880
Because fundamentally
there's two kinds of

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.980
people in the world.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.190
There's the people who put the
ideas out and then there's the

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:43.430
masses who talk about those
ideas and share them.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:47.160
And so if you are willing to
step up and do it, it can be

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.380
incredibly powerful.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.000
I mean, you see statistics and
some people say, well,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.840
blogging's dying because
teenagers

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.920
aren't doing it anymore.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.180
So the trend line, it'll
be going down.

00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:01.970
The reason teenagers don't blog
is that blogging's hard.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:08.500
It is a lot easier to send a
tweet, to take a picture.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.030
It's hard, over time, to make
a commitment to putting your

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.650
ideas out there, for that is
one of the most powerful

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.130
things that you can do to
establish your expertise.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:22.610
And even, if you are not a
writer, even if you don't

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:28.190
consider yourself a strong
writer, I will point to this

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.420
gentleman as our example.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.840
This is Gary Vaynerchuk, who you
all may know, YouTube star

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.310
and beyond of Wine Library TV.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:42.240
Gary Vaynerchuk is
not a writer.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.970
By his own admission, he
is just not good at it.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:49.550
But he is someone who
has a ton of ideas.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.780
And we all have the technology--
you know it

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.570
better than I do--

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:55.770
to make videos.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:42:00.050
YouTube is one of the most
powerful platforms

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.360
that we've ever had.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.010
People can share themselves,
can share their ideas, and

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.460
upload them instantly
from their phones.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:11.050
And I think it is only going to

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:15.380
continue to grow and thrive.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.840
And so whether it's on text,
whether it's on video, getting

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:25.900
your ideas out there, in a lot
of ways, it's our obligation

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:30.690
to ourselves, to the
world, to share the

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.460
perspective that we have--

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.220
the perspective that
only we have.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.520
We talk about reinventing our
personal brands, what that

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.430
really means to me.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:46.700
Why more and more people are
doing that now is, we all know

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.285
this is not a world anymore
where you have the job that

00:42:50.285 --> 00:42:52.930
you settle into and you
do for 30 years.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.550
Even if you work at Google for
30 years, you could have 20

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:59.520
different jobs doing incredibly
different things,

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.740
and that is a virtue that is
encouraged in this workplace.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:10.040
Here, and more and more in the
world around us, because it's

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.620
through those connections
through, seeing different

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.120
things and learning different
things, that we're really able

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.730
to do the kind of creative
deep thinking that is

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.200
necessary to keep the ball
moving forward and innovate.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.320
And so that's why it's something
so important to be

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.770
able both to reinvent ourselves
and also to convey

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:37.510
that to others so that they
grasp and understand all that

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.940
we're able to do.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.140
So I would love to get your
ideas and thoughts and

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.890
questions and I'm really
delighted to have the

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.200
opportunity to be here and talk
with you a little bit

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.650
about "Reinventing
You." So thanks.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.880
Are there folks you who have
thoughts or their own

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.460
reinvention stories that
they'd like to share?

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:10.020
The question is about
specialization versus being a

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.860
generalist, it's also
about mentors.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.340
What do you do if there are
kind of aren't mentors,

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.000
because you're in a field
that's so new?

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.870
So two thoughts about that--

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:23.070
number one, it is always easier
to advance more quickly

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.210
if you're a specialist.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:29.010
In that same conversation with
Robert Scoble, his advice

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.720
about how people can become
a thought leader--

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:38.350
he said, find a niche, find an
unexploited niche that is of

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.370
interest, that's got the wave
behind it, and own it.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:46.600
And then his example was
wearable sensor technology.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.960
Like we all know that's growing,
we all know that's

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.040
going someplace.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.240
There is not yet someone who
is recognized as the

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.940
definitive expert on wearable
sensor technology.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.270
If you can be that person
then you will be

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.180
turned to for that.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.420
And then all of a sudden because
of a phenomenon known

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.580
as the halo effect, people--

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.640
if you're an expert in one
thing, people will sort of

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.630
think you're universally
brilliant, and will start

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:11.220
asking you, what stocks
should I buy?

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.740
And when will the volcanoes
explode?

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.510
I mean, they'll ask you all
kind of crazy things.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:17.820
So that's one thought.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.720
However, some of us are not
wired to be specialists.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.290
And that's the other point.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:28.480
It is perhaps a harder road,
it's a little more circuitous,

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:34.420
I say from example, to
be a generalist.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.130
But some people are
called to that.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:40.590
I am not a specialist, because
I would get bored being a

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.550
specialist.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.800
And so that means that I've done
a lot of different things

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.750
and it's sort of a more
winding path.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.590
I would like to think that in
the end, you can get to the

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:54.800
same or perhaps an even richer
place as a result, because

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.550
you've had these different
experiences that you can cross

00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.600
hatch and bring to bear.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.660
And so one is quicker
but the other one

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.570
may have other benefits.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.860
On the mentor front, I agree
with you entirely.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.070
There's a professor at Harvard
Business School named Tom

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:14.130
DeLong who I interviewed last
year for my Forbes blog, and

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:15.530
wrote about this.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.300
He believes that there's kind
of a, you could call it a

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.030
mentorship crisis,
in some ways.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.160
Because, he gives an example--

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.260
when he goes into a room and he
asks people, so, how many

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.330
of you have had really great
mentors, really great people

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.660
that have looked out for you,
that teach you things?

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.670
And he says that almost
everybody over the age of 40

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:40.690
raises their hand and almost
everybody under the age of 40

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.230
keeps it down.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.530
And he says, and I agree with
him, that part of it is

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.810
because of increased performance
pressures.

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.030
In the past 20 years, because
of the economy, first it's

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:55.320
booming, then it's busting, now
it's in who knows what--

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.850
particularly in professional
service firms, people are

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.340
called upon to be rainmakers.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.890
Everything they do has to be
about the bottom line.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.430
And so a lot of the things that
are squishier but often

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.760
have profound long term value,
like cultivating the next

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.770
generation of talent,
gets overlooked.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.160
And so as a result, we're
losing a lot of mentors.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.250
And in some cases, in your
field, there's not even people

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.300
to begin with.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:26.330
But the theory that I have about
this is that we have to

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.845
re-conceptualize mentorship.

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:31.050
I actually wrote a free e-book
about it, as a matter of fact,

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.040
if you ever want to Google
"Mentorship 2.0," Dorie Clark,

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.830
you can get it.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.570
It's one of the "Change This"
manifestos, which is this cool

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.700
thing that Seth Godin started.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.700
But I think that what we really
need to do more and

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:49.280
more is to stop looking for this
one perfect holy grail

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.910
person that'll teach us
everything, and instead think

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.570
of it more as a mentor
board of directors.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:57.680
Who are the people--

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.140
who could be peers, they could
be people above you, they

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.420
could even be your interns
or your subordinates--

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.900
who are the people who have
slices of things that you

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.950
like, that you respect, that
you want to learn from?

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:13.650
And how do you go a la Catie
with a mentorship?

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.290
And hopefully we can learn
more in that way.

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.250
And so for anyone who couldn't
hear, the comment was you

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:22.170
can't afford to outsource
your brand.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.890
Because if you assume that other
people are evangelizing

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:28.540
on your behalf it's probably not
happening and an erroneous

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.500
brand might take root.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.340
I think that's really true.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:35.650
I mean, politics is a good
training ground in the sense

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:40.000
that literally, you have people
who are trying to throw

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.880
arrows at you every day.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.660
They're trying explicitly to
define you in a way that you

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.490
do not want to be defined.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:49.660
And so you have to be very
vigilant to guard against it.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.890
I mean, fortunately, I hope that
for most of you you don't

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:55.270
have people throwing arrows
at you on a regular basis.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:59.010
But nonetheless, even without
that people just, they get

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:00.690
impressions in their head.

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.142
Where do they get it?

00:49:03.142 --> 00:49:07.760
Oh, they saw a Google+ post from
two months ago and oh,

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.850
yeah, Girija, that girl
that likes ice cream,

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.620
or whatever it is.

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:17.130
And that's not necessarily
the thing that you want.

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:23.250
And so I am really glad that
you sparked this piece,

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:27.270
because for a lot of people,
they think their work will

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:28.960
speak for itself.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.070
And that's just not sufficient
anymore.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:35.180
If you do that, you
might luck out.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:35.630
You might.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.230
There's some people that
succeed that way.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.650
For most of us, it
doesn't happen.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:45.760
And if you don't want to roll
the dice with your future then

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.990
it's important to least take a
little time to be cognizant of

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:52.740
what's out there and how you can
begin to kind of stack the

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.520
deck in your favor.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.740
You can never perfectly control
what other people

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.930
think of you.

00:49:57.930 --> 00:49:59.430
We're not omnipotent.

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:03.540
We don't have the ability to
plant ideas in people's heads.

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:08.300
But we can make it far more
likely that people will view

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.860
us in a certain way.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.820
And so I think that's a
really great point.

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:16.040
Other thoughts or questions that
people wanted to raise?

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.030
Yes.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:20.430
The gentleman was just quoting
Scott Adams, the Dilbert

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:23.940
creator, talking about
specialization.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.470
And the fact that if you kind
of combine a couple of

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:32.375
different areas, being a
comedian, doing writing, piece

00:50:32.375 --> 00:50:34.550
them together-- it's a smaller
universe that you're competing

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.220
in, which I think is
exactly right.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.010
Ultimately, when you're
specializing, and when you're

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.080
thinking if you want
to specialize,

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.250
you have to be strategic.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.035
Because it can't be too big.

00:50:44.035 --> 00:50:47.640
That's, as a starting point, you
have to be smart about it.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.760
It's kind of like in college,
you have to write a 20 page

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.690
final paper.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:55.340
And it's, oh, I'm going to write
my 20 page final paper

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.170
about the history of Rome.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.110
Oh, OK, great, you can really
cover the history

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:03.810
of Rome in 20 pages.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:04.750
It's not going to work.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.330
And so your professor always
stops you and says, no, no,

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:11.460
no, maybe you can write a 20
page paper about the history

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.380
of upper class women's fashion
in ancient Rome in 20 pages

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:19.730
but you cannot write about the
history of Rome in 20 pages.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:23.520
If you set out and you try to
be the expert in sports, you

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.096
are going to get pummeled.

00:51:26.096 --> 00:51:29.270
You won't ever break through
and get noticed, because

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.050
there's just too much
competition.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:36.240
But if you want to be the world
expert in some variety

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.680
of rugby, or something
like that, then the

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.790
path gets a lot easier.

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:42.550
So choosing well is
key, so thank you.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:45.090
Did you have a thought
about that as well?

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.360
Yes, so it's a great question,
thank you.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.930
It's about staying motivated
as you reinvent yourself.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:53.390
How do you kind of keep going
with these uncharted waters?

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:56.710
I think that one of the most
powerful tactics, in a lot of

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:00.050
ways, is the public promise.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.290
Part of why I like
blogs, too, is--

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:05.290
certainly we all know of blogs
that have been abandoned and

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:09.270
whatever, but if you're serious
about it, a blog

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.310
demands to be updated.

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.300
And it's something that
has sort of a built

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.530
in demand on it.

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:16.930
And so if you put out there, I'm
going to start this, I'm

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:21.890
doing it, then there's sort of
an internal compulsion to keep

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.530
it going and keep
it successful.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:26.030
There's a website that I talk
about in "Reinventing You"

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:28.100
called stikk.com, which
some of you guys

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:29.220
may be familiar with.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.850
It's S-T-I-K-K dot com,
and you make a

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.560
public vow of some kind.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.390
So this is like the thing you
do only when you are very,

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:39.430
very serious.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:43.860
And so you say, OK, I am going
to lose 50 pounds.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.330
And you put some crazy bet.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:52.100
If I do not lose 50 pounds in
six months, I will give

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:58.300
$20,000 to my friend, or I
would give, even better--

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.950
this is sort of their
innovation--

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:04.380
if you are a Democrat, they will
say I will give $20,000

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:08.610
to the George W. Bush library.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:12.340
And so you are making a public
commitment and you are highly

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:16.120
financially motivated to
succeed in your goal.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.860
So sometimes just going nuclear,
laying down the

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.210
gauntlet, and putting
it out there.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:24.660
But I think that your friends,
your colleagues, they have to

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.400
be in your corner.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.500
It's just part of why I talk,
in "Reinventing You," about

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.810
the importance of kind of
getting your team on your side

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:37.200
and finding a narrative, a way
to explain it to other people.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.810
Because if you have the people
around you who are sort of

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.960
skeptics, or they're sort of
nagging at you, or tearing it

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.270
down a little bit,
it's very hard.

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.820
But if you have the team in your
corner, you can really do

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.570
amazing things.

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:55.780
There's a book called
"Influencer," which I would

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.270
recommend highly.

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:01.630
It's by the same people, it's
five authors, Joseph Grenny,

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:03.280
and I don't remember
any of the others.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.470
There are far too many, but the
people who did the book

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:09.570
"Crucial Conversations," and
"Influencer," and then they

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:13.110
have a sequel called "Change
This." And they're both really

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:17.720
cool books about the ways that
you can effect change in your

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.330
own personal life, or at
a more macro level.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:24.710
So great strategies in there,
and if you're interested in

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.800
it, that's one way
of pursuing it.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.090
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:32.510
For Dean, one of the things
that really--

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:35.670
there's sort of an external
factor that kind of came in

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:41.750
early on, which is that
he was originally--

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:46.250
his record is that of a
moderate, centrist governor.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.760
That is not how he was perceived
by the vast majority

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.690
of the American public for one
large reason, which is that at

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:57.720
the time that he was running,
the Iraq war had started.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.150
And he was one of the earliest
and most vocal

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:01.200
opponents of it.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.170
And so consequently he got
branded as this crusading

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.300
liberal firebrand.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:10.200
And I think a lot of people
assumed that there were other

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.620
pieces, sort of left wing pieces
that went along with

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:18.100
that, when in actuality that
wasn't really the case.

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:21.530
So I think that one of
the challenges--

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.210
and at the time, obviously there
was so much momentum

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:27.910
behind the anti-war thing,
that it was more of a net

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:29.790
positive, at least
in the primary.

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:34.780
Although you're right,
ultimately because of again,

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.960
other interesting outside
factors like the 527s, which

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:43.610
was the Political Action
Committee that was allowed

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:47.270
time and is no longer, under
campaign finance laws, people

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:51.720
were able to give really large
amounts of money to target

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.590
him, particularly in Iowa.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.330
Anyway, all that being said,
how is an individual brand

00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:00.090
different from a candidates'
brand?

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:04.290
I think that when you are
working on a political

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:07.600
campaign, you need to
be really mindful

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.530
of a few other things.

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:12.720
The first thing that you need
to be mindful of is, who are

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.240
your competitors that
are out there?

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.050
How do you differentiate
yourself?

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:21.020
You might have a great record
as a school teacher, or

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:21.990
something like that.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.840
That's great, but if you're
running against another school

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.400
teacher, then whatever
advantage you have on

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.980
education might be
neutralized.

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:30.160
You've got to come up with
something different.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.020
You also need to be taking a
careful look at macro trends.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:37.830
So the Iraq War would be a big
example, what's going on in

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:39.470
the economy, that
sort of thing.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:43.800
When you are an individual
branding yourself, those

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.640
things are important.

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.540
I mean, obviously you
need to be mindful--

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.630
well, what other types
of candidates are

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:49.780
applying for this job?

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.680
Or what is going on in the
world that would make me

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.800
marketable and saleable in
the broader marketplace?

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.350
But I think it's a difference
of degree.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:01.090
You keep those things in mind.

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.710
But as an individual when you
think about your individual

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:08.830
brand, what matters most, what
matters fundamentally, is

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:10.540
what's coming from you.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.590
It's not these sort of
external factors and

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:14.790
positioning yourself.

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:19.050
It's what is true to me and
what is that sort of

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:21.380
uniqueness that I can convey?

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:24.620
And so I think that they are
similar phenomenons.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.990
The way that they're done is
different, because so many

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:31.470
politicians really do you start
with polls and work

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:32.810
backwards from there.

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:39.040
But when done right, it's mostly
that politicians and

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.750
individuals should be looking
at similar things.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:45.740
But individuals should
worry far less about

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.990
the external world.

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:51.110
I think that for most of us we
can solve many of our problems

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:55.710
just by really getting clear on
internally who we are what

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:57.140
we bring to the table.

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.890
I hope that might answer
your question.

00:57:58.890 --> 00:57:59.280
Thanks.

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:02.520
So Googlers, it's fantastic
to be here.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.920
My book is available.

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.730
I'm happy to sign it
if you'd like.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:08.110
