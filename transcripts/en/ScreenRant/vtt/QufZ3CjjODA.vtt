00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.799
It may not be the only reason why the original
Star Wars trilogy was a hit with adults and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.620
kids, but the straightforward story didn’t
hurt.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.130
No need to get bogged down in politics or
star systems, just know to root for the young

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.170
rebels taking down the evil, planet-exploding
Empire.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.840
As an added bonus, the movie’s hero managed
to turn his father back to the light, taking

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.250
down the villain together.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.250
Or did they?

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.940
It’s a question that the new trilogy will
probably answer, if The Force Awakens is anything

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.120
to go by and YES, there will be SPOILERS.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.470
But to understand the real meaning of Star
Wars, the studying the full saga is key – and

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.620
if you catch the hidden story at its core,
you might even guess what’s coming in the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.800
next chapter of the Star Wars universe.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.010
Keep in mind this is our theory and you will
see that the proof we bring forward might

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.310
make you see Star Wars in a whole different
way…

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.240
That’s the plan for our latest Docu Series,
The Hidden Truth Behind Star Wars.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.770
Starting At The Middle

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.020
By now most Star Wars fans know that the first
movie was actually the fourth chapter of George

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.750
Lucas’ original story, and it’s not hard
to see why he thought it was the one most

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.930
likely to win over movie audiences.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.640
Take away the spaceships and lightsabers,
and Luke is your average fantasy hero, born

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.200
from nothing, recruited by a wise old wizard,
and trained to be the great hero he was destined

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
to be.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.870
George Lucas admitted from the start that
he was just copying classic stories and archetypes

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.400
for Luke’s heroic journey, and as he became
a more experienced Jedi Knight, even his father

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.390
Darth Vader couldn’t help but see the light.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.890
The trilogy ended with Luke saving the day,
and wiping out the Dark Side once and for

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.670
all… at least, that’s what we thought.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.760
Until Lucas decided to tell the REAL start
of the story, re-defining Luke’s journey

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.390
in more ways than fans may even realize.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
The Real Story of Anakin Skywalker

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.459
While the last half of the Star Wars story
saw Darth Vader travel from Dark to Light,

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.850
the first half of the story was the exact
opposite, showing his fall from light to dark,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.270
making him as central to the story as his
son.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.720
In fact, Luke’s story became a perfect echo
of his father’s.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.870
Beginning his life as Anakin Skywalker, he
too lived on an isolated desert planet, forgotten

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.660
by the galaxy until The Force intervened,
guiding another old Jedi to him.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.530
A Jedi who would see him as important, and
recruit him to fight a growing darkness, decades

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.190
before the exact same thing would happen to
his son.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.980
But Luke was only important because he was
Anakin’s son – Anakin was important for

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.160
a completely different reason.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.490
If you believe the Jedi in the films, Anakin
was born from The Force itself, to become

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.590
the Chosen One, a prophesied person who would
finally bring balance to the Force.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.670
To the Jedi, that meant defeating their enemies,
the Sith, once and for all – and use of

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.709
the Dark Side along with them.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.430
When you combine both trilogies, Skywalker
and his son fulfilled the prophecy together,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.010
but it wasn’t easy.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.970
The two heroes didn’t just face the same
journey, but the same choice: with the future

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.540
of the galaxy on their shoulders, would they
choose the Dark Side to protect their family,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.670
or the Light, for the good of the galaxy?

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.819
It’s important to point out that it isn’t
ever stated as Good over Evil, just Dark and

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.260
Light sides.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.851
After all, the Jedi tell Anakin that love
leads to the Dark Side – and it’s a need

00:03:43.851 --> 00:03:46.819
to protect his wife that does him in.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.170
Since George Lucas took inspiration from humanity’s
earliest stories for the Star Wars saga, his

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.069
description of The Force sounds more like
Yin and Yang than good over evil.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.670
Yin and Yang… and The Force

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.099
George Lucas never denied his eastern influences
when he created the Star Wars Universe.

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.349
Everyone knows the Yin and Yang symbol for
this element of Chinese mythology, but the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.919
actual meaning of Yin and Yang may be hard
to separate from The Force at all.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.630
When all creation was chaos, there were two
opposite forces.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.289
Rather than fighting, the two reached a balance,
and out of them was born the first human.

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.360
Sound familiar?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.720
But one wasn’t evil or good, just opposite.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.339
Where one may be dark or old, the other is
white and youthful.

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:40.839
Different teachings may favor one side over
the other, but only a balance between the

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.629
two can bring peace.

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.569
The Jedi are looking for the same thing, but
miss one key point: both sides are equally

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.960
important, and constantly struggling back
and forth.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.349
There’s another major clue that The Force
follows the same rule, and you can find it

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.800
by looking at the Yin and Yang symbol.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.050
Notice that the black and white aren’t just
balanced, but have a piece of the other at

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.129
their core.

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.250
It’s the same with the forces of good and
evil in Star Wars.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.810
The Jedi and Republic claim to be good, but
fear, paranoia, and control take root in the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.490
prequels – and literally, the Emperor in
disguise.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.589
In the original trilogy, Darth Vader sits
in the heart of the Dark Side, but only his

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:26.639
son can see that he’s still good at heart.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:34.289
These similarities show what most people miss
about the Star Wars story: it’s not a tale

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.839
of good winning over evil; just The Force
swinging back and forth.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.689
It’s family that sends Anakin to the Dark
Side, but it’s family that pulls him back.

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.669
The Force created Anakin with a choice to
shift things off balance, and his son was

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.699
lost, then found, to shift it back.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.729
So even though Luke thought the fight was
over at the end of Episode 6, The Force had

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.289
other ideas.

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.559
The Force Awakens

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.840
Since shifting The Force out of balance is
a Skywalker trademark, then Episode 7 shouldn’t

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.339
have been a surprise.

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:14.330
Where Luke relied on Anakin to fight back
the Dark, Ben Solo, Leia’s son, relied on

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.229
Anakin to help the Dark Side grow.

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.560
Again, another hero on a desert planet is
pulled into a galactic mission, and even gets

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.370
her own wise old man to guide her path.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.809
The mentor meets the same end of Qui-Gon Jinn
and Ben Kenobi before, leaving the hero to

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:36.610
rely on family to restore balance to The Force
– with a new mentor, as well.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.719
The Force’s True Purpose

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:46.659
After thousands of years of conflict between
the Sith and Jedi, the Emperor rose to shift

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:52.289
power back to the middle, The Force created
Anakin to make it possible, and Luke arrived

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:54.930
to once again set things right.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.809
Family helped Luke achieve victory, but family
delivered the cruelest twist years later,

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:03.119
when his nephew and apprentice turned against
him.

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:08.789
Whether Rey is or isn’t related to the Skywalker
clan, she’s walking the path that Anakin

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.020
and Luke did before her.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.939
If the ways of The Force keep up, Rey should
forget about defeating the Dark Side once

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:19.039
and for all, and stick to the task at hand.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:25.039
After all, the next age of peace, or age of
conflict will be on its way not long after.

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:29.979
And odds are, a Skywalker will be at the center
of it – not on the side of good or evil,

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:34.409
just Light, or Dark… exactly as The Force
wills it.

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:38.479
This theory makes total sense when you look
at the full Star Wars saga.

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:43.710
The Force, just like the Yin and the Yang,
is basically a perfect balance of Good and

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.770
Evil, Shadow and Light, The Dark Side and
the Light Side…

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.349
One side needs the other side to exist.

00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:54.789
It’s somewhat expected that the new Trilogy
will follow the same path as the two before

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:55.999
it.

00:07:55.999 --> 00:08:05.849
J.J. Abrams has taken some heat when people
accused him of almost entirely copying the

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:11.529
two first trilogies when making The Force
Awakens but when we analyze the hidden truth,

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:14.580
it was clear what creative choice he needed
to make…

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.740
That’s our perspective on the Force, and
it’s one that’s harder to come by when

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.919
the Star Wars story is only told by one side
of the struggle.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.449
But what do you think?

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:31.629
Have we missed any key points or parallels?
