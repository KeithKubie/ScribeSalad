This episode of DNews is brought to you by…the
BuyPower Card from Capital One.

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:10.104
Every purchase brings you closer to a new
GM vehicle.

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:14.665
Climbing mountains, exploring high places
and playing music all have something in common…

00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:22.835
and your body does it naturally.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:24.884
Howdy folks, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:29.624
The human body is amazingly adaptable; we
heal after massive injury, we overcome emotional

00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:33.714
trauma, and with a bit of training, our bodies
can adapt to whatever we throw at them.

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:37.955
Mountain climbing is one of the most challenging
outdoor activities I've ever attempted, and

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:41.255
doing some research on it, I've found it's
pretty tough on our bodies too.

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.005
Firstly, there are no muscles in your fingers
or toes.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:45.005
I know!

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.765
Without them, we can't climb anything, and
there are NO muscles in there.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:52.805
Your phalanges (or bones of the fingers or
toes) are attached to tendons which pull from

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:54.365
muscles in your palm and forearm.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:57.725
Spread your fingers out like this, see those
taught cables stretching through your hand?

00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.985
Those are tendons connected to muscles in
your FOREARM!

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:04.855
When you're rock climbing, the muscles build
up -- as expected, and according to a 2006

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:08.865
Journal of Anatomy study[a], climbers bones
are thicker too!

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:13.975
Even those who didn't begin climbing until
after skeletal maturity at age 25 had thicker

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:15.505
metacarpals and phalanges.

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:19.905
Of course, those thicker bones won't make
any difference if the fingers aren't callused.

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:21.375
Calluses are a form of skin protection.

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:24.875
Perhaps you've shaken hands with a construction
worker, a climber, or a guitar player…

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:26.705
Remember those rough spots on their hands?

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:31.575
Those calluses are a result of repeated friction
of the skin, and are a natural formation to

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:32.775
protect the body.

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:38.645
The outermost layer of your skin, the stratum
corneum, is a layer 25 cells thick of dead

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:39.645
skin.

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:42.175
It serves as a first barrier to UV light,
infection and friction.

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:47.414
When a violinist plays a lot, or an auto worker
finger-tightens bumper bolts every day, the

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:53.425
skin on their fingertips will respond by thickening
the stratum corneum to over 100 cells!

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:57.135
So let's say your muscles are built, your
fingers are callused, and you get to the top

00:01:57.135 --> 00:01:58.565
of the mountain you're trying to climb…

00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:01.985
Once you're there your brain starts freaking
out, and not just a little.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:07.215
A study in the American Journal of Medicine
of 35 climbers who didn't take supplementary

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:11.914
oxygen with them, found brain damage in nearly
all of the adventurers.

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:12.914
The cause?

00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:15.275
Hypoxia, or lack of oxygen to the brain.

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.825
Makes sense at altitudes in the study of over
14,000 feet (4267M).

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:22.175
A lack of oxygen on a mountain can cause insomnia,
dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.105
headaches; it's called "acute mountain sickness."

00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:28.665
And though most climbers know this already,
what they don't know is that damage ain't

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:29.665
temporary.

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:33.326
At high altitudes, both professional and amateur
climbers know to get acclimated, and some

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:39.605
no longer experience the sickness, but MRI's
of climbers brains still showed brain damage.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:44.345
Over time, the damage worsens and though the
body is resilient the brain doesn't recover

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:45.345
so well.

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:51.174
After years of high-altitude climbing the
brain damage can screw with VR-spaces in the

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:55.735
brain, or the parts that communicate with
the lymph system and drain brain fluid.

00:02:55.735 --> 00:03:00.754
Of course, this can all be avoided by bringing
oxygen with you, so… do that.

00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:04.674
Of course, there is one thing that might help
some of you avoid these high-altitude brain

00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:06.885
issues… a fear of heights!

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:11.394
According to Evolutionary Psychologists, fear
of heights is what kept our ancestors from

00:03:11.394 --> 00:03:14.545
getting too close to the edge of a cliff and
risking death.

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:18.424
Of course, if it's enough to keep you off
a mountain, then it might have blown into

00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:21.705
something worse than the evolutionary inborn
instinct.

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:26.335
Many primates are comfortable in trees, so
why do we get a phobia of heights?

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:28.415
Probably something taught by parents or experiences.

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:30.365
How do you feel about climbing?

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:33.385
Have you ever wanted to challenge your body
by climbing a mountain?

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:34.585
Get on belay down in the comments!

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:38.995
The BuyPower Card from Capital One wants to
help you get to your next adventure, whatever

00:03:38.995 --> 00:03:43.465
that may be by giving you a percentage of
every purchase back to earn toward a new Chevrolet,

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:44.985
Buick, GMC or Cadillac.

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:48.885
There is no limit on the amount you can earn
or redeem toward part or even all of a new

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:51.195
vehicle and your earnings never expire.

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:54.954
