00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.440
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:07.130
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast in now.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.810
Just checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on Ya.
How are Ya?

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.760
How's it going?
I'm actually doing great despite the,
uh,
that cough I just did.

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.220
There wasn't a real cough.
I just,
you know,
I've,
I've,
I've,

6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.430
I've run out of unique ways to say I'm just checking in on you.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.670
I try to do it a little bit differently and I,
I got nothing left.

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.160
I don't know what you want from me.
Um,
anyway,
so let's get on.

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.550
Let's get on with the podcast here.
You know,
this is just a quick one.

10
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:39.320
This isn't even an official podcast,

11
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.480
despite the fact that I have fucking advertising on it.

12
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.020
It's not an official one.
This is me just poking my head into a little office,

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.450
itchy,
a little cubicle and the living room.
If you're unemployed or maybe a,

14
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.550
you're living off a trust.
Yeah.
To go egg big shout out to anybody.

15
00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:02.240
Just sitting around,
living off a trust,
you know,
what are you going to do today?

16
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.230
I go down to the art store and get yourself an Easel,
you know,
little canvas dot.

17
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.790
Payton.
That's what people do.
You know when you're like super fucking rich,

18
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:15.360
there's no reason for you to go outside.
There's just no fucking reason.
I,

19
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.000
I really can't stand when people judge,
you know,

20
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.910
trust fund babies.
I feel that's like one of the,

21
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.850
one of the biggest issues that this country is dealing with right now.

22
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:30.650
We see harsh judgment of trust fund babies,
you know,

23
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.500
I mean anybody can be fucking broke and be like,

24
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.680
look at that rich conscious sitting over there doing nothing.
What a waste.

25
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.010
What a waste of a fucking life.
You know?

26
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.580
Let me tell you that she was subway sandwich,
eating judgmental.
Fuck.

27
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.660
Let me ask you this.
If you were in that situation,
what would you be doing?

28
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.040
Cause I could tell you what I would be doing the exact same fucking thing and

29
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.010
all you fucking people on your high horse,

30
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.190
<v 2>no.
Do what I could do it.
You know,
I'm one of those people,
you know,</v>

31
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.750
people know that people know me.

32
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.720
<v 0>I have to wake up with a purpose.
If I don't have a purpose in life,</v>

33
00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:08.840
shut the fuck up your bills.
All right?
That's what you're doing.

34
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.530
You're walking out the door and you chasing the fucking carrot and some someday

35
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.590
you're dreaming.
You dream the debt.
Carrots not going to be there.

36
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.260
You want to be that evil guy.
You know?
Look at George Bush,
man.

37
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.740
Do you ever see a guy enjoying not being president more than that guy?

38
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.770
He's actually good at what he does.
He's not a trust fund baby either,
by the way.

39
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.800
I'm just saying,
you know he's actually good at it.

40
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.283
Just sits there.

41
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.020
I wonder what he thinks about just there's no way to be present when you leave

42
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:38.890
as president.

43
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.280
You have dead bodies on your conscience or do you made the right decision or the

44
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.341
wrong decision?

45
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:49.270
At some point you had to shoot off some missiles because who's kidding?

46
00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:52.990
Who America is the world's babysitter.

47
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.550
Okay.
We know what we know what's best for you,

48
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.653
okay?

49
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.570
And what is best for you is to do what we say and give us your natural resources

50
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.100
as we pretend to care about your people.

51
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.810
Okay?
It's like a lifetime movie.

52
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.530
Everybody's acting like something special's happening at the end of the day was

53
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.880
wasn't that really just a bunch of shit so you could fucking make money?

54
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.520
Isn't that what it was?
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

55
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.850
I'm talking about trust fund babies and I'm sick of the judgment of who judges a

56
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:34.520
baby.
First of all,
kind of a fucking person.

57
00:03:34.521 --> 00:03:37.370
You maybe that's why God didn't give you money.
You have to think about that.

58
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.650
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's called Karma.

59
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.580
Isn't that the most overused working expression Karma?

60
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.070
This is my theory on Karma.
Karma Getcha unless you,
unless you don't give a fuck.

61
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.910
If you don't give a fuck and you,
if you truly don't give a shit,

62
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.930
you got to have like a level of guilt for common to come back and bite you in

63
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:03.650
the ass.
But if you just some fucking entitled con you,
those people,

64
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:08.290
they'd skate through life.
You know you have a,

65
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.290
him you haven't seen entitled can just walk across the room.

66
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.230
It's like he has those little kids shoes on.
Then have the wheels on them.

67
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.260
You only take two steps.
They just glide across the room.

68
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.910
They don't care about breaking hearts.
They don't care about evicting people.

69
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.123
Right.

70
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.500
They don't give a shit who fucking sewed their shirt together that out.

71
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.180
What does that endangered species throw it on the grill.
They don't care.

72
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.550
You know,
there's a genius to that.
Just not giving a shit.
You know what I mean?

73
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.980
I'd love to see one of those people,
you know,
in the afterlife,

74
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.650
if you have to get,

75
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.180
if you actually get judged just to see the fucking look in the face,

76
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:46.840
you know what I mean?

77
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.350
And then God at some point would have to feel some sort of shame being like,

78
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:54.070
well,
you know,
at the end of the day I assembled that.
You know what I mean?

79
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.760
That's why I've never understood about the judgment.
It's just like,
you know,

80
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:02.761
especially with these fucking sociopath's as opposed to the levelheaded saint

81
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.390
that I am,
these fucking,
these fucking sociopath's out there.

82
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.470
Like,
where does,
you know,
shouldn't you know,

83
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.330
shouldn't you be judging God on that one?
Gingy be looking up like really,

84
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.420
you know,
what are you doing blow last night?

85
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.330
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

86
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.200
<v 0>You forgot to put the a I give a shit about other people assembly into this one.</v>

87
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.500
Just fucking sent it out there.
I Dunno.
The more I,

88
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.070
I vaguely pay attention to all that space shit.
You know,

89
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.500
I hate people who are in this space by the way.

90
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.260
There was talking about do you understand and you can put,

91
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.050
it's like,
yes.
Yeah,
I get it.
I get it.
You know,
ourselves.

92
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.830
Understand is we fucking,
we've,
we've,

93
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:50.220
we've seen how gigantic it is yet we haven't found anything.

94
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:52.320
So I still think this place is pretty amazing.

95
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.940
It's fascinating as Mars is,
this does nothing to do.

96
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.820
I don't understand these fucking people that want to go to Mars and live there

97
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.200
and it's like,
and do what?

98
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.663
<v 4>Huh?</v>

99
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.470
<v 0>Live in some fucking strip mall for the rest of your life.</v>

100
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.510
Some star trek looking strip mall.

101
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.553
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.540
<v 0>Fucking drinking Tang.
Just so you can say,
Oh yeah,
you know,</v>

103
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.400
that's your big fucking move.
The,
you know,
people want to live on Mars,

104
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.390
that means they suck at everything else in life.
Right?
They got enough of the,

105
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.360
you know,
you know what it is.
You graduate high school,

106
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:31.150
you want to come back someday,
right.
Smoking a big cigar
going,

107
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.050
hey,
you know,
yeah,
I was jacked guy used to push around the playground,

108
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.840
but you know what I did right?
I went to,
I did things,

109
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.730
I did digs and now I smoke this and I drive down and see that over there.

110
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:48.210
That's fucking me.
It makes it,
I matter.

111
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.950
So usually in this day and age,
that means you're going to try to create an APP,

112
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.330
right?
You gonna Fuck Fuckin,
I don't know,
get some sort of,

113
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.520
you start a website where you curate videos and fucking news.

114
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.580
I don't know what these fucking millennials do,
but I think if you,

115
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:14.080
if you suck at that,
right?
You can't play an instrument.

116
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.290
And you ego could not just handle,
just being happy with what you have.

117
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.090
I think at that point it's like I can't just go back to my high school reunion,

118
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.650
just be in some regular Joe Waking up in the morning,

119
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.580
putting my coffee and my thermos

120
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.770
going into the shower quietly crying was the water cascades over my face and my

121
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:45.880
wife comes walking in going to Uri.
Just be like,
yeah,
I just sneezed.
I'm fine.

122
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.820
Just washing my face.
Right.

123
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.210
I think at some point,
either you just fucking give in and just say,
hey man,

124
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:57.850
you know,
being a regular guy kind of fucking cool.
You know,

125
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.380
or you can't handle it right.
They should mind me.

126
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.060
I've never seen a few good men.
You get hurdle the truth,
you know,

127
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.560
there's too many,
too much gritten a teeth in that movie.
That's right.
Iceman.

128
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.120
I am dangerous,
right?
Too much of that shit.
So I never watched it.
You know,

129
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.140
which people walking around dressed in fucking then little navy suits.

130
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.630
Um,
anyways,
he can't fucking handle it.
And you gotta go back to high school,

131
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:27.490
you and you got to do something.
And I think at that point,

132
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:31.300
that's when you just say,
listen,
I,
I,
I got to live on Mars.

133
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.920
I mean,
I can't go back with nothing.
I got to have something to say.

134
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:39.040
That's like Lance Bass.
He couldn't handle that.

135
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:43.930
Justin Timberlake walked away from,
from in sync.

136
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.480
Right.
Ah,

137
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.080
want it that way or whatever the fuck they sing that song where they all,
I all,

138
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:54.690
I could like puppets,
right?
He just fucking walked away,
you know,

139
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.430
and got the one guy,
the goatee guy,
he's got a sense of humor about himself.

140
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.370
He makes all these funny commercials.
He'll do a thing.
He doesn't give a fuck.

141
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.160
Right?
You've got the dreadlock guy.

142
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.660
Did he used to bang Jennifer Aniston or was that the other guy
who,

143
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:13.350
some white guy with dreadlocks used to go out with Jennifer Aniston,
you know,

144
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.940
have you one of those beautiful celebrities always dates a guy and he always

145
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:20.340
have that,
that,
that really,
you got that moment like,
wow,

146
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.870
why didn't I learn how to fight fucking play the Ukulele and wear flip flops?

147
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.390
That's what I had to do.
Fucking walking around with your goddamn man tits.
Um,

148
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.930
anyway,
sorry.
And I think lance can handle it.
He's just like,
what the fuck?

149
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.260
You know?
So then annexing,
you know,
he's signing up to go out and space to some,

150
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.400
I'll try and outdo.
Oh,
what'd you put you put out futures?
Sexy songs.
Huh?

151
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.880
Wait,
wait,
wait.
Right Wayne,
Wayne,
Wayne,

152
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.000
Wayne mad man.
I'm going to outer space.
What?

153
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.960
Oh,
what is it about wearing your pajamas in the middle of the day?
That just,

154
00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:07.460
it just fucking opens your mind up.
You know what I mean?
I swear to God.

155
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:09.870
<v 4>Okay.</v>

156
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.570
<v 0>There is no free of feeling that being a white male,</v>

157
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:16.440
heterosexual still in your pajamas at 11 o'clock in the morning on a weekday,

158
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.150
on a weekday.
And you know what,

159
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.410
cause I'm a liberal because I want everyone to experience that,
you know,

160
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.550
all the people in the Philippines.
Um,

161
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.420
anyways,
uh,
I'm actually,

162
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:34.080
I'm in a good mood because I did something yesterday that scared the living shit

163
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:37.890
out of me and I didn't die,
which is all,
you know,
obviously,

164
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.810
cause I'm doing this podcast.
So,
you know,
I hadn't flown a helicopter,

165
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.420
uh,
since like October until this month.

166
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:48.810
And I flew for the first time and I could not believe how fucking rusty I was.

167
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:52.260
How much just shit.
You forget.
You're like,
what?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

168
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.230
Oh yeah,
that's right.
You know,
darn it.
Base,

169
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:00.140
turn it final.
I didn't even slow down.

170
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.780
I was so busy trying to keep the fucking pad between the compass,
you know,

171
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.510
and the Dashboard Day,
I can't remember what the fuck you call it,

172
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:12.800
the control panel that I forgot.
I was still doing like 65 knots and I'm woo.

173
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.810
I fucking went right by it.
I had to slam on the brakes.

174
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.190
Right.
So,
but you know,
I flew around,
shook,
shook off the Russia,

175
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.310
he's coming around,
he's coming around,
you know.
So I went,

176
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.550
I went again yesterday and uh,

177
00:11:28.551 --> 00:11:31.550
went up with my instructor and he was like,
so what do you want to do?
I said,

178
00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:34.070
all right,
let's do the pattern.
Let's fly the traffic pattern.

179
00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:38.150
Let's do some auto sets where they simulate a main road of failure.

180
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.620
That's the big fan above your head.

181
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.440
Like what if all of a sudden the engine cuts up,
you know,
um,

182
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.160
and then those kicks left.
What do you do?
You slam the collective down,

183
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.800
had right pedal,
right trim,
air speed,
rpm.
He'd come,
the rpms coming up,

184
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.730
you pull the collective up,
you catch fucking things,
you pick up your spot.

185
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.770
So we were doing those and at some point I was just like,
all right,
fuck this.

186
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.440
Okay.
Um,
I,
I have to fly this thing by myself or solo.
Is he saying the business?

187
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.130
But I'm just a novice.
So I said,
all right.
He goes,
well,
okay,

188
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.560
we did a couple of those.
He goes,
what do you want to do now?
I said,
all right,

189
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.453
can,
uh,

190
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.840
can you just step out and let me just fly this thing around one time by myself

191
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.330
just to do it again?
And he goes,
yeah,
absolutely.

192
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.620
So he steps out and up to that point,
it had been a great day.
You know,

193
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.250
not a lot of traffic over there.
Everything's fucking fine.
So he gets out,

194
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.010
roll it back up.
You know,
lights are out,

195
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.040
PM's are in the green gauges.
Real Green cabaret heats up.

196
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:40.010
I fucking lift up light on the skids,
bring it up,
bump,
holding a hover.

197
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.990
Here we go.
Here we go.
Cyclic.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

198
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.600
Less weight in the fucking thing.
You know,
fucking palms are sweating.

199
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.320
You know,
there's always said,
Don,

200
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:52.720
I can't believe I actually fucking know how to do this thing right.

201
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.500
So immediately there's a fucking crosswind.
So I'm looking at the wind sock.
God,

202
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.790
you fucking content.
Fight it.
Left pedal.
Now I'm facing the wind,

203
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.410
so everything's fine.
And next thing you know,
like fucking,

204
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:09.730
like three jet blue's are taken off at southwest is landing.
You know,

205
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:13.810
I made my call and the guy's like,
you know,
whatever.
Fucking six Victor Hotel.

206
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.870
Standby.
Standby means shut the fuck up.

207
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:20.230
I always forget that cause then I would go six tricks through hotel standing by.

208
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.400
So I'm fucking sitting there.
I'm,
I felt like I was in a oven for 20 minutes.

209
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.430
What I really wanted to have happen,

210
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.430
it was just like one of those things where it's like,
all right,
fuck this up,

211
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.930
fill in this rolled out,
have him step out.
I fucking roll back up,

212
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.170
lifted off.
As for clearance,

213
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:43.640
he gives it to me and I just take it for a lap around the airport.

214
00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:46.820
That's all I wanted to do.
So now I'm fucking sitting in this Harvard just going,

215
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:50.140
Jesus Christ.
Now I'm thinking,

216
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.260
what the fuck am I doing?

217
00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.740
So finally
he called,
yeah,
go fuck go.

218
00:14:00.741 --> 00:14:03.960
Six Victor Hotel.
I left closed traffic.
I've cleared for takeoff,

219
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.000
cleared for takeoff,
six Victor Hotel.
And then I,
uh,
I fucking took off,

220
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.760
brought it around and when I was turned across,
when,
you know,

221
00:14:11.761 --> 00:14:13.710
I'm looking for traffic,
did join the downwind,

222
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.210
make sure I don't have any problems.
I was actually thinking like,
you know,

223
00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:22.950
last night I did stand up dressed is Steven Adler at the goddamn comedy jam.

224
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.360
I tried out a new fucking bit about blow up dolls that was killing so hard.

225
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:31.970
I looked over and Josh,
Adam Meyers was fucking dying,

226
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.020
laughing on the side of the stage.
And so as much as you make people laugh,

227
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:37.660
when you look over and you see a fellow comedian dying laughing,
you know,

228
00:14:37.661 --> 00:14:42.060
you're onto something.
So then I went back and I got to play Ryan Sore,

229
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.340
dressed as Steven Adler sound,
the sound guy.

230
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:47.710
Now I would have dressed up as Matt camera,
but he's just,
you know,

231
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.710
he doesn't have any unique facial hair.
He's got that sorted out.

232
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.560
Luke Skywalker haircut.
I just want to look like me with the stupid wig on,

233
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.420
you know.
Um,

234
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.950
and then I got to play the encore paradise city and I was thinking,

235
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:04.250
I fucking did that.
I did stand up and play drums live last night.

236
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.940
It right now I'm flying a helicopter by myself

237
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.350
and I flunked so much shit in high school,
terrible at math,

238
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.070
fucking flood French.
All of that shit

239
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.780
was a great feeling.
And I was like,
Oh yeah,
that's right.

240
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.130
I'm flying a helicopter so I get to the downward,
you know,
where did you go?

241
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:31.130
Across three zero.
You bring your fucking carburetor heat up.

242
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:33.710
See if you're fucking carburetor.
Doesn't freeze over in the engine,

243
00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:38.210
doesn't cut out as you slowing down.
Came around,
still pulling power kit,

244
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:41.540
my 60 knots as I turned the fucking base in the file.

245
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.160
K right in lead,
set that thing down nicely.

246
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.080
And uh,
they're,
my instructor came back in and just,
you know,

247
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.440
plugs his headphones in.
He goes,
he goes,
uh,
how did that feel?

248
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.720
I said,
I,
you know,
I said it was like riding a bike except you could kill you

249
00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.953
<v 3>self.</v>

250
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.040
<v 0>I started laughing and what I've found with instructors is they're all bad ass</v>

251
00:16:05.041 --> 00:16:09.030
guys.
Every one of them chicks,
they're all fucking bad assets,
you know.

252
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.690
But the second you admit that you're actually scared,
they always laugh.

253
00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:15.550
And then they usually tell you a story how fucking nervous that they were.

254
00:16:15.551 --> 00:16:19.020
But if you have some fucking cocky cunt,
um,

255
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.580
you don't want to do that,

256
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.130
cause then what they're gonna do is they're going to chop throttle on you as you

257
00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:24.990
fucking doing some stay here.
And I don't need that.

258
00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.120
Even though it's good training.
I've never had anybody do that to me.
Um,

259
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:34.000
but anyways,
so I did it and it made me feel
fucking amazing,

260
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.200
man.
She's like the sickest goddamn feeling and I sweat it.
God,

261
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.310
all I need to do is make like another $40 million and I think I could actually

262
00:16:41.311 --> 00:16:43.680
afford to truly engage in that hobby.

263
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.920
I in La,
it's just super expensive.

264
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:50.610
I think if you live more in the middle of nowhere,

265
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.680
the big fucking thing is like just storing the goddamn whatever you get the

266
00:16:56.771 --> 00:16:59.740
plane or the helicopter.
Um,

267
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.590
I dunno if anybody knows like a cheap way to do it,
I would absolutely,

268
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.230
uh,
absolutely do it.
But until then,

269
00:17:08.231 --> 00:17:11.770
I'm just treating it like the way I treat cars.
Like I just go on the road,

270
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.460
you know,
I go to budget and then that's it.
I just,

271
00:17:15.461 --> 00:17:19.780
whatever fucking car they give me,
I get it.
And I gotta be honest with you.
I,
I,

272
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:22.900
that's the one thing that bugs me about renting helicopters at every time you

273
00:17:22.901 --> 00:17:26.790
fucking go in there,
eh,
something's a little different,
you know,

274
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.290
just be nice to know you fucking tail number.

275
00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:32.920
Not have to fucking constantly be looking or the control panel,

276
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.990
nowhere everything is.
Know how everything works.

277
00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:38.230
Every radio seems to be a little bit different.
It's just like a fucking,

278
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.670
it's just that extra thing you got to like deal with it.
I wish,
um,

279
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.090
I didn't and I'd love to just buy one of those fucking are 20 twos,

280
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.420
you know,
they're fun is held.
They just a little to cdot,
right?
Any,

281
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:52.520
you're really flying it.

282
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.890
It's like if you had a car that just had drum brakes and no power steering,

283
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:59.400
like you really fucking,
you know,
are holding up.

284
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.930
This is just what I've heard from other pilots.

285
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.650
Cause I've never flown anything fancy,
nothing fancy.
Like,
um,

286
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.580
but I really fucking enjoyed it.
And,
uh,
just even doing that,

287
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:12.510
I mean that's how long it takes to fly the pattern.
Um,

288
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:13.930
<v 4>yeah,</v>

289
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.940
<v 0>I mean that couldn't have been more than like felt like 90 seconds.</v>

290
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.480
You'd probably,
maybe it was a little bit longer.
I don't know.
But uh,

291
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.000
<v 4>yeah,</v>

292
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.950
<v 0>I dunno.
It's just fucking definitely left the place yesterday.
You know,</v>

293
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.020
that's one of those things where you'd get did something great and you're

294
00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:32.210
driving away and you've got the window down just driving right.
Gone.

295
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.060
So anyways,
you guys been watching the playoffs?
Yeah,

296
00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.010
I'd say for first round playoffs.

297
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.430
I'll tell you the series I'm watching obviously,
and I'll say,

298
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.740
I'll tell you again,
I'm just going to keep saying,
I'll tell you,

299
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.250
I'll tell you I'm watching those Celtics and the Bulls,
um,

300
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.270
Celtics are now up three games to two after being down.
Oh,
too.

301
00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.100
After looking like we had no fucking answers.
Right.

302
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.570
And,
uh,

303
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.570
which is why my nod for MVP of the series is Rondo without a doubt.

304
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.570
Because the second he went down the series just completely changed.

305
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.093
<v 4>MMM.</v>

306
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.540
<v 0>And I thought all of the Bulls had this figured out,</v>

307
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.660
but evidently it was rando he knew what the fuck was going on.

308
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.890
I'm giving them full fucking credit because it's just,

309
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.470
it's been a tale of two cities.

310
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:28.803
<v 4>You know,</v>

311
00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.630
<v 0>they looked like they were going to sweep us and now it looks like we're going</v>

312
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:37.200
to run the table on them.
However,
however,
I think Rhonda is coming back.

313
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.520
He took his cast off,

314
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.750
his suits have long sleeves again and um,

315
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.550
I can't wait to watch games.

316
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:49.320
Six I want to see like is this guy is good is it appears in this,

317
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.020
in this series at last night,

318
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:56.130
admittedly the officiating was a little subpar and it definitely went in the

319
00:19:56.131 --> 00:20:00.610
Celtics favor and I loved with Lopez was applauding the fucking refs.

320
00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:04.560
Sometimes it's worth getting a fucking technical.
I love that guy,
man.

321
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.030
That guy comes out every night,
wants to play.
He's a little fucking weird.

322
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.910
He's on his own vibe.
He just,
I,
I really liked that guy.

323
00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.610
I love when he fucking started clapping.

324
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.350
It's like my favorite thing and then they go to,

325
00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:22.260
I think it actually work because then we went down,

326
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.580
they called the ticky tack fall on the other end and you saw Dwayne Wade was

327
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:30.210
whatever the Celtic said to him.
I think it might've been uh,
Isaiah,

328
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.780
he just started smiling and laughing.
I swear to God,
man.

329
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.580
I just think the NBA is so fucking controlled.

330
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.310
<v 4>Okay.</v>

331
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.650
<v 0>I really do.
Just for the simple fact that you can do it.</v>

332
00:20:42.651 --> 00:20:43.880
I've said this a zillion times,

333
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.060
there is no easier game to control or fix than basketball cause it's the only

334
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:53.440
fucking game where you can sit down as a ref.

335
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:57.330
You can take people out of the game,
you know?
I mean,

336
00:20:57.331 --> 00:21:00.960
I guess all the games you can object somebody,
but they,
you know,
in baseball,

337
00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:03.360
football,
hockey,
you really have to do something.

338
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.360
You just can't point at a guy and be like,
hey,
go sit on the fucking bench.

339
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.210
Well I guess you can in hockey,
right?

340
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.463
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

341
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.640
<v 0>I dunno.
You know what,</v>

342
00:21:14.641 --> 00:21:16.560
that's one of those things where you think you have a good theory and then you

343
00:21:16.561 --> 00:21:21.120
fucking explore all the options you like,
oh well maybe it doesn't work.
Whatever.

344
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.300
No,

345
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.880
but you only sit them down for like fucking two minutes and they come back out

346
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:25.361
and it's not like,

347
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:28.990
well fucking Wayne Gretzky's got three penalties two more and he's out of the

348
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:33.370
game right?
There you go.
Gone back on track with my theory.
There you go.

349
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.750
You can't sit Tom Brady down all you got like this is what kills me about

350
00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:40.360
basketball.
I don't give a fuck how many points you're up.

351
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.250
You're up like 20 points.
You just like,
yeah,

352
00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:47.410
this game's a rep is one quarter ago.
You know,

353
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.990
most teams are lucky if they score like 27 and a quarter,

354
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.520
that's like a fucking great quarter.

355
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.330
We're up by 20 all we really need to do is score eight points and we're fine.

356
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:58.750
And the next thing you know it's just like a little fucking jerk offs are on a

357
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:03.100
27 to run every fucking time.

358
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.700
That whole thing.
It's a game of runs.
I don't think it is.

359
00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:12.110
I think it's a game of fucking ratings in.
If a team gets up too high,

360
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.740
they just start fucking call,
call and files together.
Ah,
that's stupid.

361
00:22:15.741 --> 00:22:18.950
That's a stupid fucking theory.
But it does,
it just appears that way.

362
00:22:18.951 --> 00:22:23.120
Maybe it is the nature of the game that nobody can just blow somebody out.

363
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.150
They always come back.

364
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:26.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

365
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:31.340
<v 0>Like I would say like 85% of the time,
of course I didn't do any research,</v>

366
00:22:31.341 --> 00:22:33.240
but you seem to 85% of the time you fucking go,

367
00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:36.590
you go up by 30 points in the first half,
you know,

368
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.560
somehow by the end of the game of what away,
what else?
Sex,

369
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.410
what are the most unbelievable and probable come back

370
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.250
since last night's fucking slew of NBA Games that did the exact same thing.
Yeah.

371
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.280
Um,
anyways,
I don't want to talk about it.
All I'm saying is that I think a

372
00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.310
Rondo really showed,
I mean just,
I mean it's fucking unbelievable.

373
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:01.660
Like how much the series change.

374
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.050
One guy is gone and the whole thing turns around.
Um,

375
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:09.000
so I'm excited to watch games six.
I mean,

376
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.260
I like seeing greatness.
I don't give a shit.
I mean,
I hope it's on my team,

377
00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:16.230
but if it isn't that can't and I'm like,
I can't just sit back and appreciate it.

378
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.110
Right.
I tried to be a good guy for right now.

379
00:23:19.111 --> 00:23:22.440
I don't know why I have this fucking,
this pillow that wraps around you,

380
00:23:22.441 --> 00:23:27.120
this little half circle pillow.
You know when you have a baby abuse,

381
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.230
it's perfectly set him down.
You give him that bottle of Jack,
you know,

382
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.250
and then that's it.
You know?
But if you try to do it with regular pills,

383
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.410
it doesn't work.
But for some reason I have it around me right now.
I don't know.

384
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:40.980
It feels right.

385
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.070
Like I don't wait to have a kid that buy one of these fucking semicircle
pillows.

386
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.510
Um,
all right.
What else did I want to talk about?
I've been watching,
you know,

387
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.870
I've been watching the hockey.
Okay.

388
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:56.030
Gotten over the fact that my Bruins had been knocked out by the quietest fan

389
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:59.180
based team in the league.
Right.

390
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.520
The team that cheering forgot until April.

391
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:08.060
Then all of a sudden they all show up like they give a shit.
Oh man,

392
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.650
that was fucking hard watching that.
Anyways,
um,
the prejudice are looking great,

393
00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:14.720
but I still think a,
I don't even if I already talked about this,

394
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:18.200
I started this podcast twice.
I forget if I brought this shit up.
I still,

395
00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:22.580
I'm still going with the penguins.
I think the penguins repeat.
Um,

396
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.290
and I Miss Anaheim Edmonton.
I bet that's a great fucking series too.

397
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.010
It's so crazy.
They're already down to just two series in each conference,

398
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:33.680
so I have to make sure that I'm watching,
um,

399
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.150
for those people last week you're like,
hey,

400
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:38.660
how come you didn't talk about Moto GP,
the race in Austin?
You know what?

401
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:41.390
I didn't see it.
And uh,
then I,

402
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:44.300
I realized I recorded it and this is what you learn.

403
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.860
If you're new to moto GP and you go to record the race and you've got to fucking

404
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:50.780
do it.
It might,

405
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.070
it might be better than Formula One just because of the sheer amount of like

406
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:58.850
passing in lead changes and all that.
It's fucking insane.

407
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.140
And then the fact he just watched these guys falling off motorcycles.

408
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.220
I wrote one of the races.
Um,
well let me explain it first.

409
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.170
You're going to go to record it.
If you novice like me,

410
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:13.200
you go to record it and you'll be watching like the first race in it.
Oh,

411
00:25:13.201 --> 00:25:16.490
say Moto too.
When they're on these little skinny bicycle tires and you're like,

412
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:20.270
those don't look like the fucking,
you know,

413
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.450
those Badass bikes that I saw.
What's going on here?

414
00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:28.230
Then there's moto three and you're like,
where does the real one?
Was that Ross,

415
00:25:28.231 --> 00:25:32.570
Valentino Rossi guy,
whatever the fuck his name is.
Uh,

416
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.730
Mike and the mechanics,
whatever that other guy's name is.

417
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.750
I don't know any of the fucking name shed.
So there's three different classes.

418
00:25:38.751 --> 00:25:40.880
This is what I learnt.
All right.

419
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.950
On Moto GP as they say.
And um,

420
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.370
there's Modo too.

421
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:51.520
There's Modo three and there's moto GP and that's basically like being in Aa Aaa

422
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:53.990
and then being in the majors.
Now for whatever reason,

423
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.850
modal three is the lowest level.
So I guess they go in three,
two,
one.

424
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.210
I guess that's how they do it.
And they don't say one,
they just say GP,

425
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.400
which I believe stands for Grand Prix.
I don't fucking know.

426
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:08.380
So motor three is 250 cc according to this,

427
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.770
this thing on reddit here to 250 cc bike,
you know,

428
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.760
so that's basically a cubic centimeters.
So it's a smaller engine.

429
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:21.440
It's not as fast.
You know,
it's still fast as shit the way they're doing it.

430
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.160
But you know,
that's the one like,
okay,
all right there grasshopper,
we'll,
we'll,

431
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.840
you know,
we'll see how he'd do it this level.
And then if you,
uh,

432
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.620
succeed at that level,
then they move you up to moto two,
which is 600 CC's.

433
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.740
Evidentaly four strokes and all the engines are made by Honda,

434
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:41.400
which I find interesting.
Um,
so hot,

435
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.220
they're all Honda base.
Everybody's working the exact same shit.

436
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.930
That's probably so they can truly get an idea of who,

437
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.940
um,
who is the best writer,
who's going to get called up to the show moto GP.

438
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.850
And according to this person,
a lot of times in Modo,

439
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.680
Modo to the race is better because they all just have basically the exact same

440
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:04.380
engine.
So this guy was saying you could throw,

441
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.300
you usually can throw a blanket over the top three people in that race.
Um,

442
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:14.460
and then the big show is moto GP,
which is a thousand CC's.
Um,

443
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.890
and those things are just fucking rockets.

444
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:18.600
And I watched his whole thing on how they build them.

445
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.420
They're hand handbuilt gets how much those motorcycles cost a piece.

446
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.530
Take a wild guess.
Like if for some reason you went down and they said,
hey,

447
00:27:25.531 --> 00:27:28.080
you want to take it for a lap,
but if you fucking trashed this thing,

448
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.850
you've got to pay for it.
Okay.

449
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.650
And they give you that fucking suit with the airbag.
And unfortunately you don't,

450
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.500
high side East slide off the bike and you get up and be like a shit.
What's that?

451
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.000
Gonna cost me?
I would have thought anywhere between 102 hundred 50 grand,

452
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.600
you know,
and I understand that it's a fucking racing bike and all that,

453
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.430
but you know,
they're a little last things.
You know what I mean?

454
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.710
You got to do a build on a car.

455
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.200
There's like fucking people working on it on the other side.

456
00:27:55.201 --> 00:27:59.370
He can't even see him a motorcycle.
I mean it's,
it's right there.

457
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.900
Everything is right fucking there.

458
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.960
You and another guy can lift up the engine and the shit is small.

459
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.600
It does like 100 a hundred to 250 grand is what I would've guessed.

460
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.980
Three 75 tops.
Right.
This is like,

461
00:28:10.981 --> 00:28:14.070
I'm at the showcase showdown on the prices.
Right.

462
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.080
And I horrifically underbid is what happens.

463
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.230
Those bikes cost $2 million each,

464
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.300
$2 million each.
They're handmade.
Um,

465
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.440
all this space age stuff.
I watched this whole thing on how they build them.

466
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.660
The gas tank is actually underneath the seat.

467
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.680
What's where the gas tank usually is,
is the fuel injector.

468
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.280
There's an airport right in front of that,
right where the fucking front late.

469
00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:42.080
Usually I just went on,

470
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.080
I watched the whole goddamn thing was absolutely fascinating and a,

471
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:49.290
I'm totally in on that sport watching that sport.
And I'm watching the F one.

472
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.670
I don't know when the wrote next races,
but uh,
if you want to watch dude,

473
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:55.800
well I think it was the motto to race.
The last one,

474
00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:59.850
this fucking guy came out of a turn is backend started fishtailing and he went

475
00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:04.710
like right up and over the handlebars doing,
I don't know how fast,
I don't,

476
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.540
I don't get how they get up
cause he,

477
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.080
he landed on like his foot,

478
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:13.800
he limped for a second and then he just kinda just shakes it off.
They're like,

479
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:17.350
hey,
said foot problems,
said foot problems in the past.

480
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.570
I'd imagine he'd had everything problems.
You fall off a bike.

481
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.690
You know,
it's funny when I was thinking about getting a motorcycle out here,

482
00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:28.920
the stupidest thing you could ever do,
um,
you know,

483
00:29:28.921 --> 00:29:31.080
riding a fucking motorcycle.
I know a lot of guys say,

484
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.950
well you just fucking flew a helicopter.
It's with way safer,
way safer.

485
00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:37.250
There's nobody up there.
I was actually driving back.
I was did,
um,

486
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.010
Mark Marin's podcast promoting season two of F is for family.

487
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.110
I don't know when that's coming out.

488
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.520
<v 4>MMM.</v>

489
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.070
<v 0>And thank you to mark Marin.
Forget me on his podcast,
I had a great time.</v>

490
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:52.570
We talked about anger,
meditation.
We talk music and we help promote any,

491
00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:56.680
help me promote the show.
And um,
I was on my way back.

492
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.110
It was the middle of the day and all of a sudden there was just all this

493
00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:02.930
horrific traffic.
And uh,
this big fucking accident,

494
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.820
this truck had jumped at medium strip.
I don't have to guide median strip.

495
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:10.240
I don't know if the guy fucking fell asleep or whatever,

496
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:13.600
but 10 people went to the hospital,
one person died in a dog died,

497
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.570
you know,
so I don't know.
I just think the highway is way,
way,
way more dangerous.

498
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.450
I've said it before,
you flying in formation,

499
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.630
the secure in the fucking blue angels,
everybody's doing 80 miles an hour.

500
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.600
There's no radio contact.
Nobody knows where anybody is fucking going.

501
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.840
These people texting these people on meds,
you have no idea.

502
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:35.710
And then forget a bit and then right on the other side is another group of

503
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:37.420
fucking people.
You know,

504
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.280
there's never ending parade of fucking people flying on the other side.

505
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.650
You don't know what they're going to do.
That fucking guy was driving a truck,

506
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:51.130
fell asleep,
pat a heart attack,
whatever the fuck he did jump the meetings.

507
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.260
Strip went right up and over into oncoming fucking traffic at like,

508
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:59.020
it was like 12 in the afternoon.
Do you look it up?
It's on was on the five right?

509
00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:00.070
In your Colorado Boulevard.

510
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.443
<v 4>MMM.</v>

511
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.880
<v 0>So anyways,
so I was thinking about getting a motorcycle when I was,</v>

512
00:31:04.881 --> 00:31:08.420
I was looking up those moto GP suits.

513
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.160
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

514
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160
<v 0>What's your like 2,500 bucks a whack,</v>

515
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.070
but they got a little air bag in them and I'm like,

516
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:16.660
well that's what the fuck I would want.

517
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.040
It would be hilarious to buy one of those and then by like a fucking Harley

518
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.610
Davidson and just look like the biggest fucking asshole ever.

519
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.780
You just ride that thing.
If somebody cuts in front of you,
you just let it.

520
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.720
But there's another thing too,
is on those,
when they're racing,

521
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.610
you can lay it down and slide and fucking all that stuff and you find,
you find,

522
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.000
it's not like you can slide into oncoming traffic and there's a good God damn

523
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.230
garbage truck coming at you.
Yep.

524
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:43.403
<v 4>MMM.</v>

525
00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.070
<v 0>I Dunno,
but I miss ride motorcycle,
so I'm taking a,
ah,</v>

526
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.100
there's just nothing safe about them.
I was thinking,
all right,

527
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:54.850
well I'll just get a dirt bike.
I won't go over jumps or anything.

528
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:58.230
I'll just ride some trails.
But then every,
I've ever been like fucking,
I dunno.

529
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.830
It seems like every six weeks you hear a story about somebody riding on a trail

530
00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:03.880
choosing a mountain bike though.

531
00:32:03.881 --> 00:32:08.560
But if you run like a dirt bike at some mountain line ends up like pouncing on

532
00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:13.250
your back,
which got the helmet on.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

533
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.261
I,
I,
you know what?

534
00:32:14.261 --> 00:32:16.480
This podcast is going great and he just went off the rails somewhere.

535
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:19.390
I don't really know where.
Let's,
let's do a little bit of,
uh,

536
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.030
advertising Indochino in

537
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.430
the sting wreath,
the Gordon Sumner read it.

538
00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:32.050
Don't shy to talk about how every man looks better in a suit.

539
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:37.750
You know,
when I'm checking out guys at the outdoor mall,
I'm like,

540
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:41.780
you know,
I'm really attracted to that guy,
but he's just wearing an Izod,

541
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:46.340
you know,
with some quarter Roy's,
that's not my all.

542
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:48.230
Now look at that fellow wearing this suit.

543
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.190
Now there's something I could take home to my parents that said,
everybody,

544
00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.320
if you're sick of gay men,

545
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.710
you're not giving you the fucking once over or maybe rolling their eyes.

546
00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.680
You ever think that maybe it's not you fucking love handles.

547
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.800
Maybe it's the fact that you don't have on a shirt,
a tie,

548
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:08.030
and a sport coat to cover up all the mistakes you've made with your nutrition

549
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.590
over the last 40 years.

550
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.860
Thank God there's Indochino is making it easy to get a perfectly tailored suit

551
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.970
and an incredible price.

552
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.160
You can choose from hundreds of top quality fabrics and personalize your suit

553
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.940
just the way you want it,
whether it's for work,
a wedding,

554
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.260
or another special occasion.
Here is how it fucking works.

555
00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.060

673
00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:22.270
They rip this seats out of a commercial airliner and they just stuff you in

they're going to walk up the street holding their fucking head.
Hi.

727
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:25.350
I'm imagining that person would,
you know,

right?

741
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.410
Yeah.
I believe I hit everything that I want to talk about.
You know,

742
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:22.670
I was just checking in on you some

743
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:27.470
<v 5>fucking music.
Excuse me,
that you guys can listen to a man.</v>

744
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:31.560
We got another like half hour of stuff from classic podcasts from a Thursday or

745
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:35.250
a Monday and a year,
a day a week gone by.
That's it.

746
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:39.000
Go fuck yourselves.
I believe there's another f one race this Sunday.

747
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:42.840
Check it out if you can.
Uh,
let's go sell dicks.

748
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.140
I'm hoping for a classic.
I hope he went,

749
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:48.960
but I also want to see Rhonda would come on and do his thing too.

750
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:51.510
You know what I mean?
Cause I still love that guy.
He's still a Celtic to me.

751
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:55.470
All right,
that's it.
Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday.

752
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.510
<v 3>[inaudible]
locked in Bro.</v>

753
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.150
<v 6>Hey,
what the fuck I'm talking about?</v>

754
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.330
We decided to have a fucking party for a new place.

755
00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.520
You don't you think that was my idea.

756
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.640
Do you think it was my idea to have a bunch of strangers come into the fucking

757
00:46:24.641 --> 00:46:27.640
house?
I'll have people over.
That's what I do.
Hey,

758
00:46:27.641 --> 00:46:32.080
you want to come over and watch the game?
Nine people that I know,
right?

759
00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:37.090
Have all your fucking phone numbers.
You don't.
Nia is a more open person,

760
00:46:37.091 --> 00:46:41.500
so she's like,
let's have a party.
All right,
so we still,

761
00:46:41.501 --> 00:46:45.070
she goes to invite your friends.
So I'm alright.
So,
you know,
I got,
you know,
I'm a,

762
00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.180
I'm a guy,
I don't have a bunch of friends.
Okay.

763
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.240
I got six good friends for that I could really trust,
you know,
it's about it,

764
00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:58.203
at least out here.

765
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:03.040
Then over here in neah talking to her mom about all excited about the party and

766
00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:07.120
she's like,
yeah,
I sent it on a Facebook and I was just like,
oh my God,

767
00:47:07.121 --> 00:47:11.850
did I just invite 110 paypal?
And my heart literally sank going,

768
00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:16.840
please tell me you didn't just invite 110 fucking people.
She's like,

769
00:47:16.841 --> 00:47:19.420
don't worry,
they're not all going to show up.
It's like,
yeah,

770
00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:20.500
but like a third wheel.

771
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.470
And then they're going to bring people that you don't even fucking know.

772
00:47:23.471 --> 00:47:27.010
And that's exactly what happened.
It was a fucking great party.

773
00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.400
I'm not gonna lie to you,
but I got to like,
I got to learn how to,
I'll be,

774
00:47:30.401 --> 00:47:33.760
I thought I was going to be a good host.
I wasn't.
I wasn't.

775
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.530
I was all right with the people I knew.
But the people I didn't know.
Uh,

776
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.270
actually most of them are all right,
but there were a couple of them.

777
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:44.140
I just find it just sends you something fucking annoying about somebody you

778
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:48.310
don't know,
sitting on your goddamn couch,
you know,

779
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:53.830
eating your food,
drinking your booze.
He like,
who the food of fuck are you?

780
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.210
It's somebody else was laying down on the floor.
I felt like the kids' Dad,

781
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:01.000
I want to make,
get and get a fucking job,
right?
It's over.

782
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:05.140
It's 26 she fucking pumped.
So anyway,
so the party is going great.

783
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.480
And uh,
I'm basically the whole time,
you know,
not drinking too much,

784
00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:14.770
but I'm standing by the front door cause that's the only way out.
All right?

785
00:48:14.771 --> 00:48:17.680
And nobody's walking out with any of my shit,
right?

786
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:21.910
I'm acting basically like psycho in fucking stripes.
That's how I am.

787
00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:25.210
It's how I'm wired.
All right?
So,
uh,

788
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.080
fucking three quarters away through the party,
everything's going great.

789
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.500
And I'm like,
wow,
this is,
you know what?
I forgot.
I forgot.
I'm not 21 anymore.

790
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.910
I'm fucking 43.
All my friends are adults and everybody's drinking responsibly.

791
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.350
And no one's really hammered,
nothing got broken,
everything's cool.
So I'll start,

792
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:45.080
just as I was starting to relax,
some kid comes up to me,
he's like,
ah,
yeah,

793
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.080
you own the house.
And I'm like,
well,
the bank owns it.
I'm fucking paying it off.

794
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:54.830
What can I do for you?
And he's like a yes,

795
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:59.650
kind of embarrassing.
But I used the bathroom downstairs and uh,
it's clog now.

796
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:03.670
And I was wondering if he had a plunger.
And I was like,

797
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:09.310
yeah,
I do have a plunger.
I got plunger right here in the upstairs bathroom.

798
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.820
So I give it to the guy and I,
and I say,
man,
I appreciate your honesty.
He goes,

799
00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:16.720
no problem.
He goes downstairs,
he takes care of it,
comes back,
he wants again.

800
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:21.400
He goes,
he goes,
sorry about that.
I said,
not at all,
not at all.

801
00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:24.520
What the fuck?
It's a toilet,
you know,
plugs up every once in a while.

802
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.250
But I appreciate,
I appreciate your honesty.
You know,

803
00:49:27.251 --> 00:49:31.780
cause that would have been nasty.
Good for you.
Right.
So,
uh,

804
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.910
now the couple hours goes by the party ends and there's like one straggler left.

805
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:39.370
And I tell the story to knee.
I'm like,
you know what a good,
what a good guy.

806
00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:43.820
What a good shit.
No Pun intended.
You know,
he could have left it in there.

807
00:49:43.821 --> 00:49:46.450
And then the other party I come walking in my fucking bathroom,

808
00:49:46.451 --> 00:49:51.250
looks like a Goddamn port authority bus station,
toilet,
you know,
so site.

809
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.640
So,
so one of the stragglers at the party goes,
yeah,
he goes,

810
00:49:54.641 --> 00:49:58.300
I saw that whole thing go down.
That's not exactly how it went down.
I'm like,

811
00:49:58.301 --> 00:50:02.170
what he talking about?
He goes,
he goes,
it wasn't him that was in the bathroom.

812
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.830
And I go,
who was,
he goes,
it was his girlfriend.

813
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:10.980
Some lay

814
00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.700
took a dump of a magnitude that it wouldn't go down the toilet.

815
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.350
So now she's in there panicking and this is when today's technology kicks in.

816
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:28.010
She can it back in the day,
she would had to crawl the fucking window

817
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.440
<v 0>and hope nobody saw her and just left the door locked.</v>

818
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.530
Everybody would have panicked.
Holy Fuck,
who's in there?

819
00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.670
Did somebody pass out to somebody.
If somebody committed suicide,
some of what?

820
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.800
It kicked in the door,
right?

821
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.980
Knocked it off the fucking goddamn hinges and you go in there,

822
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:44.210
that'd be nobody in there.

823
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.900
You'd feel the air from outside and then look down and everyone would see a

824
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:49.130
giant shit and be like,

825
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:54.050
as a party would be over and the owner of the house would be walking around

826
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:54.913
going home.

827
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.390
<v 6>What one are you mother fucking Jerry,</v>

828
00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.700
<v 0>you better drive away.
Right.
That's how I would have ended.</v>

829
00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:08.260
But because of today's technology,
not saying she didn't panic,

830
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.400
you know,

831
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.700
it's even worse as a lady cause they're not even supposed to do stuff like that.

832
00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:14.420
Right.
And uh,

833
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:19.030
she was able to text your boyfriend and I would fucking pay at least $400 to

834
00:51:19.031 --> 00:51:22.120
read those texts,
the panic in those texts.

835
00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:28.720
And to his credit,
he fucking eats,
stepped it up.

836
00:51:28.721 --> 00:51:31.600
He took the hit,
he came up to me,

837
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:37.310
v h ones I love the eighties own Belper and said,

838
00:51:37.541 --> 00:51:41.080
I took a dump in your toilet to a magnitude it didn't go down.

839
00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.860
And I need the tools required to alleviate this situation.

840
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:53.170
So
Anti Douche bag of the week,
that guy right there.

841
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.220
So taking a fucking bullet for the team that gets that right there is the

842
00:51:57.221 --> 00:52:01.930
reverse Peyton manning award.
He didn't fucking go,

843
00:52:01.931 --> 00:52:05.530
we had protection issues right now.
He took one,

844
00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.420
he took one for the fucking tape,

845
00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:11.410
went upstairs like a Goddamn gentlemen asked for a plunger,

846
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:14.890
gave it to him and it was all fun.

847
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.340
And I went down there at the end of the party.
You never would've known anything,

848
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:23.120
anything happen.
You know what I mean?
Like,
uh,

849
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.570
you know,
three hours after the Kennedy assassination.
I bet it was.

850
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:27.860
It was all I would say it,
you know,

851
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.400
marked it all up and everything was all figured out,
but it was a nice road.

852
00:52:31.401 --> 00:52:36.060
Again,
mopped up the brains.
What am I talking about?
Yeah.

853
00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:57.100
<v 3>[inaudible] Hey,
what's going going</v>

854
00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.050
<v 6>on?
It's bill burn.
It is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

855
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:06.300
April 20 something 2009.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

856
00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.530
You know,
I really don't.
I really don't.
All right.

857
00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.560
I feel like shit.
Uh,

858
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:16.800
I had a really rough weekend in a Columbus,
Ohio.

859
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.780
But before I get into the details,

860
00:53:18.781 --> 00:53:23.280
I want to thank everyone who came out on a Friday,
Saturday,
and Sunday.

861
00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:26.910
I had a great time.
I had too good of a time.

862
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:31.110
Let's put it that way.
Um,
yeah.

863
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.850
Too good a time to go to fucking time.
And I'm paying for it right now.

864
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:40.500
You know,
I don't know why I keep doing this.
I don't know why.

865
00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:45.030
I just can't learn,
you know?
You know,
I always do overrated,

866
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:48.540
underrated on this shit.
They all,
you know what's fucking underrated?

867
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.070
Eight hours sleep,
you know,
you know what's,

868
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:57.180
you know what's fucking underrated going,
hey,
you want another shot at Jamieson?

869
00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:01.520
You know what?
No,
I think I've had enough.
You know what I would like?

870
00:54:01.521 --> 00:54:06.020
I would like a water that's underrated.
You know,

871
00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.190
not going to fucking steak and shake at three in the morning.
That's underrated.

872
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:17.180
Yeah.
One of those fucking double burgers I never even made at that place before.

873
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:21.950
It didn't even look like meat like a patty in order.
Patty looks like.
Sure.

874
00:54:21.951 --> 00:54:26.330
We all do.
We've all had a fucking burger.
Even you little Veggie cons out there,

875
00:54:26.331 --> 00:54:27.650
you know what it looks like.

876
00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:32.430
This is a little burned up wig and there was two of them.

877
00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:34.641
You know what?

878
00:54:34.641 --> 00:54:38.870
I was kind of a 40 year old fucking guy going to be 41 and fucking June goes to

879
00:54:38.871 --> 00:54:43.871
steak and shake at three in the fucking morning when he's got a Goddamn fucking

880
00:54:45.261 --> 00:54:47.660
eight 40 in the morning flight.
Why would you do that?

881
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:52.040
Schererville you suck at math.
We all know that,
but you can tell time.

882
00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:55.580
I know there's numbers involve of Jesus Christ.

883
00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.590
What a fucking idiot.
This whole fucking
yes.

884
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.620
I just started thinking about that boogie nights.
I'm a fucking idiot.

885
00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.450
I'm a fucking Elliot and I'm a fucking Eddie and I fucking idiot.

886
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.790
Twice Friday night ended up at steak and shake at three in the morning,

887
00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.500
you know,
fucking Sunday night I was as far as,

888
00:55:18.501 --> 00:55:22.670
I didn't walk in and they weren't like norm,
like on chairs areas again,

889
00:55:22.671 --> 00:55:26.720
all shit faced.
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking motley crew.

890
00:55:26.721 --> 00:55:30.320
You want to see a motley crew go to a fucking steak and shake at three in the

891
00:55:30.321 --> 00:55:31.154
fucking morning.

892
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:32.860
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

893
00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:36.760
<v 6>Good God Almighty.
Now I'll tell you I was part of the problem.</v>

894
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:39.950
Oh,
you know,
I bet I was doing it.
Everybody else was doing,

895
00:55:39.951 --> 00:55:42.380
they were all sitting in their shit face looking around.
Everybody else.

896
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:47.210
Go on Jesus Christ.
Look at,
Oh,
that fucking guy.
Oh my God.

897
00:55:47.211 --> 00:55:52.000
Look at her.
She's wearing slippers.
Jesus Christ.

898
00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:55.470
You know you don't even realize they're doing it to you too.

899
00:55:56.270 --> 00:56:00.130
I'm going to have fucking guy.
Huh?
Look at that.
Look at his fucking eyes.

900
00:56:00.131 --> 00:56:03.400
What does,
it's almost like he's been drinking Jameson all night.

901
00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:08.630
Why wouldn't you get a water after awhile?
What a fucking idiot.
Yeah.

902
00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:12.870
Let me have one year burnt up wig.
Fucking burgers.
Ah.

903
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:16.790
Why is shit food so good when you,
when when you shit faced,
you know?

904
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:23.410
Is that what it is?
Shit.
Face Shit.
Food is just,
it's just all shit shit.

905
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.070
Fucking decisions.
I didn't want to do that,
man.
I was doing well.
You know,

906
00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:29.680
I went to trader Joe's,
you know,

907
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:33.130
dodged a bunch of fucking Birkenstock hippies and I,
you know,

908
00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:37.210
I went in there and I,
I,
I got the fridge put in my room.

909
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:42.910
Fuck global warming.
I want to be in shape.
I had a fridge put in my room.
I,

910
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:47.230
oh I had done all this healthy food and what do I do?

911
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:51.020
What do I do?
I go out,
I go drinking two,

912
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:55.630
one of four nights like a fucking moron.
Oh my God.
I went to this one.

913
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:58.870
You know what I had,
I had a slice of pizza last night too.

914
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:03.700
That's how fucked up I was.
This is like all coming.
It's like a slide show,

915
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.090
you know,
you can't remember this shit that happened in between,
but you just,

916
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:10.480
you just have pictures.
Good.

917
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:12.340
God Almighty was at a bad looking pizza.

918
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:17.000
Is there anything fucking worse than that?
Just a bad look and it just,
you know,

919
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:21.250
lets you know when someone makes a pizza right and even sucks when it's hot,

920
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.490
but then it just sits there for awhile and it just gets that,

921
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:28.060
that a cold case file.
Look to it.
You know what I mean?

922
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:31.450
Like it should have a fucking toe tag hanging off the crust.
They,

923
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.790
they brought over a whole pie to look like that,
you know,

924
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:38.050
they looked like some five year old made it and like an easy bake oven,
you know,

925
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.650
and you're their parents and I,
you have to eat it and say,
oh,
Susie,

926
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:47.680
it's delicious.
You know,
just begin.

927
00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:52.150
Begin her little life of people lying to her and not being fucking honest
saying,

928
00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:56.050
no,
don't wear that.
You look fat in that now.
You just go,
oh,
Susie,

929
00:57:56.051 --> 00:58:00.630
you look beautiful.
That's an excellent pizza you made.
You don't,
Susie,

930
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.390
it fucking sucks.
All right.

931
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:06.040
I'm not saying to give up your dream about being a cook,

932
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:09.490
but you definitely don't fucking have any talent at this point in your life.

933
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.420
You know,
maybe we can send you to some sort of,
uh,
oh Jesus Christ.

934
00:58:13.421 --> 00:58:17.620
What are those chefs schools called?
Huh?
Well,
what does that art called?

935
00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:23.050
You know,
come on.
You know what it is because with a c,
it's not custodial.

936
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:29.680
It's not calm.
Macerich he plays for fucking the Canadians.
Oh Canadians.

937
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.370
I want to say a bone,
Julia to all my friends up there in Montreal.
You know,

938
00:58:33.371 --> 00:58:36.010
I was just breaking your balls.
I've been blogging for the Bruins and uh,

939
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.400
is basically I went down as blogging for the Bruins during the playoffs,

940
00:58:39.401 --> 00:58:44.380
which I'm going to continue to do because they swept the Montreal Canadians.
Um,

941
00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:48.250
and basically,
uh,
you know,

942
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.690
I have to blog for the Bruins and playing the Canadians.
I mean,
what do,

943
00:58:50.691 --> 00:58:53.920
what do you,
what am I going to say?
The Canadians won 24 cups.

944
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:57.940
We've only won five.
We haven't won since 1972.

945
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:02.740
All I can do is just try to piss you off.
That's all I was doing.
I was,

946
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:07.360
Montreal fans get really,
really fucking mad.
You know,
I made fun of their coach.

947
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.480
I just did what I get.
Oh,
I just made fun of how they looked,

948
00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.940
how they blew their fucking players.
I don't need any more.

949
00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:16.920
I said I was just trying to be a jerk and then people got all just garners noise

950
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.800
.
You were hockey.
You know,
there's guy himself,

951
00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:25.970
a comedian.
I don't think this is very funny.

952
00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:30.890
Whatever.
I,
you know,
it's fucking funny.

953
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:34.550
I heard Celine Dion is thinking about buying the Montreal Canadiens.

954
00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:38.420
He's probably gonna move into Vegas.
There'll be a fucking mascot on ice.

955
00:59:38.421 --> 00:59:41.450
That would be,
that would be a crime.
That'd be a goddamn crime.
All right.

956
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:42.920
This is the Monday morning podcast.

957
00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:46.250
This is the hangover episode of the Monday morning podcast.

958
00:59:46.251 --> 00:59:51.080
I am sitting in a hotel in Manhattan,
New York.
Why are you doing that,
bill?

959
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:54.590
Huh?
You lay in low after your weekend of Busan.

960
00:59:55.100 --> 01:00:00.100
Now I've got a week at Caroline's and I'm working with Joe to Rosa once again,

961
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.210
my partner in crime too.
Codependent fucking alcoholics.

962
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.200
Do you know one time,

963
01:00:06.201 --> 01:00:10.640
I don't think I might have told this story on ONA opion Anthony Show for you.
Uh,

964
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.780
people who live in,
I don't know,
fucking North Dakota.
Um,

965
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:18.140
I don't know when I was in Caroline's Caroline's comedy club on Broadway,

966
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:22.610
where I will be Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday for a fucking 22 shows,

967
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.930
22 fucking shows.
I can't even do one show at this point.
I'm laying low,
man.

968
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:30.380
I'm laying low.
Um,
but anyways,
one night I was,

969
01:00:30.381 --> 01:00:33.020
I was standing there at the bar and I decided,

970
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.320
I didn't know if I decided I wasn't going to drink,
but I just wasn't drinking,

971
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:41.510
you know,
and all of a sudden who comes walking down the stairs,
you know,

972
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:45.610
like some starlet in the 1950s,
making a big fucking debut,

973
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.610
Joe de Rosa do you think was missing was the fuck in the evening gown.

974
01:00:49.611 --> 01:00:54.530
He comes fucking Walson down the stairs,
you know,
all dainty,
like,

975
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:59.240
and the second I saw him I was like,
fuck,
now I got a drink.
Right.

976
01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.660
And you know what,
he was thinking the exact same thing.
That was the funny thing.

977
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.610
Neither one of us wanted to drink.
You got any friends like that?
You just,

978
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:13.100
you just been fuck ups for so long that neither one of you can just pull you out

979
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:17.840
of the tailspin.
I'm sure.
Anybody who's in in Aa good.

980
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.590
Tell me what exactly that that's called.
What kind of friendship that is?

981
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:28.280
Um,
I don't fucking know.
I really,
I really,
really feel like shit right now.

982
01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.770
And,
uh,
so I'm sitting in the room and,
uh,

983
01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.080
if you noticed the quality might be a little bit better.

984
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:37.520
Actually got a microphone now and I have a little mixer and I have my headphones

985
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:41.570
on and I'm sitting here in the fucking dark.
That's not true.

986
01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:44.770
I got the one little desk light on,
uh,

987
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:49.130
basically talking to myself.
You know,
technically once you start listening,

988
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:52.760
this whole thing makes sense.
But Right now before I upload this thing,

989
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.410
this is really,
uh,
you know,
he says,

990
01:01:57.411 --> 01:02:00.710
why they don't give everybody handguns.
Because if one was laying around,

991
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.880
I'm fucking with you.
You know what I would do?

992
01:02:04.881 --> 01:02:07.160
I'd probably pointed out the window.
I wouldn't shoot anybody.

993
01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:08.210
Just try to scare someone,

994
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.290
maybe make me laugh and I could get a little oxygen or something into my fucking

995
01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:15.260
head.
What do you guys see?
What do you guys use for hangovers?
Huh?

996
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.890
Other than the smart thing,
not drink anymore.
God Damn.

997
01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:23.130
It's just so much fun though.
You know,
I was having a great time,
you know,

998
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:26.820
there was broad,
you know,
just having a good fucking time.

999
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.530
Just a good time.
You know the other fucking people who like to drink.

1000
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:36.520
I met a couple of hunters.
I met a couple of dancers.
I met you.

1001
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:41.430
I met a,
you know,
a nice mix of people as I'm a fucking weird dude man.

1002
01:02:41.431 --> 01:02:44.430
I don't like people before I get on stage,
like I don't want to see him.

1003
01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:47.610
I don't see anybody in the fucking crowd.
But the second the show's over,

1004
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:49.910
if somebody is cool,
I,

1005
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.170
I that's the part of the show I I enjoy and I become like this fucking uh,

1006
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:58.560
Charlie rose and I just started interviewing people.
You know.

1007
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:02.910
What's it like to shoot a pheasant in the face?
Huh?
What's that like?
You know,

1008
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:07.740
do you got a little fucking couple of pieces of wood that you rubbed together

1009
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:12.570
and somehow it sounds like a pheasant going a Eddie come on over here,
you know,

1010
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.870
or whatever fucking pheasants names are.
If you had a pet pheasant,

1011
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:19.440
what would you name it?
Huh?
Larry?
That'd be a great name for a pheasant.

1012
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.460
Has to be funny if you had it right.
And people looking at it like,
oh my God,

1013
01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:26.340
is it a pheasant?
Like Larry,
get the fuck off of that thing.

1014
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:28.320
Actually got off of it,
you know,

1015
01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:31.800
and then he got on a late night talk show and then you went out there and then

1016
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:32.610
it didn't work.

1017
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:36.480
And then the host sorta mugged about how it didn't work and then maybe takes a

1018
01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.980
turn on his fucking wingtip shoe and 50 years later it's part of the greatest

1019
01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:43.650
hits DVD,
you know?

1020
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:46.860
And little did you know that that was the pinnacle of your life is a fucking

1021
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:50.190
zookeeper.
That one moment you thought it was going to keep happening?
No.

1022
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.210
One episode,

1023
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:56.340
one episode you would never asked back because your animal shit on the fucking

1024
01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.570
host shoe
wasn't supposed to do that.
It didn't do,

1025
01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:04.710
they didn't do it in the rehearsals.
All right,

1026
01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:06.980
how the fuck am I going to maneuver this here?

1027
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:09.750
All the rattling in the background.
I couldn't move my mixer or you know,

1028
01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:13.740
I feel right now I feel like the fucking unit Obama all this,
Goddamn,

1029
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.940
was he anti-technology though?
I don't know if he was anti or pro at all.

1030
01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:22.410
I know he was definitely fucking alone and was a paranoid son of a bitch.

1031
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:32.640
My back.
There we go.
You guys get nervous there for a second.

1032
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.020
What the fuck does too many fucking cords here.

1033
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.150
I'm going to go back to this cell phone.

1034
01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:43.900
I'm not on holding my fucking laptop like a Goddamn,
you know,
like,

1035
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:46.230
you know,
servants used to hand shit to kings.

1036
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:49.230
Would they put something on a pillow and then they had the little hands

1037
01:04:49.231 --> 01:04:51.450
underneath it?
That's the way I'm holding it.
I'll tell you what,

1038
01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:54.750
can I paint a fucking picture?
Can I paint a goddamn picture?
Let me,

1039
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:57.720
let me adjust the microphone.
I want to tell you about my microphone.
By the way,

1040
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:02.040
do you remember back in the 1970s,
you know,
nowadays,

1041
01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:05.780
whenever somebody has a Mike,
uh,
and they have like a little filter on that,

1042
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:07.500
a filter or whatever,
I don't know,
the technical,
you know,

1043
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:11.220
little spongy thing that you stick on there so it doesn't pop or if there's some

1044
01:05:11.221 --> 01:05:15.480
sort of wind,
you know,
nowadays that just black and it just looks like a,

1045
01:05:15.481 --> 01:05:18.280
you know,
fucking giant just sitting there.
Right.

1046
01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:23.170
And something that they can put on TV,
you know.
But back in the day,
man,
the 70s,

1047
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.270
you know,

1048
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:30.010
when people were buying weed by the fucking garbage bag full and uh,

1049
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.560
you know,
the 70s were colorful man,
you fucking day just start it off.

1050
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.394
You know,

1051
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:40.600
they had that crazy cereal that they used to have somebody brought up booberry

1052
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:45.610
or count Chocula and Franken Berry and I was in the cereal aisle.
Uh,
you know,

1053
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:47.680
the other day when I,
when I went to trader Joe's,

1054
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:52.000
when I was going to have a healthy week before I down five bottles of whiskey on

1055
01:05:52.001 --> 01:05:53.470
the worst drunk too.
I'm one of those guys,

1056
01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:56.260
I fucking call up people and start telling him I love him,
you know,

1057
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.500
and one of those guys,
you know,
I,

1058
01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:03.070
I do everything but end up in the drunk tank on the fucking Andy Griffith show

1059
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:06.400
him such an old school drunk.
But I'm not an angry guy when I get drunk.

1060
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.740
I'm really not.
I'm actually pleasant and I'm able to emote.

1061
01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:15.210
Is that why you do it,
Bill?
I don't fucking know.
Oh,
I know.
It was,

1062
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.060
it makes me feel like shit.
The fuck was I just talking about,
oh,

1063
01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:21.190
how coat color for the 70s where yeah.

1064
01:06:21.191 --> 01:06:26.191
You'd start off with that fucking cereal that they had and uh,

1065
01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.020
and with one of the worst sentences ever.
Yeah.

1066
01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:36.250
He started off with that cereal that they had.
Oh,
there you go,
Bill.

1067
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:38.380
It's a great way to,
to fucking start it off,
right.

1068
01:06:38.381 --> 01:06:41.860
If you're patting yourself on the back about how you could paint a visual,

1069
01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.840
you know,
it's funny,
I've headphones on right now.

1070
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:47.680
I have no idea how loud I'm talking and I'm sure that there is somebody on the

1071
01:06:47.681 --> 01:06:52.630
other side of this wall that is contemplating calling the front desk,

1072
01:06:52.631 --> 01:06:54.880
but what they're listening to is so fucking bizarre.

1073
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.740
They haven't been able to tap out yet.
Um,
well let's Eric and bill.

1074
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.220
Maybe they're listening in your sound fucking annoying.
All right.
Whatever.

1075
01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.970
Stop Heckling yourself.
Get to the point.
Yeah,
you'd start off,
you eat tricks,

1076
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.780
you need booberry the shit literally changed the color of your milk,

1077
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:13.960
which is some really hacky comedy from fucking the 80s but I'm telling you,

1078
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:18.550
you had that shit going on honeycomb,
you know the,

1079
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.880
the fucking people were wearing polyester.

1080
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:25.180
I mean Shit was loud in the 70s you know,

1081
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:29.620
those plaid slacks,
people had slacks,
he had boots had set up the side.

1082
01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:34.480
They're all fucking shiny.
Women had like those,
those plastic looking purses.

1083
01:07:34.481 --> 01:07:37.990
It was fucking freaky.
It was weird.
Everything was like done.

1084
01:07:37.991 --> 01:07:40.810
Suddenly I think that the advertisers just like,
look,

1085
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:45.580
everybody's on drugs so we,
we really need to enhance their trip.

1086
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:48.850
So much shit in the 70s was like really done

1087
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:51.970
to like even like the fucking monkeys,

1088
01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:56.740
which I guess you know was that this was the late sixties I think it went to the

1089
01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.960
early seventies we were one when they used to fucking,
you know,

1090
01:07:58.961 --> 01:07:59.950
pretend to sing in,

1091
01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.960
pretend to play instruments at the end of the show there and they would,

1092
01:08:02.961 --> 01:08:07.360
they would cut to that little musical montage is and they'd always do like half

1093
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:11.050
the time they would do like those,
they'd put it in like a kaleidoscope.

1094
01:08:11.610 --> 01:08:14.920
So he had them actually in the middle and then like six of them like going

1095
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:19.910
around like a fucking that go fucking revolver aside.
I don't know what it was.

1096
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:25.190
And you're eating that cereal.
He just watching this shit.
Anyways,

1097
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.320
this all comes around to my microphone.

1098
01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:31.100
Back then you couldn't even watch like a sports show without sort of tripping,

1099
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:31.611
you know what I mean?

1100
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:35.870
Like they had ABC's wide world of sport and they had these fucking bright yellow

1101
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:39.920
sport coats on and they used to have these microphones and when they stood

1102
01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:44.060
outside,
the little spongy thing that they stuck on top wasn't black.

1103
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:47.300
It didn't blend in with the microphone.
There were these crazy colors.

1104
01:08:47.301 --> 01:08:50.870
And one that I always remember was there was always like bright orange.

1105
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.890
It made no fucking sense.
But as a kid I liked it.

1106
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:58.520
So whatever I bought a microphone in,
the guy goes,

1107
01:08:58.521 --> 01:09:03.140
what kind of wind screen do you want?
You know,
you want the standard black one?

1108
01:09:03.141 --> 01:09:05.780
I said,
fuck that.
I want that one.

1109
01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:10.781
Keith Jackson used to use when he do Monday night football way back in the day,

1110
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:15.140
or we do the college games.
Remember Keith Jackson?
Huh?
Hello again.

1111
01:09:15.141 --> 01:09:19.340
Everybody that says keep Jackson.
Remember that guy?
Alabama,

Crimson tide and I'm fucking wolverines I Michigan,

1113
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:27.440

Um,
anyways.
Yeah,
so that's what I got here.

1114
01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.380
That was a really long fucking way to go to explain that.

1115
01:09:30.381 --> 01:09:34.010
I put an orange spongy thing in the end of my fucking Mike and I'm a Jew.

1116
01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:36.770
I know I'm cursing a lot right now and I'm cursing.
I'm not cursing at you guys.

1117
01:09:36.771 --> 01:09:40.130
Okay?
Sometimes people get confused.
Stop cursing at me.

1118
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.490
I'm not cursing at you and cursing at my hangover because I described shit to

1119
01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:47.720
you.
All right?
Jesus Christ.
Look at this fucking fake wood in this desk.

1120
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.730
This is the kind of desk that you sit,

1121
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.290
you know that you sit at when you're like confessing to a murder.

1122
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:57.230
You know what I mean?
He just sitting in and trying to wear you down.

1123
01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:02.630
They bring in some food and I can like,
they're your friends.

1124
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.820
I was just watching those fucking cold case files,
man.
God Damn.

1125
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.910
Most things are creepy.
It is fucking creepy.

1126
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:15.230
Just watching the people when they come in and,
and they,
and they,
and they,

1127
01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:19.010
they get in question for the murder and they just sounded like,
you know,
regular,

1128
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:22.940
regular guys.
Where were you that night?
Oh,
you know,
I was home,
you know,

1129
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.640
watching a basketball game,
you know,
you're chilling out
at a p to

1130
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:34.290
find out he fucking hacks up 23 people.
Then when they,
when they,

1131
01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:36.970
when they admit it,
they're like,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
I did it.
You know,
they,

1132
01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:38.540
they found this one guy that,
that,
uh,

1133
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:42.450
who's that fucking guy that the green river,
I know,

1134
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.730
they always got to give them nicknames,

1135
01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.400
the fucking news so they can sell more papers.

1136
01:10:46.401 --> 01:10:48.830
They give them nicknames like they're going to the rose bowl or some shit,

1137
01:10:48.831 --> 01:10:53.210
you know,
crazy like Johnson,
he's killed 48 fucking people.

1138
01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:59.930
They call me ice iceman.
Um,
anyways,
so there,

1139
01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:02.450
there's one guy up in Seattle,
right?
He killed all these,

1140
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.990
all these women who was brutal and uh,
they picked the guy up.

1141
01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:08.120
He never been arrested before and they,
they,
they,

1142
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:11.990
they meet him outside of his job cause they put together a case.
Okay.

1143
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:14.130
He has no idea that they're onto them and they,
they,

1144
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:19.170
the cops come up to the guy and they say,
listen buddy,
uh,
where,
you know,

1145
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:22.170
fucking whatever the police officer's it to try to get a headache.

1146
01:11:22.171 --> 01:11:24.150
I don't know what the fuck they say.
You know,
they say,
hi,

1147
01:11:24.151 --> 01:11:27.300
we're cops and we're here to arrest you for the murder of four women.

1148
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:31.440
Now if you never been arrested before,
when your heart drop,
the guy just is like,

1149
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:35.610
he,
I guess evidently he just went,
okay.
Then they brought him down there,

1150
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:39.480
he confessed to that and he confessed to like fucking 60 other women that he had

1151
01:11:39.481 --> 01:11:43.010
killed.
So they bring this guy into,
uh,

1152
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.640
another room to talk to a,
to a psychologist,
you know,

1153
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:51.480
cause he wants to try to break them down so you can figure out so you can stop

1154
01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:55.890
these maniacs.
Right.
And He,
they asked the guy this question,
they said,
uh,

1155
01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.870
you know,
if you could,
um,

1156
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.050
you could pick out one thing about your personality that you feel is different

1157
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:09.150
from the average person walking down the street,
what would that be?

1158
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:14.580
And without missing a beat,
the guy said,
ah,
that,
that whole caring thing.

1159
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:23.520
Wow.
You know when you think you don't give a fuck Jesus Christ.

1160
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:28.350
Just regular.
Yeah.
The whole Karen,
that whole caring thing.
Yeah.

1161
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:31.560
I just don't seem to give a fuck.
It's weird.
You know?

1162
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.700
I don't know.
I hate watching that.
I don't know why I watch that show.

1163
01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:37.470
That show literally gives me nightmares.
You know what I mean?

1164
01:12:37.471 --> 01:12:40.050
You start thinking about what?
This is not funny.

1165
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.420
What the fuck am I talking about?
See,
this is what happens.

1166
01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:45.120
This is what happens when you go out boozing.
I,
you know what the sad thing is,

1167
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.420
is I know at some point,
at some point this weekend,

1168
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:53.100
I'm probably going to do this again,
but fortunately I'm in New York City,

1169
01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:55.980
so I want end up at a steak and shake.
I've never eaten there.

1170
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.380
I think I've made fun of that fucking place

1171
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:04.740
on these podcasts.
How would you rate,
how would you guys out there?
Huh?

1172
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.690
All my listeners out there.
Please tell me you listening.
Please tell me I'm not.

1173
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.231
I'm done.

1174
01:13:10.231 --> 01:13:15.231
Just sitting here baking under this fucking hotel lamp for nothing.

1175
01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.020
How would you rate the worst?
Your worst?

1176
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:24.690
Like a fast food,
you know what I mean?
Everybody,
you know,
no one wants to eat it,

1177
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:27.420
but we all eat it cause you know,
it tastes good.
Fucking tastes good.

1178
01:13:27.421 --> 01:13:29.400
But then there's,
there's certain ones,
either you had,

1179
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:34.470
either you had a bad experience or you,
uh,
just the look of it,
you know,

1180
01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.460
like got,
let's say for me like Taco Bell,
I just can't go in there.

1181
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.360
There's just something about the colors on the sign.
They,

1182
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:44.880
it just makes my stomach hurt.
You know,

1183
01:13:44.881 --> 01:13:48.540
you just get that awful feeling in your stomach.
You know,

1184
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:50.670
I fell the same way about that.
Like,
Arby's,

1185
01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:57.120
you've never fucked with Arby's
and Mcdonald's guy.
I'm old school.

1186
01:13:57.121 --> 01:14:01.200
I like Mcdonald's
in and outers this shit.

1187
01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.170
But you know,
I got a lot of memories as a kid at Mcdonald's.

1188
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:06.750
So I think that one's still wins even though in and out is even better.

1189
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:10.320
But there's just certain ones I won't even go into,
you know?
All right guys,

1190
01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:14.350
I'm fucking and fast.
Jesus Christ.
I need a fucking water or something.

1191
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.740
The hell that I do with that water didn't have water around here.

1192
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:21.940
Hang on a second.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

1193
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:24.250
Fucking water I should had last night.
All right,
let's,

1194
01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:27.160
let's get on with the questions here.
Um,
if you're new to my page,

1195
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:29.950
you probably think I'm out of my fucking mind and you would be right.

1196
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.210
I am out of my mind.
But you know what?
You know what?

1197
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:36.790
I don't have anything to say to that.
I am guilty as charged.

1198
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:41.530
What are you fucking perfect.
Why don't you go to the city to fucking www?

1199
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:44.170
I'm fucking perfect.com and go listen to that podcast.

1200
01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:49.300
I bet there's a lot of fucking lapse on that one.
You know?
Did they got a mixer?

1201
01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:53.110
I've got a fucking mixer.
Bitch.
You liked that shit.

1202
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:57.880
I'm learning a lot of computer stuff.
You know what?

1203
01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:01.360
How about you guys make me computer literate?
Can you do that for me?

1204
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:03.340
I'll start off with something really easy.

1205
01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.510
Something that really fucking annoys me on my computer.
And you know what?

1206
01:15:07.511 --> 01:15:08.880
Maybe someone else does.
This isn't,

1207
01:15:08.881 --> 01:15:12.700
maybe this annoys someone else who has a computer who also has a drinking

1208
01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:15.850
problem.
Okay.
And then,
uh,
you know,

1209
01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:18.670
I'll read how to do it and maybe I can help something,
another drunk out there.

1210
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.220
All right.
This is one of my problems that I have

1211
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:25.780
when I go to you when I go into to apple works,
right?

1212
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:30.670
The text is so fucking small.
I don't understand it.
It's set.

1213
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.570
I know how to change it,
but I gotta change it every time.
All right.

1214
01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:38.410
Right now it's stuck on 12.
Okay.

1215
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.760
Which is basically squint size and you know,

1216
01:15:42.761 --> 01:15:47.310
when I copy and paste your guys' emails into my fucking thing,
it's,
it,
it,

1217
01:15:47.311 --> 01:15:50.230
it makes it smaller.
I don't know what it's doing.
I wanted at 18,

1218
01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.480
I want the default set at 18.
How the fuck do I do that in apple works?

1219
01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.390
I've got a brand new MAC book.
I want to learn how to do that.
Okay.

1220
01:15:58.391 --> 01:16:02.350
I want to learn some shit.
You know,
I know how to upload.

1221
01:16:02.351 --> 01:16:06.010
I know how to do this now.
Look at me.
I don't know how to Upload Shit.

1222
01:16:06.011 --> 01:16:08.800
I'll turn it into a fucking MP3.
I'll send it right to you.

1223
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.660
I know how to do that now.
I feel great.

1224
01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:14.500
It's my new opening line when I hit on chicks in the road.

1225
01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.540
You know what's up,
sweetie?
How are you doing?
You'd like to show you,
you know,

1226
01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:24.430
I can also upload audio files and turn them into an MP.
Three.
Huh?

1227
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:30.220
Put it on a desktop.
I'll fucking drag it right over there.
Same Way.

1228
01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:33.100
I'm going to drag you across the fucking carpet in my Kotel.

1229
01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:37.960
What the fuck is that?
All right.
Can somebody teach me how to do that,
please?

1230
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:42.170
Okay,
and let's get on with the podcast here.
You know what the problem is?

1231
01:16:42.171 --> 01:16:44.320
Is this not enough fucking room here?
Oh,
I got it.

1232
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.700
Why don't I just move this dude,

1233
01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:49.900
I even have a little stand here for my microphone.
I have a little fucking stand.

1234
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.020
This is like a,
I don't know.

1235
01:16:53.021 --> 01:16:57.130
This is one of these like really nerdy things that if you start when you're 18

1236
01:16:57.370 --> 01:17:01.660
by the time you're 30 you're famous and you're not a nerd anymore.

1237
01:17:01.661 --> 01:17:05.980
Like chicks one,
fuck you had sun,
it's unreal.
But when you start this at 40,

1238
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.920
it's just pathetic and sad.
Okay,
here we go.

1239
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:13.910
We're going to go to a,
I already did the underrated.
So why don't I do over it?

1240
01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.430
Um,
I know this is really,
this is really coming off grumpy.
I understand.

1241
01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:22.460
But whatever,
you know,
last week I was pissed.

1242
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:27.170
This week on grumpy.
You know what I'm doing for a happy one.
How about next week?

1243
01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.240
Okay,
next week I'll be all bubbly.

1244
01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:34.790
I won't because I'll be flying across this country.
Oh man,
that's gonna suck.

1245
01:17:34.791 --> 01:17:36.110
Let's not think about that.

1246
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:39.320
Do you know like I literally fall asleep on the plane.

1247
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:43.190
I've flown across this country so many fucking times that I can literally look

1248
01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:47.720
down and pretty much guess what stayed.
I'm over,
you know,

1249
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:53.030
as a passenger I can do that.
Why these levels so low but the fuck is going on.

1250
01:17:53.031 --> 01:17:57.230
There we go.
Might not talking into this thing.
Hello.
Test.
There we go.

1251
01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:02.030
You know what I mean?
I can look out,
I can tell,
you know,

1252
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:03.920
pretty good.
I mean,
Rick.

1253
01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:05.973
<v 9>Yeah,</v>

1254
01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:08.500
<v 6>I dunno.
Wait a minute.
What the fuck am I bragging about?
What?</v>

1255
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:13.030
Southwest is a desert.
You get into Colorado,
you've got the mountains,

1256
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.870
starts getting flat.
You're like,
all right,
this is Nebraska,
Kansas.

1257
01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:21.580
Maybe we were in Iowa.
You start seeing more lights.
You moving towards fucking

1258
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:27.940
into Illinois.
Right?
And that all works.
I don't fucking know.

1259
01:18:27.941 --> 01:18:32.020
Like I actually like I recognize like lakes now.

1260
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:36.860
You know I can look down on my watch.
Ah,
you know what?
It's taken this long.

1261
01:18:36.861 --> 01:18:40.940
We're right about here and we should be seeing Cleveland comment by there.
It is.

1262
01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:44.900
There it is.
I look down.
Sometimes we'll look at fucking stadiums.

1263
01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.420
So all my fucking life is now.

1264
01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:53.470
If I could be outside the plane and look at my stupid roundhead looking out of

1265
01:18:53.471 --> 01:18:56.860
that little oval fucking window.
This is what I signed up for.

1266
01:18:58.630 --> 01:19:02.170
This is how fucking hung over I am.
I'm actually bitching that I'm a comedian.

1267
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.580
Something that I wanted to do something that I decided to do.
All right.

1268
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:10.410
Jesus Christ.
There was a way for you guys to email me a fucking tampon.

1269
01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.400
I think I get like 9 million this week.
All right.
Uh,
here we go.

1270
01:19:14.401 --> 01:19:17.370
Let's read the overrate it.
All right.
Let's get into your thoughts.

1271
01:19:17.371 --> 01:19:20.490
I think you've heard enough from me for one week.
All right.
Overrated bill.

1272
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.350
All right.
Build a,
I think this is overrated.

1273
01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:25.290
A lot of people don't talk about this.
This is coming from a woman.
She says,

1274
01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:28.590
male strippers are overrated.
She said,

1275
01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:32.730
especially when they are hired a for a Bachelorette party.

1276
01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:36.360
Is it me or does,
uh,
uh,
Jesus Christ,

1277
01:19:36.361 --> 01:19:38.850
I can't read when I'm fucking not hung over.
She goes,

1278
01:19:38.851 --> 01:19:43.020
is it me or does anyone else think this is the stupidest waste of 125 bucks

1279
01:19:43.021 --> 01:19:46.920
they've ever seen?
You guys get strippers for 125 bucks?
Jesus.

1280
01:19:46.921 --> 01:19:50.580
Is there anything that sucks about being a woman?
Yeah.
Given birth periods.

1281
01:19:50.581 --> 01:19:54.060
All right.
You're right.
You're right.
Sorry.
Um,
yeah.
Okay.
Name was,

1282
01:19:54.061 --> 01:19:56.460
let me get back to this.
Yeah,
the guys are all,

1283
01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:59.880
the guys were all muscled up and everything,
but to be honest,

1284
01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:04.530
when you see women looking at male strippers and they're hooting and hollering

1285
01:20:04.531 --> 01:20:06.750
and laughing and laughing it up with their,

1286
01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:10.650
they're actually laughing at the stripper.
Yes,

1287
01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.680
it is true that they are likely some women who enjoy it and thinking this guy

1288
01:20:16.201 --> 01:20:17.430
would probably be awesome in bed,

1289
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:22.431
but 95% of women are hysterically laughing at the Ridiculous Man All oiled up in

1290
01:20:23.221 --> 01:20:28.221
his g string with his stupid little boombox playing NXS what you need,

1291
01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.480
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,
she just,
there you go.
She's painting a picture there.

1292
01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:38.770
That's what you need and a good story and you need a narrator who's not fucking

1293
01:20:38.771 --> 01:20:41.740
grumpy and hung over anyways,
playing what you need.

1294
01:20:41.741 --> 01:20:45.640
Gyrating around the living room and dry humping.
Dad's lazy boy.

1295
01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.970
You know what?
Jesus Christ,
uh,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1296
01:20:51.971 --> 01:20:54.760
This is really fucking long.
Let me get to the point here.
She says,
women,

1297
01:20:54.761 --> 01:20:59.140
what women want is women want a man who was a man,

1298
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:01.930
kills spiders,
drink beer,
et cetera.

1299
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:06.990
None of us would picture our man acting like a sex machine with a wax chess

1300
01:21:07.311 --> 01:21:09.580
dancing in front of a group of housewives.

1301
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.000
A man will offer my girl a man will offer,

1302
01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:16.840
my girlfriend is a stripper and he knows his buddies will congratulate them like

1303
01:21:16.841 --> 01:21:18.850
God,
Dude,
you go friends and strip it.
That's awesome.

1304
01:21:19.330 --> 01:21:22.390
A woman would never offer the same information.
Why?

1305
01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:27.100
Because she knows the response from other woman would be a snicker and a yikes.

1306
01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:30.130
Gee,
I'm so sorry.
Look,
is that true?

1307
01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.520
The women really not like don't just like cougars,

1308
01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:36.720
don't they like male strippers?
You know?

1309
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.010
If you want to know what it's like to be a guy,
be a woman in your,

1310
01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:44.770
as far as like our sex drive,
you know I,

1311
01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.180
I think maybe a woman once you're in your forties at that time I didn't know

1312
01:21:48.181 --> 01:21:49.620
what the fuck point I'm trying to make there.

1313
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:55.130
I just know that like older women act like the same level of retarded.

1314
01:21:55.591 --> 01:21:59.880
That guys act like
our entire fucking wise.

1315
01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:02.400
When they start to get older.
I don't know what it is.
I guess it's safe.

1316
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:03.660
They finally don't give a shit.

1317
01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:07.560
And they could admit that they like cock or they like sex,
you know,

1318
01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:09.780
cause before they have to be like,
well,
you know,

1319
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:13.770
it's just for procreation or I just like my boyfriend's cock.

1320
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:18.420
I don't have any other fucking fantasies,
you know?
Whereas guys,

1321
01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:20.190
we just get,
we could just get to be pigs.

1322
01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:24.360
We just get to be the God pigs that we are.
But you know what?

1323
01:22:24.361 --> 01:22:27.060
You get to cry at movies and get that shit out.
I get to hold it in.

1324
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.970
You know what?
There was a rough one was that Harvey milk movie.

1325
01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.310
The amount of Shit I had to think about,

1326
01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:35.340
so I wouldn't tear up there in that movie just so I wouldn't be failing.

1327
01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:39.660
You know,
as a guy,
you can't fucking cry.
So I got to sit there and be like,

1328
01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:41.100
you know,
he's,
he's going through some shit.

1329
01:22:42.690 --> 01:22:47.250
I know everyone was getting all sad when a,
you know,
when he gets whacked there,

1330
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.630
you know.
So in order to,
not to get emotional myself,
I just thought,

1331
01:22:51.631 --> 01:22:53.910
you know what,
if someone just came over and just kicked him right in the balls

1332
01:22:56.970 --> 01:23:01.260
and I just started laughing,
you know,
that's what it is.

1333
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:06.610
That's what comedy is.
It's to stop from crying.
All right.

1334
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:11.530
Um,
number two.
Oh,
this is,
oh my God,
this,

1335
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.470
some New Yorkers aren't gonna like this one.
This is another thing that she says,

1336
01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.740
oh,
is overrated is underrated.

1337
01:23:17.741 --> 01:23:21.670
Actually a two run homer in the bottom of the ninth,

1338
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.490
ninth after Mary off of Marianna Rivera.

1339
01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:29.800
And I could've fucking read that better.
Yeah,
the red sox swept the Yankees.
Man.

1340
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.770
This fucking unbelievable.
There'll be back.
This shit always happens.

1341
01:23:32.771 --> 01:23:36.620
One team always jumps out in front of the other team,
right?
And then we

1342
01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.930
<v 10>do,
we fucking own you guys.
You feel good on you.
Good.</v>

1343
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:42.390
<v 6>And then they literally almost like it's fixed.
Now.</v>

1344
01:23:42.391 --> 01:23:47.250
The Yankees will sweep us down there and we'll play each other like 12 times or

1345
01:23:47.251 --> 01:23:50.760
13 times and someone will win when it fucking seven to six.

1346
01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.800
It's a Goddamn business people.
Okay.
There's no fucking Santa Claus Hunter.

1347
01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:59.070
I don't buy it.
Um,
and we stole home plate and you know,

1348
01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:01.740
how the fuck does that happen?
$200 million team.
You know something.

1349
01:24:01.741 --> 01:24:03.060
You realize the red sox sale,

1350
01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.990
they're only there number four this year as far as money spent.
Oh yeah.

1351
01:24:06.991 --> 01:24:08.610
A lot of you fuckers didn't know that.
Did you?

1352
01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:15.090
Yankee spent 200 million then it's the mets then I believe the cubs and then us.

1353
01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.490
We're 122 million.
Isn't that great?

1354
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:19.890
Now we're going to act like where some little fucking starving panty,

1355
01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.200
little Pansy fucking team
Yankee did ruin in baseball.

1356
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.130
Um,
who gives a fuck?
I'll tell you what's funny is that the,

1357
01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:34.480
the the fuck did I just do there?
I'm going to sit on my computer.
All right,

1358
01:24:34.481 --> 01:24:37.140
let's let you know what I'm really starting to feel like I'm losing the momentum

1359
01:24:37.141 --> 01:24:40.980
of this 31 minutes.
31 hung over minutes.
Dude.
I'm going to tell you right now,

1360
01:24:40.981 --> 01:24:42.360
this is feeling like four hours.

1361
01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:45.110
I feel like I'm doing a fucking telethon right now.
Uh,

1362
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:49.900
let's get to the questions for the week.
I got a,
I got one here.
Um,

1363
01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:53.820
am I the only one who thinks Terry Francona is glasses make him look like a

1364
01:24:53.821 --> 01:24:58.200
cancer stricken Mrs Claus,
he's the,
he's the,
uh,

1365
01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:02.550
he's the manager of the red sox.
I did see him.
Yeah.

1366
01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.480
Those days there are definitely a,
he looks like he should be at the very least,

1367
01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.440
uh,
you know,
going out caroling or something.

1368
01:25:10.770 --> 01:25:15.300
Reading the night before Christmas.
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.
You know,

1369
01:25:15.301 --> 01:25:18.840
I talked a lot about sports last week and a couple of people really got pissed

1370
01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:21.840
just talking about how dumb they are.
Some guys sense this,

1371
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.890
this huge fucking rant about saying how,
you know,

1372
01:25:25.891 --> 01:25:29.010
being into a sports team is almost as dumb as patriotism.

1373
01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.380
I know the point you're trying to make.
You know what I mean?
I get it.

1374
01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:37.410
You know,
I know what you're saying,
but you know what the fuck dude.
I mean,

1375
01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:40.110
I've done like almost two years of these things.

1376
01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:45.120
Eventually sports was going to come up that we always have to talk about what

1377
01:25:45.121 --> 01:25:48.600
you want to talk about.
This guy was really,
I dunno.

1378
01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:51.210
Sometimes I don't know if people are going for Douche bag of the week.

1379
01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:53.490
I don't know what do I have anything else here?

1380
01:25:53.491 --> 01:25:57.780
I don't think I have anything else.
Oh,
Bill,
I need some advice.
All right,

1381
01:25:57.781 --> 01:26:00.420
here's another guy obviously had some Jamison.
Listen to this shit.

1382
01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:04.520
This is his question.
Hey Bill,
big fan bombed right now.

1383
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.490
I didn't get that for a second.
I thought like he said,

1384
01:26:07.491 --> 01:26:09.470
big fan and he meant like that line bomb.

1385
01:26:09.471 --> 01:26:13.610
But evidently he means he shit faced or is the worst speller anywhere in the

1386
01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:16.880
world.
Here we go.
It starts off.
It says,
anyways,

1387
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:20.420
I need some objective viewpoint.

1388
01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:22.670
Me and this hot chick,

1389
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:28.270
I'm a big old ugly rugby player recently started hanging out.

1390
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:32.030
He misspelled that and we like,
no,
he,

1391
01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.490
he put the e at the beginning of each.
We like each a lot.

1392
01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:43.210
Jesus Christ.
Dude recently started hanging out.
We'd like each other a lot.

1393
01:26:43.211 --> 01:26:48.190
My problem.
She used to date a black guy.
I have black friends.

1394
01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.420
My buddies will tear me apart.
Thoughts,
advice.

1395
01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:58.210
Thanks John.
Well,
John,
um,

1396
01:26:58.211 --> 01:27:01.730
my thoughts are you're pretty fucking shit faced when you,
uh,

1397
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:02.860
when you sent that email,

1398
01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.510
that's my thoughts cause the rest of it makes no sense.

1399
01:27:07.511 --> 01:27:10.630
She used to date a black guy.
Okay.
You have black friends.

1400
01:27:10.631 --> 01:27:12.970
Is that supposed to establish that you're not racist?

1401
01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.870
My buddies will tear me apart
like what?

1402
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:21.890
They're going to in a good natured way rib you that your deck isn't going to be

1403
01:27:21.891 --> 01:27:25.340
as big.
I don't know what you're trying to say here.
Tell you what,

1404
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:26.570
why don't you fucking,
you know,

1405
01:27:26.571 --> 01:27:29.840
don't email me now cause I know you're feeling the way I'm feeling,
but you know,

1406
01:27:29.841 --> 01:27:34.460
sober up.
Try to clean that up.
You know,
I think maybe you got something there.

1407
01:27:34.461 --> 01:27:38.810
Send me a second draft.
I Dunno what the fuck that means.

1408
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.430
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1409
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:43.010
<v 6>She used to date a black guy.
How to fuck would they know</v>

1410
01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.430
you have black friends?
My Body will tell you where your black friends.

1411
01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:49.480
Do they know this guy?

1412
01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:50.520
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:53.610
<v 6>Did she use to date one of the,
one of your friends who's black?</v>

1414
01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:58.530
That's just a weird statement.
I have black friends.
Do you have black friends?

1415
01:27:58.531 --> 01:27:59.700
Sure.
We all do.

1416
01:28:00.810 --> 01:28:03.450
Like you're trying to learn yourself some sort of credit credibility.

1417
01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.570
The fuck does that make anyways?
You know,
how many friends do I have?

1418
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:15.200
Joe Derosa,
he's half a Gypson so that takes care of the,
uh,

1419
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.240
does that take care of Arabs?
Are Egyptians considered air?

1420
01:28:18.241 --> 01:28:21.530
I know what the fuck Arabs are.
I don't even know.
I don't fucking know.
I can't,

1421
01:28:21.531 --> 01:28:25.080
I know,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

1422
01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.370
Is being an innocent one question I've always is being Jewish,
is that,
oh,
I know.

1423
01:28:29.371 --> 01:28:31.920
It's a religion.
Is it a,
is it a race?

1424
01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:33.090
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:37.750
<v 6>It's not a race.
Right?
I don't want to tie,
a long time ago,
I,
I,</v>

1426
01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.680
I was in high school and one of my friends was Jewish.
Right?

1427
01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:43.110
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1428
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:47.890
<v 6>And uh,
I said to him,
I said,
what are you,
what are you,
Italian?</v>

1429
01:28:48.090 --> 01:28:49.020
He goes,
no,
I'm Jewish.

1430
01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.200
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.590
<v 6>And I,
I could tell I offended him.
So I didn't do a followup question,</v>

1432
01:28:53.591 --> 01:28:57.280
but in my head I'm going,
okay,
Italian is a race.
I thought Jewish was a religion.

1433
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:58.510
I know Jewish is a religion.

1434
01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.420
You know that that would make any fucking sense.
I don't fucking know.
Let's,

1435
01:29:03.450 --> 01:29:04.590
let's read a revenge story.

1436
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:09.510
Let's read a revenge story and let's fucking wrap up this podcast.

1437
01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:13.620
This is going to be a shorter one.
This is the hangover version.
Oh,

1438
01:29:13.621 --> 01:29:17.450
here's something else I came up with is I am actually contributing underrated.

1439
01:29:17.451 --> 01:29:21.390
You know it's underrated free Internet in the hotels.
God Damn.
And I liked that,

1440
01:29:22.730 --> 01:29:25.590
that wrote all that other shit in anger,
so let's not read that.
All right,

1441
01:29:25.591 --> 01:29:25.951
here's him.

1442
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:30.750
Here's a big long revenge story to end the podcast this week and let me know.

1443
01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.010
Got what you guys think about this sign.

1444
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:34.440
I know I've kind of been turned in my head a little bit and I got this Mike like

1445
01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.460
stationaries that affecting the sound cause God knows I'm not going to go back

1446
01:29:38.461 --> 01:29:42.540
and listen to all this shit.
I usually listen to them but not this week,
man.

1447
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:45.450
Not this week.
It's been up for a fucking week and on with to tell you,
you know,

1448
01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:48.210
it's one of these times,
so it's great.
I don't have a kid,
you know,

1449
01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.790
because I would have no patience for them.

1450
01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.580
I know it's a new bit I've been working on in my act,

1451
01:29:53.890 --> 01:29:57.020
talking about how much I like,
uh,
I like kids when they're,

1452
01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.430
I like kids the same way.
Like I like dogs.
I like,

1453
01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:02.520
I like them when they're puppies and then full of life,
you know?

1454
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:05.370
And once they get a little bit older and stubborn,
they think they know shit.

1455
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:09.690
It's just,
it's fucking,
there are knowing,
you know,
I like kids like,
uh,

1456
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.930
your fucking cracks me up.
I saw this kid the other day,

1457
01:30:12.931 --> 01:30:16.260
this kid was like two years old,
right.
You know,
it's funny about toddlers,
right?

1458
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.970
How they did,
I talked about this already,
how they got their little fucking,

1459
01:30:20.971 --> 01:30:24.720
they go,
they already have a beer belly and they never even drank.
They look,

1460
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:26.550
you know,
look,
these little fucking truckers,

1461
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:34.400
it always is just fucking makes me toddlers fucking beer bellies just fucking

1462
01:30:34.621 --> 01:30:37.320
make me laugh every time I say,
oh,
you know,

1463
01:30:37.321 --> 01:30:40.050
it's because they're not self conscious about their bodies.

1464
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:41.460
They don't give a fuck.

1465
01:30:41.461 --> 01:30:45.720
So they just got it hanging out there like some fucking drunken slob at a

1466
01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:49.010
barbecue.
You know,
they just,

1467
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:52.830
it's just funny to me.
They look like they've already fell.

1468
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:57.390
They fucked up in life.
You know,
like they're gambling,

1469
01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:02.010
they're eating the wrong food.
I don't know.
Why do they have those fat bellies?

1470
01:31:02.970 --> 01:31:07.200
Jesus Christ.
You're eating mush in milk.
You'd the of the first,

1471
01:31:08.150 --> 01:31:08.983
I don't know.

1472
01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:12.960
Why don't I just admit I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about sometimes

1473
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:17.910
and literally sweating right now because of a lamp.
That's how fucking hung over.

1474
01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:22.850
I am.
Okay.
Here we go.
You know something,
I'll say,
hey,
I met,

1475
01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:25.350
this is something I've been doing.
I've been,
I've been trying to eat,
you know,

1476
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:30.130
one just veggie meal a day,
you know,
to then I can make up for the fucking oxen.

1477
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.620
Then I'm going to eat later on that night.

1478
01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:36.150
Or evidently the fucking steak and shake that I'm going to eat.
And uh,
you know,

1479
01:31:36.151 --> 01:31:39.360
I can't stand about those fucking veggie meals.
I ordered this Veggie meal,
right?

1480
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.340
I ordered a,
uh,
uh,

1481
01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.570
some sort of fucking horrific Veggie,
a wrap,

1482
01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.700
which really sucked because they grilled the vegetables.
You know,

1483
01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:54.330
like when you go beyond where they stopped becoming mushy.

1484
01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.780
[inaudible] uh,
I can't even say what it sounds like.
What it,

1485
01:31:57.950 --> 01:32:01.390
what it tasted like because it's gonna make me fucking gag here,
but you know,

1486
01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:04.810
it just,
I'm going to do it.
You know what?
If you're squeamish,

1487
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:08.120
cover your fucking ears right now.
You know what it tastes like when,

1488
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:12.660
when they over steam vegetables or they fucking,
um,

1489
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.910
over grill.
I don't know what it gets.
All squishy and mushy.

1490
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:20.350
It tastes like it's preached,
chewed.
Just pausing right now,

1491
01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:24.310
waiting for the groans.
People thrown their headphones off.

1492
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.160
All you people on elliptical,
talented.
You just grown.

1493
01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:32.980
Do they have the fat Harry Fuck next to you.

1494
01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:37.690
Start looking at you wondering what you're listening to.
Um,

1495
01:32:38.630 --> 01:32:43.060
this is what I hate.
You're Veggie wrap.
All right.
And they go one veggie wrap.

1496
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:47.260
I ordered some soup,
like an old fucking Jewish man in Manhattan,
right?

1497
01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:52.180
And then what happens?
They bring it to me and this,

1498
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:56.950
they got French fries on the side.
It's like,
can't you see?
I'm trying,

1499
01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:02.290
I'm trying to get in shape.
I understand it's a French fries or potato.
It's a,

1500
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.360
it's a vegetable.
I get it.
What the fuck?

1501
01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:07.400
It's like when you go to the cheesecake factory,

1502
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:11.680
you order a salad and then they go,
would you like to third?
It's like,

1503
01:33:11.681 --> 01:33:13.360
do you not get the fucking theme here lady?

1504
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:15.160
Did you not see what I'm trying to do?

1505
01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.430
Do you see my bloated alcohol infused phase two?

1506
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:22.940
You understand what I'm trying to do here?
Actually,
you know,

1507
01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:26.550
it's not even fair cause I actually talked to one of those,
uh,
cheesecake.

1508
01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:31.330
I think I was making fun of the cheesecake factory and now my act and um,

1509
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:35.440
they're actually was,
there was a waitress in the crowd as always.

1510
01:33:35.441 --> 01:33:38.950
I always end up shitting on something and then someone from the crowd is like,

1511
01:33:38.951 --> 01:33:40.660
Hey,
I do that.
What the fuck?

1512
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:45.160
So it was this cheesecake factory waitress and she came up to me and she said,

1513
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:49.760
uh,
she goes,
actually,
they make us do that.
We have to do that.
If we don't do it,

1514
01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:52.540
we get fired.
Really?

1515
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.060
Is that what it's come down to?

1516
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.260
That that's where the decisions in your life led you?

1517
01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:02.620
That you have a job that if you don't ask people for cake,

1518
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:07.600
which is usually a nice fucking thing to do.
If you don't do it,
you get fired.

1519
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:12.610
They have a gun to your fucking head to basically have your job,

1520
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:17.290
to try to make people become diabetics.
Is that what's going on?

1521
01:34:17.530 --> 01:34:20.500
Is that what happened in your life because you sucked at something in school?

1522
01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:25.690
You know?
I don't fucking know.
All right,
let's get on with a revenge story.

1523
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:29.520
I am fucking,
I know why I shut off the air conditioners.

1524
01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:31.090
Anybody else just hate air conditioning.

1525
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.470
I don't mind air conditioning when it's 9,000 degrees out,
but when it's fucking,

1526
01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.260
you know,
it's like,
I don't know what it is.
It's like 65 degrees out,

1527
01:34:41.261 --> 01:34:45.040
70 72 and they got the air conditioning on.
It's like,

1528
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:48.330
are you trying to give me pneumonia?
Huh?

1529
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:51.550
Is that what the fuck you're trying to do?
Jesus Christ.
Am I in a mood?
Hey,

1530
01:34:51.551 --> 01:34:55.360
what do you guys think about that?
Swine flu?
You know,

1531
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:59.360
this might be a little comfort,
controversial,
but I'm kind of all for it.

1532
01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:06.100
I think this is another time where where were getting in the way of nature

1533
01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:12.580
running it's course nature is trying to kill off us.

1534
01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:17.510
Not all of us,
but some of us,
so that you know,

1535
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.330
there's no traffic.
You know what I mean?

1536
01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:27.250
It's like the forest fire.
It's a rebirth.
You know,
you burn it down.

1537
01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:30.550
Some animals die,
some trees die.
You get rid of all the brush.

1538
01:35:30.551 --> 01:35:34.960
It's like a spring cleaning.
That's all a plague is.
It's just that we,
you know,

1539
01:35:35.050 --> 01:35:36.820
you don't want any loved ones to die

1540
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.510
plagues and I'll tell you about plagues that there are really,
uh,

1541
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:44.990
they're fascinating.
Like they're,
they're putting out all these stats.

1542
01:35:44.991 --> 01:35:47.600
You know what?
Fuck this revenge story.
Let me go on the Internet here.
Let me,

1543
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:52.880
let me,
uh,
let me restart Firefox.
Now.
What is your fucking problem?

1544
01:35:52.881 --> 01:35:56.690
I never stopped it.
I'm in the middle of a podcast.

1545
01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:58.630
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1546
01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:01.520
<v 6>Got Damn.
These fucking computers.
What do they do?
This shit to me.
Come on,</v>

1547
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:06.050
let's go.
Anyways.
Yeah,
they were,
they were given up all,
all these,
uh,

1548
01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.510
all these statistics on a plagues and that type of stuff.
Evidently.

1549
01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:15.130
Do you need all the,
like,

1550
01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:20.130
like 675,000 people died in the United States in 1918 because of like an eye

1551
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:28.280
influenza,
whatever the fuck that is.
I ain't know what the fuck that is,

1552
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:30.800
but everybody got it and a whole bunch of people died

1553
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:33.770
and you know what's,
fuck it.

1554
01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:38.750
You know what's fucked up about that was thank God they did.
You know,

1555
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:41.150
cause if they didn't,
they all would've fucked

1556
01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.100
and they would have made more fucking people.

1557
01:36:44.230 --> 01:36:46.870
We might've been where we're at right now.
We might've been that,
you know,

1558
01:36:46.871 --> 01:36:51.610
15 years earlier.
I love,
I'd just throw numbers out,
man.

1559
01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:55.510
Like I'm a fucking scientist here or when I'm talking about,
hang on a second,

1560
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:58.150
let's look up plagues.

1561
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:03.700
It's going to get me on some sort of FBI list.
You know,

1562
01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:07.240
I need to do now is Google fucking anthrax?
There'll be a knock at my door.

1563
01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.270
And I really will be confessing at this fucking table here.

1564
01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:13.480
Great plagues

1565
01:37:15.730 --> 01:37:20.160
and history.
Okay.
That should be a great game show.
That's,

1566
01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:23.700
that'd be a fucking great game show.
Okay.
Is you tried it.

1567
01:37:23.701 --> 01:37:28.060
You start googling shit and whoever gets the FBI to come to your place first

1568
01:37:28.061 --> 01:37:32.170
wins and you can't do like easy shit like,
uh,

1569
01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:35.050
like he obviously any sort of creepy pedophile stuff cause that's just fucking

1570
01:37:35.051 --> 01:37:37.540
horrific and it's,
it's never funny is it?

1571
01:37:37.930 --> 01:37:40.750
Even though I joke about it on stage sometime.
All right.

1572
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:45.220
List of historical plagues.
Let's go to Wikipedia.

1573
01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:48.910
God knows they're always number one.
All right.

1574
01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:51.960
In human history,

1575
01:37:51.961 --> 01:37:56.400
the term plague refers to an epidemic disease causing a rate of mortality,

1576
01:37:57.210 --> 01:38:01.890
a pestilence and academic.
Daesh.
Shut the fuck up.
I want to,
I want stats.

1577
01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:07.260
Okay,
what do I gotta go to?
Mlb,
you got to go to CBS sports.com so I got to go.

1578
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:12.120
Ongoing danger.
Great plagues of Athens.

1579
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:17.760
Let's get to some recent ones here.
You know,
what do we got here?

1580
01:38:18.150 --> 01:38:20.280
Great plague of Iceland.
See what I'm saying?

1581
01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:23.970
Everywhere everybody had a plague in it.
Then the herd,

1582
01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:28.800
great plague of Portugal,
great plague of Russia,
great plague of Ireland,

1583
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.810
Scotland,
London plague,

1584
01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.690
just attack the fucking city for two years,

1585
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:40.860
1592 to 1594.
The Italian plague,

1586
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:45.690
everybody's fucking had one was the last time we had a plague.
You know,

1587
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.940
you just say that
you just can nip it in the butt with,
with,
with fucking,

1588
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:55.410
with the media.
They just,
they get it out there before it gets a chance to,
to,

1589
01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:00.220
to help with the traffic.
You know.
So I'm in New York City right now and they,

1590
01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:05.300
if they have a number of a number of cases out in Queens and uh,

1591
01:39:06.481 --> 01:39:08.910
you know,
the telling people how,
you know,
what's funny as hell,

1592
01:39:08.911 --> 01:39:11.730
they tell people that you use common sense.
If you feel like you get in the flu,

1593
01:39:11.731 --> 01:39:14.730
go to the hospital,
right?
So they,
they say,
you know,

1594
01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:19.050
if you sneeze or if you cough,
just cover your mouth.
Right?

1595
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:22.350
So half hour later,
I'm walking down the street,

1596
01:39:22.351 --> 01:39:24.870
walking down whatever fucking avenue here in New York,

1597
01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.800
and I see this kid on a bicycle and he proceeds to sneeze.

1598
01:39:28.801 --> 01:39:31.860
And he just turns his head and it looked like a fucking spit take.

1599
01:39:31.861 --> 01:39:36.120
And I just burst out laughing,
bursting out,
laughing,
you know,

1600
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:40.320
rather than being,
I'm like the exact opposite of a,
uh,

1601
01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:43.260
I was going to say a hemophiliac.
That's not what I'm trying to say.

1602
01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.110
What are those fucking people that always nervous that they got something,

1603
01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:49.170
a hysterectomy?
What does it,
I know it begins with an h.

1604
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:53.190
This always happens to me is what happens to my fucking brain as I knew the
word.

1605
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:58.260
And then my brain panics and all I'm left with is a letter,
uh,

1606
01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:01.050
fucking hemophilia.
I can't get that word out of my head,

1607
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:04.560
you know?
And I got to talk about something else.

1608
01:40:04.561 --> 01:40:06.690
Let's talk about the Jonas brothers comedy show.
Huh?

1609
01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:11.880
I think I speak for the group when I say it's about time,
you know,

1610
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:18.270
because their music is fucking hilarious.
And,
uh,
I,
I just,
you know,

1611
01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:22.530
fucking cons
is fucking business,
you know what I mean?

1612
01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.240
Really?
Is that,
is that what I should,
that's not what I should've done.

1613
01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:31.760
I should've gotten this business with fucking
three,

1614
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:35.790
three of my other brothers.
You know,
I'll play the drums.

1615
01:40:35.791 --> 01:40:39.150
You get a Ukulele and then you do this and then you'll get your own fucking

1616
01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:44.010
sketch show
sons of bitches.

1617
01:40:45.090 --> 01:40:47.790
Oh yeah,
I'm better.
I'm better about the fucking Jonas brothers.

1618
01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.870
I want some goddamn stats here on dead people.
All right?
I don't feel good.

1619
01:40:51.871 --> 01:40:55.270
So I gonna read about dead people.
Make all the black death.
Here we go.

1620
01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:56.830
Here we go.

1621
01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.240
The black death was one of the deadliest pandemics.

1622
01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:05.290
The fuck is a pandemic is an epidemic in a pandemic.

1623
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:10.590
A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that spreads through pop

1624
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:16.210
populations across their large region.
For instance,

1625
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:20.050
a continent or even worldwide.
Thank you,
Wikipedia.

1626
01:41:20.051 --> 01:41:21.550
So what the fuck is an epidemic

1627
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.140
is what happens and you just start fucking search and everything and then you

1628
01:41:26.141 --> 01:41:26.974
figure out what the hell

1629
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:33.010
an epidemic occurs when new cases of a certain disease occur in a given human

1630
01:41:33.011 --> 01:41:37.600
population during a given period.
Isn't it the same fucking thing?

1631
01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:42.660
Is that not the same fucking thing?
I close enough.
All right.

1632
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:45.390
You guys want to hear about the black death,
Huh?

1633
01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:47.470
When you're sitting there and your cubicle at work,

1634
01:41:47.471 --> 01:41:48.970
while God damn and I'm going to read you some shit.

1635
01:41:48.971 --> 01:41:51.400
God knows you can do this yourself.
It's right there.
And Wikipedia.

1636
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:56.080
The black death was according to chronicles,
characterized by Boobos,

1637
01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.340
a swelling in the lymph nodes.
I don't even know where the lymph nodes are.

1638
01:42:00.341 --> 01:42:04.810
I think there are they in your neck a hypochondriac.
Bam.
I got it.

1639
01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:07.870
All right.
See,
that's what I gotta do.
Just start talking about all this shit.

1640
01:42:08.710 --> 01:42:12.130
Then I don't know where I yell out the word and now I can't remember what I was

1641
01:42:12.131 --> 01:42:15.880
talking about.
Oh,
I know.
I'm the exact opposite of a hypochondriac where,
ah,

1642
01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.280
now that doesn't make sense.
HYPOCHONDRIAC is nervous.
I had to keep my,

1643
01:42:21.281 --> 01:42:22.114
I eat apples.

1644
01:42:22.630 --> 01:42:26.200
Scientists and historians at the beginning of the 20th century assume that the

1645
01:42:26.201 --> 01:42:31.120
black death was an outbreak of the same disease caused by the bacterium who

1646
01:42:31.121 --> 01:42:36.121
gives a fuck and spread by fleas with the help of of animals like the black rat.

1647
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.810
However,
this view has recently been,

1648
01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:48.490
gave me some stats for Christ's sake.
How many fucking people died?

1649
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:55.450
What?
Wait,
wait a minute.
The origins of the plagues does that,

1650
01:42:55.451 --> 01:42:56.320
did that to Deb.

1651
01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:01.600
Deep Debit to the total number of deaths worldwide is estimated at 75 million

1652
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:03.274
people,

1653
01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:08.950
approximately 25 to 50 million of which occurred in Europe.

1654
01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:15.120
The black death is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe's population.

1655
01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.480
Just stick about that people.

1656
01:43:19.481 --> 01:43:23.980
Six out of 10 automobiles that you'll see in front of you tonight as you try and

1657
01:43:23.981 --> 01:43:26.680
drive home would not fucking be there.

1658
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:29.560
And we already built the highways.

1659
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:36.430
It's a hole.
You know a ton of fucking car.
You know what I'm saying?

1660
01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:42.550
You know it's America,
man.
You want to fucking drive.
Put the top down.

1661
01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.270
Then I'm making Pontiac's anymore.
How fucking sad is that?

1662
01:43:47.710 --> 01:43:50.680
Let's think about some great Pontiac's.
That's where we're going to close out.

1663
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:54.200
After we talked about the epidemic,
we talked about death.

1664
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:57.530
Let's talk about how sad it is that there's no more Pontiac's anymore.

1665
01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:02.220
There's just no more.
The Pontiac Trans Am,
Huh?

1666
01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.680
Got It.
Drops off after that,
but you know,

1667
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:07.080
<v 9>yeah.</v>

1668
01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.020
<v 6>The Sun Bird,</v>

1669
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:14.280
the t 1000 you guys remember the Pontiac t 1000 as when you're really fucked up.

1670
01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:15.870
When you bought a bootleg Chevette.

1671
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.770
That's when you really were saying that you were an extra level of white trash.

1672
01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.550
Okay.
You ate macaroni and cheese five times a fucking week,

1673
01:44:25.110 --> 01:44:25.943
you know?

1674
01:44:27.210 --> 01:44:27.770
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1675
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:30.930
<v 6>You know,
I can't even,
what the Fuck I've even said today did I?</v>

1676
01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.670
Was I riffing about Sharon?
A tray,

1677
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:35.850
a macaroni cheese with another man looking into his eyes.

1678
01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.130
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1679
01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:40.260
<v 6>Was that this podcast,
was that another podcast?</v>

1680
01:44:40.261 --> 01:44:44.170
Was that at some point a show last night?
I don't know why,

1681
01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:48.990
but this has been the Monday morning podcast for a April fucking 20 something.

1682
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:53.940
I don't know what it is.
I don't know.
This is,

1683
01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:56.020
we're in the garbage time.
They still have their as well.

1684
01:44:56.110 --> 01:44:58.000
They were official site is still up.

1685
01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.400
What I want to Pontiacs do they have the Bonneville?
You know what?

1686
01:45:03.401 --> 01:45:04.600
They were a one trick pony.

1687
01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:05.610
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:45:05.610 --> 01:45:06.930
<v 6>Anybody drive a Pontiac?</v>

1689
01:45:08.170 --> 01:45:08.870
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:10.640
<v 6>I don't know,
but let's talk about that next week.
Okay.</v>

1691
01:45:10.641 --> 01:45:13.100
This is the Monday morning podcast,
be Caroline's this week.

1692
01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:16.670
And then I'm taking a break here for a May and June.

1693
01:45:17.230 --> 01:45:21.780
Going to recharge my fucking batteries and I'm coming out swinging in July.

1694
01:45:21.781 --> 01:45:23.690
I started the comedy works in Denver,

1695
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:29.350
and then I go do a eddies fist fuck in a fucking a Uma.

1696
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:36.710
I'm just gonna make up shit now.
And then I'm going to be at a wallpaper.

1697
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.610
Freddy's at the limelight.
Um,

1698
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:44.050
beautiful theater.
We're a

1699
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:47.930
Cirque de Solei performed just reading awful brochures here.

1700
01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.420
What is Cirque de Solei?
I really impressed with it the,

1701
01:45:50.421 --> 01:45:55.100
the strength that those guys have,
not so much on the costumes.
All right,

1702
01:45:55.101 --> 01:45:56.810
you guys,
that's the podcast for this week.

1703
01:45:56.811 --> 01:45:58.880
I hope you guys all have a tremendous week.

1704
01:45:58.910 --> 01:46:03.380
And I apologize if I was a little bit grumpy this week,
but,
uh,
you know,

1705
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:06.680
I'm sorry.
All right,
that's on me.
I'm just gonna Pause.
I'm sorry.

1706
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.910
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
