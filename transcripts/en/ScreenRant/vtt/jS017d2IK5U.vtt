00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.900
It's nearly impossible for modern directors
to keep references to their favorite movies

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.480
or directors out of their own films, with
easter eggs, props, and even lines of dialogue

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.230
being planted as an homage.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.000
But sometimes, it's the sounds of the movie
that show where the real influences lie - even

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.090
if they're nearly impossible to catch.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.700
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movies That Stole
Their Sounds From Other Films.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.910
Avatar

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.250
James Cameron's alien epic was years in the
making, with the wildlife of Pandora one of

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.469
the most memorable parts.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.430
The director originally dreamed up the panther-like
Xanator with a script note saying it could

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.960
even beat a T-Rex - so it's no surprise that
it sounds just like the version seen in Jurassic

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.570
Park.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.500
It's not the only dinosaur sound lifted for
Avatar, either, since the Direhorse lets out

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.010
snort and barks that are impossible to miss
for fans of Spielberg's dinosaur adventure.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.411
Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:03.700
You know it, and you've heard it, even if
you don't know what it's called.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.939
Easily the most famous reused movie sound
effect of all time, The "Wilhelm Scream" made

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.610
its first appearance in Distant Drums.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.670
When the scream was used in Star Wars and
Indiana Jones, it became an inside joke for

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.120
engineers everywhere - and The Lord of The
Rings featured A LOT of them.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.130
Once you notice it, no blockbuster will ever
be the same - and it's so overused, there

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.160
are plenty of movie fans who'd probably be
happy to see it retired.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.160
Jaws

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.590
Most movie fans will tell you that it was
the movie Jaws that made Steven Spielberg

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.930
a Hollywood hit, but his FIRST movie about
a monstrous beast chasing an everyday man

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.170
taught him all he needed to know about suspense
and terror.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.940
Duel swapped out the shark for a murderous
fuel truck driver, but it also ended with

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.490
the truck defeated, and a monster's roar added
to its death for added effect.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.250
When it came to the death scene in Jaws, Spielberg
made sure to include the same sample as "a

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.159
thank you" to the movie that started his career.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.799
Ant-Man

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.880
When Disney acquired the rights to the Star
Wars universe, fans didn't expect to see the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.039
results in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.000
But the story of the smallest Avengers featured
an easter egg that's easy to miss.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.820
When Ant-Man villain Yellowjacket finally
suits up, it's his laser cannons, not shrinking,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.260
that poses the biggest threat.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.720
But if those cannons sound familiar, it's
probably the sound of the Imperial AT-AT walker's

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.040
main cannon from The Empire Strikes Back buried
within them.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.620
Star Trek

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.680
J.J. Abrams gave a surprisingly believable
vision of the future in his Star Trek reboot,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.930
but the sounds used weren't so original.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.349
Audiences might have missed the fact that
Kirk's motorcycle was riding on spoke-less

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.349
wheels.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.150
But the motorcycle's sound was an even more
subtle detail.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.510
Especially when you realize you're hearing
a remixed version of the sound of a flying

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.480
car in The Jetsons cartoon universe.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
Blade Runner

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.980
The links between both of Ridley Scott's sci-fi
dramas have been studied by fans since they

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.270
first released, with evidence mounting that
Blade Runner and Alien take place in the same

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.270
universe.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.270
The sounds support the idea, too.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.069
A low humming noise is audible under most
of Alien's scenes set in the spaceship's crew

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.459
quarters, with a more pronounced effect planned
for the ship's medbay.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.330
That specific sound wasn't used in the finished
movie, but the sound editor placed it in Blade

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.540
Runner, making Deckard's apartment sound almost
identical to the Nostromo.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.790
Wreck-it Ralph

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.489
It isn't just classic games that are paid
tribute to in this story of a villain-turned-hero,

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.260
since the movie shares a sound designer and
mixer with some serious blockbusters.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.590
One of those films is Terminator 2: Judgment
Day, which explains why Calhoun's gun is clearly

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.190
making the exact same sound as the laser weapons
fired by the T-800's in the movie's opening

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.610
scene.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.269
On top of that, the sound effect made when
opening the vault in Cyberdyne Systems' lab

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.450
is also translated into the animated movie,
when King Candy hacks into the code of Sugar

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.680
Rush.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.440
It turns out it wasn't just video game cameos
fans had to watch out for.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.299
Star Trek Into Darkness

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.540
If there's one director J.J. Abrams has pointed
to more than any other, it's Steven Spielberg,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.530
whose vision of the future seen in Minority
Report probably played a role in creating

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.970
the same near future of the rebooted Star
Trek.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.900
The sci-fi story of cops who stop crimes before
they're committed even got a shout-out when

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.330
Khan crashes his ship into San Francisco.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:33.119
Listen closely to the alarms and sirens playing
as Khan starts to flee the scene - apparently,

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.800
the Pre-Crime cops were the first to respond.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.159
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:43.009
This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark dealt
with plenty of dark magic, including human

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.029
sacrifice by way of a burning hot lava pit.

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:49.930
When Indy's new leading lady is the next to
be sacrificed, she gets a front row seat to

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.979
the opening of the pit.

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.069
But listen closely, and you'll hear a familiar
sound.

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.940
It isn't just the stone doors being opened,
but the unforgettable sound of a lightsaber

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.939
igniting.Specifically, Darth Vader's saber
in The Empire Strikes Back.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:07.939
Man of Steel

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.490
Zack Snyder's take on Superman was a very
different one from what fans were used to,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.080
but the sound team made sure to include one
major easter egg for fans of the original

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.130
George Reeves version.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.639
When filming The Adventures of Superman in
the 1950s, short scenes of Reeves flying across

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.229
a sky blue backdrop were used, with a sound
of rushing wind to sell the scene.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.059
Special effects have come a long way, but
that same wind sound effect is included when

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:33.939
the new Man of Steel takes flight.

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:39.759
It's hard to hear, but the sound designers
confirm it's there for those who know what

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.219
they're looking for.

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.289
Those are the best sound effects borrowed
or hidden by blockbuster directors that we

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.909
could find, but which ones have we missed?
