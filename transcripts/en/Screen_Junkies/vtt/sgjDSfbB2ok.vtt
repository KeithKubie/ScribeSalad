Before every movie was needlessly

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.570
converted to 3D.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.820

VOICE (CONT'D)
Jurassic Park.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.230
VOICE (CONT'D)
Now needlessly converted to 3D.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.510
VOICE (CONT'D)
Revisit the adventure that launched

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.570
your childhood obsession with
dinosaurs...

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.940
VOICE (CONT'D)
...and two really disappointing

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.000
sequels.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
VOICE (CONT'D)
Rexperience the ground-breaking CGI

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190
that still holds up after 20
years...

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.640
VOICE (CONT'D)
and the technology that doesn't.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.440

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990

grandfather who will leave his
grand-kids alone with complete

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.960
strangers... and a T-Rex.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.220
VOICE (CONT'D)
When this incredibly dangerous

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.070
dinosaur park faces inevitable
insurance problems, Hammond must

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.780

Together, they will experience a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.530
journey through a state of the art
theme park that is fully staffed

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.900
and operational...

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.320

Except for tougher fences...

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.739
VOICE (CONT'D)
More than one security guard...

film that you are currently
watching.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.400
