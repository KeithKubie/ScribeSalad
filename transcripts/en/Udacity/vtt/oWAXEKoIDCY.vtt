00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.100
Alright, so let me try to, to write that down in a, in a way that let's us

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.000
summarize it. So I think what you're trying to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.220
say is when we did that one dimensional case,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.218
it had, the b c dimension was one. When we did the interval, it was two. When we

00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:13.700
did two dimensional, lineal separator, it was three. And

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.350
you're wondering whether in, three dimensions, it would be four.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.380
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.410
&gt;&gt; So that's, yeah, a really good insight. Let me, be a little

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.266
bit more precise here. That the hypothesis spaces in each of these cases

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.222
here, they, they were defined this parameter theta. In

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:30.680
the interval case it was defined by a and b.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.492
In the two dimensional case it was defined by

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:36.152
w and theta, and w was in two dimensions so

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:39.490
this was actually, a vector of size two. So,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.701
yeah, each time we went up, it, to do a

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:45.738
different example, we actually added another parameter. And, it

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:49.632
looks like the bc dimension is the number of parameters.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:50.260
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.392
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:53.032
in a sense it's it's the dimensionality of the

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:55.813
space in which the hypotheses live. So it really,

00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:58.387
it really fits very nicely. That doesn't exactly answer

00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:01.300
your question. It is the case that for a three

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.260
dimensional problem there's going to be four dimensions. And so

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.181
it turns out you are right. That for any d

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:12.470
dimensional hyperplane concept class or hypothesis class, the vc

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.460
dimension is going to end up being d plus 1.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.610
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see, and that's because

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.990
the number of parameters that you need to represent

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.970
a d dimensional hyperplane is in fact, d plus 1.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.760
&gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, d, the weights for each of the dimensions

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.220
plus the theta, you know, the greater than or equal to thing.
