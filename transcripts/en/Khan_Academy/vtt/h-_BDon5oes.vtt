00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:01.767
- So what I would like you to do

00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:05.673
is see if you can figure out
the measure of angle DEG here.

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:08.436
So try to figure out the
measure of this angle.

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:09.980
I encourage you to pause the video now

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.508
and try it on your own.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.416
All right, now let's work
through this together

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:16.749
and the key realization
here is to think about

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.586
this angle, it is an inscribed angle,

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:24.586
we see it's vertexes sitting
on the circle itself.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.032
And then think about the
arc that it intercepts.

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:30.631
And we see, we see that it intercepts,

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.490
so let me draw these
two sides of the angle,

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.978
we see that it intercepts arc CD.

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:42.444
It intercepts arc CD.

00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:44.330
And so the measure of this angle,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.536
since it's an inscribed angle,

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:49.960
is going to be half the measure of arc CD.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.290
So if we could figure out
the measure of arc CD,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.193
then we're going to be in good shape.

00:00:57.193 --> 00:00:59.514
Because if we figure out
the measure of arc CD,

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:00.536
then we take half of that

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.469
and we'll figure out what we care about.

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:05.888
Well, what you might notice,
is that there's another

00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:09.893
inscribed angle that
also intercepts arc CD.

00:01:09.893 --> 00:01:13.132
We have this angle right over here.

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:16.150
It also intercepts arc CD.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.353
So you could call this angle C ... Whoops.

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:23.393
You could call this angle CFD.

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:26.678
This also intercepts the same arc.

00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:28.757
So there's two ways you
could think about it.

00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:32.994
Two inscribed angles that
intercept the same arc

00:01:32.994 --> 00:01:34.549
are going to have the same angle measure

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.498
so just off of that you could
say that this is going to be,

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:39.518
that these two angles
have the same measure,

00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:41.550
so you could say this is
going to be 50 degrees.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.918
Or you could go, you could actually solve

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:46.112
what the measure of arc CD is.

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:50.187
It's going to be twice the
measure of the inscribed angle

00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:51.278
that intercepts it.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.437
So the measure of arc CD
is going to be 100 degrees.

00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:56.130
Twice the 50 degrees.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.326
And then you use that and you say,

00:01:57.326 --> 00:02:00.275
Well, if the measure of
that arc is 100 degrees,

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:02.597
then an inscribed angle that intercepts it

00:02:02.597 --> 00:02:03.746
is going to have half its measure,

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:05.453
it's going to be 50 degrees.

00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:08.686
So either way we get to 50 degrees.
