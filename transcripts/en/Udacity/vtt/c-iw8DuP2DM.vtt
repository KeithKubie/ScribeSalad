Thanks, Rado.

00:00:02.716 --> 00:00:06.142
Now that you understand what intents
are in glorious metaphor,

00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:10.080
let's use them to do something useful.
We'll replace the Toast,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.780
with an intent to launch 
the DetailActivity.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.200
You'll need to pass 
in weather forecast data

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.030
for the detail activity to display.
For more information,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.890
see the intent extra contants
defined in the intent class.
