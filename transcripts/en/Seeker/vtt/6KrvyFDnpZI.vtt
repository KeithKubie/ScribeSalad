00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.550
Have you seen increasingly larger gluten-free
sections at your local store?

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.550
Why is that?

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.819
Some kind of fancy new diet?

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.819
Not... quite...

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.799
Hey guys, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.349
For the 1-percent of the population with celiac
disease in the U.S., your long nightmare is

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.279
over now,
the FDA finally set standards for gluten-free

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.279
labeling!

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.039
Gluten-free standards now specify that anything
over 20 parts per million is allowed to be

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.260
considered actually free of the gluteny-devil.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.160
Yes, there will be SOME gluten in stuff labeled
"gluten free," but 20ppm is like 32 seconds

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.240
out of a year or a drop of water in your car's
gas tank.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240
It's not much.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.850
Having Celiac disease is NOT the same as a
food allergy.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.199
Food allergies like with wheat or shellfish
involve the body's antibodies attacking something

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.680
they see as an invader.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.490
Celiac is an autoimmune disease.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.570
So the immune system is attacking the body
itself.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.390
When a person with Celiac disease consumes
gluten, their immune system goes on the fritz

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.530
and starts attacking the villi in the small
intestine that are responsible for absorbing

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.530
the nutrients from food.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.910
This lack of nutrients in combination with
the immune system attacking it's own body

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.190
causes a number of negative physiological
effects and can even stunt development in

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.190
children.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.220
Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye and
barley.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.340
It's not bad for you, nor is it a product
of food processing.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.030
Gluten is the latin word for glue.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.640
It's the "glue" that holds bread together,
and was discovered by monks in the 7th century.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.330
If you've eaten gluten-free breads you probably
missed that chewy texture from regular bread

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.470
-- that's the gluten.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.330
It's used in regular foods, but also animal
feed and is sometimes added to vegetarian

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.710
"meat" to give it protein and consistency.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.720
But if it's just 1-percent of the U.S. population,
why do people hate on gluten so much?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.250
Now for those of you who are unfamiliar with
living gluten-free, there are plenty of resources

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.680
around the web, but just an FYI, if you don't
need to live that way due to an autoimmune

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.080
disorder, choosing to do so won't inherently
make you healthier.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.850
Outside of the 1-percent of Americans with
Celiac, as many as 7-percent of people have

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.710
a gluten sensitivity, but many others are
piling onto the gluten-free bandwagon, similar

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.950
to our other videos regarding fad diets, cutting
out a food group is a fad, and simply paying

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.830
more attention to what you're putting in your
body will be enough to lose some weight.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.750
Americans tend to OVER-eat grains and breads,
so a noob trying a gluten-free diet will often

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.100
immediately cut back on grains, but a gluten-free
diet doesn't mean low-carb and doesn't mean

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.100
"better" necessarily.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.170
In fact, if done poorly, simply gutting the
gluten from your diet can leave people deficient

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.810
in iron, calcium, B-vitamins and vitamin D,
according to the Academy of Nutrition and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.810
Dietetics.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.840
It can also be hard to get enough fiber!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.670
The problem with Celiac disease is how underdiagnosed
it is and as more people realize they have

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.560
the disease, we'll probably see more gluten-free
options, but don't think that just because

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.180
they say SCIENCEWORD-Free they mean healthy,
they just mean safe to eat for those people.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.510
What do you think about gluten-free?

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.370
Have you tried a gluten-free food that you
think is better than the gluten-full version?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.450
