00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.373
she texts us a lead
in South Dakota.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.775
We're gonna meet up with Adam
and his dad, Bruce.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.044
FRANK: Their family has lived
on the farm since the '40s,

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.380
and the house and the barns
have accumulations

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.282
of everything from
petroliana to toys!

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.283
ROBBIE: Man!

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.284
FRANK: That's what
I'm talking about.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.285
That's my whole world!

ROBBIE: Man, you look exactly
like-- look at you two.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.042
You look exactly alike.
FRANK: Alike.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.511
ROBBIE: Holy cow!
How you doing?

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.645
Rob; nice to meet ya.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:46.713
BRUCE: Pretty good.
Nice to meet you, Rob.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.747
FRANK: Nice to meet you, Bruce;
Frank.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.015
BRUCE: Nice to meet you, Frank.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.049
FRANK: Sounds like you want
to thin out a little bit.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.317
BRUCE: Well, we got
a few things here,

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.052
and we can go look around,
see if anything

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.788
tickles your fancy on it.
ROBBIE: Alright, yeah.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:55.822
ROBBIE: I'm getting excited.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.857
There's six or seven
buildings here.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.225
BRUCE: I have been
here my whole life.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.694
I'm 61 years old.
FRANK: Okay.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.963
BRUCE: Growing up here on
the farm, it was just kind of

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:06.132
exciting to go out
and help in the fieldwork.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.202
Before I went
into grade school,

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.405
I was driving tractors
around the farm already.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.107
ROBBIE: What do you guys
farm around here?

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.608
BRUCE: Corn or soybeans,
usually.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:16.910
Sometimes wheat.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.312
BRUCE: Dad did a lot of service
station work in here.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.381
BRUCE: My dad had
a small shop here

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.351
that he did a lot of fixing,
repairing for neighbours.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:29.189
The age that my parents
grew up in, they pretty much...

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.423
kept everything.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.525
They didn't get rid of
much of anything.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.594
ROBBIE: When you're picking
an accumulation of, like,

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.497
three generations on
a multi-generational farm,

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.599
there's a lot of stuff
that gets left behind

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.234
that never got cleaned up.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.102
We have to work
a little bit harder

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.604
to find the good stuff here.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.739
FRANK: Got some of
these Co-op cans here.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.409
BRUCE: Yep.
FRANK: I got six of 'em.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.910
15 bucks apiece.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.179
That'd be $90.
BRUCE: That'll work.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.150
FRANK: Alright,
I'm gonna keep looking.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.952
FRANK: Republic
Steel Corporation.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.187
I like old boxes.
20 bucks.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.489
BRUCE: How about 30 on it?

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.090
FRANK: I'll split it with you.
25.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.992
BRUCE: That'll work.
I'm good with that.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:07.126
FRANK: Alright.
We got a deal.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.228
BRUCE: Thank you.
FRANK: Alright.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.229
ROBBIE: Frank.
FRANK: What d'you see?

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.263
ROBBIE: Stained glass.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.664
FRANK: This
came out of a house.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.701
It needed to be rescued.
How about $65?

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.069
BRUCE: What do you think 75?

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.670
FRANK: I'll split it with you.
70.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.838
BRUCE: Okay.
That'll work.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.007
FRANK: Alright, you got a deal.
Great.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.609
FRANK: Today was
the kind of day I love.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.477
We got to hang out
with some cool people;

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.079
we got to buy
some neat stuff.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.847
ROBBIE: I got it; you got it?
FRANK: Yeah, we got it.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.618
BRUCE: Some things that the guys
found, it was tough to let go.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.053
Memories kind of
kick into gear.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.656
But I think it's gonna
go to a better place

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.025
and be used in the future.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.627
FRANK: Bruce.
ROBBIE: Bruce.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:41.895
FRANK: It was fun.
BRUCE: It's been good, guys.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.296
FRANK: Been real fun.
Thanks for showing us around.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.664
ROBBIE: It has.
Thanks for having us out.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.333
BRUCE: I still have plenty
here to keep my memories going

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.836
of what went on in the past.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.837
[honks horn]

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.071
FRANK: See ya, Bruce!
See ya, Adam!

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.206
BRUCE: We'll see you guys!
