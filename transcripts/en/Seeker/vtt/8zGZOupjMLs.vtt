00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.560
What if I told you, you could stream an HD
movie while on a flight from LA to London,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.189
uninterrupted, all on one satellite.

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.500
One!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.820
Satellite!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.080
That’s insane, I know.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.120
There are over 1,400 active satellites in
orbit.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.170
Right now.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.500
Each one was built for a unique purpose.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.660
ViaSat-2 is one of the largest active geosynchronous
communications satellite currently in space

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.390
with the highest internet capacities.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.949
This behemoth weighs in at over fourteen thousand
pounds (6,500kg), stands about 20 feet tall

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.179
(6m) and has a wingspan of about 158 feet
(48m); that’s like the wingspan of a 767!

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.350
The ViaSat-2 is one of the latest in satellite
communication technology.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.159
It can provide 300 gigabits of service per
second, with about 25mbps download speeds.

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.590
That’s enough to stream an ultra HD Netflix
show.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.590
FROM SPACE.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.389
It also helps that it’s geostationary.

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.739
It’s always in the same place in the sky,
blanketing a huge swath of the planet with

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.510
the glory of internet.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.289
That glory, by the way, extends across North,
Central, and the top of South America the

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.119
Caribbean, and across the Atlantic Ocean!

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.159
A priority of ViaSat is to provide is to provide
high-speed internet to planes and ships, but

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.570
it can also help people get broadband internet
who live too far from good infrastructure.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.869
Right now, a lot of internet-providing satellites
use frequencies inside a range called the

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:20.869
Ku-Band.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.180
Its signal isn’t super susceptible to atmospheric
moisture, which is a plus, but satellites

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.200
need a big, heavy antenna to use it— this
increases the cost to launch.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.359
The ViaSat-2 uses newer Ka-band frequencies
which are used by military aircraft for targeting

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.359
radar.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.299
The antennas are lighter -- lessening the
cost to launch, but the signal is more susceptible

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.909
to atmospheric moisture.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.829
The biggest benefit with this new sat, is
that its ONE SAT covering a hugemungous area!

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.509
That means there would be less handoff as
you cross the Atlantic.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.609
With KU-satellites there are lots and you
have to hop from one to the other.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:02.420
With ViaSat-2, it’s like everyone from Caracas
to Seattle to Paris are on the same network!

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.140
ViaSat-2 could change how we communicate in
our global community.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.090
There are 1,399 other satellites up in space
too, and each one has a purpose, and a story.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030
Do you have a favorite?

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.580

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.910
Since you’re still here, can you do me a
favor and subscribe?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.910
It just takes a click!

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.872
And if you want more flying goodness, watch
Amy talk about how big satellites really are.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:26.872
Some are HUGE.

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:29.530
I don’t think I have to tell you, but the
internet doesn’t come from space.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.290
It’s beamed up there from the ground.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.440
Having only one satellite to beam to?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.220
That might be a big advantage.
