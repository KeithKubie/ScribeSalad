00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:16.308
When I was about eight years old,

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:20.550
I first heard about something
called climate change or global warming.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.189
Apparently, that was something
humans had created by our way of living.

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:30.839
I was told to turn off
the lights to save energy

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:34.459
and to recycle paper to save resources.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.079
I remember thinking
that it was very strange

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.019
that humans, who are
an animal species among others,

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.198
could be capable of changing
the Earth's climate.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.561
Because if we were,
and if it was really happening,

00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:54.739
we wouldn't be talking
about anything else.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.000
As soon as you'd turn on the TV,
everything would be about that.

00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:03.541
Headlines, radio, newspapers,

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:06.690
you would never read or hear
about anything else,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.719
as if there was a world war going on.

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:13.360
But no one ever talked about it.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.154
If burning fossil fuels was so bad
that it threatened our very existence,

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.278
how could we just continue like before?

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:26.498
Why were there no restrictions?

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.320
Why wasn't it made illegal?

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.891
To me, that did not add up.

00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:36.297
It was too unreal.

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.978
So when I was 11, I became ill.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.042
I fell into depression,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.613
I stopped talking,

00:01:44.998 --> 00:01:46.487
and I stopped eating.

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:51.488
In two months, I lost
about 10 kilos of weight.

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:56.008
Later on, I was diagnosed
with Asperger syndrome,

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.289
OCD and selective mutism.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.760
That basically means I only speak
when I think it's necessary -

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.670
now is one of those moments.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.258
(Applause)

00:02:15.908 --> 00:02:18.290
For those of us who are on the spectrum,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.857
almost everything is black or white.

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:23.234
We aren't very good at lying,

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:26.598
and we usually don't enjoy
participating in this social game

00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:29.153
that the rest of you seem so fond of.

00:02:29.153 --> 00:02:30.423
(Laughter)

00:02:30.688 --> 00:02:33.751
I think in many ways
that we autistic are the normal ones,

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:36.368
and the rest of the people
are pretty strange,

00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:37.561
(Laughter)

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:40.509
especially when it comes to
the sustainability crisis,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.525
where everyone keeps saying
climate change is an existential threat

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:47.136
and the most important issue of all,

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.082
and yet they just carry on like before.

00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.396
I don't understand that,

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.198
because if the emissions have to stop,

00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:58.579
then we must stop the emissions.

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:01.019
To me that is black or white.

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:04.460
There are no gray areas
when it comes to survival.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.781
Either we go on
as a civilization or we don't.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.939
We have to change.

00:03:12.016 --> 00:03:15.950
Rich countries like Sweden
need to start reducing emissions

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.230
by at least 15 percent every year.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.119
And that is so that we can stay
below a two-degree warming target.

00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:28.273
Yet, as the IPCC
have recently demonstrated,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.116
aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius

00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:35.302
would significantly
reduce the climate impacts.

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:39.798
But we can only imagine
what that means for reducing emissions.

00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:43.600
You would think the media
and every one of our leaders

00:03:43.607 --> 00:03:45.607
would be talking about nothing else,

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:48.168
but they never even mention it.

00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:50.733
Nor does anyone ever mention

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.859
the greenhouse gases
already locked in the system.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.115
Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming

00:03:57.455 --> 00:04:00.128
so that when we stop burning fossil fuels,

00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:02.617
we already have an extra level of warming

00:04:02.864 --> 00:04:07.314
perhaps as high as
0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius.

00:04:09.072 --> 00:04:11.624
Furthermore does hardly
anyone speak about the fact

00:04:11.624 --> 00:04:15.176
that we are in the midst
of the sixth mass extinction,

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:20.686
with up to 200 species
going extinct every single day,

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:25.819
that the extinction rate today

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.619
is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:31.848
than what is seen as normal.

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:39.879
Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about
the aspect of equity or climate justice,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.227
clearly stated everywhere
in the Paris Agreement,

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:47.849
which is absolutely necessary
to make it work on a global scale.

00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:51.342
That means that rich countries

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:55.279
need to get down to zero emissions
within 6 to 12 years,

00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:58.337
with today's emission speed.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.330
And that is so that people
in poorer countries

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.990
can have a chance to heighten
their standard of living

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.558
by building some of the infrastructure
that we have already built,

00:05:08.863 --> 00:05:11.911
such as roads, schools, hospitals,

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.960
clean drinking water,
electricity, and so on.

00:05:15.707 --> 00:05:20.299
Because how can we expect
countries like India or Nigeria

00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:22.180
to care about the climate crisis

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:27.190
if we who already have everything
don't care even a second about it

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.048
or our actual commitments
to the Paris Agreement?

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.527
So, why are we not reducing our emissions?

00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:40.909
Why are they in fact still increasing?

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.031
Are we knowingly causing
a mass extinction?

00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:47.429
Are we evil?

00:05:49.118 --> 00:05:51.299
No, of course not.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.329
People keep doing what they do

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:55.969
because the vast majority
doesn't have a clue

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.722
about the actual consequences
of our everyday life,

00:06:00.474 --> 00:06:03.449
and they don't know
that rapid change is required.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.446
We all think we know,
and we all think everybody knows,

00:06:08.447 --> 00:06:10.020
but we don't.

00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:12.339
Because how could we?

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.459
If there really was a crisis,

00:06:16.696 --> 00:06:19.583
and if this crisis was caused
by our emissions,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.277
you would at least see some signs.

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:26.918
Not just flooded cities,
tens of thousands of dead people,

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:31.100
and whole nations leveled
to piles of torn down buildings.

00:06:31.904 --> 00:06:34.184
You would see some restrictions.

00:06:34.616 --> 00:06:36.300
But no.

00:06:36.774 --> 00:06:38.570
And no one talks about it.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:46.032
There are no emergency meetings,
no headlines, no breaking news.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.645
No one is acting
as if we were in a crisis.

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:54.129
Even most climate scientists
or green politicians

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.130
keep on flying around the world,
eating meat and dairy.

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:08.057
If I live to be 100,
I will be alive in the year 2103.

00:07:09.738 --> 00:07:15.181
When you think about the future today,
you don't think beyond the year 2050.

00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:20.992
By then, I will, in the best case,
not even have lived half of my life.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:23.969
What happens next?

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:31.590
The year 2078, I will celebrate
my 75th birthday.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:37.460
If I have children or grandchildren,
maybe they will spend that day with me.

00:07:38.682 --> 00:07:40.953
Maybe they will ask me about you,

00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:44.893
the people who were around, back in 2018.

00:07:46.786 --> 00:07:49.268
Maybe they will ask
why you didn't do anything

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.260
while there still was time to act.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.268
What we do or don't do right now
will affect my entire life

00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:01.471
and the lives of my children
and grandchildren.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.555
What we do or don't do right now,

00:08:04.562 --> 00:08:08.681
me and my generation
can't undo in the future.

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:15.034
So when school
started in August of this year,

00:08:15.034 --> 00:08:17.594
I decided that this was enough.

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:22.015
I set myself down on the ground
outside the Swedish parliament.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.928
I school striked for the climate.

00:08:26.677 --> 00:08:29.755
Some people say that I
should be in school instead.

00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:33.929
Some people say that I should study
to become a climate scientist

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.224
so that I can "solve the climate crisis."

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:41.631
But the climate crisis
has already been solved.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.368
We already have
all the facts and solutions.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.818
All we have to do is
to wake up and change.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.729
And why should I be studying for a future
that soon will be no more

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:58.799
when no one is doing anything
whatsoever to save that future?

00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:03.279
And what is the point of learning facts
in the school system

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:05.902
when the most important facts

00:09:05.902 --> 00:09:09.349
given by the finest science
of that same school system

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.629
clearly means nothing
to our politicians and our society.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:18.648
Some people say that Sweden
is just a small country,

00:09:18.869 --> 00:09:21.499
and that it doesn't matter what we do,

00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:26.179
but I think that if a few children
can get headlines all over the world

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:28.646
just by not coming to school
for a few weeks,

00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:32.108
imagine what we could all do
together if you wanted to.

00:09:32.108 --> 00:09:35.524
(Applause)

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.170
Now we're almost at the end of my talk,

00:09:41.089 --> 00:09:46.380
and this is where people
usually start talking about hope,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.412
solar panels, wind power,
circular economy, and so on,

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.418
but I'm not going to do that.

00:09:54.751 --> 00:09:59.319
We've had 30 years of pep-talking
and selling positive ideas.

00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:02.199
And I'm sorry,
but it doesn't work.

00:10:02.909 --> 00:10:04.517
Because if it would have,

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.779
the emissions would have gone down by now.

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:08.432
They haven't.

00:10:09.472 --> 00:10:11.920
And yes, we do need hope,

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.189
of course we do.

00:10:14.649 --> 00:10:18.469
But the one thing we need
more than hope is action.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.183
Once we start to act,
hope is everywhere.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.960
So instead of looking for hope,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.820
look for action.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.519
Then, and only then, hope will come.

00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:41.045
Today, we use 100 million
barrels of oil every single day.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.221
There are no politics to change that.

00:10:45.148 --> 00:10:47.750
There are no rules
to keep that oil in the ground.

00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:52.395
So we can't save the world
by playing by the rules,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.570
because the rules have to be changed.

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:58.206
Everything needs to change --

00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:00.540
and it has to start today.

00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:02.148
Thank you.

00:11:02.148 --> 00:11:05.497
(Applause)
