[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:08.140
COLT MCANLIS: They're
everywhere

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.600
TODD KERPELMAN: And just
keep pointing.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.130
And we are live.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.660
Hello and welcome to Google
Games Chat number seven, the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.200
Halloween edition.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.710
COLT MCANLIS: It's spooky.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.520
TODD KERPELMAN: Where none of
us are wearing costumes, but

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.090
I'm wearing orange because
of Halloween.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.360
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Or the
baseball game?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.910
TODD KERPELMAN: Or the Giants.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.590
That is one of the convenient
things about the Giants

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.830
playing in the World Series,
is you can wear orange and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.040
you've got both bases covered.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Orange and
black, it's perfect.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:32.960
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, Halloween
or Giants fan--

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.130
both.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.640
WOLFF DOBSON: Does that mean
it's always Halloween in

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Oklahoma state?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.590
TODD KERPELMAN: I
suppose it is.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.470
COLT MCANLIS: I have strong
opinions about Oklahoma that I

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.440
won't bring out on the air.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.970
So let's just refrain
from Oklahoma jokes.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.880
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Cause
he loves it.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.230
TODD KERPELMAN: Halloween
episode.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.630
WOLFF DOBSON: To all of our
Oklahoma visitors, we'd like

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.910
to say, we love Oklahoma.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.410
COLT MCANLIS: Unless you got
something to say, Oklahoma,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.330
and then put it on the street.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Hey,
here's a fun fact.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.390
That pre-roll video we watched--
if you watch that a

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.930
week later, Louis Gray crawls
out of your computer monitor

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.145
and knifes you to death.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:02.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.175
COLT MCANLIS: Until you show
it to someone else.

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:04.930
TODD KERPELMAN: That's true.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.380
WOLFF DOBSON: You watch it and
then you get an SMS that says,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.240
"7 days."

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.440
TODD KERPELMAN: Therefore, you
have to forward this video to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.250
somebody else or else you're
not going to make it.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.040
And you know, we really should
probably stop just showing

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.870
that pre-roll in the
first place.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Why do we keep
showing that pre-roll?

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.690
TODD KERPELMAN: It's so hard
to get repeat customers.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.980
COLT MCANLIS: It's important
that people know

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.560
what we talk about.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.110
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.740
All right.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.270
So we're going to start with
some introductions.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.470
Hi.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.070
Todd Kerpelman, moderator.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.450
To my left, Dr. Wolff Dobson.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.270
What are you dressing
for for Halloween?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.560
Or are you?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.910
WOLFF DOBSON: Right now
I'm dressing up as--

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.300
I was thinking about a spider.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.330
I'm not sure I have enough PVC
tubes to form all the legs.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.980
TODD KERPELMAN: Possibly
a mangled spider.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.230
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm going
to be a spider after

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.390
an unfortunate accident.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.730
TODD KERPELMAN: Or a tick

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.650
TODD KERPELMAN: To my right we
got Colt McCanlis What are you

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.390
dressing up for,
for Halloween?

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.360
COLT MCANLIS: A drunk father.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.330
It's going to be great.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.160
Run up to the door, kids.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.970
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.200
WOLFF DOBSON: Have you done the
trick-or-treat where you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.039
carry the bottle of wine
and the wine glass?

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.440
COLT MCANLIS: That's
what we're doing.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.430
That's actually the plan.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.170
WOLFF DOBSON: I did that
for a couple years.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.380
COLT MCANLIS: Run on, kids.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.630
Daddy's in the street.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.150
TODD KERPELMAN: And John--

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.080
John McCutchan, what are you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.650
dressing up for, for Halloween?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.740
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh, I--

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.490
nothing.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.420
TODD KERPELMAN: You sure?

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.520
You sure you're not going
to be a hobo?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.290
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I might, yeah.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.710
I am working on my costume
right now.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.280
COLT MCANLIS: John's going
to go as a native client

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.080
acceleration module.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.160
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.950
You won't see me.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.730
WOLFF DOBSON: Wait, are you
trying to say that's Harry?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.010
COLT MCANLIS: I like it.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.130
It's rugged.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.520
If we get attacked by zombies
during the show, I'm getting

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.600
behind this guy.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.450
TODD KERPELMAN: That is true.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.920
He's got the lumberjack,
like--

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.240
give you an axe, a baseball
bat, you are the antihero.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.930
COLT MCANLIS: If you watch "The
Walking Dead," you'll

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.935
notice that the amount of
zombies killed by plaid

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:56.270
outranks solid colors.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.110
Do the research, internet.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.230
Prove me right.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.220
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: What
about stripes?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.410
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is probably true.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.870
WOLFF DOBSON: The amount of
drama per episode goes up

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.760
exponentially and the number
of zombies goes

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.610
down at the same rate.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.580
I'm disappointed.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.410
TODD KERPELMAN: Well let's move
on to today's tech demo,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.490
which is really less of
a tech demo and more--

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.970
we're just going to
play some games.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.910
Specifically, Colt wanted
to show off

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.010
his favorite [? NaCl ?]

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.655
Halloween-themed game.

00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:21.380
So take it away, Colt.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.720
COLT MCANLIS: Thank you.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.450
For the Halloween show I,
wanted to make sure that

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.970
everyone had a great chance
to get a taste of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.560
Halloween on the web.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.800
So Jimmy, can we switch
over to feed, please?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.580
Fantastic.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.870
What you're looking at here is
a fantastic game by Spacetime

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.450
Studios called "Dark Legends."
"Dark Legends" is a vampire

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.820
MMO that you can get playing on
your phone or in the Chrome

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.390
web browser using
native client.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.180
So I've spent some time in this
game, unfortunately--

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.180
well, fortunately it's a great
game to spend time with--

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.000
but I got a level 31 vampire
here, and she's rockin'.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.370
Now the reason this is a great
Halloween game is, you get

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.420
some visuals in here that you
don't get with certain other

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.050
MMOs, right.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.700
Like how many other MMOs
do you see that have

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.800
a fountain of blood?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.180
Plus, the entire point of the
game is this sort of nice,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.660
atmospheric concept that you're
going out and battling

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.840
the decaying undead, as opposed
to the unholy undead,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.630
which vampires just
generally are.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.280
You also notice that none of
these vampires are sparkling.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.089
Big, important thing for
me, as I was ranting

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.850
about in our last talk.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.360
So all through the environment
you get these really cool

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.290
environmental things.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.160
Like of course Halloween is
here, so they've got the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.790
environments with the pumpkins,
as well as just some

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.270
really cool ambience, like these
vampires down at the end

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.150
of the street found an
unsuspecting victim to make

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.780
friends with.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.530
They're just dancing

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.020
So the cool thing is, you
obviously run around and do

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.680
instances with other
players-- sort of

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.170
like raids and dungeons.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.610
Of course, all of these
instances are isolated, so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.410
you're guaranteed to get some
good friends and not an

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.130
experience of waiting
in line or waiting

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.560
into a queue or whatnot.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.130
But in general, this is
a fantastic game.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.200
If you're looking to do some
nice a browser-based Halloween

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.780
gaming, I highly
recommend "Dark

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.790
Legends." It's fantastic.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.440
The guys over at Spacetime
Studios-- they know what

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.970
they're doing when
it comes to MMOs.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.570
And the coolest part is that you
can pick this up and run

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.740
right on your phone, too.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.930
So if you're sitting here and
you're playing and all of a

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.020
sudden you decide, hey, I'm
sorry, I need to go to the DMV

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.110
for some reason.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.040
You can just turn it, off pick
up your phone, walk to the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.430
DMV, and scare everybody
there.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.430
So this is my Halloween browser

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.590
game pick of the month.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.910
So go, play it. "Dark Legends"--
check it out on the

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.540
Chrome Web Store.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.320
TODD KERPELMAN: I see
you got killed.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.236
I guess it's hard to play
and talk at the

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:29.520
same time, isn't it?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.380
COLT MCANLIS: It is.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.290
Usually I'm ignoring everyone.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.510
But while you talk,
I'm going to play.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.240
TODD KERPELMAN: Well I was just
going to point out your

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.220
character's choice of outfit.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.060
COLT MCANLIS: Listen, that's
actually the highest powered

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.020
outfit in the game.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.100
Don't judge.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.010
It gives me +3 intelligence
and +30 damage.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.100
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: +3
something else?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.770
TODD KERPELMAN: +20 charisma.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.760
COLT MCANLIS: Careful,
careful.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.960
TODD KERPELMAN: If you
know what I'm saying.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.990
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No, I don't.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.710
COLT MCANLIS: She fights the
undead, and that's important.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.520
You have to look the part.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.530
TODD KERPELMAN: I feel like
maybe a plaid shirt might be

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.490
appropriate.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.690
COLT MCANLIS: Actually,
that's great feedback.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.770
Spacetime Studios, you need
to put in a plaid shirt.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.380
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I could
be the model.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.590
I'll just come in.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.480
COLT MCANLIS: We'll
fly you down.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.350
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Look like you
rolled out of bed, and you

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.180
could kill zombies.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.650
COLT MCANLIS: I think that's
really what we need to start

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.000
up is the Google GDL zombie
killing program.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.470
You're issued a plaid shirt and
"Dark Legends" and you can

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.620
go from there.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.500
TODD KERPELMAN: Go
and kill zombies.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.620
Well thank you very
much for the demo.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.310
I will go and play it and
I too will pick up

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.950
that outfit, I guess.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.600
COLT MCANLIS: You should.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.350
It's a great outfit.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.060
TODD KERPELMAN: Can I wear
it on a male character?

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.790
Can I wear speedos?

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.790
COLT MCANLIS: So there is a
male version of this which

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.650
looks just as creepy.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:49.330
They've got other versions.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.500
They've got a funny little X--

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.700
super vampire version that looks
like the standard Bram

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.160
Stoker style with the big
poofies and everything.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.920
I don't even know.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.050
I'm not a fashion guy.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.910
But a fantastic game.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.860
WOLFF DOBSON: The big poofies?

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.190
COLT MCANLIS: The poofies,
you know.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.090
They've got the jacket and
then this big, like--

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.550
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Poof.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.030
COLT MCANLIS: Poof.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.860
I don't even know-- frills?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.770
Lace?

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.750
TODD KERPELMAN: I know what
you're talking about.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.180
The frilly stuff.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.400
The 18th century gentlemen
dandy outfits.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.800
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.380
If you know what that's actually
called, put it on the

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.460
stream and Jimmy will reward
you with shooting your

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.710
username out on the internet.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.430
WOLFF DOBSON: Or someone's
username.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.105
Not totally sure.

00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:29.410
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Are you talking
about an ascot?

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.520
WOLFF DOBSON: No, an
ascot is different.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.370
That's the tie.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.770
That's the double tie-thing
that you get.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.240
It's like a thing that comes
down and you have a little

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.370
diamond stud, if I recall
from Scrooge McDuck.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.890
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's right.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.750
COLT MCANLIS: Duck
Tales, woo-oo.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.740
WOLFF DOBSON: I think we've
gone off track.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.890
TODD KERPELMAN: This entire
show is off track.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.960
WOLFF DOBSON: Why is it
that Scrooge McDuck

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.330
doesn't wear pants.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.180
Does anybody know?

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: None
of them wear pants.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.200
TODD KERPELMAN: Before
we start this week's

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.320
five-for-five, I just want to
point out-- last week we

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.380
talked about the future of
college as one of our

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.450
five-for-fives.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.760
And this past weekend--

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.820
I'm just going to show
this, I don't know

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.790
if you can see this.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.790
Time Magazine--

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.780
their cover was basically
the exact same topic.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.400
So Time Magazine, stop
stealing our ideas.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.470
Come up with your own.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.890
You've got your own staff.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.350
COLT MCANLIS: Or better
yet, steal

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.840
them, but give us credit.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.310
At least own up to the
fact that you stole

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.660
the idea from GDL.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.870
TODD KERPELMAN: That is true.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.480
Reinventing college,
inspired by Google

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.165
Games Chat number six.

00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:28.010
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's true.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.800
It's absolutely true.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.179
TODD KERPELMAN: I think so.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.330
Do we have the cool graphic
intro yet for our

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.580
five-for-five?

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.320
I'm getting a thumbs down.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.210
WOLFF DOBSON: Five!

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.150
Four!

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.890
Five!

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.110
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
pretty good.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.450
And this is--

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.910
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Play that back
every episode from now on.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.990
WOLFF DOBSON: Only if we
all do it together.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.760
TODD KERPELMAN: That's going
to be even more awkward.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think
just you going like--

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We'll
mute the sound.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Speaking
of zombies.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.060
TODD KERPELMAN: So this
is a Halloween-themed

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.890
five-for-five.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.704
WOLFF DOBSON: I sense
an animated gif.

00:09:04.704 --> 00:09:07.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.500
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm trying
to keep us on topic.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.930
Stop it.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.240
I'm going to start the stopwatch
once we reveal our

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.140
first question.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.240
We'll chat about it until the
stopwatch goes off and then

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.380
we'll move on.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.190
So Halloween theme,
first question--

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.650
so what's up with all
these zombies?

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.640
Why are there so many zombies
in so many games?

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.450
Why do so many games
have zombie modes?

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.744
Why do we love zombies
so much?

00:09:28.744 --> 00:09:30.200
WOLFF DOBSON: I have a thesis.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.560
The thesis is, back when you
were programming on a

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.830
PlayStation One, you
were lucky--

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.962
using painters' algorithm
instead of a z-buffer, you

00:09:38.962 --> 00:09:42.320
were lucky to have two enemies
onscreen at a time.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.650
Once we switched to modern
graphics cards with lots of

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.920
cores, suddenly rendering
a whole bunch of dudes--

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.370
not nearly as big a deal.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.130
In fact, if you've done a lot
of graphics programming, you

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.090
know all about level
of detail.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.940
As you zoom closer to somebody,
you actually swap

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.630
models out as you get closer
and closer and closer, with

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.990
more and more polygons
on them.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.930
But the reward for that is,
fewer and fewer people are

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.180
visible behind them as you
zoom closer and closer.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.160
And so if you pull the camera
all the way back and show 300

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.880
zombies, dudes are probably
made out of

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.170
20, 30 polygons apiece.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.790
But it looks fine.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.810
And we can push that kind
of graphics even on

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.190
a Nexus 7 or something.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.530
We just have so much more
graphics power.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.120
And therefore, zombies
are fun.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.970
TODD KERPELMAN: So you're
saying zombies work well

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.900
because these days we can do
swarms of enemies, and swarms

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.100
of 300 guys with guns would be
silly, but swarms of zombies

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.990
coming towards you would be--

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.020
WOLFF DOBSON: I don't know how
often you've been shot at, but

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.840
300 guys with guns--

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.380
it's a pretty short trip.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.580
In fact, there's an e-talk years
ago from the Valve guys

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.050
about how they had to tone down
how much the bad guy shot

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.090
at you, because you just died.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.400
Immediately.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.766
It's like, you're suppressed
and flanked and it's over.

00:10:56.766 --> 00:10:58.640
COLT MCANLIS: That would
be realistic.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.770
WOLFF DOBSON: Sadly, realistic
shooters--

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.360
not nearly as much fun.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.960
COLT MCANLIS: So we'll accept
the concept that aliens are

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.956
attacking from outer space and
make that a reality, but not a

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:06.610
guy shooting at you?

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.520
No, no, no.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.380
It's stormtroopers, right?

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.760
WOLFF DOBSON: Well that's why
the stormtroopers couldn't hit

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.550
anybody, either.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.960
They really have
that many guys.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.130
COLT MCANLIS: They can hit
their head on the door,

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:15.810
apparently.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.130
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm going to say
there's two things that I

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:22.200
like from the game design
perspective about zombies.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.660
One is that you can basically
have the player shoot at them

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.880
all you want and no parents'
group is going to complain.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.280
No one's really going
to raise a ruckus.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.690
WOLFF DOBSON: Or say
German laws that--

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.850
TODD KERPELMAN: There's
that, too.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.880
But if it's people, you start
to feel kind of bad about--

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.050
is it really OK to have
mowing down people?

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.270
But zombies--

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.680
you can shoot down a whole bunch
of them, limbs can go

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.320
flying off.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.840
They make perfect enemies in
that sense in that it's

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.960
generally considered--

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.510
if you've got to have something
coming toward you

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.650
that you're going to kill,
zombies are good because

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.620
they're dead anyway.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.610
WOLFF DOBSON: To all our undead
viewers, we'd just like

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.950
to say we love you.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.050
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, but we
won't feel bad if we kill you.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.660
[ZOMBIE NOISES]

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.140
TODD KERPELMAN: The other thing
is, I feel like people

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.910
judge the enemies in context
in terms of their

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.690
intelligence.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.020
So basically, here's the deal--
you can have a zombie

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.430
coming towards me, and in a
video game, if he gets stuck

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.640
on this table and just keeps
walking towards me, stuck on

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.500
that table, that actually
feel somewhat realistic.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.140
Because zombies are
sort of dumb.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.350
If it was a person--

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: A way to mask
our terrible path-finding

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.230
algorithms?

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.500
COLT MCANLIS: The programmers
are incompetent.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.090
Throw zombies at it.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.040
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes,
pretty much.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.710
WOLFF DOBSON: Your expectation
for the post-dead is much

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.330
lower than your expectation--

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.280
TODD KERPELMAN: Your
expectation for the

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.165
path-finding abilities
of an enemy.

00:12:41.165 --> 00:12:44.810
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It also plays
into uncanny valley, right?

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.350
People look like zombies
in the uncanny

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.660
valley, so it's perfect.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.530
It's the sweet spot.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:49.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.660
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Actually
photo-realistic, real zombie

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.310
rendering, because it is
the uncanny valley.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.850
TODD KERPELMAN: So when someone
says, hey, this

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.510
character's eyes look kind of
dead, you say thank you.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.790
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I worked so hard
to get those eyes just

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.790
dead enough.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.300
TODD KERPELMAN: Colt,
anything to add?

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.740
COLT MCANLIS: Well, listen.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.430
I think from the design
characteristics, it's as close

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.390
as you can get to actually
shooting another human and

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.560
still being legitimate
about it.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.160
Plus there's just the concept
that video games very much

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.510
touch on the concept of
one against many.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.910
It's always your hero vs the
world or the environment, and

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.215
at an evil realm, nothing
embodies that better than a

00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:30.110
horde of zombies.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.430
It just fits.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.920
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, if you
think about the number of

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.480
people Nathan Drake
has killed--

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.800
I mean you should feel
bad after awhile.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.220
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And then he's
so charismatic in the

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:42.960
cut-scenes.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.100
WOLFF DOBSON: It's like, I
murdered 27 people, and then I

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.980
made some jokes at my
ex-girlfriend, and then I

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.240
killed another 75 people.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.820
So no, I think that's true.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.440
I think the danger with having
zombies, and having the slow

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.340
guys who get hung up on the
train as they come at you--

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.920
besides the sort of breaking of
reality where you're like,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.335
even a zombie ought to be able
to get over a garden hose or a

00:14:04.335 --> 00:14:05.200
bench or something.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.630
But I think the other problem is
that if you're building an

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.380
AI, and you're new at it, this
is the default thing you do,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.910
which is make a bunch of guys
who come right at you.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.880
And then your default gameplay
is to back up

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.920
and shoot at them.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.260
And I'm so tired of that.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.840
COLT MCANLIS: You didn't like "I
Made a Game with Zombies In

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.070
It?" I thought that
was fantastic.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:26.540
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean--

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.070
I think--

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.720
[TIMER BEEPS]

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.230
TODD KERPELMAN: Time to reset
and go onto our next topic,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.690
which actually is zombie AI.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.800
And I think you had a
thesis about this.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.460
Let's hear it.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.310
WOLFF DOBSON: No, my thesis
was on educational child

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.550
development.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.540
TODD KERPELMAN: Boring.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.370
WOLFF DOBSON: I really think
that this concept--

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.400
I don't know if it's in
universal terms, but the term

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.430
that my crew calls it is
"kiting," where you're backing

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.290
and shooting a guy.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.696
Running back and forth and
shooting a guy and shooting a

00:14:51.696 --> 00:14:52.946
guy and shooting a guy.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.590
It's the default thing that
happens with this kind of

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.990
really simple behavior,
is kiting.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.970
And then the question is, are
you making kiting because it's

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.240
the thing that you
know how to make?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.080
Or is it because we want the
character to be kiting?

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.020
As far as I'm concerned, from
a design perspective, if a

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.330
slow guy is chasing you, and
you're turning around every

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.530
now and then and shooting
at them--

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.920
if you will consistently outrun
that guy, that's not a

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.680
game anymore.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.130
That's just like mowing
the lawn.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.350
In fact, I actually find some of
the horde zombie games make

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.690
me feel like I could
just be out raking.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.850
That'd be okay.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.930
I'd get the leaves off my lawn
and I'd feel better about

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.040
killing all these dudes.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.710
COLT MCANLIS: I'm sorry,
I didn't connect that.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.940
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Kiting
feels like a cheat.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.310
When you're playing it you're
like, I know that there's this

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.940
AI radius that I could just step
into it for a second, he

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.890
starts lurching towards
me, I step out of it.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.110
WOLFF DOBSON: And
I plug the guy.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It totally
breaks the game itself.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.280
COLT MCANLIS: Only if it's
the default, though.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.050
Because kiting-- if you
remember the original

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:01.030
Everquest, it was the thing to
do, to go get Spirit of the

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.060
Wolf and kite the drakes.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.330
WOLFF DOBSON: I already have
Spirit of the Wolf.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.910
COLT MCANLIS: You have
it all the time.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.120
When we get Wolf Spirit--

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.290
that was the thing.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.400
If you were two or three levels
below these drakes, you

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.510
couldn't beat them.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.310
But if you had Spirit of the
Wolf, you could actually run

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.390
and kite them around.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.340
So that was like, cool,
I found a hack.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.000
So I wouldn't say that
kiting is always bad.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.570
WOLFF DOBSON: I don't think it's
universally bad, but I

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.310
want it to be part of the
emotional part of the game.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.430
And I think in that
case it is.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.810
If you could imagine the game
where you have the giant--

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.450
well, like we were talking about
long ago, the big blue

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.040
monster in the "Pathways into
Darkness," where you're

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.470
backing up and unloading every
last clip into the guy.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.530
And the whole point of the
game is, that guy is

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.040
unstoppable and all you
have is this puny gun.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.110
And then all of a sudden, the
emotional content of this game

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.840
is the thing that you want.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.970
There was an old PlayStation
2 game, and I can't

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:51.550
remember the name.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.740
And I should have been looking
it up while you were talking,

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.830
where it was kind of hide and
seek where you played the

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.050
little scrawny girl being chased
by the giant monster.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.750
And every time the giant monster
showed up, you had to

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.150
throw yourself into--

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.250
basically just hide.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.640
You had to go hide inside a
closet or behind the curtain

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.650
or whatever, and cower
there and wait for

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.514
the monster to get--

00:17:10.514 --> 00:17:12.339
and then leave again.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.270
What was the name
of that game?

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.420
But it was a really
neat mechanic.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.540
Unfortunately, the game didn't
quite work, but it was a neat

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.710
mechanic, because it is--

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.980
all of a sudden, kiting
is really--

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.160
it was like, oh my God,
I set it off.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.210
I have to go hide.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.420
COLT MCANLIS: So, real
quick question.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.380
So you're the AI guy.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.860
So if I were writing AI
correctly for a horde of

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.180
zombies, what should
I be doing?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.920
What are some algorithms, what
are some techniques?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.740
There's some people on the video
right now that I know

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.920
cannot wait to write
a good zombie AI.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.450
What do they do?

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.900
WOLFF DOBSON: So the very core
thing you have to do with

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.100
zombies is that you don't want
to form a conga line.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.240
And the conga line is, I'm
running away, I'm kiting these

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.750
guys, and they all--

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.890
TODD KERPELMAN: Start
funneling in.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.190
WOLFF DOBSON: And then they
become this conga line.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:59.640
So the way around that is to
use a technology called

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.010
"flocking." There's a very
famous paper by Craig Reynolds

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.140
which was about boids,
B-O-I-D-S. And the idea with

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.190
boids is, when you see a flock
of birds flying around, they

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.770
don't hit each other.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.210
Well, if they do we don't
see it very often.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.220
COLT MCANLIS: Socially
awkward birds.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.080
WOLFF DOBSON: Hawkward.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.640
But when the birds fly around,
they're kind of

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.640
following each other.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.170
They're all going, and
there's a chaotic--

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.420
actually chaotic, mathematically
chaotic tumble

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.070
as the flock moves around.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.440
And what they're actually doing,
what Craig Reynold's

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:43.270
model was, is to find a guy,
find his nearest couple of

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.550
neighbors, and try to match
speed and orientation with

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.070
those guys.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.890
And it turns out that if
everybody is following that

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.600
very simple rule, you
get things to look

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.670
like flocking birds.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.070
He's got a whole site called
Steering Behaviors.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.690
And if you go check out Steering
Behaviors, it's all

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.570
kinds of very inexpensive ways
for dudes not to run into each

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.740
other as they're going along.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.300
And you usually combine--

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.710
so now you have a horde,
who all kind

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.560
of look like a horde--

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.210
they're all sort of spread apart
and they're not smacking

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.190
into each other--

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.950
and actually there's lots
of us more about this.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.490
In games like "Ages of Empires,"
there are actually

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.610
formations that they
like to form.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.580
So as they get close to each
other, it's like, oh, there's

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.590
a bunch of areas on the board
where they're like, I like to

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.080
form in these things.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.610
As they get close,
gravity kind of

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.780
pushes me into formation.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.790
And that's a way where you
otherwise end up with all of

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.970
your catapults in front and
all of your shield men in

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.020
back, because the catapults
got there first.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.000
You want them to-- oh, they've
got to the centroid of the

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.710
place they're supposed to go.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.180
Now you feel this gravity to
pull you into formation.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.320
COLT MCANLIS: And
with a flock--

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.000
I'm extending this.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You
can't do that.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.580
COLT MCANLIS: There's an
important part there.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.000
So with a zombie flock, who
controls where the flock goes?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.370
WOLFF DOBSON: All right, so
either you have a single

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:15.150
leader, or the zombie
has one more rule.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.960
So each zombie is standing there
and he's like, okay,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.160
Kerp's over here and he's moving
this direction, so I

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.440
move in that direction.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.690
And the way you do that--

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.950
it's a little bit of trig, but
basically you calculate his

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.930
vector, my vector, and the
speed, whatever, and then we

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:29.980
add them all together.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.240
We'll post links afterwards
to some discussion of it.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.330
But you also apply a vector
in the direction

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.660
that you want to go.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.890
You average these vectors
together.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.240
I want to be over there, but
Kerp's in the way, so I'll

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.720
blend around it.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.720
And if you think about the way
like when I walk around, and--

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.200
except for when I walked into
the studio this morning.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.170
I just about knocked
over the camera.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.210
When you walk in, or when you're
walking around, I don't

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.750
sit there and like calculate a
plan to avoid every single

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.490
obstacle and then stick to that
plan as I walk around.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.930
Instead I walk forward,
and like, oh

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:08.750
there's a thing there.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.270
Okay, I'm going to
walk around that.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.900
And that's essentially what
flocking is doing.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.180
It's like, well I want to go
that way but Kerp's in the

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.950
way, so I'll walk with him
for a little bit until

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.200
he's out of the way.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.720
And the closer I get to Kerp,
the stronger Kerp's vector to

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.100
push me back away from him is.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.670
TODD KERPELMAN: That's because
I don't shower.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.230
WOLFF DOBSON: So true.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:35.870
But once I've made my distance
from everybody, then it's like

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.140
the gravity vector pulling me
toward-- the pull towards the

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.560
target now is much stronger.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.190
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So it's some
form of weighted average?

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.160
You increase the weight with
your flock buddies based on

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.920
your radius from them?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.570
So a smaller radius like the
more it's like going in a way

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.270
that is much more important for
me and then when you're

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.710
kind of that like that nice
minimum there then you're like

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.340
true vector takes over?

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.660
WOLFF DOBSON: And likewise,
the other way around, too.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.885
Which is that, if I'm too far
away from Kerp, I might feel a

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:05.500
little gravity to come back
to him, because I

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.490
want to stay in formation.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.570
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So there's
a minimum on that curve.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:09.870
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, stop it.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.410
We have to move on.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:12.680
Sorry.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.780
COLT MCANLIS: Cool
stuff, though.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.960
TODD KERPELMAN: Very
interesting stuff.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.820
Post links.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.550
We can all make our own
flocking behavior.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.750
WOLFF DOBSON: Flocking
is really fun.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.050
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We should
have a flock off.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.050
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Next
show-- flock off.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.400
WOLFF DOBSON: This is a lot
of places we can go

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.430
here, but we're not.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:35.050
COLT MCANLIS: Probably cancel
us in the next one.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.350
TODD KERPELMAN: You had
me on flock buddy.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:47.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.352 --> 00:22:49.900
TODD KERPELMAN: What is that
your scariest moment that

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.825
you've run into in a game?

00:22:50.825 --> 00:22:55.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.440
TODD KERPELMAN: Scariest
moment in a game.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.890
You're not allowed to say the
"Resident Evil" one, dogs,

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.650
because that's what everyone
thinks of first.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.660
And you get bonus points if
your answer involves a

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.300
non-traditionally scary game.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.070
But you don't have to go
for the bonus points.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.960
I'm not going to go for
the bonus points.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.540
WOLFF DOBSON: I think we have
to start with John.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.230
TODD KERPELMAN: We'll
start with John.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.730
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Well, I'm
going to go back to my

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.040
standard game.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.686
Demon Souls.

00:23:15.686 --> 00:23:21.500
[LAUGHER]

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.990
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I haven't played
it in months, but the

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.080
DLC just came out,
so I'm going to

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.830
start playing it again.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.690
No, but actually there was in
"Demon Souls," which is "Dark

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.850
Souls 1," there's a stage that
you spawn into to the world,

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.800
and you're walking down this
tunnel, and there's just this

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.550
massive dragon.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.370
Way, way, way big.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.615
Essentially, the dragon takes
over the entire environment

00:23:43.615 --> 00:23:44.810
that you're in.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.760
And you're walking and fireballs
are coming out, and

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.490
you're like, what am
I supposed to do?

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.870
You can't even get close
to this guy.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.050
And that was just terrifying.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.030
It takes so long and eventually
you realize--

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.420
you don't actually attack him.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.740
You use the environment
to attack him.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.900
And that's the only way to beat
him, but for the longest

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.500
time you're sitting there
like, what am

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:03.990
I supposed to do?

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.000
You're shooting arrows at him
and you're just getting

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.510
slaughtered, again and
again and again.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.110
TODD KERPELMAN: Cole.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.950
Scariest moment in a game.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.730
COLT MCANLIS: I'm trying
to get the bonus

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.180
points on this one.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.810
I don't know if you're going
to give them to me.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:15.710
WOLFF DOBSON: "Mario Galaxy."

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.650
COLT MCANLIS: "Metroid." The
first "Metroid," when you

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.230
actually encounter a Metroid.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.460
You go through this entire game,
you fight Ridley, you go

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.310
through all the areas.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.860
And then when you first
encounter the Metroid, you

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.760
realize what that thing
can do to you.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.970
The only way either kill
it is either to freeze

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.040
it and rocket it--

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.890
and if you miss it, it
attaches to you.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:37.470
I remember inching, pixel by
pixel, through that game.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.050
Because as soon as that
Metroid-- as soon as one of

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.220
his pixels came on screen,
he was on top of you.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.830
And man, I remember
just being frozen.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.630
Just the haunting concept
was like--

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:47.790
this Metroid's going to
get me, this Metroid's

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.070
going to get me.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.830
I inched the entire way.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.480
In the follow up for
the Game Boy, the

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.180
"Metroid 2," same concept.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:55.960
Because "Metroid 2" there were
Metroids everywhere.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That
was one of the best

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.570
Metroid games ever.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.810
COLT MCANLIS: It was amazing.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.390
Even though it was like this
the whole time. "Super

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.200
Metroid" was the same way.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.610
When you finally beat
everything and

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.810
you got down into--

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.470
there was a four-tier zigzag
until you got to the final

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.010
Mother Brain room.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.650
It was still just as haunting
as it ever was, just this

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.670
desolate environment and you
know-- you know that there's a

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.894
Metroid like seven pixels away,
and you're about to be

00:25:19.894 --> 00:25:20.770
in a firefight.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.290
Man, that was just--

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.170
to this day, If I see something
shaped like a

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.870
Metroid, I just wet myself.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.220
TODD KERPELMAN: We will have to
experiment with that later.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.900
WOLFF DOBSON: I have
one right here.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.180
TODD KERPELMAN: So for me,
I'm going to pick a

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.590
couple moments in games--

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.090
traditionally scary games--

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.190
"Dead Space" and "Resident
Evil 2," I

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.630
think, where the game--

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.040
the entire way, lulls
you into thinking

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.200
certain areas are safe.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.060
Like in "Dead Space," it was
this save point place, or

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.960
maybe it was the store
machine or something.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.080
It was the same point.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.330
And in "Resident Evil," it was
that loading animation while

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.160
the door opened and you got
into the next room.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.600
In both of those, there was
one point in each of those

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.570
games where all of a sudden,
a monster came in.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.060
When you were like, okay, I'm
relaxed, I'm at a save point.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.730
I get out and all of a sudden,
a monster drops

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:03.500
down from the screen.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.310
Or in "Resident Evil," you open
up the door, the loading

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.550
animation goes, and then
two zombies come in.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.660
And both of those just freaked
me out, because up until that

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.160
point, the game had done such a
good job of training me that

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.790
when you're at this point, you
can relax, it is safe.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.140
WOLFF DOBSON: That's such a good
emotional manipulation.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.600
There are horror games where
they play the safe music, and

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.780
you're in the safe place, and
you feel it for awhile, and

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.580
then they turn on you.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.660
But they wait for like half
the game to do it to you.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.900
It's so important to have
those ups and downs.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.450
Otherwise you're just always
being attacked,

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.500
and it's not scary.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.570
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm waiting for
the moment when the actual

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.020
safe room--

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.480
in "Resident Evil," the safe
room with the typewriter and

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:41.860
the good music--

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.050
WOLFF DOBSON: I can hum
the music if you like.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.110
I still associate that music
with a happy place.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.970
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.540
One day, that place isn't
going to be happy.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.790
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.780
WOLFF DOBSON: So mine
concerns a story.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.260
So back in the Dreamcast days,
there was a game called

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.980
"Carrier." And if you go back
and play it now, it is

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.060
comically, comically
silly looking.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.100
But at the time, my imagination
was doing a lot of

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.950
work for me.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.620
I remember I was living in San
Francisco, and I was playing

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.110
at night, waiting for my wife
to come home from chorus.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:16.090
I'm sitting there, and there are
these little baby things

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.890
that come out of a pod,
and they sort of

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.310
crawl along the ground.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.720
You have to--

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.340
you have your little arc welder
that you're sitting

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.220
there zapping, walking
slowly backwards,

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.090
zapping these things.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.670
And kind of walking over them.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.080
And I didn't feel like
I was frightened.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.810
I know how to--

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:32.520
I was kiting them.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.290
I knew what to do.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.780
You come back up and
shoot these guys.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.106
And then you set off another
one, back up

00:27:36.106 --> 00:27:36.870
and shoot the guys.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.270
They made this kind of gross
noise as you're doing it, and

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.280
I had to go back and forth
across this corridor full of

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.670
those things, like three
or four times.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.200
The game was awash
in backtracking

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.940
So then my wife comes home, so
I go and save, and I go into

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.640
the kitchen to start
washing the dishes.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.580
And I'm holding the sponge, and
I'm wiping the thing, and

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.610
then I hear this squish
behind me.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:02.660
And I just spun around, and I
grabbed the sponge, and suds

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.295
are going everywhere.

00:28:03.295 --> 00:28:05.400
I'm like, what are you doing?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.160
And she's like, oh there
was a nectarine.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.910
It was moldy, so I dropped it.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.770
I was just like--

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.370
[HEAVY BREATHING]

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.340
WOLFF DOBSON: And I just hadn't
realized, in three

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.110
hours, my anxiety had been
completely maxed out.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.607
If I'd been holding a gun
instead of a sponge, there

00:28:20.607 --> 00:28:23.290
would have been six holes in
the kitchen at that point.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.200
COLT MCANLIS: I like to
cook with a handgun.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.190
Omelettes taste better
with a glock.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.500
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm like,
bam, dishes are done.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Guys,
we do have some

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.260
feedback from Youtube.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.700
Someone says "Demon Souls"
is a masterpiece.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.550
So we do have a John
McCutchan fan.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.570
Not expecting that.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.520
COLT MCANLIS: Is the person
wearing plaid?

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.020
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
[? Rodimir ?]

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.720
[? Pitsoff. ?]

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.250
[? Rodimir ?]

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.840
has not discussed what
he's wearing.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.180
And then we have--

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.210
TODD KERPELMAN: What
are you wearing?

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.200
WOLFF DOBSON: No, no, no.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.550
Mute.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.780
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.040
says "Super Mario" was
extremely scary.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.160
It didn't specify
which platform.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.140
TODD KERPELMAN: I'd like some
more details about what was

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.480
scary about "Super Mario."

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.340
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: When I got
my first NES, I was

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.880
like six years old.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.140
And I could barely play video
games, and because of that,

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.800
Mario was actually terrifying.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.230
You get to the world 8-1, you
have to do four jumps in

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:27.340
succession, and there was just a
pillar one Mario-width wide.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.670
And having to do that,
when I finally--

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.450
I would get terrified, because
I've only got three men.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.730
And I'd have to go all the
way back to 1-1 when

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.110
I screw this up.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.360
Eventually you figure out the
rhythm and that's fine, but

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.000
when I was a far worse
game-player than I am today,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.735
it was terrifying.

00:29:43.735 --> 00:29:45.450
WOLFF DOBSON: Would you say
you were more anxious or

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.150
frightened?

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.420
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, I was
probably more anxious.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.140
WOLFF DOBSON: Anxious is a
slightly different emotion.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.310
My story was a little bit more
about anxiety rather than

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.330
fear, but it's the same
sort of thing.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.970
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It was fear of
having to start the game

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.790
again, because there's
no save point.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.160
WOLFF DOBSON: So you're just
going back to that, over and

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.360
over again, with Demon Souls.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.390
This is what I'm hearing.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.560
It's like, the horror
of your life is

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.790
having to redo something.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.700
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Anxiety

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.660
WOLFF DOBSON: So actually I
would add one more, which is

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:17.960
"Minecraft." It can be scary,
because you've built this safe

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.720
world, and all a sudden there's
dudes it in your

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.660
castle, blowing it up.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.160
And you're like, how
did that happen?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.400
But actually I was playing with
my daughter, and we were

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.420
running around, and we fell into
a cave, and fell really

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.310
far down this cave.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.710
And we're running around.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.220
And we'd never actually
done much caving--

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.530
or spelunking, shall I say--

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.660
up until that point.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.450
You get down there, and there
are lot more monsters, and you

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.480
can hear them crawling around
in the [? weeds. ?]

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.290
As I was like, yeah okay, just
do my pickax, just dig our way

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:44.930
out of this.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.020
But she was like, I don't
like it here.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.450
This is a bad place.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.320
Let's go up and sleep and it
will be daylight again.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So "Minecraft"
for me, was really

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.510
scary in two ways.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.375
One, at night, when you have
to go into your safe house.

00:30:57.375 --> 00:31:00.370
And you just know that if they
get through your defenses,

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.770
it's out of control.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.330
There's not much you can
do at that point.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:07.930
And then two, sometimes I fell
deep in a cave, and whenever I

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.110
do make it back up to the
surface, I don't think I'll

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.530
ever be able to find
my house again.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.140
WOLFF DOBSON: There's a level
of unhappiness there.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.330
I know you're talking about.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.210
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I guess
I'll just start anew.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.040
TODD KERPELMAN: Claustrophobic,
scared of the

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.490
dark, lost--

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.320
WOLFF DOBSON: And monsters
growling as

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.510
you're digging around.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.230
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And you might
dig in one direction for the

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:29.140
longest time, thinking you're
going up, and then you hit the

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.250
purple rock where you can't
really break through.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:37.160
And you're like, I need to find
the shortest path around

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.100
this huge mound of
unbreakable rock.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.020
Only to get up and see that,
a, your house is probably

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.820
destroyed and you'll never
find it again.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.580
WOLFF DOBSON: Or you
accidentally dig under a lake.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.660
COLT MCANLIS: What would make
that is if you climbed all the

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.200
way back to the surface and you
found out that apes were

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.550
running the place.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.190
TODD KERPELMAN: What a twist.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.890
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Spoiler.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.240
TODD KERPELMAN: All
right, let's move

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.570
on to our next question.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.675
Another zombie one or
the vampire one?

00:32:05.675 --> 00:32:07.110
TODD KERPELMAN: How are
we doing on time?

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Good.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:07.960
2:36.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.550
I think we got time.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.910
Let's go with one
more zombie one.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.750
In our various forms of media,
books, games, or movies, do we

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:22.330
prefer the traditional slow,
shambling zombies, or the "28

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.010
Days Later," "Dawn of the Dead"
fast-running zombies.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.340
COLT MCANLIS: I'm just
going to jump out.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.230
"28 Days Later" fast
zombie, right.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.880
So the fast zombie is to the
regular zombie as shiny

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.840
vampire is to regular vampire.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.985
This is an abomination.

00:32:36.985 --> 00:32:40.790
Listen, a zombie is not-- a
single zombie is not the

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.640
reason you're afraid
of zombies.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.130
It's the horde.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:44.880
It's the flock.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.570
It's this unending wave
of deathness.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.290
What kills you with zombies
is not one guy.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.290
It's the concept that you're
never going to get out.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.740
That's what's terrifying with
zombies, and you know what?

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.350
Fast zombies break
that entirely.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.380
Because it's just a different
ballgame.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.093
It's a sparkly vampire
of zombies.

00:33:02.093 --> 00:33:03.490
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't think
that necessarily breaks it,

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.330
but I agree with you.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.290
What's frightening about zombies
is not just that

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.190
there's zombies near you.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.010
It's that like 99% of all
humans on the planet are

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.290
zombies, and it's kind
of hopeless.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.370
You're in a shopping mall, and
you're up on the roof and

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.260
looking out, and it's like,
well, I see a lot of zombies

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.810
and I see one dude way over
there who's not a zombie.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.200
And then it's just
a sea of zombies.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.220
And you're like, what am I
even trying to do here?

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.200
I can outrun these guys,
but where do I run to?

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.590
There's nothing left.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.720
That's the frightening part
of zombies for me.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.993
COLT MCANLIS: The cool
thing is half of

00:33:35.993 --> 00:33:37.080
them are your neighbors.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.815
I served with Ted in the PTA.

00:33:39.815 --> 00:33:41.820
Now I get to hit him
with a shovel.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.230
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Again.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:46.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.450
TODD KERPELMAN: I think
you've turned me to

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.080
your point of view.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.330
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.300
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm
going to stand

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.320
with multi-speed zombies.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.140
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm going to
stand with multi-speed

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.260
zombies, because I
think part of the

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.660
zombie fear isn't just--

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.409
I mean, there's the concept that
zombies were the sort of

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.460
Cold War fear of conformity
kind of metaphor.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.350
You're like, what?

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:15.380
It's like, no, no, no, really.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.403
And also, again, it was reused
as consumerism, like on "Dawn

00:34:19.403 --> 00:34:21.500
of the Dead" and things
like that.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.780
But for me, it's about
infection.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.000
It's about SARS.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.760
It's about all the bad things
that can happen to you.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.170
And one bite and you're hosed.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.429
To me, that's the zombie fear.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.949
And so speedy zombies are just
fast-moving things that want

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.800
to infect me, as opposed
to slow-moving things.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.389
COLT MCANLIS: But again,
it breaks the mold.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:48.150
So if you have a sparkly vampire
that doesn't blow up

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.239
in the daylight, that
breaks the rules.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.429
Now, if you've got
a fast zombie--

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:53.270
WOLFF DOBSON: They have rings.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:54.560
They have a ring that
saves them .

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.960
Haven't you been watching?

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.590
COLT MCANLIS: No, that's
the Vampire Diaries.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.050
That's a different one.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:59.230
WOLFF DOBSON: See, you
have been watching.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.880
[GROANS]

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.130
WOLFF DOBSON: Busted!

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.390
TODD KERPELMAN: Do these
vampires wear bikinis when

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.490
they go out fighting?

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.580
COLT MCANLIS: They should.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.660
Back to the point.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.630
The fact is that--

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.170
WOLFF DOBSON: Vampire
tan lines.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:18.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.650
COLT MCANLIS: So you've got
a fast-moving, infectious

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:25.540
organism that doesn't respond
to gunfire or being on fire.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.000
That breaks the mold.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.550
Like you can--

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.130
COLT MCANLIS: I'm sorry,
but you are wrong.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.970
And you think that
part of sales OK

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.410
WOLFF DOBSON: Audience, you
have to help me here.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.160
Tell us how wrong Colt is.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: If you
were Patient Zero--

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.650
who do you eat first?

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.950
How do you spread yourself
most effectively?

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.260
WOLFF DOBSON: Dude, there
was a cool little game.

00:35:53.841 --> 00:35:55.510
TODD KERPELMAN: This
is a good topic.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.450
Let's reset and start this.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.950
TODD KERPELMAN: So am I actually
looking to spread?

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.105
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Well, your brain
has been consumed by the

00:36:04.105 --> 00:36:06.200
zombie virus, and you just have
the impulse to spread.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.420
WOLFF DOBSON: You start
with Madagascar.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.520
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes,
that is true.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.900
WOLFF DOBSON: You haven't
played the plague game?

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.225
TODD KERPELMAN: You've always
got to start in Madagascar,

00:36:15.225 --> 00:36:17.770
because they shut off their
ports right away.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.240
WOLFF DOBSON: The President of
Madagascar is like, somebody

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.170
sniffled somewhere.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.750
We're shutting the ports.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:24.570
TODD KERPELMAN: The internet
knows what

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.630
we're talking about.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.730
You guys know.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Madagascar.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.540
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You want to
spread as fast as possible and

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.690
as robustly as possible, so you
don't pick just one class

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:38.990
of the population.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.600
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.620
I got to go to an airport.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.470
I feel like that's where
I got to go.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There's
a lot of security

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.860
at airports, though.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.150
There's a lot of guns.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.200
Let's say you're
in a hospital.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:48.940
You're sick.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.420
You just wake up and now
you've got to eat.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.980
And you are the last surviving
member of your new race.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.500
COLT MCANLIS: Ooh,
I like that.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.120
That's creepy.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.190
TODD KERPELMAN: So really,
it's about

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.100
it's about me surviving.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.180
COLT MCANLIS: As a new zombie
that can affect anything.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.470
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You don't
want to go extinct.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.720
Your entire species would go
extinct if you don't succeed.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.110
TODD KERPELMAN: The thing about

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.070
waking up at the hospital--

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.810
the nice thing there is, there's
probably a bunch of

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.150
victims ready.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:17.230
In bad, sedated, not really
ready to fight back.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: But are they
going to spread very well?

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:20.200
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah
it depends.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.460
A lot of these guys-- well, I
guess it depends on the virus.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.360
If I'm sick and I get bitten
by zombie virus, does that

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.100
make the healthy again except
for the zombie part?

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't think
you've addressed the taste of

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.220
the people you're biting.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.520
If you're at a hospital,
I don't know if

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.090
you'd want to eat them.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.260
What about a jail?

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.770
In jail, you're in a confined
space, the people are forced

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.810
to be there, closed
confined quarters.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:44.740
Something to think about.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.780
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm not sure
about the jail, because it's

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.710
very easy to bottle in.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.972
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: If I was a
zombie, I would just be like,

00:37:50.972 --> 00:37:52.765
who's going to taste the best?

00:37:52.765 --> 00:37:54.170
I won't spoil my appetite.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.810
I'm going to really
think about this.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.570
COLT MCANLIS: So you'd go to
library, because you're going

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:57.420
for brains, right?

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.760
So you'd want the beefiest
brains that

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.500
spend the most exercise.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.430
Libraries, universities.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:03.110
That's the best that I--

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: But you
know veal, right?

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:05.140
COLT MCANLIS: Google,
yeah , Google.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.020
You would start at Google.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.760
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Just like veal,
you don't want a brain

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.990
that's been too exercised,
because then

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.170
it's a little tough.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.645
WOLFF DOBSON: It's
a little stringy.

00:38:13.645 --> 00:38:18.120
So there was a game called
Influenza, which I think was a

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.600
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.230
game.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.600
And yeah, your job is to
basically take control of

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.870
people who are sick and
have them go and

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.990
sneeze or throw up.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.940
And you have upgrades like Vomit
Linger and things like

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.290
this, which is like how long--

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:36.150
WOLFF DOBSON: When you're
working on mechanics for your

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.575
games, make sure you have
that check box.

00:38:38.575 --> 00:38:40.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
just this perfume.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.350
COLT MCANLIS: That's our new
team shirts +1 Vomit Linger.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.060
GDL Google Games Chat.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.420
TODD KERPELMAN: So John,
you didn't say--

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.280
who would you bite first?

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.460
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think
I would go for the

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.930
least mobile first.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.620
WOLFF DOBSON: He's just lazy.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.850
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm going to
increase my numbers really

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.950
easily without much
threat, without

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:04.330
exerting a lot of energy.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.390
But again, we're going to be
this mass of slow-moving--

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.970
you can take the guys
off the edge.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.900
It's like a family
of penguins.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.640
WOLFF DOBSON: It's a phalanx,
if you will.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:21.090
Have you read "World War Z?" If
you have not, if you like

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.470
supernatural books
or action books,

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.940
"World War Z" is amazing.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.820
But yeah, this is one
of the problems.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.840
It's basically like,
okay, you've gained

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.980
control of your zombie--

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.280
if you've got all the survivors
in one place, now

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.890
you need to rid the
world of zombies.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:37.850
How do you go about that?

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.050
And they have an interesting
solution.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.960
I won't spoil it.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.450
"World War Z"-- read it.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.090
TODD KERPELMAN: I think that's
our fifth topic.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.680
And we covered that
pretty well.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.830
Except I'm still thinking
airport.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:53.800
I'd still go for the airport.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800
There's a great you get there

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.050
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:03.030
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Certainly, if
you could get some planes

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.500
taking off with a couple
zombies, so that by the time

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.400
they land, it's like a
zombie party plane.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.620
WOLFF DOBSON: How is that
plane going to land?

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.670
Reinforced cockpit doors.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.950
So only the pilot will
be able to land.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.790
The pilot then has a choice.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.880
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Hopefully
the pilot chooses to--

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.430
WOLFF DOBSON: But if it does
that, then they're just going

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.620
to bite sharks, and then
you have zombie sharks.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.940
COLT MCANLIS: But that's
what you want.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.700
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think
you just won the game.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.570
COLT MCANLIS: With
freakin' lasers.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.150
TODD KERPELMAN: We're going to
finish out with "what are you

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.870
playing." We'll start
with Wolff first.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.670
WOLFF DOBSON: So I've been
playing a whole bunch of

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.860
things, but the game that struck
me as an interesting

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.750
discussion topic is "Horn."
Just came out--

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.315
I've been playing
on my Nexus 7.

00:40:44.315 --> 00:40:45.780
It's published by Zynga.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.270
It's a very interesting game.

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:53.530
It's got touches of "Ico" in it,
or however you say that.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.890
Which is the old PlayStation 2
game where you have the space

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.520
princess that you
carry around--

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.670
drag around by her hand.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.760
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: "King
of Space."

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.900
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, and
then solve puzzles.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:09.040
And it also has, definitely,
overtones of "Zelda." What

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.800
struck me about it as I was
playing it, and I was enjoying

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.700
it, and it's fun--

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.910
is that it signaled to me that
the era of second or third

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:23.080
generation PlayStation 2 games
are now available mobile.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.470
I was sitting there playing on
my Nexus 7, which is not a

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.100
particularly expensive
device and thinking

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.980
wow, this looks nice.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.100
It's like late PlayStation 2--

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.570
oh wow, we've come--

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.680
that was quick.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.090
So that's what I found very
interesting about it.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.110
It's fun so far.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.790
The combat mechanics are
very touch-sensitive.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.450
TODD KERPELMAN: Actually, that
makes me look forward to being

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:48.630
able to play some of the other
classic PlayStation 2 or DS or

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:50.690
whatever games that I never
got around to playing.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I've
seen a couple of them.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.860
They ported for the--

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.620
shoot, what is the
name of the game.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.470
Come back to me and
I'll have it.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:07.750
TODD KERPELMAN: So, still
playing "Skyrim." But I also

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:08.410
started playing--

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.530
TODD KERPELMAN: I actually, two
days ago was like, crap, I

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.470
got to play something
different.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.450
So that when I go to this--

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.460
WOLFF DOBSON: We have
a terrible job.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.430
We're forced to play games so we
have something interesting

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.170
to talk about.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.130
TODD KERPELMAN: I had work to
do, but it was like, I can't

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:27.330
do my work.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.810
I've got to play something
different.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.150
And so I played "Faster
Than Light," FTL.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.920
I started playing that.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.330
And boy, I die a lot.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:37.570
WOLFF DOBSON: You have to
play a game that we

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:38.570
haven't talked about.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.800
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's a rule.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.770
TODD KERPELMAN: I do have to
say, my crew is terrible at

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.690
fighting fires, I think.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You use the
airlocks to fight the fires.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.480
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, except
that apparently, one of the

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.140
fires broke out in the
oxygen station.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.050
WOLFF DOBSON: I feel like
there's a secondary safety

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.300
protocol we weren't following.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.880
TODD KERPELMAN: I emptied
out the air, I

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.690
closed all the doors.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.900
To fire was out, and I was
like, now what do I do.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.710
I was left without oxygen.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.020
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Get every
person into that room.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:15.210
TODD KERPELMAN: I tried, and
they didn't make it.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.410
WOLFF DOBSON: I like playing
simulators where everyone dies

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.220
in the cold, black
void of space.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I was talking
to Vince about "FTL," and he

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.450
was saying eventually you can
get a teleporter, and you can

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.030
teleport to the enemy ship
and fight hand-to-hand.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.750
He said he did that, and he left
his automated attack bots

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.400
going, and they destroyed
the ship.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:37.020
The enemy ships and his
whole crew went.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.970
You have to make sure that if
you teleport over, you get

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.540
back over before
the ship goes.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.830
TODD KERPELMAN: Colt, what
are you playing?

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.000
Besides "Dark Legends."

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.850
COLT MCANLIS: Well, actually
I have been playing "Dark

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:47.040
Legends," because--

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.220
TODD KERPELMAN: It's for work.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Well
it actually is.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.430
So since last episode, we said
hey, let's show off a great

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.160
Halloween game.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:00.631
And I was level one when I
started a week and a half ago.

00:44:00.631 --> 00:44:03.090
TODD KERPELMAN: I thought you
had mailed these guys, was

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.190
hanging and shooting booze.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.770
COLT MCANLIS: I've been playing
the entire time.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.240
And you know what?

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.670
The game has gotten better and
better and better the longer

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:09.370
I've played it.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.550
It's really hard to
communicate what--

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Are they
pushing updates?

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.180
COLT MCANLIS: All of
the space-time--

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.880
sorry, I mean the content--

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.360
my experience with the game has
gotten better and better.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.310
You've got to remember, I was
addicted to "Everquest" back

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:20.580
in the day.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.520
My father and I, we each
had two accounts.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.230
And that was our father-son
bonding, was we would sit down

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.340
and play "Everquest" together.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.290
And then I had to do some stuff,
and so he took over all

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.700
four accounts, and then got
two more computers and was

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.880
able to six box an "Everquest"
guild by himself.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.960
Padre, if you're watching, mad
props for your MMO skills.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.250
WOLFF DOBSON: I thought this
is why you had children.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.270
Daddy needs you to tank.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.840
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I need
a gold farm now.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.020
COLT MCANLIS: I've heard
that phrase before.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.675
So I am very clued in to
what makes good MMOs.

00:44:54.675 --> 00:44:57.240
And "Dark Legends" got cooler
and cooler and cooler.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.260
Because it was a different
mechanic.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.390
It was originally built for
mobile, and so it took a

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.760
little bit of time for me to
understand why they changed

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.480
some things, and how it
translated to the native

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.410
client build.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.690
But the more I got into it, the
more it made sense, and

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.090
the more fun I started having
with it, so yeah, I've been

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:13.600
playing "Dark Legends,"
believe it or not.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.480
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I got a
new game this week.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:22.030
Yes, I picked up the new
"X-COM." It's great.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.900
I never really got
into "X-COM" when

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.290
it was a DOS game.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.610
And it's now the exact same game
I watched my friends play

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.900
as a kid, and I'm loving it.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.120
And the transition to
3D is excellent.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.780
It's still the exact
same game.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:36.850
You're building out
your base--

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.030
WOLFF DOBSON: I hear
the interface--

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.830
I mean, the interface in the DOS
one was fairly terrifying.

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:42.470
TODD KERPELMAN: You had to spend
half your time making

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.440
sure you ordered
enough bullets.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.480
WOLFF DOBSON: There was that,
and just the grid of buttons,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.480
with incomprehensible
icons on them.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's still
a very complex game.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.530
It's still grid-based, but
you're working with an-- at

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.050
least, I'm playing on the PS3,
so I'm working with an analog

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.350
stick, and they do a really
great job of mapping the

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:05.650
controls to the console.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:08.090
And it is a lot of fun.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:10.270
TODD KERPELMAN: How you named
your squad after either

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:11.820
friends, coworkers,
famous people?

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.060
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm too lazy.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.290
I'm too lazy to do that.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:17.270
Although I have a friend who
keeps telling me on Facebook--

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:20.710
he's like, you just
died last night.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:21.810
WOLFF DOBSON: I do
all the time.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.570
I name all my characters
after my coworkers.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.285
TODD KERPELMAN: I started doing
that in "FTL," but they

00:46:25.285 --> 00:46:25.810
die too quickly.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:26.850
It's not worth it.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:27.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: In FTL, they're
really disposable.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.102
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:29.102 --> 00:46:30.570
WOLFF DOBSON: Have you
seen the way I play?

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.880
The way I play, would like
because we defeated visit we

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.930
defeated the UFO attack on the
bodies of thousands of special

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:39.670
forces people.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.280
I don't know how you
play "X-COM."

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.690
COLT MCANLIS: The famous Zapp
Brannigan quote is that, "How

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:45.230
did you defeat the killbots?"

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:47.110
WOLFF DOBSON: "They had a
built-in kill limit, and so I

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.950
just sent wave after wave
of my own men."

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.920
COLT MCANLIS: Until they
reset themselves.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.580
WOLFF DOBSON: And we'd do
it again, right men?

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.300
Men?

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.010
COLT MCANLIS: Love me
some Zapp Brannigan.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:59.820
"Futurama." More episodes,
please, please, please.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.550
WOLFF DOBSON: Every mission I
go on is a suicide mission.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.370
And again, this is also my
motto playing "X-COM" and

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:07.020
similar games.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.810
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So "X-COM,"
unlike FTL, in "X-COM" I'm

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:13.560
really enjoying the RPG mechanic
of my players,

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.100
despite being too lazy
to name them.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.900
WOLFF DOBSON: I love you, AA.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.930
COLT MCANLIS: Do you put
all of them in plaid?

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:22.600
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: They come
with preset, good names.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.690
And some of them I have almost
max rank, and I'm pretty

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.190
concerned about them, just
because they're so powerful.

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.740
COLT MCANLIS: I can just imagine
John being like, okay

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.570
everybody, well we're
in plaid today.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:36.710
My children.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.690
I'm bundling you up and then
throwing you into the fray.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.890
WOLFF DOBSON: Quick, there's
a fire in the oxygen room.

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.310
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to vent it.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:46.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.640
WOLFF DOBSON: Little frozen,
plaid bodies in space.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: In FTL, they
have the plaid meter.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:52.580
Spend enough time on my ship.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.924
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:53.924 --> 00:47:54.898
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: They're
in plaid.

00:47:54.898 --> 00:47:56.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.915
I think that is a perfect
note to end this

00:47:59.915 --> 00:48:01.460
Halloween episode on.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.025
Remember kids, forward this
video your friends or Louis

00:48:04.025 --> 00:48:05.275
Gray will get you.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.940
WOLFF DOBSON: Louis
Gray, Louis Gray.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.860
Don't say his name three
times or he'll pop up.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.410
TODD KERPELMAN: And we will
see you in two weeks.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:19.660
Happy Halloween.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:33.867
