00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.171
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.439
I'M JON STEWART!

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:10.511
MY GUEST TONIGHT ONE ANGELINA
JOLIE, DIRECTOR OF THE NEW FILM,

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.012
IT'S GREAT "UNBROKEN".

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:17.084
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR YESTERDAY.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:24.291
I BEGAN THE SHOW SOMEWHAT
OVERWROUGHT BECAUSE NO ONE

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.226
INVOLVED IN THE DEATH OF ERIC
GARNER WAS NEVER INDICTED.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.496
AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE
I WAS WRONG.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.965
&gt;&gt; THE PERSON WHO DID THE
VIDEOGRAPHY OF THIS.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.233
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; THAT PERSON

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:37.304
WAS INDICTED BY A GRAND JURY IN
STATEN ISLAND OVER GUN CHARGES.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:41.175
&gt;&gt; Jon: GET IT? SOMEONE WAS
INDICTED. THEY GOT

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:46.680
THE SHOOTER... OF THE VIDEO...

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.918
LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU KIDS
OUT THERE.

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:55.389
PHOTOGRAPHING CRIME DOES NOT
PAY.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.658
BUT WHAT'S SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT THIS IS THAT FOR MONTHS

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.593
WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH
ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WITH

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.295
DARREN WILSON AND MICHAEL BROWN
IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:02.095
DID BROWN HAVE HIS HANDS UP?

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.597
DID HE NOT HAVE HIS HANDS UP?

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.466
WAS WILSON AFRAID FOR HIS LIFE
WHEN HE KILLED BROWN?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.937
REASONABLE PEOPLE --
AS WELL AS PLENTY OF (BLEEP)

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.708
ONES -- COULD --
OKAY, THEIR PICTURES DIDN'T COME

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.475
UP.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.713
(LAUGHTER)
-- COULD REACH DIFFERENT

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:20.814
CONCLUSIONS.

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:24.084
BUT IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO
AMBIGUITY.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:30.023
EVEN WITH CLARITY THOUGH, PEOPLE
CONTINUE TO BLAME

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:34.561
THIS DEATH ON ANYTHING BUT THE
INJUSTICES OF A FLAWED SYSTEM.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:35.028
&gt;&gt; WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS THAT MAN WAS

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:37.030
A BIG MAN.

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:39.566
&gt;&gt; HE'S A HUGE INDIVIDUAL.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.708
&gt;&gt; GARNER OUTWEIGHED THE OFFICER
BY PROBABLY 150 POUNDS.

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:48.375
&gt;&gt; Jon: HE IS GIGANTOR! HE IS A
FLOAT IN A PARADE.

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.843
THEY HAD TO BRING HIM
DOWN!

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:53.747
HE WAS THE ABOMINABLE BRO MAN!

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.315
OK YEAH, HE OUTWEIGHED "ONE" COP
BY 150 POUNDS.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.717
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER FIVE COPS?
OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST HOW MUCH

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.453
RACIAL PROGRESS AMERICA HAS
MADE?

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.954
YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE BLACK
PEOPLE WERE ONLY THREE-FIFTHS OF

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:02.155
A WHITE PERSON.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.393
NOW, THEY'RE LIKE SIX!

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:10.163
UNLESS THERE'S SOME OTHER REASON
HIS SIZE WAS RELEVANT?

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:13.500
&gt;&gt; IF HE HAD NOT HAD ASTHMA AND
A HEART CONDITION AND WAS SO

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:15.869
OBESE, HE ALMOST DEFINITELY
WOULD NOT HAVE DIED FROM THIS.

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:17.604
THE POLICE HAD NO REASON TO KNOW
THAT HE WAS IN SERIOUS

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.774
CONDITION.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:24.044
&gt;&gt; Jon: PLEASE...

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:27.214
ASTHMA, HEART DISEASE, OBESITY,
YEAH, THOSE ARE SERIOUS

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.415
CONDITIONS BUT, COME ON!

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:29.650
COME ON, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S
REPORT SAYS THAT GARNER DIED

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:32.319
FROM "COMPRESSION OF THE NECK"
AND "COMPRESSION OF THE CHEST."

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:37.691
THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE DEATH BY
CHOKING THAN DEATH BY CHOCOLATE.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:41.762
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
THE NYPD PATROL GUIDE DEFINES A

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.363
A CHOKEHOLD AS ANY PRESSURE TO
THE THROAT OR WINDPIPE

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.365
WHICH MAY PREVENT BREATHING OR
INTAKE OF AIR. WELL,

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:51.672
LISTEN TO ONE EXPERT EXPLAIN WHY
THIS CASE ISN'T THAT.

00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:58.145
&gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T USE THE TERM
CHOKEHOLD AS A MARTIAL ARTITS

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.013
STUDENT, I WOULDN'T
USE THAT TERM.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:03.584
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Jon: GO ON, SENSEI.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:12.125
&gt;&gt; IF YOU GO FOR THE TRACHE
OR WHAT'S CALLED AN AIR CHOKE OR

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.460
THE WINDPIPE, YOU CAN LITERALLY
KILL SOMEBODY.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.429
THAT'S ILLEGAL BY EVERY POLICE
DEPARTMENT STANDARD.

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:16.463
SO THE DEFINITIONS, IT MAY SOUND
TECHNICAL, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.300
IN THIS CASE, IS IT?

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:26.073
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, IT IS, MR. MIYAGI,
RESPECTFULLY.

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:29.376
THAT'S WHAT LITERALLY HAPPENED!

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.616
FACTS ON, FACTS OFF.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.050
ALRIGHT, SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED
BUT INCREDIBLY FRAGILE, OUT OF

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.385
SHAPE MONSTER WEAKLING. AGAIN,
THEY WOULD JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.086
AGAINST ALL AVAILABLE
CRIMINOLOGY STATISTICS THAT

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.888
EVERYONE IS EQUAL UNDER THE LAW.

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.422
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY VERY CASUALLY THAT
THIS WAS DONE OUT OF RACIAL

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:45.726
MOTIVES OR OUT OF VIOLATIONS OF
CIVIL RIGHTS.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:51.665
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT A HINT THERE THAT
ANYONE USED ANY RACIAL EPITHET.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:55.936
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO, THE COPS HAVE TO USE
THE N-WORD FOR IT TO BE RACISM?

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.139
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THE PHRASE A
PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:01.508
EPITHETS? I DON'T
KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:05.846
THIS COP IS RACIST
BUT IT SEEMS THE ESCALATION OF

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.616
THESE INCIDENTS MAY
BE A BY-PRODUCT OF A SYSTEM

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.019
THAT'S APPLIED UNEQUALLY AND
WITH PREJUDICE.

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:15.222
BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT THAT, WHAT
IS IT?

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.191
&gt;&gt; IN THIS CASE, THE POLICE
OFFICER WAS DEALING WITH A

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:19.393
CRIMINAL WHO WAS RESISTING
ARREST.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:24.031
MAYBE IF MR. BROWN HADN'T
COMMITTED HIS CRIMES AND THIS

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:29.469
GENTLEMAN HADN'T RESISTED
ARREST, THEY WOULDN'T BE

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:30.370
DEAD TODAY.

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.940
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, OR IF THEY
DIDN'T CHOKE HIM.

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:36.109
I MEAN, NOT EVERYONE WHO
RESISTS ARREST -- YOU KNOW WHAT,

00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:36.877
I THINK I CAN DO THIS.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.111
THIS YOUR HONOR, MAY I APPROACH?

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.347
NOT THAT WE WERE HAVING A TRIAL,
OBVIOUSLY.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.883
THAT'S WHAT THE GRAND JURY WAS
GOING TO TRY TO GET TO BE DONE.

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:46.220
BUT IF IT PLEASES THE COURT, I
WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THAT

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:49.189
RESISTING ARREST DOESN'T ALWAYS
LEAD TO THIS SORT OF THING.

00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:56.563
HERE'S EVIDENCE, EXHIBIT A.

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.498
&gt;&gt; COME ON.
&gt;&gt; GET OFF THE BEACH NOW.

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:01.368
&gt;&gt; GET THE (BLEEP) OFF MY ARM
BEFORE -- GET THE (BLEEP) OFF.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:06.740
GET OFF!

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:13.580
&gt;&gt; FOR BEING A NUISANCE.
REALLY? I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:14.248
THERE WAS A CHARGE FOR THAT.

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:15.582
&gt;&gt; I'M A (BLEEP) GOOD PERSON!

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:17.951
&gt;&gt; WATCH YOUR HEAD, WATCH YOUR
HEAD.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:22.556
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME SHE
WAS LESS OF A MENACE TO SOCIETY

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:23.957
AT THAT TIME?

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.493
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE'S
STRAIGHTENED HER LIFE OUT AND

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:28.629
HAS SHOWN US THAT SHE IS,
AND I'M QUOTING HERE, A

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:36.837
(BLEEP) GOOD PERSON, BUT -- COME
ON, PEOPLE, WON'T ANYONE ADMIT

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.840
THIS IS SYMPTOMATIC OF A LARGER
ISSUE?

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:41.275
&gt;&gt; JOINING ME NOW IS KENTUCKY
SENATOR RAND PAUL.

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:43.877
&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
BIGGER THAN JUST THE INDIVIDUAL

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:44.344
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:46.980
&gt;&gt; Jon: THANK YOU!

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.449
RAND PAUL!

00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:51.618
YOU KNOW, HERE IS A REPUBLICAN
WHO HAS BEEN MAKING AN EFFORT TO

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.320
REACH OUT TO THE
BLACK COMMUNITY.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.656
HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT VOTING
RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:56.690
SO THIS IS,THIS IS A START.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.991
GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:01.028
WHAT IS THE LARGER ISSUE HERE?

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:05.532
&gt;&gt; SOME POLITICIAN PUT A TAX OF
$5.85 ON A PACK OF CIGARETTES,

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:08.468
SO THEY'VE DRIVEN CIGARETTES
UNDERGROUND BY MAKING THEM SO

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:09.703
EXPENSIVE.

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.506
BUT THEN SOME POLITICIAN ALSO
HAD TO DIRECT THE POLICE TO SAY,

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.242
HEY, WE WANT YOU ARRESTING
PEOPLE FOR SELLING A LOOSE

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:16.210
CIGARETTE.

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:22.082
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT THE (BLEEP) ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:25.619
WELL, I GUESS NOW WE KNOW WHAT
IT TAKES FOR A SENATOR FROM

00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:26.987
KENTUCKY TO ADMIT CIGARETTES CAN
KILL.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.689
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:34.528
I APPRECIATE THE PURITY OF YOUR
ANTI-TAX DOGMA, BUT THE

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:39.032
CIGARETTE TAX IS TRULY THE LEAST
SALIENT ASPECT OF THIS CASE!

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:42.035
IT'S LIKE SAYING, YOU KNOW THE
PROBLEM WITH THE HINDENBURG,

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.637
GOVERNMENT PARKING REGULATIONS.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.805
THAT'S IT!

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:48.408
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT BIG BROTHER
OVER YOUR SHOULDER GOING,

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:50.244
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO DOCK!

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:52.679
(LAUGHTER)
HONESTLY, ERIC GARNER COULD HAVE

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:54.915
BEEN OUT THERE WITH MIX
TAPES OR A A SQUEEGEE OR A

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:57.851
SNOWCONE AND THE SAME KIND OF
(BLEEP) COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:00.654
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TEN
DAYS, A GRAND JURY, WHICH AT

00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:03.624
LEAST IN FEDERAL CASES HAS A 99%
INDICTMENT RATE,

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:06.560
FAILED TO INDICT AN OFFICER WHO
CAUSED THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.530
CITIZEN. THEY DIDN'T INDICT HIM
FOR ANYTHING.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:12.866
NOT MURDER, NOT MANSLAUGHTER,
NOT EVEN RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.968
WHICH IS LIKE ONE DEGREE
ABOVE A PARTY FOUL.

00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:18.772
AND FOR SOME REASON TO QUESTION
A SYSTEM PRODUCING THAT RESULT

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:21.108
IS SOMEHOW OFFENSIVE.

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.043
&gt;&gt; THIS PROCESS HAS TAKEN PLACE.

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:24.178
IT'S OUR CONSTITUTION.

00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:26.880
IT'S THE LAWS WE LIVE BY.

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:28.282
GET OVER IT.

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:32.085
&gt;&gt; THEY ARE TEARING DOWN RESPECT
FOR A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:34.354
THAT GOES BACK TO ENGLAND IN THE
11th CENTURY.

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:42.429
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO DOES WITCH BURNING
AND (BLEEP) WHERE WE DRINK.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.832
BUT WE'VE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE
UPON THOSE PROCESSES!

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:49.436
YOU KNOW, FROM WHAT I
UNDERSTAND, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.574
SYSTEM HAS TWO SEPARATE BUT
EQUALLY IMPORTANT PARTS -- THE

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:58.045
POLICE WHO INVESTIGATE CRIMES
AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO

00:07:58.078 --> 00:07:58.512
PROSECUTE!

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:00.714
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.

00:08:00.747 --> 00:08:06.987
I GOT THAT FROM TV.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.091
GRAND JURIES ALMOST ALWAYS DO
WHAT THE PROSECUTOR WANTS.

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:14.194
SO MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHEN
IT COMES TO THE POLICE IF

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:16.430
PROSECUTORS REALLY DON'T WANT TO
INDICT THEM BECAUSE THEY WORK

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:23.036
WITH THEM AND THEY NEED THEM AND
THEY'RE ON THE SAME SHOW WITH

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.506
THEM, THEY'RE COLLEAGUES, AND
THAT MAKES FOR A VERY

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:26.707
UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.476
HEY, BEFORE I TRY AND SEND YOU
TO PRISON, THERE'S SOMETHING I

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:35.415
GOTTA ASK YOU -- THIS YEAR, ARE
YOU MY SECRET SANTA?

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:39.453
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
