00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.339
(string music)

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.042
- Oh, hi.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.110
Um, I'll just be a minute.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.752 align:start size:94% position:6%
I am so excited to
introduce you to my guest,

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.287
Margaret-

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:22.521
- James!

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.758 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
It's James, James Barry,
because I am a man.

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:28.394
Margaret is a woman's name,
and I am most definitely,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.096
undoubtedly a man.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.564
- Sure.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:34.133 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I've got rippling
muscles and a huge penis.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.102
Look at the way I sit.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.237
See that?

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.771
It's nice, huh?

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.407
- Anyway, Dr. James Barry
is one of the very first

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:41.241
female doctors-

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.743
- Male, I am a man!

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.146
- Okay.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:51.450 line:0%
(orchestral, stately music)

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.319
James Margaret Berry is born
to a super progressive family,

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.421 align:start size:84% position:16%
so progressive that
they give her the name

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.324 align:start position:0%
of her dead uncle and then
send her off to medical school.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.392 align:start size:84% position:16%
- They passed me off
as a teenage boy.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:01.760
It was very easy.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.763 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you sure he's
actually a boy?

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.064
Seems very feminine.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:08.234
- He is wearing pants.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.601
- [Both] He's a man.

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.804
- I head off to the Crimean War,

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:14.607 align:start size:94% position:6%
where I prove myself to
be a most talented doctor.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.908
Next!

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.278
- James performs the
first ever C-section

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.413 align:start size:84% position:16%
where both the mother
and child live.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.515
- And I'm one of
the first doctors

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.916
to practice good hygiene.

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.284 align:start size:88% position:13%
Who knew shitting on
your hand and putting it

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:26.119
near an open wound was bad?

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.353
Oh, yeah.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.321
I did.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.488
(yells)

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:30.457
(baby cries)

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.657
You're welcome.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.126
- Bye.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.427 align:start size:94% position:6%
For over 40 years, nobody
knew that James lived

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:35.828
privately as a woman.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.830
Living with a secret
like this make James

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.264
prone to outbursts,
and he was known

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:42.135
to have a very, very short fuse.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.769
- No, I don't!

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:44.637
That's a fucking lie!

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.640
(yells and screams)

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.444
Take it back, take it back!

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.446
(yells)

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.351
Ahh, lots better.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.720
- Dr. James Berry, a lesson
in courage and perseverance.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.122
- Did I ever tell you
about that time someone

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.190
made fun of my voice?

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.491
- Let me guess.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.325
They met the sharp
end of your tongue?

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.161
- I bloody shot them.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.629
- [Host] James, no!

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.898 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, relax, I
didn't use that gun.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:12.999
I used this one.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.501
- Oh, my God, James!

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:17.470
(intense music)
