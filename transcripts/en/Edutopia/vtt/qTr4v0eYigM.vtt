&gt;&gt;Edwina Smith: Before
I started doing Circles

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:15.106
in my class I found it very
difficult to start the academic day.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.546
Students had things that they wanted
to share that had happened with them,

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:23.026
things they were concerned
about, and I had a very long line

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:27.406
of about thirty-- twenty-five to
thirty students every morning wanting

00:00:27.406 --> 00:00:29.716
to share personal time with me.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:34.806
It made it absolutely impossible
to start the academic day.

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:38.556
After the presentation of Circles
in our staff development I knew

00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:42.506
that would be the best way
to have each student share

00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:44.826
and be heard in the classroom.

00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:04.926
&gt;&gt;Here at Glenview every
teacher holds Circles

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:09.236
for classroom management, for
resolving conflicts and also

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:11.266
to involve students in activities.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:16.356
Every day I begin with mindfulness
to really get the students focused

00:01:16.356 --> 00:01:18.116
and centered and ready for learning.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:21.676
&gt;&gt;I'm going to need you
to either close your eyes

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:26.416
or to look gently at the ground.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:33.546
&gt;&gt;The next thing I do
in Circle is a check-in

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:35.216
with a scale from one to five.

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:39.786
This allows me to assess whether
or not they're ready to learn.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:47.176
&gt;&gt;Okay, I'm a five and I have a lot
of things I need to get done today,

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.436
but I'm looking forward
to getting them done.

00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:52.146
Would anyone else like to
share why you're a five today?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.356
&gt;&gt;Student: Today I'm a five because
I can't wait for Spirit Week.

00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:02.466
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm a one because my
head still hurts from Sunday.

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.936
&gt;&gt;Edwina Smith: In
order to keep order

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:09.396
in the circle we use a talking piece,
which is a symbolic piece to signify

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.606
who has the floor,
who's able to speak.

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:16.356
At the beginning of the year I asked
the students what topics they feel

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:17.886
as a class we need to discuss.

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.856
The students write the topics
and we place them in the cup.

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:25.496
&gt;&gt;Oh, our next topic is going
to be about stop bullying.

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:28.326
How can you stop bullying?

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:32.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, I think
since most bullies bully

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:35.636
through pain you can try
to see if you can help

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:37.856
or make them feel better.

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:43.546
&gt;&gt;Student: If you see someone getting
bullied, stand up for that person

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:48.786
and tell the bully firmly
and strong to stop bullying.

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:55.536
&gt;&gt;Edwina Smith: I like the
idea of not being a bystander,

00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:59.596
'cause that's somewhat being
part of the bullying process

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.426
if you see it happening
and you don't say anything.

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:06.766
But it takes a lot of
bravery, a lot of courage

00:03:07.656 --> 00:03:09.976
to say, "Hey, that's not right."

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:14.896
&gt;&gt;As part of a program
called Restorative Justice,

00:03:15.146 --> 00:03:18.066
Circles are also used to
resolve conflicts that come

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:18.976
up during the school day.

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:25.296
&gt;&gt;Student: Sometimes at recess Sidney
and Marnie would come over and, like,

00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:28.976
just start talking about us and
saying mean things about Denai.

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:32.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Is it your job to
make Denai's job at school hard?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.526
&gt;&gt;Student: No.

00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:35.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So you choose to either
be the bully that you're being

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.556
or to be someone's ally--

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:38.350
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:39.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: -- and make
a better choice.
