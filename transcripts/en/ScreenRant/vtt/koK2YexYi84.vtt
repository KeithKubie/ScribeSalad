00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.110
Nobody does animated films like Disney, so
it's tempting to think that their most classic

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.850
stories wound up exactly the way the writers,
directors and animators expected. But fans

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.939
may never know what beloved characters, songs,
and storylines wound up on the cutting room

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.010
floor. Missed opportunities or dodged bullets,
fans will want to see for themselves. Here

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.000
are Screen Rant's Disney Movie Scenes You've
Never Seen.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.120
Lilo &amp; Stitch

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.270
Disney's story of an alien bringing two sisters
closer together had a playful sense of humour

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.660
from the very start, so even when the film's
climax had the cast flying an alien spaceship

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.270
in a death defying chase, it wasn't meant
to be taken seriously. Originally, that chase

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.570
was going to be even more far fetched, with
Stitch and the gang hijacking a Boeing 747

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.160
and flying it through the buildings of downtown
Honolulu. Obviously the filmmakers realized

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.690
the scene would read differently following
the&nbsp;September 11th&nbsp;attacks in New York,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.290
and refitted the animation to an alien spaceship
over Hawaiian mountains instead.&nbsp;

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.390
The Lion King

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.360
Any fan of Shakespeare can tell you that The
Lion King is basically the story of Hamlet

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.890
told with African animals. So it's no surprise
that Disney originally wanted the movie to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.400
be even darker and more adult. The original
ending still had Simba return to Pride Rock

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.150
for his showdown with Scar, but he met a way
uglier end. After tossing Simba to his death

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.939
- with a line directly out of Shakespeare
- Scar wound up plummeting into the wildfire,

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.630
and presumably burning to death. Apparently
Disney decided that was a little too grim....

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
Why they thought having him torn apart by
his hyena soldiers was more suitable for kids,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.290
we can't explain.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.290
Frozen

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.460
The fairy tale fans who followed Frozen from
the start know it began as an adaptation of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.380
"The Snow Queen", which would have seen Elsa
play the villain, with a much darker side.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.560
Disney decided that a tale of sisterly love
was a better choice, but you'd be surprised

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.340
to know how far some of Elsa's darker antics
made it into production. Take this deleted

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.470
scene, where Elsa encases two Arendelle soldiers
in ice as they search for her sister, beginning

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.330
to torture them for information, and assembling
an army of snow monsters. It points out just

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.670
how much a single scene can change an audience's
idea of a character.&nbsp;

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.530
Aladdin

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.260
No true Disney fan will ever forget the stars
of Aladdin, from Abu the monkey to Iago, Jafar...take

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.230
your pick. But did you know Aladdin's mother
was originally going to play an important

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.500
role in the story? Apparently the street rat's
wish to be a Prince wasn't just for himself,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.290
with a musical number revealing Aladdin's
mission to prove everyone wrong, and make

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:55.129
his mother proud. The song, "Proud of Your
Boy" even had Abu in tears, but the number

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.330
and the character had to be cut to keep the
plot moving forward. Crazy to think another

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.810
potential Disney classic wound up on the cutting
room floor.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.060
Frozen

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.129
Not every deleted scene is important to the
overall plot, but considering the shots taken

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.769
at Kristoff throughout the rest of the movie,
there's no question he would've liked to see

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:23.530
this one make the cut. Trying to sell ice
in a blizzard makes him seem pretty foolish,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.849
but the scene shows that the skills Kristoff
has to do his job are no joke. And hauling

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.989
his reindeer Sven along with him still shows
off his softer side. The directors decided

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.890
that introducing Kristoff frozen solid was
a better joke in the end - and it's hard to

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.080
disagree.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.510
Wreck-it Ralph

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.530
Everyone has their favorite video game cameo
or reference in Wreck it Ralph, but one major

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.140
set piece didn't make the finished cut. When
Ralph went game-jumping into the shooter Hero's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.620
Duty, he was originally going to be locked
up with a man named Bobby Dunderson, who told

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.970
him about a strange game paradise called "Extreme
EZ Livin 2'". Modeled on life simulation games

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.349
like The Sims, EZ Livin' was a world where
there were no heroes or villains... And no

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.590
real point. Ralph would eventually head there
in the final act, before realizing that being

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.819
bad wasn't something to be ashamed of. The
message worked fine without the sequence,

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.019
so it was cut for length. But the strange
look at social games where players maximize

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.009
"likes" would've been a cool touch.&nbsp;

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.310
Inside Out

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.090
It was Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong,
who stole the show in Pixar's look inside

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:35.320
the mind of a preteen girl, but he wasn't
going to be the only figment of Riley's imagination

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.540
audiences got to meet. Riley's favorite drawing
Mrs. Scribbles, and the monsters who used

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.270
to live in her closet were just a few of the
creatures forming a makeshift village in the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.180
girl's mind. Like most of the scrapped storylines
and extra emotions the filmmakers axed, the

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.199
movie's overall message worked better with
less - still, it's nice to know that the fans

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.850
favorite characters were only the tip of the
iceberg.&nbsp;

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.240
Those are all the deleted scenes from hit
Disney movies that we think fans should know

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.139
about, but which ones have we missed? Be sure
