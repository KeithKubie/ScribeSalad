00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.450
What I want to do with this
video is talk about

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.700
nucleophilicity.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.270
This is really just how good of
a nucleophile something is.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.180
Or I'll just make up a
definition right now: the

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:35.680
ability for an atom slash ion
slash molecule to act as a

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:51.220
nucleophile, or to give away
extra electrons and bond with

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.930
a nucleus or with
something else.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.180
I'll say with a nucleus.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.420
I want to say with a nucleus,
because that's what

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.480
nucleophilicity is saying.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.450
It loves nucleuses, especially
positive ones, that it can

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.420
give its extra electrons
to it.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.150
Now, as a first cut, if you
want to identify a good

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.660
nucleophile, it should have
extra electrons to give away.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.510
The best things that have extra
electrons to give away

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.750
are negative ions or anions, so
just at a very high level,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.770
something like the
fluoride anion.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.590
Normally, fluorine has seven
valence electrons: one, two,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.130
three, four, five, six, seven,
but it's so electronegative,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.700
it might be able swipe off
another electron from

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.880
something else and then it
becomes the fluoride anion.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.650
Then it becomes the fluoride
anion with a negative charge.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.150
You can do that for all
of the halides.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.145
You could do that
for chlorine.

00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:07.860
It can become chloride.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.210
Bromine can be bromide.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.360
Iodine could be iodide.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.190
Let me do iodine, too.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.060
Iodine, once again,
it's a halide.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.590
It has seven valence
electrons.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.980
It has many, many more electrons
than fluorine, but

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.250
if you just look at
its valence shell,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.730
it has seven electrons.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.850
And then it is also reasonably
electronegative, not as

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.220
electronegative as fluorine.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.060
Remember, the trend goes like
this from the bottom left to

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.740
the top right.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.930
So fluorine is extremely
electronegative, but iodine is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.110
still pretty electronegative.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.490
It is a halogen so it also might
be able to swipe off an

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.560
electron from someone else
and become iodide.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.380
In general, things with extra
electrons, lone pairs of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.820
electrons, and especially a
negative charge, are going to

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.880
be pretty good nucleophiles.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.570
Another example that's
not a halide is the

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.340
hydroxide anion, so OH.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.420
This is an example of something
that is a molecule.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.770
Maybe traditionally water
would look like this.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.430
Traditionally, this is just
neutral water, and oxygen has

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.600
two lone pairs like that,
but oxygen is pretty

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.650
electronegative.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.530
It is already kind of taking the
electrons away from one of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.210
the hydrogens, and at some
point, it might just take it

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.900
altogether and then you have
the hydroxide anion.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.540
This would look like this.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.370
You have your original two lone
pairs, just like that,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.010
and then you have this pair
that's going to be taken.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.100
It already had that electron.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.490
It takes that electron from the
hydrogen, so now it has

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.000
two more electrons.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.920
Let me color code it so
you see what it took.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.350
It took this electron from the
hydrogen and now this also has

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.990
a negative charge.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.280
That's also a reasonably
good nucleophile.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.815
And, of course, you have
your hydrogen now.

00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:58.770
It lost its one electron.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.320
It only has a proton
in its nucleus.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.580
Whenever you see H plus, this
is really just a proton.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.580
There's nothing else
to that hydrogen.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.730
So that's hydroxide.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.100
These are all reasonably good
nucleophiles in that they have

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.020
something to give away.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.000
They have extra charge.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.209
Now, what I want to do is think
about between these, how

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.620
do you think about what's going
to be a stronger or

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.180
weaker nucleophile?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.020
And here, it becomes a little
bit more nuanced.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.090
What we're going to do is
differentiate what happens in

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.980
a protic solvent versus what
happens in an aprotic solvent.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.310
Let me write down.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.510
Let me start with a
protic solvent.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.050
I'll make two columns here,
protic solvent and then we'll

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:54.030
do aprotic solvent
right over here.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.830
Once again, these are fancy
words, but they mean something

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.680
pretty simple.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.850
Protic solvent is something that
has hydrogens that can be

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.820
taken away or might have free
protons floating around.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.060
An example of a protic
solvent is water

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.800
or really any alcohol.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.880
Water is the simplest example
or maybe the most common.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.620
The reason why you might have
protons floating around is

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.020
exactly this reaction
I showed right here.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.430
Maybe every now and then a
hydroxide anion forms. Even

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.330
more likely, maybe a water takes
a hydrogen from one of

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.910
the other waters.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.790
One of the water molecules takes
hydrogen from one of the

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.490
other water molecules and
becomes a hydronium, where

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.665
it's not a proton necessarily,
but it's an oxygen.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.980
Let's say if you start with
water and one of these

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.350
electrons were to be given to
some proton floating around,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.900
it would look like this.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.000
And it has a positive
charge and then this

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.410
proton is very available.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.520
You can almost imagine it's
almost floating around because

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.400
that oxygen really wants to
take back that electron.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.420
So protic solvent is water.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.360
In water, you might see a little
bit of hydroxide, a

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.450
little bit of proton, a little
bit a hydronium.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.810
You see all of it in there, but
the bottom line is that

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.005
there are protons that can
react with other things.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.070
Let me clear this away so that
I have some real estate.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.490
Let me just write down water.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.400
Water is a protic solvent.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.700
Now, wait.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.290
Is that always the case?

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.510
It seems like hydrogens
are everywhere.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.790
Well, no, it's not
always the case.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.270
Let me show you an
aprotic solvent.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.830
Diethyl ether looks like this.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.150
And just so you know the naming,
it's an ether because

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.640
it has oxygen, and it's diethyl
because it has two

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.300
ethyl groups.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.360
That's one ethyl group right
there and that is the second.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.050
So it's diethyl ether.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.230
Now, you might say, hey, this
guy's got hydrogens lying

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.890
around as well.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.090
Maybe those can get released.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.270
But, no, these hydrogens are
bonded to the carbon and

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.950
carbon is not anywhere near as
electronegative as oxygen.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.600
Carbon is unlikely to steal
these hydrogens' electrons and

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.110
these hydrogens to be loose.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.870
If they were bonded to the
oxygen, that would have been a

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.040
possibility.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.500
With water, you have
obviously H-O-H.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:27.400
In alcohols, you have some maybe
carbon chain bonded to

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.540
an oxygen, which is then
bonded to a hydrogen.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.860
So in either of these cases,
in either water or alcohol,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.030
you have these hydrogens where
the electron might be taken by

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.140
the oxygen because it's so
electronegative and then the

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.270
hydrogen floats around.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.770
Anyway, that's a review of
protic versus aprotic.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.850
In a protic solvent-- and this
is actually a general rule of

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.060
thumb-- if a nucleophile is
likely to react with its

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.290
solvent, it will be bad at
being a nucleophile.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.950
Think about it.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.410
If it's reacting with the
solvent, it's not going to be

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.320
able to do this.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.710
It's not going to be able to
give its electrons away to

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.960
what it needs to give it away,
to maybe what we saw in an

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.270
Sn2-type reaction.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.870
In a protic solvent, what
happens is that the things

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.970
that are really electronegative
and really

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.290
small, like a fluoride anion--
let me draw a fluoride anion.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:26.250
In a protic solvent, what's
going to happen is it's going

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.050
to be blocked by
hydrogen bonds.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.660
It's very negative, right?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.940
It has a negative charge.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.700
And it's also tightly packed.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.909
As you can see right here,
its electrons are

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.500
very close, tied in.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.150
It's a much smaller atom
or ion, in this case.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.000
If we looked at iodide,
iodide has 53

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.290
electrons, many orbitals.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.940
Actually, iodide
would have 54.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.160
It would have the same
as iodine plus one.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.740
Fluoride will have 10 electrons,
nine from fluorine

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.610
plus it gains another one, so
it's a much smaller atom.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.450
So when you have water hanging
around it, let's say you have

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.740
something like water.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.170
That has a negative charge.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:11.800
Water is polar.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.695
Actually, both of these are
polar, so I should write down

00:09:14.695 --> 00:09:15.750
polar for both of these.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.770
This is a polar protic
solvent.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.270
This is a polar aprotic
solvent.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.620
In this case, water is still
more electronegative than the

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.060
carbon, so it still has a
partial negative charge.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.930
These parts still have
a partial negative.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.200
Water still has a partial
negative charge.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.780
The hydrogen has a partial
positive charge so it is going

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.970
to be attracted to
the fluorine.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.280
This is going to happen all
around the fluorine.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.900
And if these waters are
attracted to the fluorine in

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.580
kind of forming a tight shell
around it, it makes it hard

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.830
for fluorine to react.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:58.680
So it's a worse nucleophile
than, say, iodide or hydroxide

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.700
in a polar protic solvent.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.390
Hydroxide has the same issue.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.030
It's still forming hydrogen
bonds, but if you wanted to

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:10.800
compare them, iodide
is much bigger.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.630
Maybe I'll draw it like this.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.010
I'll draw its valence
shell like this.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:20.180
It's a much bigger ion.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.270
It has all these electrons
in here.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.310
And so, it still will form
hydrogen bonds with the water.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.070
It still will form hydrogen
bonds with the hydrogen end of

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.510
the water because they're
partially positive, but it's

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.255
going to be less
tightly packed.

00:10:34.255 --> 00:10:47.180
And on top of that, iodide is
more polarizable, which means

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.500
that its electron cloud is so
big and the valence electrons

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.820
are so far away from the nucleus
that they can be

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.380
influenced by things and then
be more likely to react.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.350
So let's say this iodide is
getting close to a carbon that

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.620
has a partial positive charge.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:09.190
So let's say carbon is attached
to a bromine and then

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.210
it's attached to three
hydrogens.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.480
We've seen that this will have
a partial negative charge.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.450
It's more electronegative than
the carbon, which will have a

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.420
partial positive charge.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.580
When this guy, this big guy with
the electrons really far

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:28.040
away, gets close to this, more
of the electron cloud is going

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.090
to be attracted to the partial
positive charge.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.450
It'll get distorted a little bit
and so it is more likely

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.640
to react in a polar
protic solvent.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.450
Fluoride, on the other hand,
is very tightly packed,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.230
blocked by the hydrogen bonds.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.020
It's less likely to react.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.210
If you were to look at the
Periodic Table, if you look at

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:57.410
just the halogens in a polar
protic solvent, the halides--

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.420
this would be the ion version of
the halogens-- the halide's

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.810
iodide will be the
best nucleophile.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.740
Fluoride will be the worst. So
in a polar protic solvent--

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:21.090
let me write this down-- we
have a situation where the

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.860
iodide is the best nucleophile,
followed by

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.900
bromide, followed by chloride,
and then last

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.920
of all is the fluoride.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.870
The exact opposite is true
in an aprotic solvent.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.720
In an aprotic solvent, the
fluoride, which is-- fluorine

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.755
is far more electronegative.

00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:48.560
Fluoride is more basic.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.120
It will be more stable if it
is able to form a bond with

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.030
something than iodide.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.210
Iodide is pretty stable.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.610
If you look at a hydrogen
iodide, it's actually a highly

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.590
acidic molecule.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.200
So iodide itself, the conjugate
base of hydrogen

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.600
iodide, is going to be
a very bad base.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.470
When you're dealing with an
aprotic solvent, you go in the

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.390
direction of basicity.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.990
We're going to learn in the
next video that actually

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.170
basicity and nucleophilicity are
related, but they aren't

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.280
the same concept.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.110
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.030
If you're in an aprotic solvent,
you're not reacting

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.320
with the solvent as much.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.310
And then in this situation,
fluoride is actually the best

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:37.920
nucleophile, followed by
chloride, followed by bromide,

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.420
followed by iodide.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.150
So here, you're going in the
direction of basicity.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:47.860
This is the best. This is the
worse in an aprotic solvent.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.490
If it was in a protic solvent,
this is flipped around.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.110
This becomes the best and
this becomes the worst.
