lot of very interesting work on

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
lot of very interesting work on
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.139
lot of very interesting work on
developing social robots robots that

first thing we're going to look at is
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080
first thing we're going to look at is
how to make characters and robots really

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
how to make characters and robots really
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.570
how to make characters and robots really
interactive and that means that there

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580
interactive and that means that there
 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.399
interactive and that means that there
might not be a puppeteer in the

background actually choosing what
 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.090
background actually choosing what
behaviors the character would do but

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
behaviors the character would do but
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.160
behaviors the character would do but
instead it would really be measuring and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
instead it would really be measuring and
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.230
instead it would really be measuring and
responding to the audience there's a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
responding to the audience there's a
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.169
responding to the audience there's a
general idea that's in Star Trek of that

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
general idea that's in Star Trek of that
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.199
general idea that's in Star Trek of that
bones uses which is this weird sensor

and you just wave over a person you so

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489
and you just wave over a person you so
 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.120
and you just wave over a person you so
you know what's wrong with them so my

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
you know what's wrong with them so my
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.370
you know what's wrong with them so my
research is basically creating

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380
research is basically creating
 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.000
research is basically creating
analytical methods to help physicians

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
analytical methods to help physicians
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.550
analytical methods to help physicians
and biologists make their decisions

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
and biologists make their decisions
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.740
and biologists make their decisions
based on data ideally it'll be some sort

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
based on data ideally it'll be some sort

will say yes this patient is at high

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
will say yes this patient is at high
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.569
will say yes this patient is at high
risk for organ failure or something very

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579

information the doctor will take that

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019
information the doctor will take that
 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.900
information the doctor will take that
into consideration and make an

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
into consideration and make an
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.350
into consideration and make an
appropriate choice for treatment

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.570
electronics if it's successful I think

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
electronics if it's successful I think
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.559
electronics if it's successful I think
we'll create a new form of communication

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569
we'll create a new form of communication
 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.880
we'll create a new form of communication
and so in Star Trek in the way the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890
and so in Star Trek in the way the
 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.460
and so in Star Trek in the way the
communication is kind of mundane you can

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470
communication is kind of mundane you can
 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.680
communication is kind of mundane you can
talk through your communicator you can

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690
talk through your communicator you can
 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.380
talk through your communicator you can
do video but if you want to be there

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390
do video but if you want to be there
 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.730
do video but if you want to be there
face to face you have to go through this

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740
face to face you have to go through this
 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.530
face to face you have to go through this
big hassle of actually going there the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540
big hassle of actually going there the
 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.810
big hassle of actually going there the
idea behind programmable matter is that

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820
idea behind programmable matter is that
 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.500
idea behind programmable matter is that
you have some stuff like let's say a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510
you have some stuff like let's say a
 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.710
you have some stuff like let's say a
pile of sand that has computational

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720
pile of sand that has computational
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.310
pile of sand that has computational
power and you can download a program to

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
power and you can download a program to
 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.620
power and you can download a program to
that stuff and as it computes it changes

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630
that stuff and as it computes it changes
 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.970
that stuff and as it computes it changes
its shape or some other physical

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
its shape or some other physical
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.340
its shape or some other physical
property you'd have a pile of patrons in

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350

your office that have a pile of petron
 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.600
your office that have a pile of petron
it's in my office and you would sort of

it's in my office and you would sort of
 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.090
it's in my office and you would sort of
your 3d model would get assembled in my
