BRIAN GRADY: Hi.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.180
My name is Brian Grady.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.910
And I'd like to welcome you all
here to the very first Silicon

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.780
Valley Video Producers meetup.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.040
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.846
BRIAN GRADY: Yeah.

00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:13.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:15.610
Yeah.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.741
Thank you very much for coming.

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:19.240
We're all really
excited about this.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.910
When I say "we,"
I mean the group

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.220
of people that I work with
and my mom, and my wife.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.194
But I'm excited
about it personally,

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:31.610
because to tell
you the truth, I'm

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.540
not a Silicon Valley native.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.050
I just fell in here two
years ago to work at Google

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.820
and produce video for the
Google Developer Studio.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.335
And we have a YouTube channel.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.940
I'll tell you more about
that in a little bit.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.030
But I'm excited because yeah, I
want to learn about 360 Video.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.180
But I also want to
meet a lot of people

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.740
in the area that
do stuff that I do,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.450
and do stuff like that I do,
and do stuff better than I do.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.421
And so I think maybe
you guys are all here.

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:04.879
I'm also really, really glad--
I'm looking around the room,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.960
and I'm really glad that we
have a great range of diversity

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.840
in the room.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.169
So I think we should
all get a hand for that.

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:13.648
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.648 --> 00:01:15.620
Yeah, thank you.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.606
Thank you.

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:19.940
So let's get the
show on the road.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.910
Who are we?

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.440
And I say "we"-- I mean us,
because we're a community,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.330
and that's what
we're here to build.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.132
We're anyone who works in video
production in Silicon Valley.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:31.632
Right?

00:01:31.632 --> 00:01:34.110
Do we work in video production?

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.810
And we want to be
inclusive all the way

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.750
to the top, San Francisco, and
we want to include East Bay.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.461
If we can get people down from
East Bay, we'd be very happy.

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:43.960
Anybody come down
from the East Bay?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.990
[CHEERS]

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.660
Oh, yeah!

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.360
I live in Emeryville.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.952
So thank you for coming.

00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:55.660
And I think we all
work in a wide variety

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.560
of formats and techniques.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.810
And I think it's great when
we get together and sort

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.330
of share ideas and mix it up.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.550
It's probably a lot of us,
because of where we are,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.050
we have tech industry clients.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.060
Anybody have tech
industry clients here?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.630
A few people.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.130
OK.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.500
AUDIENCE: I am one.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.850
BRIAN GRADY: You are one.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.820
I'll give you my card.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.710
No.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.160
Everybody give him their card.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.770
Yes.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.050
And even though we're
in Silicon Valley,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.010
I'm sure that we have a wide
range of different sorts

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.150
of programs that we create.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.930
And so I'm hoping that we have
people from these four and more

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.940
markets.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.470
Who am I?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.290
I'm Brian Grady.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.880
I'm a video producer.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.480
I'm the creative director
at Google Developer Studio.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.290
And what do we do?

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.940
We're in the Scalable
Developer Outreach team.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.840
And what that is is we are
reaching out to developers

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.350
all over the world
in massive numbers,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.520
educating them,
and inspiring them

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.030
to get their shit right on
the Google Developer Platform.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.980
And they need some help.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.160
So we provide that.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.930
There are a lot of
different-- let's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.305
say we have a diverse audience
of people that are interested

00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:10.950
and who have never done it.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.630
We have people that
they have some ideas,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.722
but they're maybe
not developers,

00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:17.180
but they want to
become developers.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.460
Then we have really
solid developers.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.870
And we have Steve [? Joffe ?]
in the back of the room here.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.330
Thank you, Steve, for coming.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.080
We have people that are very far
up the curve that are working

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.360
in startups and partners.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.565
And they need help with
developing software.

00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:36.170
And that's what the guys
that we put on camera, that's

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.530
what they do.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.284
So check out our
YouTube channel.

00:03:40.284 --> 00:03:42.534
Does anybody want to see a
little taste of what we do?

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:43.006
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:43.478

-Your life as a
developer can be easier

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.220
and more successful by taking
advantage of our guidance.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.090

of that, you may

and we really
thought them through.

00:04:58.049 --> 00:05:00.380
You see a couple
of our other shows.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.260
We built a couple of, I
think, pretty impressive--

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.670
let's kill this real
quick-- impressive brands.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.710
So I said we have
a diverse audience.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.160
We have diverse work.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.940
We saw there's a show I do
called "Coffee with a Googler."

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.440
That's just two
people sitting down,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.754
talking about what it's
like to work at Google

00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:21.010
and what they work on.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.260
All those people that you
saw in front of their slide

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.500
shows, we call
those "Dev Bytes."

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.930
And those are quick, targeted
little pieces of information

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.570
that developers need
to get their job done.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.870
And if you notice the
kiosks around here,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.674
you'll see more examples
of our work there.

Patnoe, and Nilesh Bell-Gorsia

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.830
are the production leads.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.970

post-production people that

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.070
really make everything work.

Like you guys all know that
it's not the names on here

00:06:05.624 --> 00:06:06.790
that do all the work, right?

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.700
It's the other
guys in the studio.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.430
So anyway, we have three
channels-- Google Developers,

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.560
Android Developers,
and Chrome Developers.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.995
And I would
encourage you, if you

00:06:16.995 --> 00:06:19.450
know any developers, to
please introduce them

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.880
to the channel for us.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.720
Here's tonight's agenda.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.730
And we sort of switched it up
from the original announcement,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.670
but what we're going to do is
have a colleague of ours, Neil,

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.680
come up and give us a
little inspirational talk

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.501
about where we are with 360
and where's the potential.

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.250
Then we have our talk
from Anjali Wheeler,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.460
who we are very glad came to
us from YouTube to show us

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.620
how to implement 360 Video.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.850
We're going to talk about
Jump with Todd Shaiman.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.202
We'll take a little break.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:53.575
Then we're going to hear
from Stephen Fromkin, who

00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:55.950
is a producer at 360Heros.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.244
And he's going to
show us what they do.

00:06:58.244 --> 00:07:00.699
Then we're going
to do a Q&amp;A panel.

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.260
And we'll have a little raffle.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.350
We have some awesome prizes.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.178

AUDIENCE: Oh, snap.

00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:50.130
AUDIENCE: 360 [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.122
BRIAN GRADY: Not
the 360, I'm sorry.

00:07:52.122 --> 00:07:55.280
Just the one [? GoPro. ?]
But if you get five more,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.780
then you can make the rig.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.280
All right.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.040
So Google Developer Studio
is sponsoring the evening.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.710
And if anybody here
would like to get

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.400
involved in the sponsorship,
it might be pretty interesting.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.250
If you have any suggestions
for a next meetup

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.480
or one in the future, I already
have one set up for October

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.150
pretty much.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.290
But please do contact me
if you have any questions

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.737
or suggestions.

00:08:21.737 --> 00:08:22.945
And we're back at the agenda.

00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:24.300
That's not nice.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.716
Actually, this is
the next meetup.

00:08:25.716 --> 00:08:29.000
I wanted to let you know that
Suny Behar is a director,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.470
cinematographer, and educator.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.902
He ran a program for us down
at the Red Studios in LA

00:08:32.902 --> 00:08:33.860
a couple of months ago.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.240
We had a great time.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.100
Very knowledgeable,
great speaker.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.220
So he's going to be at
the next meetup October 1.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.570
