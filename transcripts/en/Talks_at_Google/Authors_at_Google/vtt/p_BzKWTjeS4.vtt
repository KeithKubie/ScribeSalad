MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, and welcome

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.470
to Talks at Google
in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.230
Today it's my great pleasure to
introduce Josh Glenn and Tony

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.400
Leone, one of the co-authors
and the designer, respectively,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
of the "Unbored"
series of books.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.860
Along with co-author
Elizabeth Foy Larson,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.820
Josh and Tony are on a
mission to empower kids

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.825
to appreciate all
the world can offer

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:35.340
and to help them see how they
can add their own magic to it.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.500
Their first book, "Unbored:
The Essential Field Guide

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.660
to Serious Fun," has been
described as "the first kids'

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.520
book to truly encourage a
hands-on approach to creating

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.830
a personally meaningful life."

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.140
Their third book will
be "Unbored Adventure."

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.660
But today they're here to talk
about their newly published

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.670
second book, "Unbored Games:
Serious Fun for Everyone."

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.490
I can't adequately
describe how amazing it is.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.570
I've read it.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.940
So I'll just say I wish I'd had
it when I was a kid, and had it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.610
when my kids were young.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.950
So please join me in
welcoming Josh and Tony.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.980
JOSH GLENN: Thank you.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.110
I'll let you drive the
machine, I guess, Tony.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.190
TONY LEONE: Sure.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.430
JOSH GLENN: So I'm Josh Glenn.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.670
I'm born and raised here in
Boston, in Jamaica Plain.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.470
Are you from Jamaica Plain?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.480
Nice.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.980
I'm from Parkside, not Pondside.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.022
And I'm a semiotic brand
analyst in my real life.

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:46.230
I used to work at "The Boston
Globe" for a long time.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.980
I was a columnist and
editor for the Ideas

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.300
section for a long time.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.515
And Tony?

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:52.640
TONY LEONE: I'm Tony Leone.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm a graphic designer
here in the Boston area,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.470
working-- I went to Mass Art.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.650
I graduated from
Mass Art in '95,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.345
have been working in
Boston ever since.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.720
I've done a lot of work over
the years, about seven years

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.790
worth of work, with Ideo.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.690
They're over in Central Square.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.290
But for the past eight years
or so I've been out on my own,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.460
running my own studio
and happily working

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.270
on the "Unbored"
books with Josh.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.957
So I'm a more
traditional designer.

00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:19.540
I'm not so much of
a web guy, but more

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.771
of a packaging, publications,
books, and brand designer.

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.020
JOSH GLENN: So we're going
to talk to you a little bit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.040
about our creative process,
actually, here today.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.900
But then we'll also talk
about our games book,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.816
and we can even play a
game if you guys want--

00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:35.250
if we don't run out of time.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.880
But first we're going to talk
a little bit about-- just

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.980
because we're so fascinated
by our own process--

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.780
our process of how we made this
first book, "Unbored," which

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.840
was a bestseller back in 2012.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.670
TONY LEONE: Josh and I, we
met back in the late '90s,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.440
and Josh was running a zine
called "Hermenaut" at the time.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.290
I got to know Josh because he
hired me as the art director

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.490
and designer of Issues
15 and 16 of the zine.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.950
And what we
essentially did was we

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.180
took something that
was in a zine format

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.510
and created more of
a journal with it.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.060
So Josh I do have a history
of working together,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.400
and especially working
together collaboratively

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.880
on large publication projects.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.660
We did two issues
of "Hermenaut."

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.970
And so we're just giving you
a little bit of background

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.470
as to--

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.780
JOSH GLENN: And of course,
the zine world, we were DIY.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.230
But the ethos, the
aesthetic was supposed

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.855
to be very-- it wasn't
cool to have things that

00:03:31.855 --> 00:03:35.600
were glossy and color covers
and nice layout and all that.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.730
Tony and I were like,
that's not DIY at all.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.165
DIY is just, if you
make it yourself

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:42.290
and no one's telling you
what to do, then it's DIY.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.873
You can have it look
however you want.

00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:45.730
So we took-- although
the zine started

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.730
as kind of a mimeographed
thing for 20 people,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.256
we turned it into this
very beautiful journal that

00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:58.300
had a circulation of
10,000 before the end.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.380
TONY LEONE: So in
spring of 2010,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.590
we pitched the book "Unbored."

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.270
And the idea was that it
was the best of the old

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.320
and the best of the new.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.986
Josh, I'll let you
take this part of it.

00:04:09.986 --> 00:04:12.330
JOSH GLENN: Yeah, so
there was this book that

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.580
was very popular around that
time, "The Dangerous Book

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.029
for Boys" that was
very nostalgic.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.820
And I had-- my kids
at that time were--

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.755
my two sons were age 12 and 10.

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:23.130
And they had been
given, I think,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.260
three copies of that
book by usually,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.890
like, grandparents
or aunts or uncles,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.390
or other people who were
kind of worried about how

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.490
kids are growing up these days.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.448
They felt like, supposedly
kids these days they

00:04:31.448 --> 00:04:33.539
spend all their time on
TV or on screens or video

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.330
games, the Internet,
they don't go outside.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.710
Parents overparent
and they're worried

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.501
about letting their
kids run around outside

00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:39.560
and be in the woods.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.810
And there was a lot of
nostalgia for the good old days

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.460
of childhood.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.710
So "The Dangerous Book for
Boys" was a huge publishing

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.960
phenomenon.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.214
And what frustrated me and Tony
and our co-author Elizabeth

00:04:50.214 --> 00:04:52.130
Larson, who couldn't be
here because she lives

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.130
in Minneapolis-- what frustrated
us about books like that

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.405
and a lot of books
that imitate it

00:04:57.405 --> 00:05:00.060
that have come out since
then is that they're just

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.820
a nostalgia trip.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.745
They're very afraid
of the present, and so

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:04.203
their reaction to
the present-- not

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:06.619
that their criticism of the
present is wrong, necessarily,

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:08.540
but the reaction was to
retreat into the past,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.410
into this nostalgic idea of
how childhood used to be.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.880
And we wanted books
for our kids that

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.500
were about now, that
were about-- that

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.440
weren't hypocritical.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.550
And we use the computer.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.924
We let our kids
use the computer.

00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:22.830
We like games, video games.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.350
So we wanted books
that would have

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.930
some of that good
old-fashioned kind

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.624
of outdoor, no-screen,
low-tech activities for kids.

00:05:31.624 --> 00:05:33.040
We wanted it to
be realistic, too,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.125
and have a book that would
be a way of exploring

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:37.500
the world together
with our kids.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.070
And that book
didn't really exist.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.403
So we pitched this best of
the old, best of the new idea

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:42.760
to Bloomsbury.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.440
TONY LEONE: And so in
order to pitch the book,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.050
Josh wrote a couple
of articles and I

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.610
designed some very
loose, rough spreads

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.310
of what it might look like.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.240
So we chose the game Foursquare.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.032
So Josh wrote an article
about Foursquare--

00:05:57.032 --> 00:05:59.115
JOSH GLENN: As an example
of an old-fashioned game

00:05:59.115 --> 00:06:01.077
that doesn't require any
technology or screens.

00:06:01.077 --> 00:06:01.910
TONY LEONE: Exactly.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.979
And then we did
Foursquare, the app.

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.520
JOSH GLENN: Which my kids and
I used, even though at the time

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.490
it was really sort of a
way for people in their 20s

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.710
to find their friends and
to brag about how many bars

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.460
they'd been to that
night or whatever.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.210
My kids and I used
Foursquare all the time

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.400
because it was a way to force
us out of our normal routines.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.030
So if we were in Brookline
and dropping one of my kids

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.510
off at his bass lesson
and my other son

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.780
I had an hour to kill,
we would use Foursquare

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.390
and say, hey, no one
checked into this graveyard.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.348
Let's go into the graveyard
and check in there.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:33.860
So we turned it into a fun way
for me and an eight-year-old

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.310
to spend time together
exploring the world

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.540
and using an app to do it.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.920
So to us that doesn't
seem like a bad thing.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.087
It seemed like a good thing.

00:06:42.087 --> 00:06:43.753
TONY LEONE: And just
to say a little bit

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:46.450
about the design of the spreads,
the editor we were working

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.350
with at Bloomsbury, he
called us pretty much about,

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.724
I would say about two
days before our meeting,

00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:53.140
and he said, oh,
it would be great

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.390
if you had some visuals to
come along with your pitch.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.570
So we hurriedly
put these together.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.190
And it really raised
a lot of questions

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.390
as to what this book
should look like.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.064
And we'll talk a little
more about that in a bit.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.740
So we pitched the book.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.750
We got a contract that summer.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.600
And as I typically start with
any large-scale design project,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.080
and Josh does in his work,
we did a lot of research.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.130
I spent a good several weeks
researching the market segment

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.100
of kids and family
activity books.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.240
And I scoured the
market, and I just

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.700
collected images and
spreads from all the books.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.110
And very quickly a
series of themes came up.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.380
So we broke it out
into nostalgic.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.500
So this is "The
Dangerous Book for Boys,"

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.140
"The Daring Book for Girls,"
the "Field and Forest"--

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.160
the "Handy" books, which
is a pretty famous series.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.410
Another theme emerged, which
was appropriated or retro.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.800
So there's the "Popular
Mechanics," you know,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.190
the boy scientist,
the girl mechanic.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.910
"The Worst Case
Scenario" handbooks,

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.520
where they're meant to
look like survival guides.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.310
"The Zombie Survival Guide."

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.401
Another style that
came up was, for lack

00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.400
of a better word, a styled
graphic illustration,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.520
where they were
designed or created

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.760
by designers who are half
designer and half Illustrator,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.890
and they kind of
created their own look,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.100
but that had a very
computer-centric sort

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.600
of illustration style.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.900
Eclectic collage.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.950
This is very much the
DK books for kids.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.049
DK Publish has mastered
this look for kids.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.520
So we knew right away we wanted
to maybe do some of this,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.110
but we didn't want to be
just another DK type of book.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.190
Again, they master it, so we
found a lot of that stuff.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.990
Another feature that came
up was this contemporary,

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.650
what I call
contemporary technical.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.050
And this is very
much like the, you're

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.550
on a flight in the airplane in
there's sort of the emergency

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.262
exit pamphlet in the airplane.

00:08:55.262 --> 00:08:56.553
It's that type of illustration.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.750
And then certainly
just modern design,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.630
things that aren't necessarily
a particular style,

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.360
but just created by designers,
like the ReadyMade books

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.170
and the ReadyMade
magazines, great.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.170
Ellen Lupton's books
for kids are great.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.680
And here's a series
more. "The Mini Weapons

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.330
of Mass Destruction"
are great books.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:21.570
"Geek Dads," and certainly
"Make" magazine as well.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.740
And then lastly,
illustrated characters.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.440
You know, the sort of classic
way to reach out to kids

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.480
is through some sort of
cartoon-like character

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.970
or characters that
sort of run you

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.507
through either a
lesson or an activity.

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.840
Here's some more here. "The
Middle School Confidential."

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.048
And then there's a lot of
stuff like the "Oh, Yikes!"

00:09:39.048 --> 00:09:42.580
books, stuff that's cartoony
or meant to be gross or silly.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.010
That was another theme
that started to emerge.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.750
And lastly, these are
illustrated character books,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.161
but yet they're
more stuff almost

00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:53.410
you would see in your high
school guidance counselor's

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.160
office or a doctor's
office or something.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.310
You know, "Boy's Guide
to Becoming a Teen."

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.050
We knew right away this is
not where we wanted to be.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.657
JOSH GLENN: So to be clear,
those are all good books

00:10:03.657 --> 00:10:06.240
that we looked at, and they're
all perfectly good illustration

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.279
styles.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.820
So our question is,
what do we want--

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.987
what's right for our book?

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:11.820
And one thing I love
about working with Tony

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.680
is, he and I are both very
left-brained and right-brained.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.465
So we're very creative
and imaginative,

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:19.030
but we're also very analytical
and like to do our research.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.020
In fact, Tony's
wife complains to me

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.815
sometimes that when
they frame a picture

00:10:22.815 --> 00:10:25.106
it takes like six months to
get it hung up on the wall,

00:10:25.106 --> 00:10:29.835
because Tony's like thinking,
planning each wall, studying.

00:10:29.835 --> 00:10:30.890
But I like that.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.410
So we did a lot of research.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.230
And then I decided to
use some of the tools I

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.230
use in my work as a
semiotic brand analyst

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.780
to look at the stimulus, the
data that Tony had collected.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.040
So this is the next
step that we took.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.870
So what I do in my work
is, I use the tools

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.490
of semiotic analysis to surface
critical insights for marketers

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.260
and branders and
organizations, anybody

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.510
who has a brand that they're
trying to get out there,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.676
to help them understand the
context in which they're

00:10:59.676 --> 00:11:00.450
operating.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.040
There's a saying in marketing--
I'm not actually in marketing,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.620
but I consult to
marketers-- that it doesn't

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.750
matter what your
brand communicates.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.305
What matters is what
the consumer hears,

00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:12.055
because there's a gap
between what you say

00:11:12.055 --> 00:11:12.880
and what they hear.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.630
And that gap is
filled with culture.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.590
There's all this
unspoken network

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.810
of codes and
assumptions and ways

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.540
of thinking that affect
and influence and drive

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.810
our understanding and our
interpretation of everything

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.520
that is sent to us, whether it's
from culture or from marketing.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.740
So what I do in my work is do a
deep dive into a category, all

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.410
the images and
visuals, whether it's

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.186
the beer category or
automotive, or more

00:11:39.186 --> 00:11:42.490
like a cultural territory
like Britishness or luxury.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.600
And I surface all these
codes and then map them,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.660
trying to find the
deep underlying themes

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.210
of that category.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.900
And then that kind of
becomes a strategic tool

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.660
that I can hand over to the
marketing people or the brand

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.130
stakeholders, and
they can kind of

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.880
have a sense of where
they want to operate

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.969
and how they can operate.

00:11:58.969 --> 00:12:00.510
So I said, well,
why don't I just use

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.700
that same tool for Tony's work?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.230
So we did.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:09.720
So one big, underlying, binary
opposition that we determined

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.795
was in the world of
kids' books at that time

00:12:11.795 --> 00:12:16.530
that we did the study was a big
opposition between silly books

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.320
and earnest books.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.350
So on the one hand
there was books

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.808
that are very much like for
kids only, like the "Oh, Yuck!"

00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:21.850
type of books, boys only.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.266
Like parents not
invited basically

00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:24.940
was the message of
these kind of books.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.200
It's the kind of thing you
would give to your kids

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.760
and hopefully they
would leave you alone

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.176
for a while, which was obviously
not what we wanted to do.

00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:32.870
We wanted a project for kids
that you could do with parents.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.286
The other end of
that spectrum was

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.920
kind of earnest,
very earnest books

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.590
that were kind of
for parents, and they

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:44.720
were sort of parenting guides
and not that fun for the kids.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.770
And somewhere
right in the center

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.401
is probably a sweet spot.

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.400
Unfortunately, as you're
approaching the center,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.196
if you don't hit that
sweet spot exactly,

00:12:52.196 --> 00:12:54.570
it can feel very phony and
contrived on the way in there,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.480
we discovered.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.019
And then the other
big continuum is

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:00.560
between permissive
and authoritarian.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.120
This is more about
parenting styles.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.578
So in the world of parenting,
as any of you who are parents

00:13:04.578 --> 00:13:07.160
know, probably, the
three parenting styles

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.120
that you hear people talk
about are permissive,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.690
where you let your kids
do whatever they want,

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.660
authoritarian, where
you're authoritarian

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.900
and you're cracking the whip.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.440
And then authoritative is
the sort of in-between place

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.931
where you're not letting
your kids run wild,

00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:21.430
you're not cracking
the whip, you're

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.070
trying to find a balance
between those two things.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.630
And again, there's
a lot of books

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.390
that are about sort of--
because there was kind

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.060
of a backlash going on at that
time against overparenting

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.207
and helicopter parenting,
quite a lot of books that

00:13:31.207 --> 00:13:32.540
were sort of anti-authoritarian.

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:37.060
And there was a lot of
books that are very,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.350
like, these old boy scientist
books that were getting

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.630
reissued and stuff that
are sort of, here's

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.640
how to do cool
projects but you have

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.889
to follow these rules exactly.

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:47.511
There's no room for wiggle room.

00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:50.010
And there are some books in the
middle like "Make" magazine,

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.850
"DIY Kids," that
we felt were sort

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.702
of hitting that sweet spot
between the two, where it's fun

00:13:54.702 --> 00:13:56.410
and you can kind of--
there's guidelines,

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.160
but you don't have to
follow them exactly,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.050
and there's room for
experimentation and play.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.570
So in my world, I put the two
codes, two binary opposites

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.790
together, and you get
a four-quadrant map.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.000
So where silly meets
authoritarian we're calling it

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.100
the cajoling section
on the bottom left.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.120
And these are kids'
books that were

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.860
sort of fun teacher, the camp
counselor, maybe a cool cousin

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.700
at best.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.390
So the green ones that are kind
of-- that are farthest out--

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.810
are sort of lame category,
or extreme versions

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.300
of that quadrant.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.420
The yellow codes that
you're seeing here

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.500
are kind of the middle
of the row, which

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.083
can seem a little
phony and contrived.

00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:33.180
And the blue ones seemed
pretty cool to us.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.080
So at best, in the
cajoling quadrant,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.455
you had like a
cool older cousin.

00:14:36.455 --> 00:14:39.290
I had cool older cousins
in the '70s who, you know,

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.720
they're cooler than your
teacher or a camp counselor.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.120
They're showing you something
that's maybe kind of dangerous

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.870
that parents wouldn't
let you do normally.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.142
It's exciting.

00:14:46.142 --> 00:14:48.350
But they may be getting you
out of your comfort zone,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.470
which is a good thing.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.095
TONY LEONE: One thing
we did here, too,

00:14:51.095 --> 00:14:54.720
is we assigned personas to
some of these, on the map

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.420
here as well.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.015
And it helps from
a design standpoint

00:14:57.015 --> 00:14:58.640
because once we start
going into design

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.430
it starts to give a sense as
to, who are we trying to target

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:04.680
and who is it
being designed for?

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.620
So to apply personas
here is a nice tool

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.050
in the design process.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.550
JOSH GLENN: So in the top left
where permissive meets silly,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.790
this is the wacky quadrant.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.770
And it's quite a popular
quadrant for kids' books.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.190
We were saying the worst of
it is like the creepy uncle.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.690
A book like "Oh,
Yuck!" is something

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.930
that maybe an uncle
with bad boundaries

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.638
would give to your
kid, and you'd kind of

00:15:23.638 --> 00:15:26.084
be bummed out that he had
given that to your kid.

00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:27.500
Kitsch is somewhere
in the middle.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.290
And then the kooky aunt.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.623
We think that's a really good
thing, to be a kooky aunt.

00:15:30.623 --> 00:15:32.110
So that's a good
version of wacky.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.940
Then in the top right, where
permissive meets earnest.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.481
This is like sherpa parenting,
as people were calling it back

00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:37.190
then.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.060
So it's sort of hippie
parents, slacker moms, low key.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.760
And we felt like maybe there
was a white space there

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.570
or something.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.440
There wasn't really a cool
version of that quadrant yet.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.606
And then authoritarian
meets earnest.

00:15:49.606 --> 00:15:51.230
We called this the
particular quadrant.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.147
This is like fussy grandparents,
helicopter parents,

00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:56.105
at best, maybe with the
grandparents, are geeky

00:15:56.105 --> 00:15:58.980
and crafty parents, like Mark
Frauenfelder from "Make" doing

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.600
stuff with his daughter
sort of would fit there.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.200
So that gives us a map.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.990
Then we layered Tony's
research on top of that map,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.600
and we decided that
there was an opportunity

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.520
to do something that
fit with our values

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.670
as parents and as
people who wanted

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.027
to do a book that was different.

00:16:16.027 --> 00:16:17.610
And it also-- there
was an opportunity

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.800
that no one else was doing
something in the space.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.640
It's sort of a little more
earnest than the kooky aunt,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.619
a little more permissive,
maybe, than the geeky

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:25.410
and crafty parents.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.540
It's a little
easier stuff to do.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.581
You don't have to follow
all these rules exactly.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.820
So it's maybe a little
bit on the serious side,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.110
but not all the way to
earnest, and a little bit

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.290
on the permissive side, but
sort of fun authoritative,

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.915
but not all the way
towards permissive.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.400
So we decided to take our
inspiration from the books that

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.744
were kind of right
around that area.

00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:50.910
So this was our opportunity.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.743
This was all-- we're
making it sound like we

00:16:52.743 --> 00:16:55.639
did this kind of like
creepy adult coming in

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.680
from the outside and
studying the kids' category.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.800
But it was also-- the idea was
to try to articulate and put

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.940
language and visuals to our
own parenting philosophy

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.099
and what we wanted
this book to be.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.890
So then the design
codes we mapped on here.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.300
Do you want to talk
about this, Tony?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.008
TONY LEONE: Sure.

00:17:11.008 --> 00:17:13.750
Here what we're
able to do is, as we

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.405
mapped the imagery,
images of the books

00:17:16.405 --> 00:17:17.780
from my research
on here, we were

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.869
able to take the themes
that emerged and map

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.960
the themes on here as well, just
to help further articulate it.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.280
So around our sweet
spot, we thought maybe

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.110
some contemporary
technical, certainly

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.440
contemporary modern,
little bit of nostalgia,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.650
and the idea of something
being undesigned.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.740
It certainly is
designed, but it's not--

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.397
there's a certain simplicity
to it that lends itself--

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.730
JOSH GLENN: Our big example
of that was the "Whole Earth

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.790
Catalog," like '70s stuff that
we grew up with, like the Zoom

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.187
"Do" books in the '70s and
"The Whole Earth Catalog."

00:17:52.187 --> 00:17:54.020
They are designed, but
they look undesigned.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.195
They look kind of
pasted down on purpose.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.100
TONY LEONE: So from there
we went into inspiration.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.740
Where do we take
all this research?

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.670
Where we take the semiotic
analysis, and what's

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:12.220
going to inspire us visually
against all these codes?

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.380
So again, it's
pretty much what I

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.470
do with any large-scale
design project.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.460
So we looked at
doodle-like-- we want

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.677
the doodle-like
illustration, the idea being

00:18:20.677 --> 00:18:22.510
that we would hire
professional illustrators

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.200
and it would certainly be
done in a professional way,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.540
but it would have a much
more approachable look,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.030
almost as if a kid
could have drawn it.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.560
My son can't draw anything
quite as cool as this,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.060
but he could certainly
aspire to it.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.320
Certainly the idea of
scrapbooks and collages.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.750
These are just images I
found around the Internet

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.880
and through research of just
something that might inspire

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.150
color or a juxtaposition
of imagery.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:51.910
Certainly hand-drawn
typographic textures

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.000
with the idea of
a DIY, something

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.320
that had the maker's
hand involved

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.130
in some of the
typography might be nice.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.170
Cool books, DIY feel, and
again, the creator's hand.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.850
So this really
started to lead us

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.050
down a trail of what we
wanted our illustration

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.850
style to look like.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.510
If you remember, in the
first spreads we put together

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.480
for the pitch, it had a very
technical sort of feel to it.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.340
But after our research
in the semiotic analysis,

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.560
we decided we wanted something
very much with a hand quality

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.220
feel to it.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.200
So that led us to two
illustrators, the first

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.880
being Mister Reusch.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.300
His actual name is Mark Reusch,
but his illustration name

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.741
is Mister Reusch.

00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:30.740
The interesting thing
about the two illustrators

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.920
we brought on to the
project is neither of them

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.210
have the style that you
currently see in the book.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:40.820
So Mark's style, it's very
hand-drawn but very painterly.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.190
He tends to paint a
lot of his work, even

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.902
his black and white
work at the bottom.

00:19:45.902 --> 00:19:47.360
JOSH GLENN: He's
done a lot of work

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.730
for video games, snowboards.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.110
TONY LEONE: Yeah.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.902
Burton Snowboards--
JOSH GLENN: Rock Band.

00:19:50.902 --> 00:19:52.090
TONY LEONE: --shoes.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.090
I think he's done a little
bit of work for Nike.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.740
But it's very painterly style.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.900
So he's someone I
know personally,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.000
so I asked him if-- can you
do something more sketchy.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.540
So we gave each of the
illustrators an assignment

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.080
and it was like, draw some
objects, musical instruments,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.056
sewing supplies.

00:20:09.056 --> 00:20:10.430
We knew some of
these things were

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.846
going to be appearing
in the book,

00:20:11.846 --> 00:20:14.450
sewing supplies and
camping equipment.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.940
So Mark did a great job.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.921
JOSH GLENN: And poor Mark had
just broken his wrist sledding

00:20:18.921 --> 00:20:20.670
right when Tony was
asking him to do this,

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.870
and he didn't want to tell us.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:22.500
TONY LEONE: Yeah,
he didn't tell us

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.124
he had broken his
right hand, and so he

00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:25.610
drew all these
with his left hand.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.329
And he drew them
really big because he

00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:29.120
could have more control
with his left hand,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.780
and he scanned them
and shrunk them.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.610
JOSH GLENN: And he didn't tell
us until like a year later.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:32.649
TONY LEONE: Yeah.

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.232
We didn't find out
until a year later.

00:20:34.232 --> 00:20:35.710
He really wanted the project.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.930
Heather is another-- we all
knew each other from back

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.846
in the Mass Arts days.

00:20:38.846 --> 00:20:42.050
I do want to say I didn't
just go to my friends

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:42.820
for this project.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.370
We actually did
research, and I contacted

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.920
some pretty well-known
illustrators in New York.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.725
And after looking at these
other illustrators' work

00:20:50.725 --> 00:20:52.100
I was like, I
really think people

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.380
I know can actually do
what we're looking for.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.950
So that's why I said we more
or less gave them a test.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.950
Heather's more of a fine
artist and an art educator.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.990
She teaches art in the
Springfield, Mass high school

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.750
system.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.220
But she-- I knew her
from back at Mass Art.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.750
I knew she could do
what we're looking for.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.650
So these are some
of her sketchbooks.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.800
These are some-- she does
these beautiful giant cut-paper

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.602
illustrations that are
more or less installations.

00:21:20.602 --> 00:21:22.310
This is some of her
black and white work.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.180
We gave her the same test,
so she drew some camping

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.950
equipment, some sewing
supplies, and she drew actually

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.650
some Foursquare stuff for us.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.710
So after all this, we
had gotten the contract.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.280
And we needed to get--

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.090
JOSH GLENN: Bloomsbury's
the publisher.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.010
TONY LEONE: Bloomsbury's
the publisher.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.030
So we needed to get
buy-in by Bloomsbury

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.909
for the design of the book.

00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:45.450
So we put together
some rough spreads

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.250
using Heather's and Mark's work.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.580
JOSH GLENN: We should
whip through this part.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.580
We want to get to games.

00:21:54.422 --> 00:21:56.130
TONY LEONE: So Bloomsbury
gave us the go.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.760
They gave us the thumbs
up, they said go for it.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.950
Except for the cover.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.930
In the world of
books, the covers,

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.430
more than anything
else, is dictated

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.760
by the marketing department.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.050
So we shifted from
working with our editor

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.810
to working with the team in
marketing and our editor.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.314
So the cover--

00:22:12.314 --> 00:22:13.730
JOSH GLENN: Long,
painful process.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.521
TONY LEONE: It was a
long, painful process.

00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.224
I'll just go through quickly
all the iterations of the cover.

00:22:18.224 --> 00:22:19.890
JOSH GLENN: And the
marketing department

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.410
also gets to decide
the title of the book.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.460
This is our working title.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.043
TONY LEONE: This is
our working title.

00:22:26.207 --> 00:22:27.540
JOSH GLENN: Go back to that one.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.470
Every now and then
they would say,

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.202
try something with a
circle, like a maze.

00:22:30.202 --> 00:22:31.660
TONY LEONE: So a
maze and a circle.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.970
JOSH GLENN: We tried
everything they told us.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.062
I love all these
covers, by the way.

00:22:36.062 --> 00:22:38.520
TONY LEONE: Any one of these
would have made a great cover.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.810
We ended on this one, and
the editor loved this one,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.040
though at that point he said,
can you send me some titles.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.270
So after a long
iteration of covers, then

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.000
he wanted to look at titles.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.640
We came up with a lot of
names, a lot of names.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.011
He said more better.

00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:59.010
And he came at us with
"The Young Kicker's Guide

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.638
to the Sweet Life."

00:23:00.638 --> 00:23:02.596
JOSH GLENN: We like to
remember that because we

00:23:02.596 --> 00:23:04.710
like to make fun of
him for saying that.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.151
TONY LEONE: It's
still on our list

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:07.900
to make shirts that
say The Young Kicker's

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.480
Guide to the Sweet Life.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.360
So we went back with more names.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.860
And "Freestyle," "The Backpack
Rebellion," "Unbored,"

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.132
and "The Y.E.A.H. Manifesto"
started to emerge.

00:23:17.132 --> 00:23:19.340
JOSH GLENN: And "Unbored"
was almost like a joke name

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.220
at that point in this
long list of names.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.370
But we liked it because
it was kind of punk rock.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.495
Like "unsane" or something.

00:23:24.495 --> 00:23:26.340
TONY LEONE: Or "the unwound."

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.392
So we tried some of the covers
in the style that we liked.

00:23:29.392 --> 00:23:30.600
JOSH GLENN: This was so cool.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.580
We should have done this one.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.413
TONY LEONE: Exactly.

00:23:32.413 --> 00:23:33.969
JOSH GLENN: Go back to that one.

00:23:33.969 --> 00:23:35.010
"The Y.E.A.H. Manifesto."

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.550
Isn't that a good
name for a book?

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.750
We were like making up
what Y.E.A.H. stood for,

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.740
like young,
entrepreneurial, whatever.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.410
They said no.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:48.050
TONY LEONE: So you know,
we got pretty close here.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.640
Tried some different treatments.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.970
And here we got really close.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.640
And finally we got a real book.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.652
JOSH GLENN: Yeah.

00:23:55.652 --> 00:23:56.860
TONY LEONE: This is the book.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.740
JOSH GLENN: Has a nice
holographic-- what's it called?

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.370
Foil.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.578
TONY LEONE: Holographic foil.

00:24:01.578 --> 00:24:03.920
You have to lend some color.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.160
And here's some
spreads from the book.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.600
We hired a lettering
Illustrator named Chris Piascik.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.451
He lives in Western Mass.

00:24:10.451 --> 00:24:10.950
Great guy.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.620
He was a designer who's now--
all he does is hand lettering,

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.840
so is more or less a
hand-letterer Illustrator

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.340
these days.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.006
But he did all our
divider pages for us.

00:24:20.006 --> 00:24:22.700
So that's that hand-drawn
typography from our inspiration

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.660
slides.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.090
Some of Mark's illustrations
about how to rock out,

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:31.840
written by someone who runs
a rock school for kids.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.186
"Soak and Destroy," by John
Edgar Park, "Make" magazine.

00:24:36.186 --> 00:24:37.560
An article on
young adult novels.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.070
There's a series of nice
spreads in the large book,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.520
the first book, "Unbored,"
that are timelines.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.304
So I had this idea for this one.

00:24:47.304 --> 00:24:49.220
It was one of our first
ideas for illustration

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.410
to do a timeline as if you're
standing on your back pocket

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.930
porch looking across
a series of backyards,

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.360
and all the objects that
are featured in the timeline

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.480
show up, and kids and families
are playing in the backyard.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.870
Article "Step Up"
with Rebecca Walker.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.790
Art of how to make zines.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.440
More Chris Piascik work
just because it's so great.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.310
And a beautiful
illustration by Heather

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:16.070
here of a Chinese
New Year dragon.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.570
Thank you.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:18.819
JOSH GLENN: So Tony doesn't
like to toot his own horn,

00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:21.360
but he won three prestigious
design awards for this book.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.280
So all that research paid off.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.490
And the book sold
really well, and so

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.776
they asked us to do a series of
spinoffs, smaller paperbacks,

00:25:31.776 --> 00:25:34.150
that were actually more like
what we originally conceived

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.620
of, as a field guide, like
something you actually take out

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.994
with you, kind of
waterproof, you

00:25:36.994 --> 00:25:38.690
could have it in
your pocket, almost.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.100
And we decided to start
with one on games,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.320
because especially in my
case-- my kids are now older.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.280
My kids were 12 and
10 when I started,

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.405
and they're now 16 and 14.

00:25:49.405 --> 00:25:51.780
And they're getting out of
this age range of these books.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.030
These books are sort of
eight- to 12-year-olds.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.410
But games are one thing
that my kids will still

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.310
do with me any time.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.701
So we thought the games
is a good family activity

00:25:58.701 --> 00:25:59.200
book to do.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.991
We're going to do
another one on adventure.

00:26:00.991 --> 00:26:02.250
We're not sure after that.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.700
So in spirit of the
games book, does anyone

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.951
want to play one of our games?

00:26:05.951 --> 00:26:07.575
Let's play a little
game while we still

00:26:07.575 --> 00:26:08.830
have a few more minutes.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.590
It's a-- I'm like
Jane McGonigal.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.770
I make everyone play a game.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:22.310
It's a low-tech parlor game
called Telephone Pictionary.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.331
So it's like the
game Telephone, where

00:26:24.331 --> 00:26:26.830
as you whisper a word to someone
and it goes along the line,

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.080
it gets more and more-- it
gets farther and farther

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.162
away for what it started.

00:26:30.162 --> 00:26:31.870
And it's like Pictionary,
in which you're

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.482
drawing a picture of something
that someone else is trying

00:26:33.482 --> 00:26:35.357
to communicate to you,
but you may not always

00:26:35.357 --> 00:26:36.730
know exactly what that is.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:45.120
So the way this game works
is that the first person

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.610
will write a sentence here,
or some kind of phrase.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:51.790
It could be like, the
cat walked on the moon.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.870
Grandma was roller skating.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.480
Just something like that.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.950
You hand that pad
to somebody else.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:03.600
They turn the page and they draw
a picture of what you said, OK?

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.560
So it's a sentence
and then a picture.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.987
You then hand the
picture to somebody else.

00:27:07.987 --> 00:27:09.820
They don't know what
the first sentence was.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.430
All they can see
is your picture.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.910
So they then turn the
page and write a sentence

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.160
based on what they think the
picture is, and so forth.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.632
So when you get handed a pad,
if it's got a sentence here,

00:27:18.632 --> 00:27:19.340
you do a picture.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.610
If it's got a picture
here, you do a sentence.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.290
And the first person who gets
the pad has to write a phrase.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.550
Any questions?

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.828
All right, I'm going to pass
out three different ones.

00:27:28.828 --> 00:27:29.676
TONY LEONE: Josh, I
can pass them this way.

00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:31.120
JOSH GLENN: OK.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.495
TONY LEONE: Do
you have a marker?

00:27:34.612 --> 00:27:35.820
JOSH GLENN: You get to start.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.880
TONY LEONE: You want to go?

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.450
JOSH GLENN: All right.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.660
Parlor games-- while
you guys are starting,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.700
I'll talk a little
bit about the game.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.158
TONY LEONE: Starts
with a sentence,

00:27:48.158 --> 00:27:50.137
some sort of statement.

00:27:50.137 --> 00:27:52.220
JOSH GLENN: Yeah, so some
kind of evocative phrase

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.220
or sentence, short, that can
get someone to draw a picture.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.470
So the games book picks up
on some of the-- obviously

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.630
looks a lot like
the "Unbored" book,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.190
and it picks up on some of
the same kind of rubrics

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.940
that we developed.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.710
Like we have Best Ever lists,
like our favorite novels,

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.089
our favorite board games.

00:28:10.089 --> 00:28:12.130
For this one we have so
many favorite board games

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.420
we broke it into favorite
cooperative board

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.690
games, favorite quick board
games, favorite reboots

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.860
of board games.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.600
We have a lot of-- I think
maybe 75 or 80 game instructions

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.220
in here.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.080
And again, we try not
to be too instructive,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.950
so we sort of give guidelines
for how to play the game.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.950
And then we really
encourage-- we usually

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.240
have a little sidebar that
has some hacks of the game,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.240
and then we encourage the
kids and their parents

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.950
to invent their own
hacks for the games.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:42.400
And we have comics that tell
the history of various things.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.870
So here's a history of
board games told in comics.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.440
We have how to, sort of
"Make" magazine-style how

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:54.300
to articles with photos.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.290
So there's just so much
in these little books.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.270
And I think it took
us like a year to do.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.500
Here's a duct tape, a
game out of duck tape.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.941
Here's a rocket-launching game
that my brother-in-law, who

00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:07.690
teaches math in the
Boston public schools,

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.590
uses to teach angles.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.690
They have to make a very
dangerous, actually,

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.101
launch out of PVC
pipe, which we thought

00:29:16.101 --> 00:29:18.600
was safe because he had a book
from NASA about how to do it.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.780
But after this book
came out we realized

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.154
that NASA has
recalled that book.

00:29:26.046 --> 00:29:30.340
Geo games, you know,
GPS-type games, geocaching.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.220
I think there's even a Google
Earth game section in here.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.860
So one thing we like
about parlor games, which

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.740
is the game that we're
passing around now,

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.880
is that parlor games just
inherently brings the family

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.550
together because you're all
facing each other in a circle.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.370
You're not distracted
by any screens.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.240
You're not even
looking at a board.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.527
Oftentimes there's
no equipment at all,

00:29:54.527 --> 00:29:56.360
or maybe just a pencil
and a piece of paper.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.500
There's a bunch in here that
our families like to play.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.090
And the nice thing
about family game night

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:06.490
is that it's just an
amazing way for a family

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.950
to affirm they all
like each other,

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.199
because you don't have to
do it, you know what I mean?

00:30:10.199 --> 00:30:12.470
There's no reason to
do a family game night.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.170
It's not helpful,
it's not productive,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.250
it's not doing chores,
not creating something.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.450
It's just having fun
together on a school night.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.414
And that's really
nice, actually.

00:30:22.414 --> 00:30:25.080
It's a nice little break to have
with your family once in awhile

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.680
to make that happen.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.726
How are we doing on the pads?

00:30:32.726 --> 00:30:33.226
All right.

00:30:33.226 --> 00:30:35.394
Let's let them go
a little farther.

00:30:35.394 --> 00:30:37.810
TONY LEONE: One thing I just
wanted to add about our books

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.890
as well is that Josh and I
both came out of the zine world

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.570
from the '90s.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.440
I worked on a punk
zine in the early '90s,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.650
and we're both out of
the punk and hardcore

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.850
scene from the '80s.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:50.850
So our book, from
the beginning, we

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.260
wanted it to have this sort
of eclectic feel, where

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.800
it has excerpts from old books.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.020
And as Josh was saying, it's got
game theory, game activities.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.720
So it was designed
to be simple enough

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.072
to incorporate all of these sort
of divergent pieces of content.

00:31:06.072 --> 00:31:06.780
JOSH GLENN: Yeah.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.130
It ended up being actually quite
complex sort of structurally,

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:14.476
the book, because it's--
and the way Tony finally--

00:31:14.476 --> 00:31:17.850
on the first book, as we finally
got to the end of the finish

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.526
line there, was the idea ended
up being kind of, it's supposed

00:31:20.526 --> 00:31:23.790
to look like an old-fashioned
manual of how to do stuff.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.635
But then somebody's hacked
it by scribbling notes on it.

00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:28.010
TONY LEONE: Sort
of redrawing it.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.051
JOSH GLENN: Redrawing it.

00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:30.780
And crossing things
out, and ripping

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.200
things out of other pages
and sticking them in

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.390
like you might do with a
cookbook, like recipes.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.264
So there's a lot of
things that look taped in

00:31:36.264 --> 00:31:39.026
or that are done on torn
paper or graph paper.

00:31:39.026 --> 00:31:41.650
TONY LEONE: Yeah, there's a lot
of torn paper texture in there.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.320
JOSH GLENN: So
yeah, we're hoping

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.260
at sort of a subliminal
level, again,

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.960
kids'll get the
idea that what we're

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.460
trying to teach
with these books is

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.560
DIY, the same thing
that Tony and I did back

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.560
when we met in the '90s.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.170
Like doing it yourself is much
more fun than buying something

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.030
that's already made for you.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:01.590
And even if it doesn't look
as good or perfect as the sort

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.841
of fancy finished product
that you'd buy, that's fine.

00:32:03.841 --> 00:32:05.506
That's actually part
of the charm of it,

00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:07.850
is that you made it,
and all the rough edges

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.680
are part of what you
like so much about it.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.055
So we wanted the book, even
though it's a beautiful book,

00:32:12.055 --> 00:32:14.460
to have some kind of that
rough-edged look going

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.270
on inside of it.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.270
Let's take questions now
while we're doing this.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.707
JP.

00:32:19.707 --> 00:32:20.790
AUDIENCE: Should I get up?

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.665
JOSH GLENN: Oh, sure.

00:32:23.487 --> 00:32:24.320
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.320
So I guess I have two questions.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.720
You could choose
whichever one you want.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.220
First one is, you obviously
spent a lot of time thinking

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.140
about the design,
not just the package,

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.360
but just the brand,
everything, the whole feel.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.790
But the content, obviously,
is really important.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.520
Did you just take
things from your life?

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.460
Did you source?

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.010
Did you go online and
did you crowdsource it?

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:52.160
Did you test everything?

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.430
Obviously the content kind
of makes or breaks it.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.860
And then the other question
is kind of content-based.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.020
You have all these people
doing-- like Ze Frank or Rainn

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.210
Wilson doing these like,
put a challenge out online,

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:08.850
and all of our people go
out and dress your vacuum up

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.870
like your mom, take
a photo, and then

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:15.330
you have this resource of 10,000
photos of this funny thing.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.430
Did you guys-- you obviously
went for the book format.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:22.870
Are you doing-- do you know
what's happening in the wild,

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:23.910
or do you care?

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.020
Or are you getting
people to send things in

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.140
or to contribute back?

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.910
Or is it just like,
this is for your world,

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.402
and you go and use
it as you wish?

00:33:32.402 --> 00:33:33.110
JOSH GLENN: Yeah.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.770
Well, to take the
second question first,

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.735
we would love to have a
super robust online community

00:33:38.735 --> 00:33:40.610
like that, where we
could put out a challenge

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.760
and have people send it in.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.845
And we've had a
little bit of success

00:33:42.845 --> 00:33:44.360
with that through our website.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.097
However, because we're working
with a big corporate publisher,

00:33:48.097 --> 00:33:49.680
and because they're
very, very worried

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.100
about an unmonitored space where
children would be interacting

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.580
with adults, there's a
lot of worries about that.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.090
So we kind of can't do
that on our website.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.800
We're trying to be
careful about that.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.180
So what we do is, in our
books and on our website--

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.734
and actually we're
producing-- are we

00:34:06.734 --> 00:34:07.950
allowed to talk about
what we're doing?

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:08.310
TONY LEONE: I think so.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.149
We're in the process
of producing two toy

00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:11.210
kits at the moment.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.918
JOSH GLENN: Yeah.

00:34:11.918 --> 00:34:13.090
Those will be out next year.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.281
And what we're doing
is basically saying,

00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:17.739
we would love to
see what you made.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:19.650
Post it online with
the following hashtag.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.550
But we're not saying, post it
to our site or send it to us.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.250
Wherever you put
it, we'll find it.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.199
So yes, that's answer to that.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.870
Then as far as the
content goes, the idea

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.917
was partly to kind of
capture all the fun

00:34:31.917 --> 00:34:34.000
that we were having as
parenting, me and Elizabeth

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.908
and Tony, with our
kids at that time.

00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:37.949
So a lot of this is
basically from our own lives,

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.606
and yes, we did
all the activities

00:34:39.606 --> 00:34:40.480
that are in the book.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.563
We tested them all with
our kids or with our kids'

00:34:42.563 --> 00:34:45.020
friends or our
nieces and nephews.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.940
And then we were also
kind of harvesting

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.190
our own memories of childhood.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.648
So we were getting a little
bit into that kind of dangerous

00:34:51.648 --> 00:34:53.960
"book for boys" sort of
nostalgia for when we were kids

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.560
and our parents weren't
paying any attention to us,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.650
and we were running wild
in the woods all summer.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.690
So to capture a lot
of that stuff too.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.664
And then, Elizabeth and
I are both very nerdy

00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:02.830
researcher-type people, too.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.370
So there was quite a bit of
looking up historical games

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:09.530
and reading books about
games in the 1930s

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:11.470
and testing with our kids.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:12.950
So that was how we
did the content.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.366
TONY LEONE: And
we did invite in--

00:35:14.366 --> 00:35:17.440
or Josh and Elizabeth did
through their own connections--

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.630
experts in certain areas.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:21.210
Like John Edgar Park
did two articles,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:26.290
and he's a contributor to "Make"
Magazine, and Rebecca Walker.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.654
So there's experts
in their own field.

00:35:28.654 --> 00:35:31.070
JOSH GLENN: But we ended up
having, like, 30 contributors.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.726
I didn't even mention that.

00:35:32.726 --> 00:35:35.100
Like we wanted to do a thing
on citizen science projects.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.460
So we got a scientist to write
about all her favorite citizen

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.840
science projects.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.680
So yeah, we had a knitting
expert, or someone

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.380
who has a website
about knitting,

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.384
do a whole project on
knitting for the kids.

00:35:46.384 --> 00:35:48.050
In this book we only
have four of those,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.780
but we had a lot in the first
book, a lot of outside experts.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.238
All right, let's bring up those
pads and show what we have.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.600
Thank you.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.100
Cool.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:03.599
Thanks.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.350
TONY LEONE: One
more coming, Josh.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:09.391
JOSH GLENN: We can start.

00:36:11.447 --> 00:36:13.280
She won-- I'm not going
to pre-screen these,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.710
so hopefully it's all PG.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.560
She wondered how--
what's this say?--

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.250
hairy it could possibly be.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.692
Oh, rain, does this say?

00:36:28.692 --> 00:36:30.150
I think the person
read it as rain,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:35.780
so here's a person wondering
how rainy it could possibly be.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:42.340
And that got turned into
rain or shine-- that

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:48.690
makes sense-- which got turned
into rain or shine, image.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.910
Oh, that person got it.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:50.690
Rain or shine.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.810
How many ways can you
show rain or shine?

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:03.446
Is it raining or
sunny turned into--

00:37:03.446 --> 00:37:04.820
I think that's
where we ended up.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.120
So this started
with, she wondered

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.471
how hairy it could possibly be.

00:37:10.471 --> 00:37:12.970
TONY LEONE: So here we've got
the cat jumped over the igloo.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.609
Great drawing of a cat
jumping over an igloo.

00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:21.400
You guys are good
illustrators, by the way.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.941
We do these events
with kids, and you

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:25.910
get these little tiny
stick figure illustrations.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.256
The cat jumped over the igloo.

00:37:28.256 --> 00:37:29.990
And another great
illustration of a cat

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.074
jumping over the igloo.

00:37:32.074 --> 00:37:33.990
JOSH GLENN: Yeah, people
are good at kind of--

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.737
TONY LEONE: This one
stayed on course.

00:37:35.737 --> 00:37:37.320
JOSH GLENN: Here the
old man struggled

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.400
to push his shopping cart.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.670
OK.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.616
Sad, frowny guy with sort of
a hunchback pushing a shopping

00:37:44.616 --> 00:37:46.409
cart.

00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:48.450
Help, I've fallen,and my
bread stick is escaping.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:52.380
OK.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.630
So this shows somebody's
falling off a ladder,

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.290
and there's a bread stick with
arms and legs running away.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:58.620
TONY LEONE: That's great.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.578
I like the bread stick.

00:37:59.578 --> 00:38:02.990
JOSH GLENN: A pretzel saw
a boy fall off a ladder.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.480
Makes sense.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.260
And there it is.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.301
Pretzel looking at the
boy-- a pretzel with eyes,

00:38:07.301 --> 00:38:09.392
looking at the boy,
holding up a ladder.

00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:10.850
So obviously this
can go on and on.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:14.100
Sometimes when I go to
large family gatherings,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.761
we'll get a couple of these
pads going and everyone sitting

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:17.260
in a circle.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.920
And while we're talking
about something else

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.461
or even eating dinner
you can kind of

00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:22.370
pass these around
the circle, and it

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.560
has hilarity at the end,
especially when kids

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.580
are drawing the pictures.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.060
All right that's
our presentation.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.700
I think we just made
it under the wire.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.540
Thanks, everybody.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.470
And questions?

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.803
TONY LEONE: Any other questions?

00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:35.310
JOSH GLENN: OK.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:36.143
Thank you very much.

00:38:36.143 --> 00:38:37.338
TONY LEONE: Thank you.
