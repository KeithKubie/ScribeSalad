Episode 27: Progressive Era

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.100
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. history, and today we’re gonna talk

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.360
about Progressives.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.470
No Stan Progressives.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.470
Yes.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.650
You know, like these guys who used to want
to bomb the means of production, but also

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.959
less radical Progressives.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:12.959
Mr. Green, Mr. Green.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.400
Are we talking about, like, tumblr progressive
where it’s half discussions of misogyny

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.020
and half high-contrast images of pizza?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.780
Because if so, I can get behind that.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.080
Me from the past, your anachronism is showing.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.400
Your Internet was green letters on a black
screen.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.780
But no, The Progressive Era was not like tumblr,
however I will argue that it did indirectly

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.160
make tumblr and therefore JLaw gifsets possible,
so that’s something.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.820
So some of the solutions that progressives
came up with to deal with issues of inequality

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.130
and injustice don’t seem terribly progressive
today, and also it kinda overlapped with the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.929
gilded age, and progressive implies, like,
progress, presumably progress toward freedom

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.920
and justice, which is hard to argue about
an era that involved one of the great restrictions

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.250
on freedom in American history, prohibition.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.379
So maybe we shouldn’t call it the Progressive
Era at all.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.699
I g--Stan, whatever, roll the intro.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.140
Intro
So, if the Gilded Age was the period when

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.960
American industrial capitalism came into its
own, and people like Mark Twain began to criticize

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.050
its associated problems, then the Progressive
era was the age in which people actually tried

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.530
to solve those problems through individual
and group action.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.329
As the economy changed, Progressives also
had to respond to a rapidly changing political

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.329
system.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.770
The population of the U.S. was growing and
its economic power was becoming ever more

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.770
concentrated.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.789
And sometimes, Progressives responded to this
by opening up political participation and

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.240
sometimes by trying to restrict the vote.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.270
The thing is, broad participatory democracy
doesn’t always result in effective government--he

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.550
said, sounding like the Chinese national Communist
Party.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.579
And that tension between wanting to have government
for, of, and by the people and wanting to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.770
have government that’s, like, good at governing
kind of defined the Progressive era.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.890
And also our era.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.890
But progressives were most concerned with
the social problems that revolved around industrial

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.970
capitalist society.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.719
And most of these problems weren’t new by
1900, but some of the responses were.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.869
Companies and, later, corporations had a problem
that had been around at least since the 1880s:

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.009
they needed to keep costs down and profits
high in a competitive market.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.980
And one of the best ways to do this was to
keep wages low, hours long, and conditions

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.750
appalling: your basic house-elf situation.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.510
Just kidding, house elves didn’t get wages.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.879
Also, by the end of the 19th century, people
started to feel like these large, monopolistic

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.340
industrial combinations, the so-called trusts,
were exerting too much power over people’s

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.340
lives.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.930
The 1890s saw federal attempts to deal with
these trusts, such as the Sherman Anti-Trust

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.870
Act, but overall, the Federal Government wasn’t
where most progressive changes were made.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.960
For instance, there was muckraking, a form
of journalism in which reporters would find

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.519
some muck and rake it.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.870
Mass circulation magazines realized they could
make money by publishing exposés of industrial

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.481
and political abuse, so they did.

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:49.489
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.069
I bet it involves muck.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.080
The rules here are simple.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.700
I guess the author of the Mystery Document.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.700
I’m either correct or I get shocked.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.850
“Let a man so much as scrape his finger
pushing a truck in the pickle-rooms, and all

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.530
the joints in his fingers might be eaten by
the acid, one by one.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.820
Of the butchers and floormen, the beef-boners
and trimmers, and all those who used knives,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.689
you could scarcely find a person who had the
use of his thumb; time and time again the

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.049
base of it had been slashed, till it was a
mere lump of flesh against which the man pressed

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.270
the knife to hold it.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.069
... They would have no nails – they had
worn them off pulling hides.”

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.069
Wow.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.500
Well now I am hyper-aware of and grateful
for my thumbs.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.909
They are just in excellent shape.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:43.000
I am so glad, Stan, that I am not a beef-boner
at one of the meat-packing factories written

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.760
about in The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.310
No shock for me!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.709
Oh Stan, I can only imagine how long and hard
you’ve worked to get the phrase “beef-boner”

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.709
into this show.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.709
And you finally did it.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:54.709
Congratulations.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.970
By the way, just a little bit of trivia: The
Jungle was the first book I ever read that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.360
made me vomit.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360
So that’s a review.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.680
I don’t know if it’s positive, but there
you go.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.299
Anyway, at the time, readers of The Jungle
were more outraged by descriptions of rotten

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.530
meat than by the treatment of meatpacking
workers: The Jungle led to the Pure Food and

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.140
Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act of 1906.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.410
That’s pretty cool for Upton Sinclair, although
my books have also led to some federal legislation,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.640
such as the HAOPT, which officially declared
Hazel and Augustus the nation’s OTP.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.090
So, to be fair, writers had been describing
the harshness of industrial capitalism for

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.389
decades, so muckraking wasn’t really that
new, but the use of photography for documentation

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.389
was.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.820
Lewis Hine, for instance, photographed child
laborers in factories and mines, bringing

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.389
Americans face to face with the more than
2 million children under the age of 15 working

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.389
for wages.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.220
And Hine’s photos helped bring about laws
that limited child labor.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.370
But even more important than the writing and
photographs and magazines when it came to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.270
improving conditions for workers was Twitter
… what’s that?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.710
There was no twitter?

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.710
Still?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.710
What is this 1812?

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.490
Alright, so apparently still without Twitter,
workers had to organize into unions to get

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.360
corporations to reduce hours and raise their
pay.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.930
Also some employers started to realize on
their own that one way to mitigate some of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.710
the problems of industrialization was to pay
workers better, like in 1914, Henry Ford paid

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.630
his workers an average of $5 per day, unheard
of at the time.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.850
.
Whereas today I pay Stan and Danica 3x that

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.060
and still they whine.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.420
Ford’s reasoning was that better-paid workers
would be better able to afford the Model Ts

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.490
that they were making.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.979
And indeed, Ford’s annual output rose from
34,000 cars to 730,000 between 1910 and 1916,

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.670
and the price of a Model T dropped from $700
to $316.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.860
Still, Henry Ford definitely forgot to be
awesome sometimes; he was anti-Semitic, he

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.310
used spies in his factories, and he named
his child Edsel.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.830
Also like most employers at the turn of the
century, he was virulently anti-union.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.780
So, while the AFL was organizing the most
privileged industrial workers, another union

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.840
grew up to advocate for rights for a larger
swath of the workforce, especially the immigrants

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.361
who dominated unskilled labor: The International
Workers of the World.

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.650
They were also known as the Wobblies, and
they were founded in 1905 to advocate for

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.009
“every wage-worker, no matter what his religion,
fatherland or trade,” and not, as the name

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.180
Wobblies suggests, just those fans of wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.380
The Wobblies were radical socialists; ultimately
they wanted to see capitalism and the state

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.930
disappear in revolution.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.440
Now, most progressives didn’t go that far,
but some, following the ideas of Henry George,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.849
worried that economic progress could produce
a dangerous unequal distribution of wealth

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.030
that could only be cured by … taxes.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.270
But, more Progressives were influenced by
Simon W. Patten who prophesied that industrialization

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.130
would bring about a new civilization where
everyone would benefit from the abundance

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.820
and all the leisure time that all these new
labor-saving devices could bring.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.060
This optimism was partly spurred by the birth
of a mass consumption society.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.730
I mean, Americans by 1915 could purchase all
kinds of new-fangled devices, like washing

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.310
machines, or vacuum cleaners, automobiles,
record players.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.940
It’s worth underscoring that all this happened
in a couple generations: I mean, in 1850,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.250
almost everyone listened to music and washed
their clothes in nearly the same way that

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.919
people did 10,000 years ago.

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.220
And then BOOM.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.760
And for many progressives, this consumer culture,
to quote our old friend Eric Foner, “became

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.990
the foundation for a new understanding of
freedom as access to the cornucopia of goods

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.960
made available by modern capitalism.”

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.020
And this idea was encouraged by new advertising
that connected goods with freedom, using “liberty”

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.630
as a brand name or affixing the Statue of
Liberty to a product.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.590
By the way, Crash Course is made exclusively
in the United States of America, the greatest

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.930
nation on earth ever.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.930
(Libertage.)

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.540
That’s a lie, of course, but you’re allowed
to lie in advertising.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.620
But in spite of this optimism, most progressives
were concerned that industrial capitalism,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.780
with its exploitation of labor and concentration
of wealth, was limiting, rather than increasing

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.569
freedom, but depending on how you defined
“freedom,” of course.

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:56.250
Industrialization created what they referred
to as “the labor problem” as mechanization

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.550
diminished opportunities for skilled workers
and the supervised routine of the factory

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.370
floor destroyed autonomy.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:07.870
The scientific workplace management advocated
by efficiency expert Frederick W. Taylor required

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.620
rigid rules and supervision in order to heighten
worker productivity.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.360
So if you’ve ever had a job with a defined
number of bathroom breaks, that’s why.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.150
Also “Taylorism” found its way into classrooms;
and anyone who’s had to sit in rows for

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:26.319
45 minute periods punctuated by factory-style
bells knows that this atmosphere is not particularly

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.090
conducive to a sense of freedom.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.370
Now this is a little bit confusing because
while responding to worker exploitation was

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.140
part of the Progressive movement, so was Taylorism
itself because it was an application of research,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.040
observation, and expertise in response to
the vexing problem of how to increase productivity.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.010
And this use of scientific experts is another
hallmark of the Progressive era, one that

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.410
usually found its expression in politics.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.200
American Progressives, like their counterparts
in the Green Sections of Not-America, sought

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.770
government solutions to social problems.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.010
Germany, which is somewhere over here, pioneered
“social legislation” with its minimum

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.460
wage, unemployment insurance and old age pension
laws, but the idea that government action

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.470
could address the problems and insecurities
that characterized the modern industrial world,

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.020
also became prominent in the United States.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.230
And the notion that an activist government
could enhance rather than threaten people’s

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.280
freedom was something new in America.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.820
Now, Progressives pushing for social legislation
tended to have more success at the state and

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.150
local level, especially in cities, which established
public control over gas and water and raised

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.140
taxes to pay for transportation and public
schools.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.970
Whereas federally the biggest success was,
like, Prohibition, which, you know, not that

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.970
successful.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.590
But anyway, if all that local collectivist
investment sounds like Socialism, it kind

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.590
of is.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:40.970
I mean, by 1912 the Socialist Party had 150,000
members and had elected scores of local officials

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.090
like Milwaukee mayor Emil Seidel.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.310
Some urban progressives even pushed to get
rid of traditional democratic forms altogether.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.570
A number of cities were run by commissions
of experts or city managers, who would be

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.790
chosen on the basis of some demonstrated expertise
or credential rather than their ability to

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.560
hand out turkeys at Christmas or find jobs
for your nephew’s sister’s cousin.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.530
Progressive editor Walter Lippman argued for
applying modern scientific expertise to solve

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:10.290
social problems in his 1914 book Drift and
Mastery, writing that scientifically trained

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.270
experts “could be trusted more fully than
ordinary citizens to solve America’s deep

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.510
social problems.”

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:21.250
This tension between government by experts
and increased popular democratic participation

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.810
is one of the major contradictions of the
Progressive era.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.400
The 17th amendment allowed for senators to
be elected directly by the people rather than

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.140
by state legislatures, and many states adopted
primaries to nominate candidates, again taking

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.860
power away from political parties and putting
it in the hands of voters.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.230
And some states, particularly western ones
like California adopted aspects of even more

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.130
direct democracy, the initiative, which allowed
voters to put issues on the ballot, and the

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.190
referendum, which allows them to vote on laws
directly.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.650
And lest you think that more democracy is
always good, I present you with California.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.760
But many Progressives wanted actual policy
made by experts who knew what was best for

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.550
the people, not the people themselves.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.480
And despite primaries in direct elections
of senators it’s hard to argue that the

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.860
Progressive Era was a good moment for democratic
participation, since many Progressives were

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.790
only in favor of voting insofar as it was
done by white, middle class, Protestant voters.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.790
Alright.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.240
Let’s Go to the Thought Bubble.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.300
Progressives limited immigrants’ participation
in the political process through literacy

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.730
tests and laws requiring people to register
to vote.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.790
Voter registration was supposedly intended
to limit fraud and the power of political

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.790
machines.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.910
Stop me if any of this sounds familiar, but
it actually just suppressed voting generally.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.080
Voting gradually declined from 80% of male
Americans voting in the 1890s to the point

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.500
where today only about 50% of eligible Americans
vote in presidential elections.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.640
But an even bigger blow to democracy during
the Progressive era came with the Jim Crow

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.990
laws passed by legislatures in southern states,
which legally segregated the South.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.100
First, there was the deliberate disenfranchisement
of African Americans.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.420
The 15th amendment made it illegal to deny
the right to vote based on race, color or

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.060
previous condition of servitude but said nothing
about the ability to read, so many Southern

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.290
states instituted literacy requirements.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.620
Other states added poll taxes, requiring people
to pay to vote, which effectively disenfranchised

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.500
large numbers of African American people,
who were disproportionately poor.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.260
The Supreme Court didn’t help: In 1896,
it made one of its most famous bad decisions,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.970
Plessy v. Ferguson, ruling that segregation
in public accommodations, in Homer Plessy’s

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.920
case a railroad car, did not violate the 14th
amendment’s Equal Protection clause.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.170
As long as black railroad cars were equal
to white ones, it was A-OK to have duplicate

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.170
sets of everything.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.551
Now, creating two sets of equal quality of
everything would get really expensive, so

00:12:35.551 --> 00:12:37.960
Southern states didn’t actually do it.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.990
Black schools, public restrooms, public transportation
opportunities--the list goes on and on--would

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.280
definitely be separate, and definitely not
equal.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.280
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.190
Now, of course, as we’ve seen Progressive
ideas inspired a variety of responses, both

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:55.150
for Taylorism and against it, both for government
by experts and for direct democracy.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.570
Similarly, in the Progressive era, just as
the Jim Crow laws were being passed, there

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.640
were many attempts to improve the lives of
African Americans.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.990
The towering figure in this movement to “uplift”
black southerners was Booker T. Washington,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.840
a former slave who became the head of the
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a center for

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.900
vocational education.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.100
And Washington urged southern black people
to emphasize skills that could make them successful

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.510
in the contemporary economy.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.590
The idea was that they would earn the respect
of white people by demonstrating their usefulness

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:25.010
and everyone would come to respect each other
through the recognition of mutual dependence

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.890
while continuing to live in separate social
spheres.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:32.600
But Washington’s accommodationist stance
was not shared by all African Americans.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.940
WEB DuBois advocated for full civil and political
rights for black people and helped to found

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.740
the NAACP,
which urged African Americans to fight for

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.300
their rights through “persistent, manly
agitation.”

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.300
So I wanted to talk about the Progressive
Era today not only because it shows up on

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.760
a lot of tests, but because Progressives tried
to tackle many of the issues that we face

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.290
today, particularly concerning immigration
and economic justice, and they used some of

00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:00.600
the same methods that we use today: organization,
journalistic exposure, and political activism.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.620
Now, we may use tumblr or tea party forums,
but the same concerns motivate us to work

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.620
together.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.320
And just as today, many of their efforts were
not successful because of the inherent difficulty

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.610
in trying to mobilize very different interests
in a pluralistic nation.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.050
In some ways their platforms would have been
better suited to an America that was less

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.300
diverse and complex.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.550
But it was that very diversity and complexity
that gave rise and still gives rise to the

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.230
urge toward progress in the first place.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.230
Thanks for watching.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.230
I’ll see you next week.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.360
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.140
Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.570
The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.040
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Rojas, and

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.040
myself.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.260
Every week there’s a new caption for the
libertage.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.340
You can suggest captions in comments where
you can also ask questions about today’s

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.610
video that will be answered by our team of
historians.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.620
Thanks for watching Crash Course.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.830
If you like it, and if you’re watching the
credits you probably do, make sure you’re

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:53.830
subscribed.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:15:00.070
And as we say in my hometown don’t forget
to be awesome...That was more dramatic than

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.070
it sounded.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.072
