00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.460
&gt;&gt; Dan Turello: Good afternoon,
welcome to our program.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
I'm Dan Turello on staff
for the Kluge Center.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.650
Before we start, I
want to remind you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.370
to please turn off
any cellphones

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.930
or other devices
that might interfere.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.890
And I also want to remind you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.700
that we are recording
today's lecture for placement

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.460
on the library's Youtube
and iTune channels.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.440
A few words about Kloge
Center before we begin.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.140
It was founded in 2000 thanks to
a donation from John W. Kluge.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.750
The goal of facilitating
scholarly access

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.530
to the library's remarkable
collection of knowledge

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.940
and engaging thinkers and
scholars in conversation

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.600
with lawmakers and
other public figures.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.030
We do this by inviting
scholars into residents,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.330
including predoctoral

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.230
and postdoctoral fellows
and senior chairs.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.340
We also administer the
Kluge Prize which is awarded

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.500
by the Librarian of
Congress for achievement

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.070
in the study of humanity.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.950
Today, it's wonderful to have
Samira Mehta back with us.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.060
Samira recently completed
her time

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.660
as a David Larson fellow
at the Kluge Center.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.070
And the Larson Fellowships,
specifically, is made possible

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.060
by an endowment from
the International Center

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.510
for Integration of
Health and Spirituality.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.630
It's named after David
Larson, an epidemiologist,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.460
I can never say that correctly,
and psychiatrist who focused

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.600
on understudied factors that
might help in preventing,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.740
coping, and recovering
from illness.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.710
The fellowship here at the
Kluge Center is designed

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.480
to continue Dr. Larson's legacy

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.000
of promoting meaningful
scholarly study of two important

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.510
and increasingly interrelated
fields, spirituality,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.630
and physical, mental
and social health.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.650
So a few words about Samira
before we invite her up.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.390
She is assistant professor

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.040
of religious studies
at Albright College.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.120
She holds a PhD in Religious
Studies from Emory University

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.610
and a Masters of
Divinity from Harvard.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.110
Some of the courses she's taught

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.100
in the last few years include
early American religious life

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.730
to 1865, modern American
religious life from 1865

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.260
to the present, Islam and--
Islam ideals and realities,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.360
and finally gender and
sexuality in American religion.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.320
And her book "Beyond
Chrismukkah", a cultural history

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.880
of the Christian-Jewish
blended family from 1965

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550
to 2010 is forthcoming,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.630
and I hear it's forthcoming
this spring.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.690
So be on the lookout for
it from the University

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.930
of North Carolina Press.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.430
Most recently, she has
been studying the history

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.760
of contraception and religion
in America for a new book.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.370
And the title of her talk today
is Morality, Contraception,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.720
and Religion in Post
War America.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.510
So please join me
in welcoming Samira.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.710
[ Applause ]

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Samira K. Mehta:
Welcome and thank you for coming

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480
to my talk today on
contraception, morality,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.010
and religion in post
war America.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.570
I would like to thank
the friends from outside

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.420
of the Library of
Congress who are today.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.190
I appreciate your support.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.380
Thank you to John Haskell for
welcoming me back for this talk.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.900
I would also like to
thank my fellow fellows

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.850
at the Kluge Center, those
who joined us today and those

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.200
who were here with me.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.800
Some of those people overlap
and some of them don't.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.070
In terms of my research, I
can't speak highly enough

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.600
of the reference assistance
that I was given, in particular

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.760
by Cheryl Adams and
Mary Champagne

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.360
in the Main Reading Room, by
Ryan Reft and Edith Sandler

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.020
in the Manuscript Division,
and by Martha Kennedy

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.040
in Prints and Photographs.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.920
The women's history lunch group
here at the library listened

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.280
to an early version of this
talk and helped me select what

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.580
of my research might
interest you the most today.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.460
And of course, none of these
experiences would have been

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.570
possible without the support of
the staff at the Kluge Center,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.780
Dan and Emily Coccia,
Mary Lou Reker,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.860
my interns Christine
Lee [assumed spelling]

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.990
and Emily Kendal Fio
[assumed spelling].

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.110
And most specially, I would
like to thank Travis Hensley

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.090
for making everything
run more smoothly

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.920
and for being an amazing
sounding board and resource

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.280
as I navigated the Library of
Congress and the Kluge Center.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.830
Thank you.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.050
Contraception and religion
have been much in the news

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.010
over the past several years.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.270
For instance, the 2000--
in 2014, the-- there we go.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.790
The-- It works differently
than the one in my classroom.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.370
In the case of Burwell
versus Hobby Lobby Stores,

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.520
Incorporated, the Supreme
Court of the United States,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.920
right through those windows,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.220
ruled that the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.820
of 1993 can apply
to corporations.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.340
The Religious Freedom
Restoration Act was proposed

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.520
by New York democrat Chuck
Schumer and is intended

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.660
to ensure that interests in
religious freedom are protected.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.210
So originally, this act was
intended to apply to people.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.900
That is to say, an organization
could not deny an individual his

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.600
or her religious rights.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.370
So think for instance of this
act giving a Muslim student the

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.620
right to pray during the school
day or protecting a Wiccan

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.430
from being fired because
she practices witchcraft.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.590
The Religious Freedom
Restoration Act stipulated

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.880
that it protected the
religious freedoms of persons,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.280
but the Hobby Lobby
cases extended that logic

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.430
to corporations through the
concept of corporate personhood.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.440
That is to say that
the court has decided

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.380
that because Hobby Lobby is a
closely held corporation ran

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.040
by an individual or family

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.730
who sincerely held religious
beliefs, oppose certain forms

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.310
of contraception, that company
is functionally a person

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.650
and may exercise its religious
freedom to exclude such forms

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.550
of contraception from its health
insurance policies and coverage.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.850
It may not fire a woman who
uses said contraception or a man

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.940
who is sleeping with a
woman who uses such forms

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.740
of contraception, but it need
not provide access to it.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.530
The court case was
fought and won

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.720
in terms of religious freedom.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.190
Individuals and activists who
objected to the case either did

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.990
so because they didn't like
religious freedom being extended

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.520
to corporation or because they
didn't really think religious

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.680
freedom was the key
issue, rather they saw it

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.510
as a red herring and saw
the case as, in the end,

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.910
about a conservative attempt

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.360
to structure American families
and/or control the sexuality

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.240
and reproductive lives
of American women.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.980
So Burwell versus Hobby
Lobby is just one example

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.280
of a contemporary moment

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.380
when religious freedom
arguments have been used

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.260
to restrict women's
access to contraception.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.870
And in each case, there are
people who either see or wanted

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.470
to see the religious rights
of the employer triumph

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.100
or the religious rights
of the employee triumph.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.780
So, you know, that's kind
of the question there.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.190
Whose religious rights
end up mattering?

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:01.410
And in each case, objections
come both from people

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.740
who have opinions about how
that should play out and come

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.240
from people who are
concerned that this is really

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.280
about conservative
controls of sexuality.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.910
And well, this is basically
a talk about heterosexuality

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.290
and contraception,
similar logics play out,

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:22.060
and for instance, court cases
about wedding cakes in the--

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.890
in exactly this moment.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.590
So, I'm not actually here
to talk about Hobby Lobby.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.420
I did that in order to give
you a contemporary hook,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.470
a context through which you can
understand some of the history

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.980
that I'm going to
talk about today.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.420
If you're interested in
Hobby Lobby, see me after.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:42.220
I can recommend excellent
scholarship.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.400
But the tensions of religious
freedom and the structure

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.540
of American family and the
role of religion in sexuality

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.040
in public discourse is not
a unique set of tensions.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.830
It's not something
that came to exist

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.670
in the contemporary moment.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.010
Most of my research here
at the Kluge Center looked

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.050
at another moment in
the religious history

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.850
of reproductive rights,
when religious freedom

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.320
and religious responses

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.680
to the American family
were actually used

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.430
to expand women's
access to contraception.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.090
In part because of cases like
Hobby Lobby and for a myriad

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.150
of other reasons well beyond
the scope of today's talk,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.260
really well beyond the scope
of anything you could talk

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.750
about in an afternoon.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.180
Most people tend to think
of religion and sexuality

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.010
as existing in opposition
to each other.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.800
At best, we think of
the clergy's response

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.490
to women's health
as one represented

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.580
in this political cartoon.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.660
And as this is being
recorded for use online

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.670
and as the slides will not be
part of the online presentation,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.930
please forgive me as I give a
brief summary for the people

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.230
who are listening to this later.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.810
The PowerPoint is showing a
political cartoon of a man

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.590
and woman leaving a church
at the end of service.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.140
They're at the door and
they're commenting on the sermon

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.400
to a clergyman in his vestments.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.180
It's a very high
church kind of look.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.840
And the caption reads
nice waffling on the pill.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.390
The implication suggests what
I think we popularly understand

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:21.500
to be more or less the most
pro-contraception position

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.370
of the clergy, waffling.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.580
No clear endorsement that
one might have sex simply

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.220
for pleasure or that
contraception might be a moral

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.690
or social good.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.460
Rather, an impression that
clergies see marital sex

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.400
as generally good an
acceptance of the fact

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.540
that the 2.5 child
family is the norm.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.620
Something of a don't ask,
don't tell policy, right?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.400
Like, we're not asking how it is
that this is normal family size.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.910
And that's how people
often think

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.610
of religious interactions
with sexuality.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.240
And this common misconception
misses an important piece

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.690
of American religious history.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:06.190
In the 1950s, in the not quite
immediately post war period,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.600
Protestant and Jewish clergy
were central to the battle

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.820
to get women access
to birth control.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.310
Today, I'm going to tell you a--

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.570
that story in a way that
will demonstrate some

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.450
of the shifting relationship

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.410
between how American clergy
have connected contraception

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.350
and religious freedom,
demonstrating that for middle

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.820
of the century Protestant
and Jewish reproduction--

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.130
Protestants and Jews
reproduction

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.750
and the family provided a
key sight of moral agency,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.680
and one that they were
determined to protect.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.870
And just to give you a bit of a
heads-up about how this is going

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.420
to work, the story
I'm going to tell is

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.480
about a two-month campaign
waged largely by the Protestant

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.770
and Jewish clergy of the
New York metropolitan area,

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.440
along with a number of
medical organizations,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.000
and waged against
the commissioner

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.300
of the New York municipal
hospitals.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.830
Throughout the talk, I will be
moving between that narrative

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.030
and relevant pieces
of background in order

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.000
to illuminate what's
going on in that moment.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.830
So we'll be going between 1958
when the story is happening

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:16.260
and varying backstory
conversations that's informing

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.560
the action.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.570
And if you'll excuse me, I
am going to take the staple

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.110
out of this because I keep
hitting the microphone every

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.410
time I turn a page.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.090
There we go.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.390
That is better.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:49.400
So, I hope that that moving
around in time will help--

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.940
will still give you
a clear story

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.770
and that the pieces
will all knit together.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:13:00.890
But to begin, in 1958, at
the Kings County Hospital

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.710
in New York City, and for those
listening online, I have a slide

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.000
that has the picture
of the gentlemen

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.010
about whom I'm about
to be speaking.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.480
One picture is very good and the
other is a terrible reproduction

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.200
from a newspaper, but it was
the best that I could do.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.100
At the Kings County
Hospital in New York City,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.210
a Jewish doctor planned
to fit a Protestant woman

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:26.270
with a diaphragm, or as
all of the records put it,

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.260
a contraceptive device.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.640
The young woman was diabetic.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.500
She had just had her first child
and the combination of diabetes

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.610
and pregnancy had proved
extremely dangerous.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.980
Doctors feared that another
pregnancy could kill her.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.330
She was young, however,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.730
and scientists were
making massive advances

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.260
in diabetes research
and treatment.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.120
She, her husband,
and her doctors hoped

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.750
that medicine would
advance enough to allow her

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.840
to safely sustain a pregnancy
while she was still young enough

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.140
to bear children.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.390
As a result, they
wanted to provide her

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.550
with contraception
rather than sterilization.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.450
Her doctor, Louis Hellman,
was the director of obstetrics

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.700
and gynecology at
Kings County Hospital.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.170
And they scheduled
her fitting at 10:00

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:15.470
in the morning on
July 16th, 1958.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.540
At 9:30 that morning,
Dr. Hellman went

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.970
to the hospital supervisor, Dr.
Harvey Gollance to inform him

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.100
that he would be fitting his
patient with a diaphragm.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.720
Dr. Gollance informed
Dr. Hellman

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.160
that the New York City Hospital
commissioner, Dr. Morris Jacobs,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.430
had forbidden him to proceed.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.080
Dr. Hellman requested that Dr.
Jacobs put the order in writing.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.530
Dr. Gollance said he would
need to telephone Dr. Jacobs.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.590
Dr. Hellman returned to
his own office to wait.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.920
At 10:15, so 15 minutes after
the appointment was scheduled,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.090
Dr. Gollance called and
said that the order stood

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.970
but that Dr. Jacobs would
not put it in writing.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.520
So Dr. Hellman was somewhat
surprised by this news.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.700
While it had long been an
unwritten rule that doctors

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.650
in municipal hospitals
were forbidden

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.960
from prescribing birth control,
over the course of the spring

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.730
of 1958, the policy
appeared to be relaxing,

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.440
like the hospitals seemed
to be backpedaling a bit.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.440
Just a few months earlier,
the New York Academy

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.110
of Physicians has
questioned Jacobs

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.920
as to the city's
policy on contraception.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.980
On April 11th, 1985, Jacobs had
written to them that the care

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.930
and treatment of patients
are the responsibility

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.260
of the medical board.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.960
"There shall be no
interference in proper

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.120
and accepted therapeutic
practices, nor intervention

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.370
in ethical relationships
between patient

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.750
and physician," Jacobs
had written.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.240
Most physicians interpreted
Jacob's statement to mean

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.720
that birth control decisions
were up to individual hospitals

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.740
or the individual ethics boards
of hospitals and their doctors.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.470
Hellman himself had told the New
York Herald Tribune that prior

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.580
to April 11th, he would not have
been able to provide a woman

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.750
with a medically necessary
contraceptive device,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.100
but he believed that the April
11th decisions had changed that.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.270
Granted, the Herald
Tribune noted,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.530
several questions
remain unsettled.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.610
For instance, while Jacobs
appeared to relax the rules,

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.860
hospital pharmacies did not
stock contraceptive devices.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.630
Did his statement mean that
they would start doing so?

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.780
Or would patients be able
to receive a prescription

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.020
that they would then have to
take to a private pharmacy?

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.930
As it turned out, the latter.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.130
After the April 11th
announcement,

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.030
Dr. Hellman ordered
contraceptive devices

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.680
for the Kings County Hospital,
and the order was never filled.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.270
But on May 4th, when
he gave this interview

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.600
to the Herald Tribune,
Hellman told the paper

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.170
that he was very satisfied
with Jacobs's new stance.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.070
So when faced with
this diabetic patient,

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.420
Dr. Hellman followed all
of the outlined protocols.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.000
He went to the Kings County
Hospital executive committee

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.220
for permission to provide his
patient with contraception.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.770
On July 1st, they granted
him permission to proceed.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.860
This was unusual but it
was not unprecedented.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.640
Kings County Hospital had,
at three different points,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.260
ruled that the hospital could
provide therapeutic birth

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.110
control when it was
deemed medically necessary.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.880
That is to say, a couple could
not have birth control simply

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.380
because they wanted to
space out their children.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.000
They couldn't decide they did
not want to have children.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.680
They could not decide
that eight was enough.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.470
They could, however, have
birth control for reasons

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.290
like the one outlined above.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.350
There was a medical reason to
delay or space out childbearing,

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:56.520
but the couple desired to
preserve the possibility

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.430
of having children in the future
should the mother's health

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.630
or should the medical
interventions available

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.930
to the mother change.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.150
So the reversal of this
decision 15 minutes before--

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.430
after he was supposed to
see his patient surprised

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.750
and dismayed Dr. Hellman.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.590
He did, however, also feel
that it tied his hands.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.770
He did not fit his patient
for the contraceptive device,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.720
but he did go to the newspapers.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.330
The next morning, The New York
Times reported on the situation.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.090
And I would just like to
say The New York Times

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.070
and the New York Herald Tribune
and the New York Post were all

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.540
over this like white on rice.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.600
So there's a fantastic record.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.160
Since the ban was not official,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.320
there was no official
explanation

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.840
for why contraception
was functionally banned.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.210
In his book "Sacred Work",

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.480
public theologian Tom
Davis hypothesized

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.060
that the answer was
the Catholic Church.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.700
And again, for those
listening online,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.090
what I have here is a
slide with a prelate,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.630
and it says underneath, the pill
is a no-no, and he's pointing

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.730
like Uncle Sam, as in, you know,
we want you for the US Army.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:20.810
So the New York City electorate
was 80-- was 48% catholic.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.110
And the Catholic Church
firmly opposed contraception.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.630
Catholics might not appreciate
their tax dollars going

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.830
to support contraception
and public facilities.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.260
Davis argued essentially

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.250
that the New York City
elected officials were afraid

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.410
that if they appeared to
support birth control,

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.840
the church would condemn them,

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.750
and they would be
voted out of office.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.510
For a modern example,
think for instance

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.690
of John Kerry being denied
communion by Cardinal Burke

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.070
for his stance on abortion.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.000
On some level, I find
Davis's argument compelling,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.550
but I'm not fully convinced, at
least not by the electoral math.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.230
Forty-eight percent is a
lot, but it's not a majority.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.420
And perhaps more importantly,
within only a few years

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.490
of the birth control pill
being approved by the FDA,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.790
Debra Hendler [assumed
spelling],

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.180
historian /Debra
Hendler's research tells us

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.300
that Catholic women
would use contraception

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.970
at essentially the same rate as
their Protestant counterparts.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.050
It seems to me that New
York City politicians,

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.460
and many of whom were
Catholic, probably realized

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.250
that many Catholic
voters would break

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.590
with the church on
contraception.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.390
And so, I'm flagging this mostly
as a place where I'm planning

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.770
to do some more research

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.050
around why birth control
was carefully restricted

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.690
in New York municipal settings.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.510
Taking a look at the money
and where it's coming from,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:51.060
what the positions of individual
political figures may have been.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.830
But the Catholic Church aside,

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.940
there are some other
reasons why birth control was

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.320
so hard to come by.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.430
For about 75 years, birth
control and information

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.440
about birth control had
been restricted largely

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.160
on the grounds that
it was indecent.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.280
In 1873, Congress had
passed something called the

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.790
Comstock Act.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.870
Anti-pornography laws for
the suppression of trade in,

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.520
and circulation of,
obscene literature

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.080
and articles of immoral use.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.300
Essentially, for our purposes,

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.970
the Comstock laws made
it illegal to talk about,

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.610
write publicly about,
or ship birth control.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:41.140
This picture of Margaret
Sanger in 1929 shares some

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.800
of the ramifications of, if not,
the Comstock laws themselves

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.210
which were federal, the
attitudes that they represented.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.030
Margaret Sanger was
a trained nurse

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.340
and an early birth
control activist.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.350
She was both the founder of the
American Birth Control League,

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.520
now Planned Parenthood, and
one of the early proponents

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.110
of the birth control pill.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.570
She did a lot of the
fundraising that went

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.800
into funding the research that
would bring about the pill.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.980
In 1916, she had opened the
country's first birth control

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.300
clinic in Brownville, Brooklyn.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.160
It remained open
for about a month.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.480
Throughout her career, she was
arrested for her activities.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.230
And throughout the 1920's,

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.250
Margaret Sanger was
famously banned in Boston.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.560
She was prevented by Mayor
James Curley from speaking

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:34.050
in 1923, 1924, and 1925.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:40.290
This photo, which is from 1929,
is a moment when she appeared

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.610
on stage wearing a gag.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.500
She was not able to
speak, and the eminent

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.400
and male historian Arthur
Schlesinger read her prepared

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.230
remarks for her while she sat
there or stood there gagged.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.450
It was a brilliant
publicity stunt.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.550
And so, what you have here is
you have a fairly significant

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:09.950
history of birth control being
something that is legally,

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.190
often forbidden,
highly restricted, very,

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:18.560
very problematic, and
because of reasons of decency,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.250
information is extremely
limited as well.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:28.640
So the need to avoid over
mention of contraception led

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.640
to some coy ads and interesting
forms of birth control.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.400
During the same decade that
Sanger was banned in Boston,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.800
these ads for Lysol appeared in
a number of women's magazines.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.350
For those of you
watching online,

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.390
the slide that I'm showing
depicts three different

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.240
advertisements for Lysol.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.930
The first shows an older sister
advising her younger sister

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.360
in what is clearly an
intimate conversation.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.140
The caption reads, lucky
bride to have an older sister.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.910
The second image depicts
a woman wiping away a tear

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:03.530
with a handkerchief, worlds--

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.170
words swirl around her
head saying inhibitions,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.860
ignorance, doubt, misgivings.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:15.660
The caption reads, do
inhibitions, parenthesis doubts,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.500
threaten married love?

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.300
One small intimate physical
neglect can rob a wife

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.370
of her husband's love.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.960
The last image shows a portrait
of a lovely and well made

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:34.150
up woman and says, she was the
perfect wife with just one flaw.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.310
She was guilty of
the one neglect

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.530
that mars many marriages.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.100
Lysol helps avoid this.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.270
So these ads explicitly in
small text refer to Lysol

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.390
as a feminine hygiene product.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.980
But as historian Adrian Tone--
Andrea Tone makes clear,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.880
everyone understood that these
ads were really promoting

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.880
douching with Lysol as a
method of contraception.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.010
As a method, it was ineffective

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.940
and had potential
side effects ranging

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.400
from inflammation to death.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.490
But condoms and diaphragms
were both very expensive

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.460
and very hard to come by.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.150
So these examples should give
you a sense of the climate

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.010
in the first quarter of the 20th
century in the United States

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.610
when it came to conversations
about methods of

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.010
and access to birth control.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.310
It was limited.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.450
There were laws in place

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.250
that made the information
almost impossible to come by,

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.480
and the devices were
even harder to access.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.140
As a result, there was something
of a coded language for talking

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.170
about birth control, but
no real control over it,

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:50.290
which is how Lysol could
advertise itself by implication

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.870
as a contraceptive, even though
using it could result in death.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.550
So the images that we just
saw all came from the 1920s.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:04.400
The federal courts repeal
the Comstock laws in 1936.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.890
Birth control is no
longer considered obscene,

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.680
and it can be transferred
across state lines.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.080
But there's no broadly held
social sense that women

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.890
or men had the right
to contraception

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.190
or to what we might call,

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.750
and what they were
strategically starting to call,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.830
family planning services,
as the example

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.440
from New York City makes clear.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.930
And there's a gap, right, of
22 years between the repeal

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.050
of the Comstock laws
and the 1958 case.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:37.880
But not very much had
changed on the access

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.400
to contraception front.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.690
If access had not changed,
however, the religious reactions

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.800
to contraception really had.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.070
The religious community had
been more or less in support

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.800
of the Comstock Acts
when they had passed

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.380
in the late 19th century.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.430
But in the middle
of the 20th century,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.950
it's an entirely
different picture.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.980
Since the early decades of
the 20th century, main line

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.520
and liberal Protestant
dominations issued statements

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.100
on ideal Christian family life.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.090
And unfortunately, the rest

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.840
of my talk doesn't really
lend itself to photos.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.630
And so this is Kings
County Hospital,

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.680
the setting for everything.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.620
And it's not actually even
a particularly historically

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.590
accurate picture of Kings
Hospital and that I took it.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:34.240
And I wasn't alive then.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.540
So--

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.580
Sorry, I lost my place.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.640
Yes. So since the early decades
of the 20th century, main line

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.180
and liberal protestant
denominations issued statements

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.720
on ideal Christian family life.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.330
These statements held that for
the contemporary protestant

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:55.710
with the medical means to do
so, family planning was vital

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.420
because it allowed
for a more thoughtful

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.230
and deliberate creation
of Christian families.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:04.220
In 1931, the Committee
on Marriage and Home

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.200
of the United States
Federal Council

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.930
of Churches declared the
careful and restrained use

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:14.700
of contraceptives by married
couple was valid and moral

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:20.190
if used to safeguard the
health of mother and child.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.650
And protect the livelihood
and stability of the family.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.100
No direct action came
from this statement,

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.180
but it prompted much public
debate and represented a shift

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.330
from commonly held Protestant
condemnation of contraception.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.660
That same year,

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:39.260
the Congregational Christian
General Council announced its

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.320
support of voluntary
childbearing

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.670
to safeguard the wellbeing
of family and society.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:52.650
In 1954, the Augustana
Evangelical Lutheran Churches

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.090
in America adopted a statement
advocating for the spacing

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.780
of children so as to
ensure their proper care

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.320
and the health of the mother.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.410
While the Anglican Communion's
Lambeth Conference had condemned

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:12.650
birth control in 1908
and 1920, by 1958,

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.810
it stated that contraception
was a primary obligation

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.790
of Christian marriage,
that children may be born

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.090
within the supporting
framework of parental love

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.940
and family concern with
the right to an opportunity

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.270
for a full and spiritually
wholesome life.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.490
Taking into account factors
such as the cost of education

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.940
and the increased
social assumption

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.680
that you would send your
children to college,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.740
the Lambeth Conference
which, remember,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:48.120
had condemned birth control
twice within the past 50 years,

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.270
actually chastised
parents who carelessly

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.030
and improvidently bring
children into the world trusting

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.540
in an unknown future

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.040
or a generous society
to care for them.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.390
So these Protestant
denominations connected the

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.560
freedom to make one's own
decision about reproduction

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.040
with a responsibility to create
and maintain a healthy family.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.240
And they were very interested
in getting people the freedom

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:19.310
to decide how to create
their own families.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.670
These were by and
large policy statements

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.150
from the varying denominations.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.980
They weren't carefully
fleshed out theologies.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.420
They were intended
for the guidance

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.970
of their own clergy
rather than an attempt

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.880
that pan-Protestant
approach to birth control.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.030
However, they had clear
moral implications

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.640
and they provided a
framework as it became evident

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.070
in the New York City
clergy's response

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.980
to the birth control ban.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:48.160
More or less simultaneous
with the 1958 example,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.940
Protestants were beginning
to talk about something

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.900
that they called
responsible parenthood.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.210
Though the first major book

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.910
on responsible parenthood was
still two years away, 1960,

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:03.390
and the National Council
of Churches were three--

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.150
was three years away from
passing a statement in support

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:12.190
of responsible parenthood,
1961, and parenthetically,

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:16.270
it did that with 83 votes in
favor of responsible parenthood,

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:19.830
zero votes against,
and four abstentions.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.610
The idea of-- is already
in 1958 really circulating

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.110
in Protestants or cults.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.760
So what is responsible
parenthood?

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.750
Responsible parenthood is
an attempt to synthesize

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.210
and create an appropriate
relationship

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:39.480
between religion and science.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.470
The religiously mandated
responsibility to be stewards

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:46.470
of the good-- of the Earth-- to
be good stewards of the Earth,

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.110
the responsibilities that
Christian parents had

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.620
for their children,
and the autonomy

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.240
of the Protestant couple in
making their own decisions

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.190
about childrearing
were connected

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.550
to a theologically
unified approach

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:05.370
to the emerging medical
technologies of contraception.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.710
Responsible parenthood
served as a counterweight

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:13.100
to conservative Protestant
voices, and it was a challenge

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.650
to protestant conversations
with the Catholic Church.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.980
In responsible parenthood,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.710
contraception became both
marital and moral, right?

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.020
So nobody is talking about
contraception outside

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.330
of marriage, nobody in
this conversation anyway.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.530
But in that context, it is
seen as shoring up rather

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:36.130
than eroding traditional
Christian values.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.200
Now, the moral reasons
for limiting the size

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.870
of one's family, according to
this theology, were multifold

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.310
but there were three
primary reasons.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.790
First, concern for the planet.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.100
This is huge.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.720
In 1954, none other than
Harry Emerson Fosdick,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.310
one of the most prominent
Protestant ministers

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.130
of the first half of the 20th
century, much more liberal

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.770
than Billy Graham but sort
of similarly important

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.660
to Billy Graham, framed
overpopulation as one

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.930
of the world's basic problems
which could be relieved

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.690
by knowledge of and
access to contraception,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.930
a desire for healthy and
appropriate family life.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.940
In that same 1954 speech
which Fosdick delivered

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.470
at a planned parenthood awards
dinner, he said that the liberty

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:29.340
to use contraceptive control
to build thoughtfully planned,

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.110
wise planned homes was
essential to proper family life.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.290
And three, and I think
this is very interesting,

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.030
the sense that married
couples had vocational work

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.330
to do in the world.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.640
And while it was hoped
that parenthood was one

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.660
of their vocations, Christian
clergy should not assume

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.260
that it was the couple's
sole vocation.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.500
By limiting the number
of children in a family,

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.520
a couple would be better able
to fill all of their multi--

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.550
bleh, bleh, bleh-- all of them
many vocations and interact

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.300
with childrearing as
a vocational work,

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.880
giving it the care and
attention that did not--

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.610
they felt scale very well.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.860
You can do things with
one, two, three children

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.070
that you cannot do with 14.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:19.600
Perhaps most importantly, all
three of these points call

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.270
for individual moral
agency in making decisions.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.050
No agency, no government agency,
no hospital, no denomination,

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.220
and no minister, was to
impose reproductive decisions

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.520
on a couple.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.040
They were to make them together
after prayerful contemplation.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.910
Reproduction in the schema
became an extremely important

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.250
venue for Protestant
moral agency.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.280
All of these ideas and the
social attitudes behind them,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.920
about which we can talk
more during questions,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.240
informed the public campaign

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.900
that the New York
metropolitan areas, Protestant

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:59.440
and Jewish clergy were about
to wage against Morris Jacobs.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.730
And I realized I've been
talking about Protestants.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.690
I will be getting to the
Jews in just a moment.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:08.300
As I said at the beginning of
the talk, it was July 16th,

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.340
1958 when Jacob-- Dr. Jacobs
forbade Dr. Louis Hellman

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.370
to fit the young
diabetic wife and mother

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.030
with a contraceptive device.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.460
Less than a week later, the New
York Herald Tribune reported

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.360
that Arthur A. Allen, a man with
three first names, the chairman

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.750
of the Department of
Christian Social Relations

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.610
for the Protestant Council
of the City of New York,

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:35.550
had telegraphed Jacobs
requesting an immediate meeting.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.920
Jacobs declined to meet
with the Protestant council.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.870
But note the dates here.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:43.280
The patient was denied
her contraceptive fitting

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.580
on the 16th.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.880
The story broke in the New York
Times on the 17th, the next day.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.300
By the time the paper
was-- for 23rd was typeset,

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.220
the Protestant council
had already reached

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.190
out to Jacobs and been rebuffed.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.720
I don't know how many

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.840
of you have actively
engaged religious lives,

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.150
but most decisions, especially
most decisions made amongst

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.100
Protestants and Jews,
liberal Jews,

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.860
the group that we are talking
about, are made democratically.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.280
It takes time.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.880
The fact that they were able

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.290
to act this quickly is really
indicative of a broadly based--

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.100
broad-based consensus.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.220
They felt that they had a
mandate to speak with Jacobs.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.780
And they ultimately did meet
with him in early August.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.100
And they made their
disapproval of the ban known.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.020
So that's late July.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:36.290
On August 12th, The New
York Times ran a headline

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:40.040
that announced, Harlem
Pastors Criticized Jacobs.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.100
Commissioner's Stand on
Birth Control is also decried

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.160
by Rabbis.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.200
Specifically, the group ministry

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.450
of the East Harlem Protestant
Parish had issued a statement

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.660
that said, the lives
of many children

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.390
in our communities
are impoverished

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.290
or permanently scarred
because they are deprived

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.220
of the basic emotional and
material stability necessary

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.200
for their healthy development.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.920
Consequently, we believe
it is immoral in the face

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.170
of such facts to withhold
adequate instruction

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.370
in contraceptive techniques
from those individuals

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:16.010
in our communities who in
clear conscience desire

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.870
to control the size
of their families.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.310
They went on to point
out that most

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.480
of their community could not
afford private hospitals.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.560
They could only go
to city hospitals.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.500
Therefore, if the city hospitals
did not offer contraception,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:34.230
most residents of East
Harlem could not access it.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.650
The rabbis in the
headline were the Orthodox

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.320
Rabbinical Alliance.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.310
I know, I just said liberal
Jews, the Orthodox Jews were

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.560
in fact also part
of this process.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.140
The Orthodox Rabbinical
Alliance, meanwhile,

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.100
explained that Orthodox Judaism
permitted contraception only

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.400
on certain conditions.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.010
It had to be practiced by the
woman and not the man which is

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.970
to say that they did not
favor condoms as a mode

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:06.850
of contraception for reasons
rooted in the Book of Leviticus.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:10.000
They also only wanted
contraception practiced

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.300
for health reasons.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.230
So this was a health of the
mother issue or the health

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.190
of the children to whom
she was giving birth.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:21.940
This was not a family limitation
for reasons having to do

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.610
with how you imagined
your family.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:28.580
And it could only occur after
consultation with both medical

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.130
and religious authorities.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.760
Even with all of
those restrictions,

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.170
the Orthodox Rabbinical Alliance
objected to Jacob's policy

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.280
as they felt that it set
the hospital's policy

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.580
to the attendance

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.770
of one specific faith,
the Catholic faith.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.540
They didn't say that but
everyone else was saying

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.840
that it was the Catholic faith.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.840
Such an action, they wrote,

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.670
jeopardizes the hallowed
American tradition

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.660
that government mental
agencies must be divorced

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.690
from the influence of any
particular religious group

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.650
and that these agencies
must never seek to impose

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:06.420
on the people they serve
any kind of sectarian view.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.070
So in other words, even
though this is a group

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:12.970
with a fairly strict sense of
how you can use contraception,

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.970
they want the government
to stay out of it.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:22.180
They want the medical technology
available and they want women,

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.260
potentially married
couples, to make the decision

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.410
after a conversation with
a doctor and a rabbi.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.310
And if one is going to
give this a feminist read,

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.460
it is certainly true then that
a woman is making a decision

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.440
in a conversation with a
bare minimum of three men,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.640
her husband, her
doctor and her rabbi.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.740
But it is still arguing
that it is a decision

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.350
that should be made on
that individual ground.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:52.530
So, you know, important to have
both of those things in mind.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.520
Onward with our timeline.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.740
Three days later,
on August 15th,

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.400
the Interdenominational
Ministers Alliance in Brooklyn,

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:08.860
with some 150 members
who pastored some 175,000

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:12.560
of Brooklyn's Protestants,
announced in the same paper

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.050
that they were in
complete agreement

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:18.430
with the Protestant council and
sought a meeting with Jacobs.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:22.110
Among these 175,000
parishioners was

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.750
in fact Hellman's diabetic
Protestant patient.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.460
The alliance of-- issued
an official statement.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:34.300
Our ministers cannot understand
why Dr. Jacobs turned his back

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.660
on his own profession and
interfered with the proper

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.240
and accepted treatment of one

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.190
of our church members whose
very life is dependent

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.710
on such treatment.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:48.920
So essentially, the
Ministers Alliance just said,

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.690
why is the doctor trying to
kill one of our parishioners?

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.360
They went on to affirm
in a statement

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.100
that the Protestant
council had made

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.530
in their early August
meeting with Jacobs.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:04.540
The use of medically approved
contraceptive devices practiced

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.580
in Christian conscience
fulfills rather

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.750
than violates the will of God.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.280
Jacobs agreed to see the
Interdenominational Ministers

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.570
Alliance, after all he had just
seen the Protestant council,

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.590
but he also said that he would
not drop the birth control ban.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.030
So we're now in mid August.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.310
On August 23rd, Rabbi
Edward F. Klein

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.510
of the Stephen Wise Free
Synagogue called Dr. Jacobs's

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:35.170
ban an infringement on civil
rights, the civil rights

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.010
of the patient, the civil
rights of the Protestant

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.080
and Jewish communities.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.420
He elaborated.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.300
A physician is entitled by
the nature of his profession

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.410
to pursue his work in
accordance with the best legal

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.450
and medical procedures.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.160
Protestant and Jewish
patients are entitled

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.070
to receive the best medical
treatment even though some

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:03.290
procedures may be contrary to
the teachings of other faiths.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.040
That is to say Catholics
are of course free

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.310
to follow the dictates
of Catholic faith.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.700
Protestants and Jews are
not obligated to follow

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.640
and should not be functionally
obligated by a municipal system

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.990
to follow the dictates
of the Catholic faith.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:27.250
My possible favorite, on
September 1st, again according

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.040
to the New York Harold Tribune,

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.350
the Reverend George
Stewart [assumed spelling],

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:34.650
assistant director of the Saint
James Protestant Episcopal

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.970
Church at Madison
in 71st preached

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.620
that birth control is Christian.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.940
He did this on the-- from
the pulpit on Sunday morning,

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.520
on the Upper Eastside.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.920
In his sermon, Reverend
Stewart preached,

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.860
and this is a direct
quote, "The sex act is one

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.280
of the greatest treasures
of marriage, irrespective

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.430
of its purpose of pregnancy.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.810
Therefore parents who in
Christian conscience wish

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:08.170
to plan their family may use
contraceptive methods or devices

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.760
in their sex relation and
secure the other great spiritual

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.450
benefits without
involving contraception."

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.670
He went on, "The use of
contraceptive devices

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.390
for effective family
planning is consistent

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.530
with a realistic understanding
of the nature and purpose

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.920
of sex relations in marriage.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.840
Birth control is Christian."

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.690
There are lots of things
that are worth unpacking

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.760
in that comment, for instance,
the slippage between talking

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.340
about a couple, a married
couple and parents.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.860
A married couple are
assumed to be synonymous

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.230
with the word parents.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.840
The idea here is not
whether to have children,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.820
it's how many and when.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.990
That is part of the
operating assumption here.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.920
And also notice that the
assumption here is again

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.280
marital sexuality.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.880
But that said, this is an
extremely sex positive message.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.900
This is not a message that says,

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.860
we really wish you
could help yourselves,

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.090
but we did say it's better
to marry than to burn.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:15.160
And I suppose since we can
prevent women from dying

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.170
of having 15 children,
we might as well.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.710
Right? That's not
the message here.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.060
The message here
is sex is sacred.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.190
Sex in a marriage is
good and it is important

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.960
for things other
than having children.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.090
Now, we know you
will have children.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.650
We know you would never
consider not having children,

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.720
but we understand that you
might sometimes want to have sex

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.630
for good, moral,
spiritual reasons.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:44.670
Notice, he's also not
saying and it's really fun.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.430
He is saying there are all
of these religious reasons

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.700
and parenthood is one of them
but it's not the only one.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.570
Just immediately prior to
the September 17th meeting

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.650
of the Board of Hospitals, which
is where the decision was going

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.080
to be finally debated
and towards

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.800
which Morris Jacobs had
been kicking the can more

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.340
or less all summer, 11
Unitarian ministers wrote

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.980
to the hospital board asking
them to overrule Jacobs because,

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.000
as the Reverend James M.
Hutchinson of Flushing,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.890
Queens put it, "The denial
of contraception was unwise

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:23.670
and a denial of the rights
of full medical treatment."

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.570
According to the Unitarians,

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:29.930
Jacobs was making a moral
decision that rightly belonged

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.930
to the individual patient.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:34.150
And I'm just going to
parenthetically add

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:37.520
for any colleagues of
mine in the UU Scholars

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.960
and Friends group who are
listening to this, it's 1958,

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:45.120
that's why I said Unitarians
and Unitarian Universalists.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.070
Joining the general outcry

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:50.300
where the 17-member
medical advisory committee

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.980
of the planned parenthood
of Manhattan and the Bronx,

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.480
who wrote to Jacobs and
to the board of hospitals,

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.970
sighting the American Medical
Association's ethical guidelines

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.720
that physicians not base
medical care on the--

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.740
an exclusive dogma
or sectarian system,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.050
a comment that clearly
indicated their sense

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:11.030
that the Catholic Church,
a single religious entity,

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:14.060
was holding sway over the
New York City medical system.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:19.270
And similarly, the equally
secular New York Women's Club

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:22.040
of New York wrote
to Jacobs urging him

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.470
to make contraception available.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:28.660
In the voices of the clergy,
you hear any number of concerns

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.730
that religious actors,
and in this case,

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:35.480
largely religious leaders and
male religious leaders brought

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.040
to the debate about
contraception.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.000
First, among the traditions
that allow contraception,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.360
you hear a range of
opinions about when

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.240
and why it might be
used, ranging from health

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:52.140
of the mother to-- sort of at
will as long as children are

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.650
in the grand scheme things,
part of the pan and the picture.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.280
The pro-contraception side
does not necessarily agree

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.400
with itself about how
contraception is to be used,

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.390
which is part of why they
were all inclined to view this

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:07.610
as a religious freedom issue.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.270
They don't want to have to live

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:12.320
with each other's
determination either.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.100
They want this to be a decision
that a couple is making--

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.560
in conversation with them, the
clergy, and in conversation

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.860
with who they understand

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.650
to be the other pertinent
expert, the doctor.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.700
And they are self-understanding,
and many,

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.210
many doctors are agreeing
with them that the experts

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:32.990
in question, there should be
a clergyperson, clergyman,

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:35.410
and there should be a doctor.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:37.960
This is not a decision for a
couple to make on their own.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.930
This is considered to be
really very, very weighty,

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.130
and something for authorities.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:50.860
If a hospital provides
contraceptive services,

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.870
the clergy can then help them--
their parishioners decide how

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.210
to access it, their
congregants decide.

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:59.500
Clergy and wealthy
congregations,

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.180
like the Upper Westside
congregation, have the space

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.720
to talk about sex as enjoyable.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.130
Clergy in less affluent
conversations talk

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.260
about the harm that many
mouths can do to families,

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.990
the reality that children
cost money and the reality

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.290
that the more hours you work,

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:22.400
the less emotional time you
might have to give them.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.240
Clergy raised questions
of maternal health.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.940
In many of these conversations,
the family in changing ideals

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.140
of what makes a family
shape the comments.

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:36.740
There is an ability to
limit the size of the family

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.880
and it becomes a space
for moral agency.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:45.020
All of a sudden, this is venue
in which people can take action

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:49.020
and in which the clergy really
feel that people should.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.250
And while only the religious
minority, the Jewish voices,

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:55.690
emphasized the religious freedom
element in their comments

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:59.490
to the press, religious
freedom is underlying all

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:01.390
of the other comments.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.770
For a hospital to align its
policies with Catholic views is

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:09.430
to deny Protestants as much
as Jews the religious freedom

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:13.220
to participate in
this new and key venue

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.970
of Christian moral
agency, the moral choice,

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:19.010
the Christian choices about
how to navigate family life

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:23.770
and vocation, about how to
parent, about how to be spouses.

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.720
Contraception from the
Protestant standpoint had opened

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:30.520
up all of these venues as
places for moral agency.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.090
And Protestant moral
agency always at its base is

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.490
to rest with the individual.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:40.730
So let me finish the
story very briefly.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:45.800
On September 17th, 1958, after
a fairly unremitting campaign

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.880
by the clergy of the New
York metropolitan area,

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.680
the Protestant and
Jewish clergy,

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.920
the Board of Hospitals
reversed its position

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.380
and allowed the therapeutic
prescription of contraception.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.660
Jacobs made it clear that the
contraception would only be

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.040
offered for medical reasons,

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.700
not for sociological
or emotional reasons.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.800
The hospital policy
also specified

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:12.050
that any Roman Catholic and the
some Orthodox Jewish doctors,

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.710
nurses and other hospital staff
who objected would not be forced

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.750
to provide contraception.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.600
I always wonder whether
that extends to the person

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.320
in the billing department,
who doesn't want

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.950
to have to process the claim.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.600
I don't know.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.600
I really do legitimately
wonder how that got navigated.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.640
In part, in addition, before
hospital suggested contraception

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.050
to a woman, more than one
doctor would have to agree

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:40.970
that it was medically mandated.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.950
The woman would then be
given an opportunity to speak

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:45.680
with a clergyman of her choice.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.200
And again, I use the term
"clergyman" deliberately.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.990
In addition to the
formal protocol,

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:54.110
newspaper coverage said that
the hospital board had indicated

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:56.850
that a woman might not
be able to gain access

00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:59.910
to contraception unless she
had previously been pregnant

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:05.090
and her prior pregnancy
had endangered her life.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:07.580
And therefore, it
seemed a safe assumption

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.760
that subsequent pregnancies
would as well.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:14.680
They said that the previous
pregnancy rule would not be--

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.800
it wouldn't be uniformly
applied.

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.610
You could potentially go
in with a clearly medically

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.320
diagnosed condition.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.140
But really, it was going
to be extremely difficult

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:30.650
without that prior
life risking situation.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:36.350
So the compromise did not offer
the full range of contraception

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:38.330
for which the clergy called.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.160
The decision did
not give couples,

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.260
at least those using the city
hospitals, the kind of access

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:47.490
to contraception that
responsible parenthood required.

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.840
The New York City Municipal
Hospital system ended

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.620
up in this case far
more conservative

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.230
than the Protestant main line.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:58.690
And again, the Protestant
main line means not right wing

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.060
Christianity but it doesn't
necessarily mean left

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.360
wing Christianity.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.770
It can be the middle
of the road.

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:05.950
Than the middle of the
road Protestant position

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:10.890
and almost all of New York
City's forms of Judaism.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:13.710
And I'm cognizant of time
and so I will stop here,

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.760
but I hope we can have
a robust conversation

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.510
with what we have left.

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:28.990
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:30.790
Debbie.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:45.250
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:48.640
There isn't.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.780
It's a really interesting
question and one that I would

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.150
like to look into more
looking into records

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.910
at the New York Public Library

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:02.470
and planned parenthoods
records which are at Smith.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:07.900
My guess based on the newspaper
accounts is that probably not

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.830
because in all of
these conversations,

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:17.730
he basically denies that
things are going to change.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.670
He doesn't say, you know, this
is a conversation that we need

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.410
to have when the board
meets in September.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:26.270
He says no, I'm not going to
change the policy, and in fact,

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:31.480
I'm not going to talk to you,
every single minister in town.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.930
But it's an interesting
question.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:37.400
There also isn't proof
that he didn't, right?

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.930
Cameron?

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:56.460
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.840
So the question was twofold.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.410
Was there a Catholic response
and did these conversations

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:08.630
about contraception tie into
conversations about abortion?

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:12.170
So, yes, there was
a Catholic response.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:16.720
The Catholic Church said in
varying ways, at varying moments

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.550
over the two months, look,

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.280
we are not controlling
the hospital system

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.640
like we are the puppet master.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.350
They didn't use the word "puppet
master" but they were in--

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:28.070
they kept saying like we do
not have the kind of control

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:30.350
that people are suggesting
that we have.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:34.610
They also said that if the
City of New York chooses

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:38.810
to do something that we consider
immoral, we are absolutely going

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.730
to publicly say that the City
of New York has done something

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.410
that we consider to be immoral.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:48.910
So what they are saying is this
is not applying our sectarian

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.190
rules to everyone else,
we are not in charge.

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:54.630
We do, however, have the
right to free speech,

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.980
exactly like the rest of
you do, and we will use it.

00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:00.390
So that was essentially
the position.

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:04.540
They were also very
concerned that no change

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.750
in hospital policy result
in Catholics being forced

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:13.500
to operate against their own
conscience and made certain--

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.980
or participated in conversations
and said you must make certain

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.300
that if you change policy,
that does not happen.

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:25.830
In terms of abortion, you know,
I think almost deliberately, no.

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:31.440
It is also true that Kings
County Hospital was supposed

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.770
to report any woman who
came in for treatment

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:41.930
of what was non-hospital
performed abortion.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:46.830
And they got dramatically
more-- tens--

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.290
hundreds more than
they reported.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.590
And so, you get the sense

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:54.210
that the hospital knows exactly
what is going on, is concerned

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.040
about what is going on.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.770
And that is part of what's
informing all of the doctors,

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.880
because illegal abortion
is really dangerous,

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.160
and the doctors were the
people cleaning it up,

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.050
but nothing overt
in the conversation.

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:13.730
I'm sorry, I-- we have
had so many conversations,

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:15.160
and I know that your
name is unusual,

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:20.520
but I cannot remember
what it is, yes.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.950
[Inaudible] Thank you,
Jarretta [assumed spelling].

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:23.750
I'm sorry.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:57:18.780
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.650
So the questions were two-fold.

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:26.140
First, how much is the strength
of the Protestant response

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.780
to the birth control issue, not
actually about birth control

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.050
but about anti-Catholicism.

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:36.030
And the second question
was, this is just

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:37.900
about municipal hospitals,
correct,

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.620
and so there's a class
issue at work here too.

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.040
So, first of all, absolutely.

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.130
I have been known
to say jokingly,

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.600
and since this is being
recorded for the internet,

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.100
I hasten to say I'm
saying this jokingly,

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.890
you can get in the middle of
the 20th century Protestants

00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:55.330
to oppose almost
anything if you tell them

00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:59.470
that Catholics are for it.

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.770
And vice versa, right?

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:02.630
You can get them to support
almost anything if you tell them

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:04.350
that Catholics are against it.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:07.370
And I'm being flip.

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:10.850
But I do think that
there is a lot of concern

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:12.520
about Catholic control.

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.560
There's a lot of question
about who is going

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.840
to be the dominant
Christian voice

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.210
in the American public
conversation,

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:22.680
who's going to call the
shots in that conversation.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.390
This is a moment
of immense power

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:27.460
for the Protestant main line.

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:31.130
But it is, in a lot of ways,
the last moment of immense power

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.450
for the Protestant main line.

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:34.770
I don't know to what
extent people know that.

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.070
That's-- This is, I mean,
early days of this project,

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:41.910
but that's one of the questions
that is in the back of my head.

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:45.310
And so, yes, absolutely.

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:49.700
And I think that that is-- But I
also think they're very serious

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.630
about the moral responsibility

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:57.850
and the individual moral
responsibility to think

00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:59.150
about family planning.

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:00.450
One of the things

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:03.280
that Protestants say a lot
during this time period is,

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.290
look, Catholics says that
birth control is unnatural,

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:08.190
but the population is exploding.

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:12.240
The reason that population
is exploding is largely

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.040
because we have much
better medicine.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.200
And so, we have less
infant mortality,

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.430
we have antibiotics,
we have vaccines.

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:21.300
And so, you end up with
all of your children living

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.680
to adulthood and it's
causing a problem.

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:29.620
If vaccines and antibiotics are
not unnatural or acceptable,

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.520
then birth control
should be as well.

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.210
And so that is explicitly
an anti-Catholic theology

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:36.510
in some ways.

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:37.810
Like, that's who they're arguing
with when they're arguing

00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:39.520
about what is natural.

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.630
But it's also a positive claim.

00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:45.050
And absolutely, also,
it is a class issue.

00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:49.540
If you are a member of the
Episcopal Church at 71st

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:54.500
in Madison, you are really
close to the mansions

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.360
of Central Par, right?

00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:02.040
And you can get whatever is
legally available to you.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.590
And in fact, at this point,

01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:06.010
contraception is
illegal in Connecticut.

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:09.910
And one of the standard
approaches is to get

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.930
on the train into New York.

01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:16.040
And I think part of how you
can tell that there is this--

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.340
One of the ways that
you can tell

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.170
that there is this anti-Catholic
edge to it, is that,

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:23.100
clergy whose congregations do
not need to worry about this,

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:27.120
are very happy to be
part of the conversation.

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:30.130
Nancy.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:01:14.170
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:19.720
So I have not seen the sort
of social history numbers.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.880
The numbers that I have
seen come from organizations

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.230
like planned parenthood.

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:24.530
Oh, so the question was,

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.780
essentially about the
demographics of this.

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.760
What kind of access
is available?

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.810
And I'm very much, in
my own orientation,

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:35.110
a cultural historian.

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:38.020
And so, part of what I enjoy
about our friendship is

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.540
that you ask me questions
like and keep me honest.

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.680
But a lot of the numbers that
I've seen are coming from,

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.840
for instance, planned
parenthood.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:56.490
And I-- And my sense is that
they are there for sure.

01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:59.340
But they're also restricted
in what they can do by some

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.520
of these same hospital policies.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.040
Over the course of 1958,
leading up to this case,

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.370
there had been a series of
exposés in the New York Post

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:13.000
that talk explicitly about
the fact that if you are,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.510
for instance, a settlement house
and you're getting free rent

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:17.420
from the city, you are forbidden

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.670
from having a family
planning conversation

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.870
with a representative
planned parenthood

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:24.230
in the settlement house, or the
city will, at the very least,

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:26.490
start charging you rent
and possibly evict you.

01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:29.250
And they might charge
you back rent, right?

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.620
And again, none of it
is a written policy.

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.950
These are things that the
reporter whose name I believe

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:38.270
was Joe Con [assumed spelling]
goes and finds out as he moves

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:41.060
around settlement houses and
a number of other places.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.650
So all of those, yes, there
is planned parenthood.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:49.180
Alan Guttmacher is in-- is
at Mount Sinai at this point.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.820
And so, he-- and he
is a very active voice

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.910
in this conversation.

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:56.000
But then you end
up-- there are issues

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.990
of distance and transportation.

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:01.740
The private hospitals are
in wealthier parts of town,

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.060
you know, getting there, getting
back all of those questions.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.120
And I think there is a large
swath of people who are,

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.790
you know, as they're so
often are, there are people

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:14.540
who are too wealthy to get
the real aid being offered,

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.870
but don't have the money

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:18.510
or don't have the good
private insurance.
