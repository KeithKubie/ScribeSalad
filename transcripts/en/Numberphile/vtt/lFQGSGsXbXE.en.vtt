00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
ZVEZDELINA STANKOVA: So here is the game.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.960
BRADY HARAN: Has it got a name?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.880
ZVEZDELINA: "Pebbling a Chessboard", perhaps?
Or…

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.480
"Freeing the Clones﻿".

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.660
BRADY HARAN: The clones?

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.440
ZVEZDELINA: The clones.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.840
BRADY HARAN: The clones. "Freeing the Clones".

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.460
ZVEZDELINA: Okay, so we have pebbles,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.140
which we will call clones,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.700
because they will be able to move according to the following rule:

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.940
Every clone clones itself one to the right,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.940
and one up,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.540
and disappears.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
Now this move can be carried anywhere on the board,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.200
as long as the position[s] to the right and up are free.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.120
And so, again, we can replace our guy

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.880
by two clones, and remove him.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.180
For instance:

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.880
In this situation, this guy cannot clone,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.140
because the cell to its right is not free.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.640
So in other words, we cannot put two or more clones in one cell.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.660
Okay, now the board, as you can see, is a chessboard, what we are showing here.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.380
But the actual game is played on an infinite board,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.340
which is infinite to the right and up.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.900
We have these unfortunate clones inside a prison.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.740
So, there is a prison which consists of three cells,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.700
as you can see on this picture.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.620
The [?] barbed fence is enclosing these three cells.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.080
And our clones want to escape the prison.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.240
Can you construct a sequence of moves —

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.940
— and you're the boss, you decide what order, which clones to clone —

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.780
— so that the three clones will escape the prison,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.440
and the prison will be… with no clones.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.320
There will be no prisoners.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440
Okay, so let's play the game.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.520
For instance, we can do this.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.560
Perhaps that.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.740
Now we can free another clone from the prison.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.180
And then we can try the last clone,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.560
but unfortunately, there is a lot of crowding appearing.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.600
Well, the game itself is very easy.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.020
It's very tantalizing.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.380
Really, my intuitive feeling in the beginning was,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.400
"Sure, I can free the clones. What's stopping me?"

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.220
But after lots and lots of trials,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.560
one might start thinking the other way around —

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.340
— perhaps it is impossible.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280
Well, before you move on with the video,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.560
you should probably stop it,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560
and play for five, ten minutes,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.420
and see what the outcome is.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.720
Now, there are two outcomes:

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.600
If you think it is possible,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.120
one particular way of freeing the clones,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.220
one particular game, is enough.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.100
It's sufficient.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.000
I don't want to see every possible way of freeing the clones.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.560
However…

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.560
If you think it is impossible,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.500
Well, that's a question that mathematicians deal with on a daily basis.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.680
There are infinitely many games that you can try.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.460
Can you feed this into a computer?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.000
Well, computers don't really like infinite games.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.480
The calculation has to stop at some point.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.480
So computers perhaps are not an option.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.460
We need a human mind to resolve this puzzle.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.000
It has been solved by a human mind,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.080
and when Maxim Kontsevich proposed the problem,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.720
he had a particular solution in mind,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.600
which to this day is, I believe, the most elegant one.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.420
It is NOT possible, actually, to free the prison,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.520
but it is possible to prove that it is impossible.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.380
We will assign, to every cell of our board, a number.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.460
We'll just basically write the number there.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.680
So a move is made like that, everywhere.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.200
So what we need is to assign numbers

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.240
in these three cells.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.420
So we have an old cell, and two new cells.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.680
So, in principle you can use three numbers for this,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.560
but because the game is symmetric along the diagonal,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.880
you might try only two numbers

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.760
to make the solution easier, and more elegant.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.420
So something like this.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.200
The old number is "a", the two new numbers are "b".

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.360
Alright, so what we want is the old number "a"

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.020
to be equal to the sum of the two new numbers "b".

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.060
So a must be equal to 2b,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.940
making the old sum equal to the new sum.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.120
So, what number can we put in the bottom left cell?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120
In the first cell?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.180
Let's think of the very first number

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.020
that you learned in school.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.140
BRADY HARAN: One.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.080
ZVEZDELINA: One. Okay, let's see.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.920
Is that gonna work?

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.320
Let's try 1.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.880
But that forces us

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.160
to put in the two adjacent cells up and to the right,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.580
one half.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.960
And each of those one halves forces a quarter.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.820
So, suppose this chip has a certain weight,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.860
which it does.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.760
The way you can think of it is:

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.340
Cut it in half, and then put it on the two new squares.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.500
Now if I take this guy, whose weight is one half,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.740
I can replace it by two chips whose weights are one quarter.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.400
So again, the total weight stays the same.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.680
In fact, in the very beginning, what is our initial weight?

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.300
So we have… One, plus a half, plus a half.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.960
This is what you have in the prison, which is 2.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.320
Alright, so let's make a move.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.620
Let's replace this bottom guy by two new clones.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.900
So now what do we have?

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.680
We have one, plus a half, plus a fourth, plus a fourth.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.380
But hey! That also equals 2!

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.180
So indeed, we've got an invariant.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.640
And [?] saying, suppose you can free the prison.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.860
So there is no one in the prison.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.600
And we have added, perhaps, along the way,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.660
lots of clones.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.740
Now where are the clones?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.200
The clones are outside of the prison,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.420
which we can call…

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.480
Greenland!

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.500
So they are out, in the free land, in Greenland.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.680
So their weights have to add up to 2!

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.300
Because this is invariant.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.080
But the question is,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.580
do we have enough weight in Greenland,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.680
or enough gasoline in Greenland,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.100
to add up to 2?

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.540
Mathematicians may find that question

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.240
a bit too hard to answer at first,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.840
because this Greenland is irregular,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.180
it has this area that we have to subtract —

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.560
— the prison area.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.980
So mathematicians like to simplify the problem.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.000
Why not, instead of Greenland,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.300
let us first try to find the sum of the whole table.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.660
Forget about the prison.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.900
But that's still a very hard question,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.600
because you have two dimensions to move.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.360
One to the right, and one up.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.320
Okay, so mathematicians think-think-think, and say,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.860
"Let's do a simpler problem!"

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.080
A related, but simpler problem.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.980
How about we test our skills

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.260
on finding just the sum of the first row?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.380
For if we are not able to do this,

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.960
probably we won't be able to add up the whole table!

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.880
We start adding up the numbers in the first row,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.500
and this is a very interesting,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.200
perhaps familiar (to some people) sum.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.680
One, plus a half, plus a fourth, plus one eighth,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.020
and so on and so forth.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.540
If you have taken a calculus course,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.500
you will immediately recognize that this is something called a geometric series,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.240
with first term 1, and ratio one half.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.020
Which simply means, to get the next term,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.200
you have to multiply the previous one by a half.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.140
And this keeps on going forever.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.100
When I have shown this problem to…

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:58.040
…kids in middle school, the reaction has always been,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.040
"This adds up to something slightly less than 2."

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.100
So you are a little bit short of 2;

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.520
because they experimented,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.500
they added up a lot of those numbers,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.180
and said "It's slightly less than 2."

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.800
BRADY HARAN: It's never gonna quite get there.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.300
ZVEZDELINA: Never quite gonna get there.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.220
I say, "Alright. So let's see what this number is!"

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.260
So if this sum of the first row is sum "S",

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.400
"S" is equal to one, plus a half, plus a fourth,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.260
plus one eighth, and so on and so forth.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.860
What we can do, is multiply everything by two.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.120
So on the left, I get two [times] our sum,

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.480
and on the right, every term will be multiplied by two.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.800
So you will get two, plus one, plus a half,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.460
plus a fourth, plus one eighth, and so on.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.820
But now we recognize

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.900
that we know a big chunk of the right-hand side.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.060
From 1 on, this is our sum "S".

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.320
So what we have obtained

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.600
is what mathematicians love working with:

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.040
An equation.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.400
2S on the left, 2 plus "S" on the right.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.740
Can we solve it? Certainly.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.360
We will subtract S from both sides,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.300
and we will end up on the left with S,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.860
and on the right with 2.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.780
Oops. Did we reach 2? Indeed we did.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.660
So if this row adds up to anything, there is no choice;

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.080
it has got to be 2.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.340
[So] more generally,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.380
a geometric series is a sum of the form:

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.820
a, plus ar, plus ar squared, ar cubed, and so on.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.900
Where we have a first term "a", and the ratio "r".

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.720
In other words, every next term

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.320
is gotten by the previous when you multiply by "r",

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.200
just like in our first row.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.340
And so there is a nifty formula in mathematics.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.120
If this ratio is "small" —

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.220
— how small? Between negative 1 and 1 —

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.180
— this sum, this geometric series,

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.840
actually adds up to something very simple:

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.180
The first term, divided by 1 minus the ratio.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.360
And this formula works for any ratio,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.880
as long as it is between negative 1 and 1.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.940
And so we can double-check our previous result here.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.900
for the first row.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.400
In our situation, the first term was 1,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.660
and the ratio was one half.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.900
And what do we get,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.720
according to the formula?

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.380
1 over 1 minus a half;

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600
1 over one half,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.920
which is our 2.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.420
Alright, so we are going to add up.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.360
The first row, as we saw, adds up to 2.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.460
Now how about the second row?

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.060
The second row is almost like the first one,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.720
except every term is half as large;

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.720
it's half of the previous one.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.080
So in other words, the sum should be half of our 2,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.500
which is 1.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.760
And now we see a repetition of this idea

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.900
on the other rows:

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.360
The third row should add up to one half;

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.920
to one fourth; and so on and so forth.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.160
Because now we can add up the whole table,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.220
and we again end up with another geometric series,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.720
except that this time, the first term is 2;

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.120
the ratio is still a half.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.400
Using similar arguments as before,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.440
we've gotten the total sum, is 4.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.140
Alright, so back to Greenland.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.640
We really wanted to check on Greenland.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.720
It is the total sum, 4, minus the prison sum which is 2;

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.640
we end up with 2.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.240
So, it looks like

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.260
we do have enough gasoline in Greenland.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.760
It looks like there is no contradiction,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.900
because we can fill in all of Greenland with clones,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.960
and get our new sum to 2.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.040
Which would mean that we can free the prison.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.440
Can we really fill ALL of Greenland with clones?

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.080
Because, think about it:

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.880
If you miss even one of those clones,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.100
your total sum in Greenland is going to be less than 2.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.500
But 2 is our invariant.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.500
We need to have 2.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.380
So we need to fill in every single cell in Greenland

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.460
with a clone.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.240
Remember? We said we will free the clones.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.520
That's how we started.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.240
Alright. So at some moment, you say,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.780
"That's it! I freed the clones!" The game ends.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.860
But how many moves did you make up to that point?

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.880
Infinitely, or finitely many?

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.740
Basically, when you say the game ends,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.400
this is a finite game.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.900
So every time you make a move,

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.480
the number of clones increases by one.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.360
If you make 10 billion moves,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.080
the number of clones will still be finite.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.420
So can you really fill all of Greenland

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.280
with infinitely many clones

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.820
after stopping the game at some point?

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.860
No.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.360
Because infinity is not equal to a finite number.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.320
So that is a finite game,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.300
and therefore it's impossible to free the clones.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.440
So, when mathematicians solve a problem,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.160
they don't really stop.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.440
They try to generalize it.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.960
They try to create new games, new problems,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.140
and see if they're solvable or not.
