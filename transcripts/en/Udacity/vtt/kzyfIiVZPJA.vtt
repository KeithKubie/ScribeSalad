00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.410
Okay, let's take a step back for a second and talk about the major pieces of

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.290
the Web, or, or, or the major concepts

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.700
we're going to be discussing in this lesson. The major

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.530
pieces are you, your computer running a Web

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.190
browser, the Internet, and servers. Your browser makes requests

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.270
via the Internet to servers. These requests are

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.520
using a protocol called http and the servers respond

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.310
with files that your browser displays. Some examples of browsers are

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.900
Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox. You're probably running one of

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.560
those right now. These servers are computers just like yours

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.770
except they are optimized for sitting in

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.790
a closet and hosting files rather than sitting

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.551
on your desk, you know, browsing these files. And the protocol http that we are

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.936
speaking is, is just a very simple protocol that your

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:57.291
browser uses to communicate with these servers. We'll discuss each of

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.610
these pieces. Well, we won't spend a whole lot of

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.700
time on the Internet, but we'll discuss each of these pieces

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.950
in turn throughout this lesson. Okay. Time for another quiz.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.870
What I'd like you to do is, take the letters that

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.770
are near each piece of technology we just discussed and match

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.840
them up with their name and definition. Your options are HTTP,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.930
the main protocol of the Web. Servers, computers that host the files that make

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.140
up the Web. The Internet, the worlds

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.770
largest computer network. And your browser, a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.060
program that runs on your computer to display files found on the Web. Take

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.330
the letters next to each piece of technology and put them in the correct box.
