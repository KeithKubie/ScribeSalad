00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.100
MIKE: This guy saved everything.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.830
Plus he had a lot
of stuff mixed in.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.230
He had this stuff in trailers.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.330
You could tell this stuff hasn't
been touched for a long time.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.270
If you walk into a place,
and there's a lot of stuff

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.470
on display, that's easy.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.670
I don't want to
take the easy route.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.200
I want to find this stuff.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.930
I want to discover it.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.270
I love this hippo.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.930
This hippopotamus is a spring
loaded playground ride.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.700
You got the camel.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.030
You got the monkey.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.130
You get the walrus.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.900
Saddle Mates made in
Litchfield, Michigan.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.330
I always wanted the motorcycle.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.170
If some other kid
was on the motorcycle

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.800
and I didn't get it
within two minutes,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.070
there were tears coming
down this little kid's face.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.670
Jack, talk to me.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.030
They bring pretty
good dollars.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.300
What's pretty good dollars?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.570
300 range.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.630
Think you're right.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.230
The hippo we picked
up from a playground

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.370
that we took out somewhere.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.500
MIKE: We picked a lot
of guys that do demo.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.930
And if you have a
good eye, you can

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600
find some really great stuff.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.100
JACK: We've been in
business a long time

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.970
and I take my work personally.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.230
I walk through the collection.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.470
I can say, that job
I got that from.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.700
That job I got that from.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.470
It's a personal thing to me.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.870
MIKE: So if three bills is
retail, where you got to be?

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.670
I'm around two I guess.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.700
$150.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.300
Meet me in the middle.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.430
What's the middle?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.530
Want me to calculate
that out for you, Mike?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.100
That's $175.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.730
Oh.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.170
$160.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.100
All right.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
We doing this?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.070
We doing it.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.270
MIKE: We doing it.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.400
This is cast aluminum
with a steel coil spring.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.270
I'm falling in love
with this thing.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.370
Cool.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.970
Jack, where did this come from?

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.770
It was an old double
decker bus that my dad and I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.470
bought up in Massachusetts.
MIKE: Oh, yeah.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.600
Look at it.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.730
Liverpool, Piccadilly--

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.500
JACK: Chelsea.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.570
MIKE: Highbury.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.230
Good old English names.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.630
MIKE: Cabbage junction.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.230
If the route of the bus changed,
then the Marquis had to change.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.930
All right.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.370
So this is on a scroll.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.500
It's rolling.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.130
And if you're standing
at the bus stop

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.230
and you want to go
to Nottingham, well,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.400
if it says Nottingham,
that's where you go.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.100
So how long ago did you guys get
rid of the double decker bus?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.400
Oh, it's been a
good 10, 15 years ago.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.230
MIKE: People are making coffee
houses out of those now.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.800
JACK: Yeah.
MIKE: Oh, man.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.200
Did it run?
- Yeah.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.670
I wish I had it back.
- I know.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.930
Cast iron phone booths.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.770
Big Ben.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.230
The double decker bus.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.530
This thing takes you
back to that time period.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.970
They still use these
today, but they're digital.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.870
This is back when it was
paper on cheesecloth.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.470
It's not in really good shape.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.530
Whoops.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.570
It's in worse shape
since I handled it.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.030
Well, he's got to buy it now.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.770
MIKE: What are you
thinking on this?

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.530
This piece and the other one.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.500
I don't know.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500
Want me to make
you an offer on it?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.570
JACK: Make me an offer.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.700
50 bucks.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700
I would have said 10,
but you can pay me 50.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.100
MIKE: I threw out
50 bucks and he

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.100
was nice enough to take my money
because basically, I ruined it.
