00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.160
Hello.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.230
Let's do some work on
logarithm properties.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.700
So, let's just review real
quick what a logarithm even is.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:19.230
So if I write, let's say I
write log base x of a is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.020
equal to, I don't know,
make up a letter, n.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.550
What does this mean?

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:35.800
Well, this just means that
x to the n equals a.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.880
I think we already know that.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.150
We've learned that in
the logarithm video.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.860
And so it is very important to
realize that when you evaluate

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.170
a logarithm expression, like
log base x of a, the answer

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.350
when you evaluate, what
you get, is an exponent.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.231
This n is really
just an exponent.

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:56.820
This is equal to this thing.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910
You could've written
it just like this.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.190
You could have, because this n
is equal to this, you could

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.140
just write x, it's going to get
a little messy, to the log

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.930
base x of a, is equal to a.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.000
All I did is I, took this n and
I replaced it with this term.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.530
And I wanted to write it this
way because I want you to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.580
really get an intuitive
understanding of the notion

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.390
that a logarithm, when
you evaluate it, it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.745
really an exponent.

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:27.420
And we're going to
take that notion.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.910
And that's where, really,
all of the logarithm

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.380
properties come from.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.130
So let me just do -- what I
actually want to do is, I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.760
want to to stumble upon the
logarithm properties

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.540
by playing around.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.405
And then, later on, I'll
summarize it and then

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:41.120
clean it all up.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.100
But I want to show maybe
how people originally

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.040
discovered this stuff.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.960
So, let's say that x,
let me switch colors.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.600
I think that that keeps
things interesting.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:05.190
So let's say that x to
the l is equal to a.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.680
Well, if we write that as
a logarithm, that same

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.900
relationship as a logarithm, we
could write that log base x of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.410
a is equal to l, right?

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.530
I just rewrote what I
wrote on the top line.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.010
Now, let me switch colors.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.100
And if I were to say that x to
the m is equal to b, it's the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.620
same thing, I just
switched letters.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.980
But that just means that
log base x of b is

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.730
equal to m, right?

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.280
I just did the same thing
that I did in this line,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.452
I just switched letters.

00:02:47.452 --> 00:02:49.620
So let's just keep going
and see what happens.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.770
So let's say, let me
get another color.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.010
So let's say I have x to the n,
and you're saying, Sal, where

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.710
are you going with this.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.710
But you'll see.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:12.360
It's pretty neat. x to the
n is equal to a times b.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.260
x to the n is equal
to a times b.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.730
And that's just like
saying that log base x

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.420
is equal to a times b.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.460
So what can we do
with all of this?

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.010
Well, let's start with
with this right here.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.420
x to the n is equal
to a times b.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.670
So, how could we rewrite this?

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.910
Well, a is this.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.670
And b is this, right?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.010
So let's rewrite that.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.770
So we know that x to
the n is equal to a.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.480
a is this.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.120
x to the l.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.370
x to the l.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.500
And what's b?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.190
Times b.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.740
Well, b is x to the m, right?

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.380
Not doing anything
fancy right now.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.320
But what's x to the
l times x to the m?

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.730
Well, we know from the
exponents, when you multiply

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.390
two expressions that have the
same base and different

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.025
exponents, you just
add the exponents.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.830
So this is equal to, let
me take a neutral color.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.660
I don't know if I said that
verbally correct, but

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.300
you get the point.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.560
When you have the same base and
you're multiplying, you can

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.930
just add the exponents.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.390
That equals x to the, I want to
keep switching colors, because

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.870
I think that's useful.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.590
l, l plus m.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.520
That's kind of onerous to
keep switching colors, but.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.820
You get what I'm saying.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.590
So, x to the n is equal
to x to the l plus m.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.790
Let me put the x here.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.350
Oh, I wanted that to be green.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.530
x to the l plus n.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.050
So what do we know?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.980
We know x to the n is equal
to x to the l plus m.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.220
Right?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.510
Well, we have the same base.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.370
These exponents must
equal each other.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:18.863
So we know that n is
equal to l l plus m.

00:05:18.863 --> 00:05:21.270
What does that do for us?

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.590
I've kind of just been playing
around with logarithms.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.840
Am I getting anywhere?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.590
I think you'll see that I am.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.140
Well, what's another
way of writing n?

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.510
So we said, x to the n is
equal to a times b -- oh, I

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.350
actually skipped a step here.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.080
So that means -- so, going
back here, x to the n

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.710
is equal to a times b.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.640
That means that log base x
of a times b is equal to n.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.170
You knew that.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.890
I didn't.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.880
I hope you don't realize I'm
not backtracking or anything.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.360
I just forgot to write that
down when I first did it.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.250
But, anyway.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.070
So, what's n?

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.520
What's another way
of writing n?

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.400
Well, another way of
writing n is right here.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.640
Log base x of a times b.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.840
So, now we know that if we just
substitute n for that, we

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.690
get log base x of a times b.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.080
And what does that equal?

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.500
Well, that equals l.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.230
Another way to write
l is right up here.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:25.570
It equals log base
x of a, plus m.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.710
And what's m?

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.792
m is right here.

00:06:30.792 --> 00:06:35.970
So log base x of b.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.990
And there we have our
first logarithm property.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.620
The log base x of a times b --
well that just equals the log

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.130
base x of a plus the
log base x of b.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.880
And this, hopefully,
proves that to you.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.460
And if you want the intuition
of why this works out it falls

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.400
from the fact that logarithms
are nothing but exponents.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.250
So, with that, I'll leave
you with this video.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.470
And in the next video,
I will prove another

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.900
logarithm property.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.670
I'll see you soon.
