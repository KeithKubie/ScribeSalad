10 Deleted Scenes That Should Have Made the
Final Cut

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.380
Making a film is hard work, and one of the
toughest tasks a director has is editing.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.190
Taking all the footage he or she shot, the
filmmaker must piece together a coherent film

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.140
that entertains and thrills audiences.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.840
And sometimes, that means sacrificing a great
scene that may have made the final product

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.810
even more rewarding if the running time didn’t
dictate otherwise.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.470
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Deleted Scenes
That Should Have Made the Final Cut

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.470
Star Wars

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
Luke Skywalker spends the first act of Star
Wars wishing to reunite with his good friend

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.020
Biggs, and ultimately the two pals join forces
as Rebel allies in the Battle of Yavin.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
Unfortunately, Biggs is killed in the fight,
but audiences originally didn’t feel the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.530
full impact of the loss.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.460
George Lucas had deleted a scene – which
is now available in the special editions – that

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.469
showed Luke and Biggs reconnecting before
the Death Star trench run, which established

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.740
their relationship and made Luke’s sadness
a bit more sympathetic.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.299
Short enough to not disrupt the film’s pacing,
it should have been in the initial 1977 cut.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.540
Terminator 2

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.180
One of the reasons why T2 is so beloved is
the relationship between the T-800 and John

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.180
Connor.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.530
Their bond is what gives the action-packed
sequel some heart and elevates it to the next

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.530
level.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.140
But some have wondered why a programmed 'killing
machine' can learn the basics of human emotion.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.250
In a deleted scene - available in the special
edition -, it's revealed that the Terminator

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.850
has a CPU setting that shuts off its 'read
only' function and allows Arnold to understand

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.909
why humans act the way they do.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.799
It not only explains this crucial detail,
but also sets up Sarah Connor's character

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.950
arc in a nice moment of dramatic tension.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.490
Jaws

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.869
One of the highlights of Steven Spielberg’s
Jaws is Robert Shaw’s performance as the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.970
shark hunter Quint.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.000
Enigmatic and eccentric, he’s certainly
a colourful character that made the blockbuster

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.060
all the more memorable.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.829
He’s also shown to have a short fuse, a
trait that was foreshadowed in an amusing

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.829
deleted scene.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.479
Going to a local music store to purchase piano
wire for his shark killing duties, Quint has

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.220
a little bit of fun with a boy playing “Ode
to Joy” on a clarinet.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.859
It may not have advanced the plot, but it
was still a quirky character moment that showed

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:21.590
Quint wasn’t the easiest fellow to get along
with.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.659
Return of the Jedi

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.099
Luke is shocked beyond belief to learn Darth
Vader is his father, and he wonders why his

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.290
mentor Obi-Wan never told him the truth.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.470
Turns out, there was a method to his madness.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.139
In a deleted scene from Return of the Jedi
where Yoda is on his death bed, we learn he

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.319
instructed Obi-Wan to keep Vader’s identity
a secret from Luke, as the Jedi Master feared

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.400
Luke would not be able to defeat the Sith
if he was conflicted by feelings for his father.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.980
Yoda’s belief turned out to be true in a
sense, but it’s still a level of manipulation

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.519
that seems below a Jedi.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.069
Either way, it still would have been an interesting
twist for the story.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.069
Aliens

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.249
In the beginning of Aliens, Ellen Ripley is
woken from stasis after a period of 57 years,

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.410
meaning her life on Earth has drastically
changed.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.830
Oddly enough, we don’t see many hints of
her past in the 1986 theatrical edition, but

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.099
James Cameron’s director’s cut added a
new layer to the beloved character.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.569
In a heartbreaking moment, Ripley is informed
by Burke that her daughter, who was about

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.840
to turn 11 when Ripley left in the original
film, died at the age of 66.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.510
It’s smart Cameron included this, as it
provides a clearer meaning to Ripley’s character

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.969
motivations and transforms the story to one
of maternal redemption.

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.139
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.419
In The Fellowship of the Ring, Boromir is
portrayed as an easily corruptible man hungry

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.629
for the Ring’s power, but an added scene
in the Two Towers extended cut explains his

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:39.629
behaviours.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.329
With Gondor facing the impending threat of
Sauron, Denethor tasks his oldest son with

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.290
claiming the One Ring for their country, so
they can use it as a weapon against the dark

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.290
lord.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.409
The flashback is a nice moment, as it shows
Boromir was concerned about the wellbeing

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.859
of his people, and it also foreshadows the
tension between Denethor and Faramir, a major

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.159
subplot in Return of the King.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.159
Star Trek

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.139
J.J. Abrams’ reboot of Star Trek reinvigorated
the brand, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.749
without some problems.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.589
Many found it confusing that the villain Nero
simply waited 25 years after arriving in the

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:16.630
past to begin his quest of revenge, but a
deleted scene fills that plot hole.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.420
Though it’s briefly mentioned in dialogue
in the theatrical cut, the scene in question

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.680
actually shows Nero being held prisoner in
a Klingon prisoner for more than 20 years.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.830
It would have been nice to see in the finished
film, as it paid homage to Star Trek lore

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.060
and gave viewers a little more time with Nero,
who was thought by some to be a tad underdeveloped.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.060
Thor

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.669
Loki is seen as the MCU’s greatest foe,
and that’s even without this crucial deleted

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.860
scene being official canon.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.669
Obsessed with becoming the ruler of Asgard,
Thor’s brother actually has good reason

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.789
for his desires.

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.819
In a deleted scene, Loki is proclaimed to
be the rightful heir to Odin’s throne, with

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.430
Thor banished to Earth for his brash behaviour.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.650
The cut scene showed Loki wasn’t entirely
selfish, and was handed his dream with support

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.650
from his family.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.139
It was a powerful moment that made the character
more well-rounded and even sympathetic, explaining

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.300
his actions in future appearances in greater
detail than originally presented.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.300
The Avengers

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.610
Joss Whedon’s The Avengers is full of breathtaking
action, but the quiet moments can be just

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.610
as powerful.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.080
The director was heartbroken to cut out a
sequence showing Steve Rogers trying to adjust

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.800
to modern society, and it’s easy to see
why.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.820
Captain America goes on a personal journey,
and what was cut honestly strengthens his

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.900
character arc.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.360
The scene wasn’t all drama either, offering
a funny Stan Lee cameo and some cute lines

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.550
of flirtation between Cap and a waitress.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.241
The Avengers had so much on its plate, it’s
easy to see why this was deleted, but we wish

00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:36.539
Whedon had found time for it.

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:37.539
The Wolverine

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.400
The X-Men film franchise changed modern comic
book movies, but the filmmakers haven’t

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.030
been willing to embrace the source material
completely.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.379
In Bryan Singer’s first film, Wolverines
iconic yellow costume is referred to as a

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:48.379
punch line.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.740
However, James Mangold had some love for it
when he directed The Wolverine.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.780
In an alternate ending, Logan receives his
classic outfit as a gift for what he’s done,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.360
teasing the die hards with the possibility
of seeing Hugh Jackman don the costume for

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.360
an official movie.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360
With the actor seemingly ready to retire,
the upcoming Wolverine 3 may be the best chance

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.360
to make good on this false promise.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.389
Those are our picks for the best deleted scenes
that should have made the final cut.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.150
Are there any we missed?
