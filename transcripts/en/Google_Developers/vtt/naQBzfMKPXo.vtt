00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:10.594
Hello and welcome to
YouTube Behind the Scenes.

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:13.066
My name is Mat’as Molinas

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.396
and I am a Google Developer
Expert for YouTube APIs.

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:18.693
Today I am going
to introduce you

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:20.396
to the YouTube Data API.

00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:23.231
This API allows you to
use all the operations

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.165
that are available
on the YouTube website

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:27.594
from your YouTube account,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.792
by using this application.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:32.099
For example,
with the Data API

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.132
you will be able
to manage your playlists,

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:36.561
upload videos,
and use the search engine.

00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:39.990
In order to do this,
there are client libraries

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.825
available in the majority
of programming languages.

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:44.561
Whatever programming language
you decide on,

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:48.165
a client library
probably already exists

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:50.891
and you will be able to use
the Data API.

00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:53.165
In any case,
to make today's lesson

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.165
easier and faster,

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:57.561
the code examples we will see

00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:00.396
will be shown in
JavaScript and HTML,

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:03.825
so you can use the text editor
of your choice,

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:05.957
such as Notepad++.

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:08.528
If you know how to use
the Google APP Engine,

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:10.330
or if you have
Eclipse installed,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.165
you will be able to work
with this

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:14.561
and display you application
on Google servers.

00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:17.231
In this lesson we will look at
the following subjects:

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:20.495
how to register your application
and implement OAuth 2.0,

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:22.066
how to upload a video to YouTube,

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.561
and explain YouTube's
new Universal Search

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:25.561
and its Freebase integration.

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.957
Are you ready?
Let's begin!

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:32.957
ÀHOW DO YOU REGISTER YOUR APP
AND IMPLEMENT AOuth 2.0?

00:01:33.264 --> 00:01:35.198
So that your application
operations

00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:37.792
can create, actualize,

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.957
and eliminate items
from YouTube,

00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:42.495
such as videos and playlists,

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:44.231
you must authenticate the user

00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:46.099
and this should
authorize your application.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.396
To do this, the YouTube Data API
uses OAuth 2.0,

00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:53.528
so we will see how we can
configure OAuth 2.0

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:55.924
to use the YouTube Data API

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:59.330
from web client applications
on the server

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.693
and applications
installed on devices.

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:04.264
We will see which steps
are necessary

00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:07.099
to configure OAuth 2.0
for your application.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.297
STEP 1
CREATE A PROJECT ON GOOGLE

00:02:10.627 --> 00:02:13.165
In order to use
the YouTube Data API

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.198
from your application,
you need to register

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:16.726
your project on Google.

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:20.693
Let's see how to do this
from the Google Console.

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:24.462
Go to the Google Cloud Console

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:26.561
through the following
web address.

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.825
Select a project,

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:30.726
or create a new one.

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.165
Select "APIs &amp; auth"

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:34.990
on the menu on the left

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.033
and confirm that the status

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:41.561
for YouTube Data API v3 is on.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.957
If not, select "ON."

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:53.099
ENTER YOUR APPLICATION
INFORMATION

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:55.429
Calls to the YouTube Data API

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.495
require an API Key
and an OAuth 2.0 Token.

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:01.132
The Browser Key
and Server Key sections

00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:04.132
show your application keys.

00:03:04.132 --> 00:03:05.891
Us the Browser Key

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.627
with applications
that need the API

00:03:07.627 --> 00:03:09.528
to access public information

00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:11.165
from the browser.

00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:13.462
And the Server Key

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:15.297
for applications that need
the YouTube Data API

00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:17.594
to access public information

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:20.462
if your application
runs on a server.

00:03:20.462 --> 00:03:23.132
If you expand
the OAuth 2.0 Client ID section

00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:26.330
you will find the Client ID
and Client Secret

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.099
that you will use
in Redirect URI

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.297
in your application to obtain
an Access Token.

00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:35.198
To access private
user information,

00:03:35.198 --> 00:03:37.792
your application will need
to send this Access Token

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:40.726
with every call
to the YouTube Data API.

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:43.891
STEP 2
PERMITS

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:47.099
For the user to use
the YouTube Data API functions

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.759
from your application,

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.759
the user must have
opened a session

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.132
with their Google
or YouTube account,

00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:58.759
and must have gone through
the authorization process

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.594
with OAuth 2.0.

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:02.759
In this step
we will specify

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.693
what permits or Scopes
our application will require

00:04:06.693 --> 00:04:08.528
to manage operations

00:04:08.528 --> 00:04:10.825
in the user's YouTube account.

00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:13.990
After the user approves it,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.660
we will redirect it

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.858
to a Google
authorization server.

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:21.099
They will be asked
to select their account

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.297
and approve the permits
the application asks for.

00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:28.561
STEP 3
USER SESSION

00:04:28.858 --> 00:04:31.132
When the user ends the session,

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:34.264
your application will revoke
the Access Token.

00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:39.759
HOW TO UPLOAD A VIDEO
TO YOUTUBE

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.594
Uploading videos from
your application is a function

00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:46.264
that allows the users
of your application

00:04:46.264 --> 00:04:48.066
to create content.

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:51.165
An example of this function

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:53.957
is allowing the users
to create videos

00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:56.561
about how to use
your application.

00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.231
For example,
if it's about a game,

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.528
how to play a certain part.

00:05:01.528 --> 00:05:04.924
Two of the most
well-known cases of games

00:05:04.924 --> 00:05:07.495
on YouTube that allow

00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:09.528
their users to create videos

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:12.429
are FIFA 13 and Talking Tom.

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:14.561
With FIFA 13,

00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.495
users can repeat the game,
and if they want,

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:19.297
they can upload it as a video
on YouTube

00:05:19.297 --> 00:05:20.990
and share it with their friends.

00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:25.528
These videos will allow
a user community to be created

00:05:25.528 --> 00:05:28.759
that share content
from your application on YouTube

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.660
and that will promote
your application through videos

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.462
on social networks.

00:05:34.462 --> 00:05:38.231
These videos will be cataloged
by YouTube

00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:40.165
and this will allow new users

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:41.990
to find your application

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.198
when they use
the YouTube search engine.

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:47.660
They will also find it
through videos.

00:05:48.495 --> 00:05:49.594
How do we do that?

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:52.297
There are three strategies

00:05:52.297 --> 00:05:54.924
for capturing and uploading videos
from cell phones:

00:05:54.924 --> 00:05:57.792
Local Capture, Cloud Capture

00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.561
and Hybrid.

00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:01.990
The Local Capture strategy

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.297
consists in creating the video
on your cell phone application

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:08.132
and then directly uploading it
from your application

00:06:08.132 --> 00:06:09.792
to the YouTube Backend.

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:12.792
For the Cloud Capture strategy,

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:15.594
what you do is send the
parameters of the game,

00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:18.396
or the scene, to the backend
of your application,

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:21.462
which creates a video
from these parameters

00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.693
sent from your cell phone
that can be uploaded to YouTube.

00:06:24.693 --> 00:06:27.429
Finally,
the Hybrid strategy

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.594
is an alternative
where your application

00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:33.066
creates certain resources,
such as images and sounds,

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:36.297
on your cell phone, and then
sends them to a cloud server

00:06:36.297 --> 00:06:38.066
that creates the video

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:40.330
and then uploads it to YouTube.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.627
Let's look at an example of code

00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:45.132
that shows how to upload
a video to YouTube

00:06:45.132 --> 00:06:48.627
from a Java Console
application.

00:06:48.627 --> 00:06:51.891
This example can be
the basis for implementing

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:55.297
any of the 3 scenarios
or strategies we analyze

00:06:55.297 --> 00:06:57.990
once we already have the video.

00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:01.660
STEP 1
THE YOUTUBE SERVICE

00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:05.033
You must have an Access Token
that has at least one

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:08.462
of the following Scopes
approved.

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:11.495
And with this Access Token,

00:07:11.495 --> 00:07:14.165
you will create
a service application

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:17.561
that will provide you with calls
to the YouTube Data API.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.429
STEP 2
SEO DETAILS

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:25.297
You will need to define
the video metadata.

00:07:25.297 --> 00:07:29.726
It is very important that
it be configured correctly,

00:07:29.726 --> 00:07:32.594
since this determines how
it will be cataloged on YouTube,

00:07:32.594 --> 00:07:36.429
and in which search results
it will appear.

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:39.231
Apply everything you know
about SEO

00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.858
to choose the title,
the description, and the Tags.

00:07:43.858 --> 00:07:47.033
Correctly selecting
these parameters

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.396
will make it more likely
for your video to appear

00:07:49.396 --> 00:07:51.825
within the first few
search results.

00:07:52.924 --> 00:07:55.990
STEP 3
INSERT

00:07:56.594 --> 00:08:00.792
Finally, insert or upload
the video to YouTube

00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:02.990
using the YouTube Data API.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.231
Let's see how the code
would be to complete this step.

00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:11.957
WE INSERT THE VIDEO HERE

00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:27.693
We have just seen how to upload
a video to YouTube,

00:08:27.693 --> 00:08:30.363
in this case
from a Java Console application,

00:08:30.363 --> 00:08:32.990
but there are client libraries

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.660
for most programming languages,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.363
and we can use the service
from desktop, cell phone

00:08:38.363 --> 00:08:42.726
and server applications.

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:45.033
YOUTUBE UNIVERSAL SEARCH

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:46.396
AND ITS KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
INTEGRATION

00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:50.066
One difference between
YouTube Data API version 3

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:51.990
and version 2,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.099
is its Freebase integration,

00:08:54.099 --> 00:08:56.561
or the Knowledge Graph

00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:58.990
Google uses
in its searches.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.033
Knowledge Graph integration

00:09:02.033 --> 00:09:05.033
allows us to obtain results
not only including

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:07.891
resources that correspond
to the key words

00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:09.495
used in the search,

00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:12.066
but also items related

00:09:12.066 --> 00:09:14.297
to our search.

00:09:14.297 --> 00:09:17.396
A simple way to understand
how a search using key words

00:09:17.396 --> 00:09:20.825
through the Knowledge Graph

00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:23.627
is by searching for
"Leonardo da Vinci" on Google.

00:09:23.627 --> 00:09:26.198
By doing this,
we see the results

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.990
in the column on the left

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.693
correspond to documents
that include

00:09:30.693 --> 00:09:33.462
they key word
"Leonardo da Vinci,"

00:09:33.462 --> 00:09:35.330
but the results on the right

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.561
are images and information

00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:41.033
about items related to
the "Leonardo da Vinci" item

00:09:41.033 --> 00:09:43.033
in the Knowledge Graph.

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:45.594
For example,
among the related items

00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:47.825
we find the Mona Lisa,

00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:50.429
which does not include the key
words "Leonardo da Vinci,"

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:53.033
but it is a related item.

00:09:53.033 --> 00:09:55.297
This gives us
much more interesting

00:09:55.297 --> 00:09:58.528
and educational search results.

00:09:58.528 --> 00:10:01.033
In this way,
we can take advantage

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.924
of this Knowledge Graph
integration

00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:07.792
through the Universal Search
YouTube Data API.

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:10.693
Why do we call it
a Universal Search?

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.759
Because the results can include

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.660
different types of resources,

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.231
such as channels, playlists,
or videos,

00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:21.066
all in the same search.

00:10:21.066 --> 00:10:23.363
Another advantage

00:10:23.363 --> 00:10:26.396
is that the results are
shown by relevance

00:10:26.396 --> 00:10:28.297
on the server side.

00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:32.693
Let's look at some real examples

00:10:32.693 --> 00:10:35.264
that use this technology

00:10:35.264 --> 00:10:37.396
to see the power of APIs

00:10:37.396 --> 00:10:39.462
and how they can create

00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:41.924
a pleasurable user experience.

00:10:43.693 --> 00:11:03.330
THESE ARE EXAMPLES THAT UPLOAD
VIDEOS WITH THE API

00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:28.561
HERE THE API IS USED TO SEARCH

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.561
How can you take advantage
of all this?

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:34.693
Let's see how you
can obtain information

00:11:34.693 --> 00:11:36.924
from Freebase items
and YouTube video items

00:11:36.924 --> 00:11:39.165
and then use the IDs
from these Freebase items

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.561
in the search.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.429
STEP 1
YOUTUBE TOPIC EXPLORER

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.825
In this example
we will see part of how

00:11:49.825 --> 00:11:53.792
Open Source YouTube Topic
Explorer application functions.

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.990
This application uses

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.033
the playlists that YouTube uses

00:11:58.033 --> 00:12:00.693
to save user activity information

00:12:00.693 --> 00:12:03.396
to then recommend content.

00:12:03.396 --> 00:12:07.297
These lists are
uploaded videos, favorites,

00:12:07.297 --> 00:12:10.726
videos where the user
put "like",

00:12:10.726 --> 00:12:12.990
and videos they want to see
later on.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.264
It's also worth mentioning

00:12:15.264 --> 00:12:16.858
that all YouTube user accounts

00:12:16.858 --> 00:12:18.693
have a related channel,

00:12:18.693 --> 00:12:21.858
which we can use,
with user authorization,

00:12:21.858 --> 00:12:24.660
to consult these lists,
and obtain these videos

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.066
and their metadata
to obtain the IDs

00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:29.759
of related Freebase items.

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:34.231
Yes, YouTube videos now have,
along with their metadata,

00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:37.132
Freebase item IDs

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.825
automatically assigned to them
by YouTube.

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:42.198
Let's see how we can obtain
this information

00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:45.693
and then organize
the Freebase items

00:12:45.693 --> 00:12:49.495
related to the videos from these
user lists by relevance.

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:56.759
OBTAIN USER PREFERENCES

00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:08.627
OBTAIN FREEBASE INFORMATION

00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:18.858
ORGANIZE BY RELEVANCE

00:13:25.132 --> 00:13:29.891
OBTAIN NAMES FROM FREEBASE

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:36.165
STEP 2
THE UNIVERSAL SEARCH

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.132
Once we have selected
and introduced

00:13:39.132 --> 00:13:40.924
the Freebase items

00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:43.825
related to the collection
of user interest,

00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:46.627
how can we use
the Universal Search

00:13:46.627 --> 00:13:48.990
to obtain resources

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.891
related to one of these items?

00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:52.330
Let's look at the code.

00:13:54.594 --> 00:13:59.924
SEARCH FOR VIDEOS RELATED TO
A FREEBASE ITEM

00:14:02.693 --> 00:14:07.231
SEARCH PARAMETERS

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.528
THESE VIDEOS
ARE THE SEARCH RESULTS

00:14:13.264 --> 00:14:14.759
LET'S DO AN EXERCISE!

00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:18.264
Did you know that the Data API
also allows you to access

00:14:18.264 --> 00:14:22.363
Activities, which are resources
that allow you to obtain

00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:26.132
information about an action
on a channel or from a user?

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:27.924
For example, they allow you

00:14:27.924 --> 00:14:29.957
to obtain the recommendations
presented

00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:33.066
on a YouTube user Home Page.

00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:35.561
How would you use
these recommendations

00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:38.462
to obtain related
Freebase items?

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.297
SOLUTION

00:14:47.528 --> 00:14:51.033
WE OBTAIN THE ACTIVITIES

00:14:51.033 --> 00:14:53.396
FROM THE YOUTUBE
USER HOME PAGE

00:14:57.165 --> 00:15:01.858
ONLY USE
THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:05.066
LET'S DO ANOTHER EXERCISE!

00:15:05.231 --> 00:15:08.264
And how would you get
the same information,

00:15:08.264 --> 00:15:11.825
but now from the social
activities related to a video?

00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:17.528
SOLUTION

00:15:20.495 --> 00:15:34.957
USER SOCIAL ACTIVITIES
ARE USED HERE

00:15:35.957 --> 00:15:38.429
I hope that you enjoyed
this lesson.

00:15:38.429 --> 00:15:40.957
We have learned how to use
the Data API

00:15:40.957 --> 00:15:44.660
from an application
to upload and search for videos.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.594
We have also learned how to
register your application

00:15:47.594 --> 00:15:49.264
and use OAuth 2.0

00:15:49.264 --> 00:15:52.033
in order to use
all these operations.

00:15:52.033 --> 00:15:54.231
To do this,
we used, as an example,

00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:56.924
code from the YouTube
Topic Explorer application.

00:15:58.099 --> 00:15:59.957
I recommend you analyze it
in detail.

00:15:59.957 --> 00:16:02.363
It's an excellent example
of how to use

00:16:02.363 --> 00:16:04.198
the YouTube Data API,

00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:06.396
and also how to make
an application

00:16:06.396 --> 00:16:09.627
with JavaScript using
AngularJS.

00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:11.858
I invite you to watch
the next lesson,

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:14.231
where we will see, in detail,
how we can use the Data API

00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:18.627
to manage and optimize
your YouTube channel.

00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:20.429
See you in the next lesson!
