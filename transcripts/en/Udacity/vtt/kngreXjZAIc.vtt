00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.270
The answer to this question might surprise you.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.360
It's not the variant with the three letters that

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.670
are deleted, but the one with the single

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.380
letter deletion. And the reason is incredibly interesting. Because

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.740
the codon reading frame shifted. Think about it

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.020
for a second. In this first scenario here, you're

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.280
the ribosome, and you're reading the sequence, right. So

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.100
you'd read the codon GTC C, T, C, G,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.210
T, oh my gosh, whadda we do? We're missing

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.980
one. What's going to happen, is it's going to read the very

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.470
next letter, and that's going to be associated with the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.090
codon GTG. Well, notice GTG is the exact same as

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.840
what it was before. And now we go to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.890
ACC. And what essentially happened, is GTGAC, we skipped over

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.920
this whole GTG to this ACC and every thing

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.380
from here on out is pretty much the same thing.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.080
So, it's bad, right we lost three letters, but

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.480
in the end we only lost one whole amino acid;

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.630
where as down here, if we're at the ribosome, we

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.760
get the first codon, the second codon and then we

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.640
get here, skip one, got to a G well

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.660
we're still the same GTG But now we're going to keep

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.420
moving to the next three, and we get TGA, CCC,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.670
CTT, G, and you'll notice that these codons are not

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.670
the same as these codons up here. They're very different. And on top of it, this

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.290
codon here, TGA, what does that code for? It codes for a big ol' STOP codon.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.330
So this mutation here, we only deleted one

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.980
letter, but it caused a frame shift. And

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.130
then, we introduced an early stop code on.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.050
This is going to drastically change the protein sequence,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.170
compared to this mutation, which at this deletion

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.930
here Even though the deletion was three letters

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.030
and this one was only one letter, this

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.630
variation is far more significant in the resulting protein.
