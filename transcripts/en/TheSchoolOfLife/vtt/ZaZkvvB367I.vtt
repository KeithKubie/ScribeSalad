00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.450
How do you build a better world? There are
so many well-known, urgent places you might

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.930
start: malaria, carbon emissions, tax evasion,
the drug trade, soil erosion, water pollution…

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.800
Donald Winnicott deserves his place in history
because of the dramatic simplicity of his

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.789
approach. He proposed that the happiness of
the human race depended ultimately not so

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.540
much on external political issues, but on
the way parents bring up their children.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.130
Born in 1896, Winnicott was Britain’s first
medically-trained child psychoanalyst.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.230
Although he had no children of his own, he
played a crucial and devoted role in public

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.870
education around child-rearing, delivering
some 600 talks on the BBC, tirelessly lecturing

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.350
around the country and authoring 15 books,
among which the bestselling collection of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.750
essays, Home is Where We Start From.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.289
It was rather strange that Winnicott should even have been English given that his country

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.879
was notorious, then as now, for its lack of
tenderness and its resistance to introspection.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.639
And yet Winnicott’s brand of psychoanalysis
was, on closer inspection, peculiarly English.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.140
There was a characteristic English modesty
about what he saw as the point of child psychoanalysis.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.410
His famous radio series was simply titled
The Ordinary Devoted Mother and Her Baby.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.970
He wanted to help people to be, in his famous
formulation,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.830
good enough

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.660
parents; not brilliant or perfect ones (as
other nations might have wished), but just

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.750
OK.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.150
So what would it take, in his eyes, to encourage
the ‘good enough’ parent? Winnicott put

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.530
forward a number of suggestions:

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.060
Winnicott begins by impressing on his audience
how psychologically fragile an infant is.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.980
It doesn’t understand itself, it doesn’t
know where it is, it is struggling to stay

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.520
alive, it has no way of grasping when the
next feed will come, it can’t communicate

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.220
with itself or others.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.290
Winnicott’s work never loses sight of this,
and he therefore repeatedly insists that it

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.140
is those around the infant who have to adapt
so as to do everything to interpret the child’s

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.119
needs and not impose demands for which the
child is not ready.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.890
For example, Winnicott knew what violence,
what hate there could be in a healthy infant.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.480
Referring to what happens if a parent forgets
a feed, he cautioned: ‘If you fail him,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.450
it must feel to him as if the wild beasts
would gobble him up.’

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.900
But though the infant might sometimes want
to kill and destroy, it is vital for the parents

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.090
to allow rage to expend itself, and for them
not in any way to be threatened or moralistic

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.980
about ‘bad’ behaviour: ‘If a baby cries
in a state of rage … and yet the people

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.700
round him remain calm and unhurt, this experience
greatly strengthens his ability to see that

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.530
what he feels to be true is not necessarily
real.’

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.920
Parents are delighted when infants and children
follow their rules. Such children are called

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.910
good. Winnicott was very scared of ‘good’
children.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.650
He believed that they were the children of
parents who could not tolerate too much bad

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.090
behaviour and demanded compliance too early
and too strictly. This would lead, in Winnicott’s

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.780
formulation, to the emergence of a

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.300
False Self

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.320
– a persona that would be outwardly compliant,
outwardly good, but was suppressing its vital instincts.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.750
In Winnicott’s scheme, adults who can’t
be creative, who are somehow a little dead

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.010
inside, are almost always the children of
parents who have not been able to tolerate

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.880
defiance, parents who have made their offspring
‘good’ way before their time, thereby

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.670
killing their capacity to be properly good,
properly generous and kind.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.959
Every failure of the environment forces a
child to adapt prematurely. For example, if

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.400
the parents are too chaotic, the child quickly
tries to over-think the situation. Its rational

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.310
faculties are over-stimulated (it may, in
later life, try to be an intellectual).

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.870
A parent who is depressed might unwittingly
force the child to be too cheerful – giving

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.510
it no time to process its own melancholy feelings.
Winnicott saw the dangers in a child who,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.670
in his words, has to ‘look after mother’s
mood’.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.509
Winnicott had a special hatred for ‘people
who are always jogging babies up and down

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:22.069
on their knees trying to produce a giggle.’
This was merely their way of warding off their

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:26.340
own sadness, by demanding laughter from a
baby who might have very different things

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.830
on its mind.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.469
The primordial act of parental health for
Winnicott is simply to be able to tune out

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:38.840
of oneself for a time in the name of empathising
with the ways and needs of a small, mysterious,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.340
beautiful fragile person whose unique otherness
must be acknowledged and

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.620
respected in full measure.

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.090
Many of the parents Winnicott saw were worn
down by their labours. Winnicott tried to

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.569
bolster them by reminding them of the utmost
importance of what they were doing. They were,

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.039
in their own way, as significant to the nation
as the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.199
Winnicott called parenting: ‘the only real
basis for a healthy society, and the only

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.789
factory for the democratic tendency in a country’s
social system.’

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.919
In his descriptions of what parents should
do for their children, Winnicott was in effect

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.719
referring to a term which he rarely mentioned
directly: love. We often imagine love to be

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.499
about a magical intuitive ‘connection’
with someone. But, in Winnicott’s writings,

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.249
we get a different picture. It’s about a
surrender of the ego, a putting aside of one’s

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:35.830
own needs and assumptions, for the sake of
close, attentive listening to another, whose

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.059
mystery one respects, along with a commitment
not to get offended, not to retaliate, when

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:48.059
something ‘bad’ emerges, as it often does
when one is close to someone, child or adult.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.249
Since Winnicott’s death, we’ve collectively
grown a little better at parenting.

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:57.089
But only a little. We may spend more time
with our children, we know in theory that

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:01.309
they matter a lot, but we’re arguably still
failing at the part Winnicott focused on:

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:02.599
ADAPTATION

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.900
We still routinely fail to suppress our own
needs or stifle our own demands when we’re

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.710
with a child.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.939
We’re still learning how to love our children
– and that, Winnicott would argue, is why

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:16.669
the world is still full of the walking-wounded,
people of outward ‘success’ and respectability

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.719
who are nevertheless not quite ‘real’
inside and inflict their wounds on others.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:26.740
We’ve a way to go until we are fully ‘good
enough.’ It’s a task – Winnicott would

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.740
have insisted – that’s in its own way
as important as any other.
