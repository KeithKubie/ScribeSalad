00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.350
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.
Bipedal, naked, large brained, long the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.150
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:48.740
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:56.280
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.130
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:11.340
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here. An exploration made possible

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.270
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:21.190
- [Naomi] I'm often told that my talks are
very depressing. So I'm pleased to follow

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.410
Liz Hadley who's talk was even more
depressing than mine. If we didn't already

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.680
have enough to worry about, now we have to
worry about armadillos carrying leprosy.

00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:37.730
So I was given an assignment for this
meeting and it was a very upbeat question:

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.730
will we survive the future? So I'm happy
to say that I actually have a positive

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.350
answer to that question. The answer is
yes. I do believe we will survive. As Liz

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.480
just showed us, we're a much greater
threat to other species than other species

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.470
are to us. And short of a meteorite impact
hitting us, I think that the odds that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.690
humans as a species will survive are
probably very great at least for the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.590
foreseeable future. It seems to me the
more relevant question though is how will

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.080
we survive and particularly in what
condition. Anthropogenic climate

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.580
disruption and its companion threat of
ocean acidification threatens to reverse

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.070
the developmental gains of the past 50
years decreasing the quality of life in

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.850
wealthy nations and pushing still more of
the world's poor as well as other species

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.820
to the edge of survival. The president of
the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim has recently

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.590
noted that climate change is a fundamental
threat to development. One that threatens

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.400
to reverse 50 years of progress. So what
will a future of unmitigated climate

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.580
change look like? Not just physically but
socially, economically and politically.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.670
This was the question that Erik Conway and
I set out to answer in our book that also

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.940
has a very optimistic title, The Collapse
of Western Civilization. The book takes

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.190
place in the year 2393 when a historian
looks back on our present and asks the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.860
question: how is it that they knew so much
about what was happening to them, had so

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.280
much good scientific information and yet
did so little to prevent it. The year is

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.681
2393, the occasion is the commemoration of
the great collapse of 2093. I wanted to

00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:20.011
read to you from the book but time doesn't
permit that. So I'll just summarize the

00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:24.281
argument and hope that you'll buy the book
which only costs $6.95 in its Kindle

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:31.300
edition. So first, our historian recounts
what happened in the great collapse. It

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.410
begins with the collapse of the West
Antarctic ice sheet and this physical

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.010
collapse then ramifies into social
dislocation and the collapse of economic

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.200
and political systems. Then she tries to
answer the why question. Why did people

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.630
let this happen? And she argues that the
grip of free market ideologies combined

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.480
with scientists' failure to communicate
what was truly at stake created a

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.820
disabling paralysis. So my question today
is how do we avoid that future? The

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.680
question of what kind of future we will
have is really the question of whether we

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.520
are capable of addressing the problems
that before our eyes. And this of course

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.930
is not a new question. Indeed, I will
argue it's the Malthusian question. In

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.350
1798 as most of you know, Thomas Malthus
asked the question: can the enlightenment

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.970
project work? By that he meant can we
reasonably expect to improve the condition

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:38.380
of mankind. And his short answer was no.
And for this reason, Malthus is often

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.170
considered an anti-enlightenment
philosopher. He rejected as impossible and

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.690
even misguided the enlightenment
aspiration to achieve the perfectibility

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:55.390
of man and of society. He even doubted the
possibility of long term and sustained

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.670
improvement. Now most of us also know why
Malthus came to this pessimistic

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.980
conclusion. It was what he called the
positive checks. Positive in the sense of

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.790
absolutely, positively certain. And those
were the checks of famine and disease, and

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.350
the misery and mortality that ensured from
them. Now most of us also know that

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.990
happily Malthus was wrong. And it's
generally taken to be received wisdom that

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.330
the main reason he was wrong was because
he failed to appreciate the empowering

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.900
effects of technological innovation. The
19th and 20th century saw technology

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.490
enabling a number of key developments that
help to stave off the Malthusian disaster

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.740
that he imagined. The most important of
course was increased food production. But

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.260
also arguably equally important, better
public health through sanitation and

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.240
vaccination. Which led in turn to the
greater survival of children. And the

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.440
survival of children along with the
education of women and the development of

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.760
technologies, available technologies of
population control, allowed many of the

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.010
nations of the world to bring their
fertility rates down without the misery or

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:15.500
vice that Malthus feared. Because of this
success, because of how much technology

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.530
played a role in the development of the
western world in the last 250 to 300

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:26.490
years, technological success has become a
foundation tenet in many of our beliefs.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.710
Particularly those of us living in
wealthy, industrialised, technologically

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.180
endowed nations where we have benefited
the most from these technological

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.280
successes. Indeed, our belief in
technology is so foundational that we can

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.760
name several philosophies that express
this belief. So for example technophilia,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.350
the love of technology, cornucopianism,
the belief in the continued productivity

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.840
of technological innovation,
techno-fideism, more faith in technology

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.280
and more recently something I've been
calling disruptivism, a belief in the

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.470
power of disruptive technologies. In fact
these philosophies are so powerful that

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.640
some of them even have their own bibles.
So some of you are familiar with the bible

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.610
of cornucopianism, the book, The
Resourceful Earth. Now, one of the things

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.490
I find most interesting about faith in
technology is that it cuts across party

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.190
and ideological lines. In fact, I would
argue it's one of the few things in

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.790
western culture that does. So the
cornucopians are mostly conservatives and

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:32.640
neoliberals. They have confidence in
human ingenuity and the capacity of the

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.230
market place to do its magic. The
techno-fideist tend to be traditional

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:43.350
republicans, democrats and what I call
paleoliberals as opposed to neoliberals. I

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:48.080
guess we have to have mesoliberals too. We
haven't figured out who they are yet.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.410
Techno-fideists tend to believe in
government investment and technological

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.660
R&amp;D. And then there's the disruptivist who
I haven't quite figured out what they

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.810
believe in. But they talk about the need
for disruptive technologies but without

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:05.170
specifying how those technologies come to
exist. But all agree on the crucial role

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:10.180
of technology. What they disagree about is
how we get it. So liberals tend to focus

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.900
on education and research particularly in
great research universities and

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.530
institutions like this one and UCSD across
the street. Conservatives stress free

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:24.920
market economics and entrepreneurship. And
disruptivists don't say. But here's the

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.350
rub and actually there're several rubs. So
I'm a historian, there's never only one

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:35.090
answer. The first rub is what I'm calling
the cargo cult mentality and we have

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.450
anthropologists in the audience so I hope
they'll appreciate what I mean by this.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.380
When you listen to the advocates of
technological solutions to climate change,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.960
no matter of the left, or right or in
between, one is struck by the similarity

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.270
to anthropological descriptions of the
cargo cult. By that I mean we are waiting

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.800
for the goods to arrive but we have no
coherent plan to get them. To the

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.600
cornucopians I would ask: but what if the
market doesn't do its magic? To the

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.720
techno-fideists I would ask: well, what if
basic research doesn't translate into

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.620
usable technologies. And to the
disruptivists: what if the climate

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.530
disruption arrives before the
technological one? The second rub, much of

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.140
this discussion ignores what we have
learned or should have learned from

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.930
experience. It ignores what we know from
the history of technology about how

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.770
transformative technologies became normal
parts of our lives. Now I've lived with

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.890
historians and historians don't like big
generalizations. There are no laws of

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.140
history and we tend to focus on the
specifics of individual developments in

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.120
cases and cultures because we know they
are all different. But there is a

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.360
generalization that I think is broadly
true about technology in the 20th century.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.870
And that is that none of the
transformative technologies of the 20th

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:58.850
century were produced either by market
based mechanisms alone or entirely by

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:04.320
government R&amp;D either. Rather nearly all
the transformative technologies of the

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.460
20th century involved government-private
sector partnerships. And here's just a

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.350
short list. I couldn't fit them all on a
slide. But just some examples, rural

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:18.410
electrification, the development of
telephone and telegraph, aviation and air

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.070
traffic control, nuclear power, the
internet, digital computing, space

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.850
technologies, pollution control
technologies all formed by

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.470
government-private sector partnerships. In
fact, the only two exceptions I could come

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:35.600
up with, and being at the Salk Institute,
I have to mention the polio vaccine and

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.250
the contraceptive pill also developed
largely here in Southern California. These

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.710
were private-private partnerships but
where one half of the partnership was

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:50.090
philanthropic rather than private sector
entrepreneurial. Electricity is a very

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.020
well studied case in point. We know a lot
about the history of the development of

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.570
electricity. We know that entrepreneurship
brought electricity to most Americans in

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.080
major cities, but it took government
initiative to bring it to rural citizens.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.500
And that's true in other countries as
well. In fact, most other countries have

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.930
rural electricity before the United States
did because their governments were less

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.080
reluctant to get involved and because they
viewed electricity as a common good rather

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.680
than as a commodity. The third problem is
what I'm calling the problem of

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:26.210
persistence forecasting. And by that I
mean assuming that the future will be like

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:32.400
the past. Technology has led the way in
many radical changes in the way we live,

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.820
but will it be up to the challenge of
anthropogenic climate change? The Zen

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.560
Masters have said that technology makes
major contributions to the minor needs of

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:49.050
man. Now, I think that might be a bit
strong. Having a warm, safely-lit house,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:54.880
and clean water and good food would seem
to be more than minor needs. But still, in

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.900
the world of laptops and iPhones, one may
well wonder are we getting the

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:06.070
technologies we want or the technologies
we need. It's now a truism that Malthus

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:11.430
was wrong but the fact is that billions of
people today do still lack adequate food

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.910
and water, and they do suffer misery for
that lack. And in many parts of the world,

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:23.660
childhood mortality remains very high.
Life has improved dramatically for those

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.180
of us in the upper four billion as I think
Ramanathan calls it, but it remains

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.940
highly unimproved for at least two billion
of our fellow citizens. And in public

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.460
health, it's well documented that medical
breakthroughs of the past decades has

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.270
mainly addressed the diseases and even the
discomforts of the wealthy to the neglect

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:48.490
of many of the most devastating diseases
of the poor. So why have we made so much

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:53.300
progress on telephones, and contact lens
technology and cosmetic surgery, and such

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:59.010
relatively modest progress on solar cell
efficiency and energy storage? Well, I

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.540
think one part of the answer is clear.
Markets respond to market signals. And

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.020
without a price on carbon there's
insufficient demand for energy efficiency

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:13.600
and storage. Governments will respond to
political signals and those have so far

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.540
been largely lacking as well. And of
course this also explains why we haven't

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.880
solved the diseases of the poor. And the
fourth issue is the issue of inequality

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.560
and inequity. Today, technological
development has not resolved problems of

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:34.610
inequality and in some cases has in fact
exacerbated them. So perhaps Malthus was

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:40.300
right after all and technology just
brought us extra time. So will we survive

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:47.000
the future? Again I still think the answer
is yes. But how we survive hangs in the

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.890
balance and it will depend in no small
part on how quickly we can develop the

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:56.750
technologies to transform our energy
systems. And to do that we can't just sit

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.790
around chattering about disruptive
technologies or letting the market do its

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.230
magic, while meanwhile the fossil fuel
industry continues to explore for and

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.490
develop still more reserves of fossil
fuels, including the Arctic, one of

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.070
the few places on Liz's maps that's not
filled with people. And of course, we

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:19.070
continue to use those fuels. We have to
get past wishful thinking and

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:24.540
techno-fideism to apply what we know from
experience it is likely to take to solve

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:31.270
these problems. And that brings me to the
thorny issue of politics. People don't

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:36.860
like to talk about politics. It's awkward
and divisive. In fact, we've had a whole

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.130
set of wonderful speakers today but no one
has spoken about the evolution of

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:47.430
political systems or the evolution of
governments. But without talking about

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.340
political systems and governments, I don't
see how we can solve the problems that we

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:57.700
face. Now many people have seen an analogy
between our problem of relinquishing

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.080
dependency on fossil fuels and the 19th
century problem of relinquishing

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.740
dependency on slave labor. Interestingly,
some of the people who invoke the need for

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.010
disruptive technologies to solve climate
change are the same people who invoke this

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:19.260
analogy with the disruption of ending
slavery. But slavery was not ended because

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:24.650
of disruptive technologies that eliminated
the need for slaves. It was ended by the

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.830
disruptive politics that included acts of
terrorism, or illegal sheltering of

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:37.190
escaped slaves and finally culminated in a
tragic, bloody, military conflict. Now few

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.440
of us are prepared to break the law to
stop disruptive climate change and I'm not

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.200
advocating that we necessarily should. And
I've certainly heard many of our

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.660
colleagues criticize climate scientist
James Hansen for crossing a line and

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.211
"becoming an advocate."

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:58.450
Because he has been arrested
protesting the Keystone XL pipeline. I do

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.250
not know whether what Hansen is doing is
right or wrong, or whether it will make a

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:10.450
difference or not. And of course no one
does. But as a historian, I will say this:

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.580
most of us in the climate science arena
have been focused on science and

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:21.270
technology, and to a lesser extent on the
business side of business as usual. But

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:27.030
what may matter most, what may be most
urgent and what may actually determine the

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.560
question of how we survive is whether we
can create and sustain a disruptive

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.730
politics. Politics makes nearly all
scientists very uncomfortable. We don't

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:44.460
want what we do to be politicised and we
are afraid of being seen as political. But

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.090
it seems to me very unlikely that we can
solve climate change with politics as

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:54.810
usual. And it seems to me also very
unlikely that we can solve climate change

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.970
with our scientific thinking as usual
either. And so maybe the time has come to

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.541
think about that. Thank you very much.
