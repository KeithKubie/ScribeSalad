00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.179
We all know where babies come from.

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.800
An egg is fertilized by sperm and the resulting
zygote needs to be implanted in a uterus so

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.300
it can grow and divide.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.620
The key here is the union of the gametes:
sperm and egg.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.490
This means same-sex partners, or partners
who are unable to provide gametes themselves,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.130
need to rely on donors.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.869
But what if that wasn’t the case?

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.550
What if we could just generate gametes from
the partners?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.859
Soon, we might be able to.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.140
The method is called in-vitro gametogenesis.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.890
It involves converting adult cells into lab-made
eggs and sperm cells that can combine to create

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.910
a zygote.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.421
This could pave the way for two adults of
any sex or gender to combine their DNA and

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:41.140
produce their own biological offspring.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.280
The first breakthrough came in 2012 when researchers
working with mice successfully.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.600
reprogrammed skin cells to behave like embryonic
stem cells, known as induced pluripotent stem

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.600
cells.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.579
Then, in the lab, those cells were stimulated
to turn from stem cells into sperm or egg

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.579
cells.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.719
And to make sure the eggs were mature, they
had to implant them into mouse ovaries.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.860
But, to make this viable for IVG, they needed
to turn those lab-created cells into mature

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.420
egg cells OUTSIDE a living mammal.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.299
Which was very complex in itself and finally
completed in 2016.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.770
Once they’d figured that out, the team followed
basic IVF procedure: the skin-cell-created

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.659
egg cell was fertilized in the lab using sperm
cells also made from skin cells, completing

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:23.970
the full cycle.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.520
The resulting zygotes were implanted in a
mouse.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.890
The test saw 26 healthy pups born from the
experiment, and some of those even had babies

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.070
of their own, showing their genetic material
was undamaged.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.700
But, before you get too excited, the process
is technically challenging.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.719
Only 3.5 percent of the embryos created from
artificial eggs cells matured into pups while

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.799
the cells that were matured inside a mouse
had a 60 percent rate of success.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.109
For the moment, this tech hasn’t led to
human experiments yet.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.160
Scientists are working with human induced
pluripotent stem cells to understand how they

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.240
work differently than mouse cells when becoming
eggs, but there’s an added complication:

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.320
that fertilizing human eggs is forbidden by
Japanese ethics guidelines, even for research.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.330
Nevertheless, the implications behind this
technology are incredible.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.360
If scientists can prove this is safe and effective,
then someday, couples who can’t naturally

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.040
conceive could gain the ability to become
biological parents to a child.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.160
And if this sounds futuristic, scary, and
unnatural, consider IVF.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.690
IVF was scary and unnatural when it was first
used, too.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.440
Terms like “test-tube baby” hit the media
that are now considered inappropriate or offensive.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.970
These days, no one bats an eye when couples
use whatever means they have to conceive,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.980
and IVG could be the solution for couples
that IVF can’t help, effectively ending

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.980
infertility.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.840
