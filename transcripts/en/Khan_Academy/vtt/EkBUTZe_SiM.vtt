00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:02.849
- [Voiceover] Three L
minus six is greater than

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:04.021
or equal to eight.

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.784
Which of the following best
describes the solutions

00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:09.342
to the inequality shown above?

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:14.137
So it's three times L
minus six is greater than

00:00:14.137 --> 00:00:16.358
or equal to eight.

00:00:16.358 --> 00:00:19.736
Well all of these choices,
these are in terms of L.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.313
They've said L on one side is greater than

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.794
or equal to, actually all
of these choices are greater

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.481
than or equal to something else.

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:27.931
So let's see what we
can do to get just an L

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:29.440
on the left-hand side.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.926
So the first thing we might want to do is

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:32.899
let's get rid of this subtracting the six,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.041
and the best way we can do that is

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.319
we can add six.

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:37.676
Let's add six to both sides.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:41.356
This six and this six
are going to add to zero,

00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:43.654
and then we are going to be left with,

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:45.326
we are going to be left with

00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:47.950
three L on the left hand side is

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.605
greater than or equal
to eight plus six is 14.

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.639
Now to just get an L on the left-hand side

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.995
we can divide both sides by three,

00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:58.737
and if you divide both sides by three,

00:00:58.737 --> 00:01:00.594
you're not going to change the sign,

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.138
you're not going to change the inequality.

00:01:02.138 --> 00:01:03.299
If you're dividing by a negative number,

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.652
you would swap the inequality.

00:01:04.652 --> 00:01:06.034
Greater than or equal to would turn

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:07.229
into less than or equal to,

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.052
but we're dividing by a positive number,

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:11.778
so this is going to be L is greater than

00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:14.936
or equal to 14 over three

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:17.229
which is that choice right there.
