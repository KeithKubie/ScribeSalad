00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.838
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:07.450
JESSE HAINES: First
of all, I'm actually

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.660
just curious to know how many
of you here in this audience

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.380
were either born outside
the United States,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.730
or have a parent that was born
outside the United States?

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.030
Just to get a show of hands.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.530
All right.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.560
I'd say that's
almost half the room.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.720
Interesting.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.255
OK, so just giving you a
sense of your audience.

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:33.880
MARY SKAFIDAS: That's great.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.560
JESSE HAINES: So tell us a
little bit about where you came

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.270
up with the idea for this
book, which is, again,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.210
72 essays all about immigration,
from folks that you've heard

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.410
of and others that you haven't.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.574
But like, why?

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:55.990
ANDREW TISCH: Well, I had
joined the board of the New York

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.884
Historical Society.

00:00:57.884 --> 00:01:00.550
And one of the things we have at
the New York Historical Society

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.670
is a very nice auditorium
that we loan out

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.510
periodically to the immigration
and Naturalization Service.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.960
So I was asked if I
would offer greetings

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.540
to 100 new immigrants
who were being

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.050
sworn in on behalf of NYHS.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.580
I said, sure, why not?

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.280
And as I was
preparing my remarks,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.940
I decided to talk about how my
family got here-- the family

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.020
lore of how we came to America.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.010
And as I was sitting there
looking out on the audience,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.235
I thought to myself,
everyone has a story.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.250
Virtually every one
of us is an immigrant.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.520
And with everything
that's going on--

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.370
and this was now 18 months
ago, 24 months ago--

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.390
with everything that was
going on then, I said,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.240
why not start to tell
some of the stories?

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.040
And so I went back to the
office and talked to Mary.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.550
And Mary and I had been
writing for several years,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.470
writing op-eds together.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.037
And I said to her, how would
you like to write a book?

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:09.370
You're not gonna make any money.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.040
MARY SKAFIDAS: I ran away
and hid under my desk.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.540
No.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.890
I was very engaged, and
wanted to do this right

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.940
from when he said it.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.740
We had a great time just
researching his family history.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.279
And I was born here, but
I didn't speak English

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.570
till I was five years old
because my parents just spoke

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.619
Greek, and still
just speak Greek.

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.910
So it was something that was
near and dear to my heart.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.090
And you could see, when he
came back from the ceremony,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.090
he was energized.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.650
It was like, we're
all immigrants.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.640
And it shouldn't be an epiphany.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.560
We are all immigrants.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.464
But it takes a moment like that
for you to really realize it.

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:52.630
JESSE HAINES: And then what?

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.730
You've got such an amazing
collection of stories

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.850
here from everyone
from Marlo Thomas,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.330
Nancy Pelosi, Rabbi Angela--

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.890
like just such a mix.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.630
How did you find these people?

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.280
Were they reluctant to share?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.690
Excited to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.940
ANDREW TISCH: Very few people
were reluctant to share.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.900
As a matter of fact,
when you talk to people,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.680
they got energized by it.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.240
You know, many
people, after we asked

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.040
them three or four
questions, would

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.440
start to come up with things
that they hadn't thought about.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.990
And at the end of
the discussion,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.580
they were thanking us.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.060
But we started out by
interviewing people.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.280
And we realized, or at least
I came to the realization,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.610
I can't write in
another person's voice.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.790
So maybe I was being a
little bit lazy, but I said,

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.630
why don't you write an essay?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.140
Write 500 to 1,500 words
about how you or your family

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.100
got here.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.790
And then we'll do
a light edit on it.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.390
And the stories
that we got in were

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.260
unbelievable because it
was people really pouring

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.550
their hearts out about what
America meant to them, what

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.990
their family meant to them.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.150
It was the stories.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.380
Each one of them tells a story.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.840
And collecting the stories
was kind of the easy part,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.870
because people wanted to.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.709
It was telling people, no, we
have enough stories already,

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.710
or no, we don't need
this story or that story.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.220
So getting people to
open up their hearts,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.189
open up their minds,
write about it,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.480
that was kind of the easy part.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.520
JESSE HAINES: What
were the common themes?

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.780
I know you categorized the
stories throughout the book.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.320
You kind of grouped them.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.250
But tell us a little
bit about some

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.170
of the themes that emerged
as you started to look across

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.040
all these fascinating tales.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.280
MARY SKAFIDAS: Well,
overwhelmingly there's hope.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.025
There's hope and courage,
and that comes across.

00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:01.900
Even though that there's
different chapters--

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.100
there is the fleers.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.120
There's the lovers.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.190
There is the survivors.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.940
Even as you look
across from them,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.990
they're leaving a place
for something better,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.014
and it takes a tremendous
amount of courage

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.680
to be able to leave
everything you know,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.100
even if it's not great,
and try to set up

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.890
a life in this new country.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.710
But I think we carve the
chapters up into themes,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.180
but really, a lot of the
stories would fit in any chapter

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.340
because I think the
common theme of hope,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.780
and bravery, and courage come
through in almost all of them.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.350
ANDREW TISCH: One
of the problems

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.190
we had early on was figuring out
how to divide up the chapters.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.782
So we thought about
doing it alphabetically.

00:05:46.782 --> 00:05:48.240
And then we realized,
well, we have

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.860
Alan Alda, and Arleen Alda,
and we have Ashok Amritraj,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.060
and Ahmed Ahmed.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.380
We had way too many AAs for 72,
so we couldn't do it that way.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.690
We couldn't do it
geographically,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.470
because you had Europe,
Africa, so you'd almost

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.170
be doing it racially,
which we didn't want to do.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.850
We couldn't do it
chronologically

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.460
because we had people
from the Mayflower,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.390
and people who came over--

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.420
we literally had one person
who wrote his essay on the day

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.840
that he was sworn
in as a US citizen.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.950
And we decided to do it--

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.117
MARY SKAFIDAS: Thematically.

00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:30.325
ANDREW TISCH: --thematically.

00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:31.980
We had people who
were coming over here

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.620
for opportunity, people
who are coming over here

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.610
for love, people who were coming
over here fleeing something.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.620
But I guess the common theme
was that people came over here

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.730
for opportunity, and
because they really

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.400
believed that there were
things here that they couldn't

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.860
get anywhere else in the world.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.980
And I'll take the
example of my family, who

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.210
came from [? Dniprovska, ?]
which was in Ukraine.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.706
And they could have just
as easily gone to Warsaw.

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:12.330
It probably would
have been much easier

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:18.030
to go to Warsaw, which had a
great Jewish community there

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.200
in 1905, and it would have
been a very safe choice.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.950
And they would have
been wiped out.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.630
And I would never have been
here after World War II.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:33.000
Somebody in my family,
probably my great grandfather,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.130
took a leap of faith,
heard that there

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.480
was something going on here
that was worth pursuing,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.110
and came here.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:46.950
And six months later, brought
his wife and their three

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.020
children, one of whom
was my grandfather.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.450
JESSE HAINES: Amazing.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.710
So, so powerful,
those crossroads.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.500
So who is this book for?

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.960
Who do you hope reads this book?

00:08:04.512 --> 00:08:06.470
MARY SKAFIDAS: Well, I
think we wanted to raise

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.330
awareness of the issue.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.060
And we wanted to do it in
a way that didn't alienate.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.030
I mean, right now there
are sides in immigration.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.560
We didn't want to
alienate either side.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.740
We really just wanted
to remind people

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.370
of what makes America great,
and that we're all immigrants.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.840
And I think we've been able to
accomplish that because we're

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.110
telling the personal
story of success,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.020
and it resonates with
everyone and with every group.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.309
ANDREW TISCH: The book
is completely apolitical.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:39.230
And we run the gamut from
Nancy Pelosi to Elaine Chao,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.450
from Cory Booker to Tim Scott.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.280
We have people on the left
and people on the right.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:52.200
Immigration itself really
is not a political issue,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.570
in most cases.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.660
There are a few
people for whom it is.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.570
There are Native Americans
who have been here,

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.580
and who have gotten
screwed, quite frankly.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.530
There are people who came
over here unwillingly, i.e.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.250
slaves.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:15.870
But for the most part, this
is not a political book.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:19.310
This is a book to
raise awareness that we

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.740
are a nation of immigrants.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.640
America and Israel are
probably the only countries

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.140
in the world that have been
created by and for immigrants.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.890
JESSE HAINES: Yes.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.270
Yes.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.760
It's not a political
book, but boy,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.770
is immigration a hot
political topic right now.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.080
So I want to kind of delve
into that a little bit.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.590
What do you think--

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.130
has the direction of
the political discourse

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.720
around immigration--

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.860
are we moving forward?

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.110
Are we moving backwards?

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.600
It is a hot topic.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.570
It is divisive.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.180
What is our status as a
nation today, in terms of,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.030
have we moved kind of backwards
or forwards in our ability

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:22.340
to talk about this
issue of immigration?

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.820
ANDREW TISCH: Well, we've
always been somewhat xenophobic

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.310
in this country.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.410
Last year was the
100th anniversary

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:36.440
of the Immigration Act
of 1918, which was also

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.390
known as the Asiatic Barred
Act, which basically barred most

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.980
Asians from coming to America
because people in California

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.350
thought there were
too many Asians here.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.700
And it was literally
impossible for an Asian woman

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.420
to get a visa to come
here because people wanted

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.570
the Asians that came here--

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.320
if they wanted to get
married-- to go back

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.920
to their native country
and get married, and not

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.120
stay in America.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.910
So we we've always been
somewhat xenophobic.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:16.820
We've always had negative
discourse about immigration.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.920
When people first
started coming in,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.230
when groups first
started coming in,

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.000
it's taken a generation
and generation and a half

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.650
for them to be accepted.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.050
So it's not that this is
the first time that we've

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.600
had terrible xenophobia.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.140
But what's going
on now is certainly

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.470
of great concern
to every one of us.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.050
MARY SKAFIDAS: In
pulling together

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.050
the stories for the book,
we studied the waves

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.125
of immigration because
we wanted to make sure

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:55.250
that we had enough stories
that were representative

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.730
of each wave.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.650
And you know, we quickly
came to the realization

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.350
that how we feel
about immigration

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.120
as a country is cyclical.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.620
And we happen to
be in a down cycle,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.000
but I think people realize
that the US absolutely

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.280
needs immigrants.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.650
Right?

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:18.560
40% of Fortune 500 companies
were founded by immigrants,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.367
or they were--

00:12:19.367 --> 00:12:21.200
ANDREW TISCH: Or the
children of immigrants.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.010
MARY SKAFIDAS: --the
children of immigrants.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:22.310
So--

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.690
JESSE HAINES: Including Google.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.260
ANDREW TISCH: Including Google.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:24.840
MARY SKAFIDAS: Right.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.340
Right.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.360
Right.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.940
So I think every
new group that comes

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.350
in, there's always this fear.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.850
And it takes a while
to get over it.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.770
But then there's the realization
that you need immigrants.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.610
We need immigrants.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.000
JESSE HAINES: Yeah.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.710
Let's talk about that
a little bit more.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.126
I mean, from your
standpoint, what

00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:41.090
are some of the economic
arguments for immigration?

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.086
Because I think that
also fuels the fear

00:12:45.086 --> 00:12:49.130
of things being taken away.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.340
But there's a pretty
strong economic rationale

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.670
for why immigration is--

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.045
ANDREW TISCH:
Well, first of all,

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:58.910
let's just take something
as simple as unemployment.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.770
We have basically
full employment

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.880
in the United States right now.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:10.260
We have 3.1%, 3.2% unemployment.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.660
That is full employment,
and anyone that wants a job

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.950
can probably get a job.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.790
Maybe not the best job
in the world, but we

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.960
need more people to be working.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.660
And we just don't
have enough people.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.250
Now, we have, in this
country, achieved ZPG, also.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.060
So if we want to change
the zero population growth,

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.690
that's going to take
about 20, 25 years.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.090
And we don't have the social
systems to run that many more

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.780
people through the schools,
so that's impractical.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.620
So we need immigrants.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.340
We need immigrants to come in.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.660
We also need immigrants because
we've got three Ponzi schemes

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.200
in Washington.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.065
We've got Medicare, Medicaid,
and Social Security.

00:13:58.065 --> 00:13:58.940
JESSE HAINES: Got it.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.616
Got it.

00:13:59.616 --> 00:14:01.490
ANDREW TISCH: And the
only way that they work

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:07.940
is if we get a broader and
broader population working

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.490
base to pay in, because
the three of them

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.920
are funded by
current dollars, not

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.590
by any kind of real trust fund.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.620
It's a game the government has
played, and everybody knows it,

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.950
and nobody's doing
anything about it.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.920
So we need immigration.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.340
We need immigrants just
as workers, number one.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:39.360
Number two, many immigrants take
jobs that nobody else will do.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.350
And it's a plain and
simple fact of life

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.380
that immigrants want to come
here and they want to work,

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.880
and they want to
work hard, and they

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.900
want to do whatever it takes.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.690
And oftentimes, they
end up with the jobs

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.630
that nobody else will take.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.420
So that's very important.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:04.240
And then you look at the
brains that stay here,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.250
and the number of
PhDs that come here.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.120
And you look at the
university systems.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.570
We have the greatest
university system in the world.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.690
Of the top 50 universities
in the world, 40 of them

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:21.970
are American universities
by the latest rankings.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:27.940
Boy, if I was running the
country, any foreigner that

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:33.280
got a PhD, I'd immediately
confiscate their passport,

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.600
and pull their--

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.550
and say, you got a PhD here.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.670
You got to work here
for X number of years.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.913
Because to give them an
eviction notice is insanity.

00:15:43.913 --> 00:15:44.704
JESSE HAINES: Yeah.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.720
And I'm not asking where
you stand on these issues,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.070
but why is immigration, at this
moment in time, so polarizing?

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:05.190
Why are we involved
in such heated debate

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.210
over the wall, the ban.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.810
Given that it's hard
to argue with, I think,

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:19.770
what this book makes so
clear, we are all immigrants.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:30.100
This country is founded
on values of openness

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:35.140
and embracing everyone from
gathering our huddled masses.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.465
Why has the dialogue around
immigration gotten so heated?

00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:43.840
ANDREW TISCH: Well let me let
me turn around and ask you,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.480
what are we not polarized on
in this country right now?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.779 --> 00:16:48.570
JESSE HAINES: True.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.070
True.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.700
ANDREW TISCH: We are living
in a political environment

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.000
where everything
is being polarized.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.190
And that gets into a broader
question of leadership,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:09.190
but I think it's going to take a
while for the pendulum to swing

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.420
back to more cooperation.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.220
A lot of the things
I'm doing in Washington

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.660
involve trying to reestablish
some sort of decorum

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.454
and ability to work
across the aisles.

00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:25.579
JESSE HAINES: That's great.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.829
That's great.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:30.190
What changes would you make
in our current immigration

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:35.220
policy, were you to be able
to wave your magic wand?

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.920
ANDREW TISCH: You
want to start that?

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.430
MARY SKAFIDAS: Sure.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.980
I think Andrew actually
outlined a number of them.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.910
And obviously, we are not
immigration policy experts,

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.800
nor do we play
one on television.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.200
And this is not a question that
we typically want to answer.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.250
I mean, the focus of this was
really to raise awareness.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:02.380
But I think the realization
that we need immigrants,

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.380
that we are pushing a
lot of the brain power

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.480
that we educate out
of the country--

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.930
should it be based on skill?

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.230
Should it be based on family
members bringing more family

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.160
members over?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.620
I think those are
valid questions.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.920
And if they could be done in a
way that wasn't so sensational

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.950
and just on social
media only, I think

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.650
these are valid questions
that we should ask ourselves,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.640
and would help the
country move forward.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.320
ANDREW TISCH: And things
like DACA-- that's insanity.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.570
What are we going to do,
send people back to a country

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.120
that they've never been to?

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.470
It's insanity.

00:18:48.975 --> 00:18:51.100
MARY SKAFIDAS: Google was
one of the companies that

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.210
was very outspoken about
the need for immigration,

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.750
and the importance of being
able to bring people here

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.280
from other countries to be
able to work for Google.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.340
Have you guys talked
about this internally?

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.590
Does this come up in meetings?

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.160
JESSE HAINES: I mean, yes.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.300
And we can get the
group involved in this.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.375
Googlers are
opinionated and not shy.

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:20.270
A lot of the discourse goes
on, I think, face-to-face,

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.200
but also there's a
number of online places

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.730
where Google can discuss
and get into the issues.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.887
I know that Sundar
has spoken out--

00:19:31.887 --> 00:19:33.220
MARY SKAFIDAS: Very vocal, yeah.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:38.500
JESSE HAINES: --on
immigration, and has personally

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.415
committed funds to
support certain issues.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.785
And maybe there's
folks in the room

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:47.910
who can speak more to this.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:54.730
I also read that Larry
and Sergey, our founders,

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.930
are also immigrants.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.940
And I came across an
article that was critical,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.270
actually, of Larry in
particular for being

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.370
quieter on immigration.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:13.150
So I think Google demands
a lot of its leadership

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.100
when it comes to these issues.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.720
MARY SKAFIDAS: But
I think companies

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.930
being vocal about this is going
to be one of the things that's

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.640
going to help turn the tide.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.557
I mean, John Tish, who
heads up the Lowe's Hotels--

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.640
he's very outspoken about
this because of the need

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.930
for immigrants, especially when
you have a large hotel company

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.930
that you need to
staff seasonally.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.540
And it's become
something that's been

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.510
very troublesome, especially
for the travel and tourism

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.309
industry.

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:42.100
JESSE HAINES: Yeah.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.330
Have you seen other corporations
or business leaders sort

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:51.580
of really stepping out on
this topic in ways that have

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.587
been meaningful and impactful?

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.670
ANDREW TISCH: We're starting
to see more and more.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.300
The Chamber of
Commerce is starting

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.990
to get more vocal about it.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:05.690
And you're starting
to hear more people.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.540
And I think as the
labor pool tightens up,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.220
you'll hear more and more
senior executives, who

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.565
can't get the right
people, comment about it.

00:21:17.565 --> 00:21:19.990
JESSE HAINES: Right.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.760
So I want to give
the Googlers a chance

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.880
to start asking some questions.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.330
So start thinking of your
questions, and we have mics.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.070
But just getting
back to the stories,

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:37.790
I am curious what your
favorite one or ones are.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.520
And I hope this isn't
like asking you to pick

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.780
your favorite child--
probably a little bit--

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.004
and why.

00:21:45.004 --> 00:21:46.170
MARY SKAFIDAS: I have three.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.690
JESSE HAINES: And maybe
you could tell the group--

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.260
MARY SKAFIDAS: I have three.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.500
I have three because
I like a lot of them.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.780
But I'm going to pick
three from people

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.460
you probably haven't heard of.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.680
One is Eric Mezza.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.210
There's a chapter
in the back that's

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:03.530
undocumented-- focuses on
undocumented immigrants,

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:04.700
and my aunt was one of them.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.680
You know, she took
the job nobody wanted.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.640
She worked in the
garment industry.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.660
She matched collars to
jackets for pennies a collar.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.985
But she saved a lot
of what she made,

00:22:17.985 --> 00:22:20.360
and she was able to put me
and my cousin through college,

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.901
so we have no student
loans, which is

00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:25.490
amazing on what she had made.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.610
But there's two stories.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.240
One is Juliana Perez.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.460
She had DACA status.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.830
She just graduated from
Georgetown Law School

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.950
and is now an
immigration lawyer.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.460
When the book was published,
she had just passed her bar,

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.330
so she was very
excited about that.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.970
And that is a tremendous story.

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.795
Then there's Eric Mezza who is a
junior in Harvard now, I think?

00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:54.920
ANDREW TISCH: No, a senior.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.390
MARY SKAFIDAS:
Senior in Harvard.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.820
Brilliant, brilliant
mathematical mind.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.460
But his parents were
migrant workers.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.920
They would pick oranges in
Florida, then move to Michigan

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.880
and back.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.212
And a nonprofit organization
kind of saw him,

00:23:09.212 --> 00:23:11.420
saw his grades, and was able
to kind of pluck him out

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.270
of the crowd and help
him get to Harvard.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.720
And then the last
one is Ahmed Ahmed.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.530
I think he was born in
a Somali refugee camp.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.850
He moved here when he was
about a couple of years old.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.530
He ended up going to Cornell.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.245
He's now in Oxford, right?

00:23:30.245 --> 00:23:31.910
A Rhodes scholar.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.450
And it's just the
thing that resonates

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.910
with me is, his parents had a
privileged life where he lived.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.302
And his mother's now raising
her family basically in tents.

00:23:44.302 --> 00:23:46.010
And when they moved
to the United States,

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.030
they had nothing.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.820
But she views this as
the best day of her life

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.790
because they were able
to start fresh, and not

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.530
be worried about men
with machine guns

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.450
coming and taking their
family members away.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.962
So those are the three for me.

00:24:00.962 --> 00:24:02.420
ANDREW TISCH: I
think I'll pick out

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:09.360
two I'll pick Ryan Platt, who
is now a sophomore at Cornell.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.398
And those are the
only two Cornell--

00:24:12.398 --> 00:24:13.850
MARY SKAFIDAS: That's not true.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:21.110
ANDREW TISCH: But Ryan is the
daughter of a single mother.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.230
She's adopted from
a Chinese orphanage.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:30.260
And when she went back to China
to see the orphanage from where

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.700
she came, she tells
the story about walking

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.160
into the orphanage
and seeing all

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:44.490
these little Chinese
babies, all girls.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:48.230
And she said she had a
very tough time identifying

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.810
with them because
every time she looks

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.050
in the mirror in the morning,
she sees an American girl.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:04.280
And it just stuck with me
that her identity is American.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:10.430
And I guess the other one
is Stephanie Murphy, who

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:15.291
was a Vietnamese boat
person who left as a--

00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:16.790
MARY SKAFIDAS: Which
you got to love

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.482
with a last name
like Murphy, right?

00:25:18.482 --> 00:25:21.260
JESSE HAINES: I know, I'm like--

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.230
ANDREW TISCH: And
her family left

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.500
Vietnam when it was taken over.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.690
And they got marooned
on the South China Sea.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.810
The engine broke down,
and they were adrift,

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.130
and they got picked
up by the US Navy,

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.100
refuelled, fixed the engine,
pointed them towards Malaysia.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:50.540
And Stephanie is, today, a
Congresswoman from Orlando.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.230
So those are the
ones that I like.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:26:02.540
I love Angela Buchwald, who's
a Korean-born rabbi at Central

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.460
Synagogue.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.660
Cory Booker's essay is great.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.910
Every one of them has
something in there

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.670
that people will
find interesting.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.590
And some are more
interesting than others.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:27.770
I love Pete Gogolak's Pete
Gogolak was a football player.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.020
They came over from Hungary.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.730
And he changed the
world twice, actually,

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.900
because he and his brother
couldn't figure out

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.050
how to kick a football.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.596
They kicked it
sideways, not forward.

00:26:41.596 --> 00:26:42.720
JESSE HAINES: Soccer-style.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.530
ANDREW TISCH: And became the
first soccer-style kickers.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:52.560
And then Pete was drafted by the
New York Giants and the Buffalo

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.640
Bills, and started kicking
for the Buffalo Bills.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.230
And the New York
Giants hired him away

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.500
for a bonus of $90,000.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.580
And the uproar was so great
that it led to the merger talks

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.630
between the American
Football League and the NFL.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.631
So he changed the word twice.

00:27:14.631 --> 00:27:17.130
The way we kick the football,
and the way we watch football.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.463
JESSE HAINES: I love that story.

00:27:18.463 --> 00:27:20.790
I love that story.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.270
There are so many good ones.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:22.770
OK.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.190
Let's open up the
mics to questions.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.890
Go for it.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:27.834
AUDIENCE: Am I first?

00:27:27.834 --> 00:27:28.750
JESSE HAINES: You are.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.291
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:30.360
My name is Bjorn.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.710
I am from Denmark.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:36.090
I have lived in this country
now for 20 years, this month.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.300
And I also have a PhD.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.470
You mentioned that.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.870
I have that from this country.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.380
And very much agree, by
the way, that instead

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.880
of trying to kick
us out afterwards,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.460
you should try to keep us.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.400
I managed to do that.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.944
And I am looking at citizenship
in a couple of years.

00:27:51.944 --> 00:27:54.080
I am also white--

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.380
very.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.680
And I want to say--

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.480
and ask what you
think, obviously--

00:28:05.815 --> 00:28:07.440
and I should also
say, politically, I'm

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.720
as left-leaning as
you get probably, OK?

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.729
In terms of immigration, at
least, and many more things.

00:28:12.729 --> 00:28:14.520
But I don't actually
think it's very useful

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.520
to say that we are
all immigrants,

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.070
because if you go out in
Pennsylvania in a mining city,

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.920
or whatever they're called,
you will have people

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.550
who are white like me and
who have no identity of being

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.100
immigrants.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.600
That is to say, no one who
is alive in that family

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.600
are actually immigrants.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.660
No one's direct immigrants.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.720
They didn't came here.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.636
They didn't come here.

00:28:37.636 --> 00:28:39.160
They were born here.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.910
And so to someone
like them, especially

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.510
a lot of Trump voters, we
know, it is not the same

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.580
as saying, here's a Danish guy.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.920
Let him come over, get
a PhD, learn a lot,

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.474
and then contribute
to this society.

00:28:52.474 --> 00:28:54.390
That's not the same as
the kinds of immigrants

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.370
that we all know that Trump and
his followers are afraid of.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.370
And so calling them all
immigrants I don't think

00:28:59.370 --> 00:28:59.870
is useful.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.470
What do you think?

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.750
ANDREW TISCH: OK.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:12.250
My feeling is, we have
essays here from Mayo Stuntz.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:16.520
Part of his family came
over as Hessian soldiers

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.702
in the Revolutionary
War, and that's

00:29:18.702 --> 00:29:19.910
the young part of the family.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.660
The older part of the
family came over along

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.030
about the Mayflower.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:32.400
And they recognize that they
came from somewhere else.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.160
Maybe they're not
immigrants this generation

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.410
or this past generation

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.370
But at some point,
everyone's going

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.880
to have to admit they came
over from somewhere else,

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.890
unless their last
name is Thundercloud.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:57.350
And I think that that's
the reality of it.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:01.490
Now if they don't want to
be reminded of it, fine.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:06.855
I don't mind offending them,
if that's how they feel.

00:30:06.855 --> 00:30:09.230
MARY SKAFIDAS: But I think
you make a good point, though,

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:17.000
because some would say
the stagnation in parts

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
of Pennsylvania is
what kind of tipped--

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.190
even though we have
a great economy,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.870
and there's low
unemployment, there's

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:28.970
a lot of stagnant employment,
or no wage increases, which

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.770
has motivated a
lot of the country

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.750
to want to believe
what Trump was saying,

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.930
at least when the
election was going on.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.370
And I read "Hillbilly Elegy."

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:38.810
I'm sure there are
a lot of people

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.560
that read it in this room,
which kind explained it to me.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.850
But the point of
this wasn't to argue

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:49.250
with that particular person
who we may or may not

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.520
be able to change their
mind, but for there

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.240
to be an awareness that
their forefamily started

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.990
the same way.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.370
The book is not going to
solve all the problems.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:06.100
But I think as the
immigration debate goes,

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.000
this is one of the things
that has not been polarizing.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.310
It has actually been unifying.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.840
We need many more
things like that.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:19.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.210
My name's Jenny Johnson.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.140
And Andrew, I wanted to ask
you, since you're so involved

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.150
in New York City,
and New York City

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.630
is a city that has been
founded on immigrants,

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:36.270
do you see cities serving a
role in facilitating immigration

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:41.600
beyond the connection to
Washington and the government?

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.830
ANDREW TISCH: Absolutely.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.200
I believe that,
first of all, cities

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.790
are where the immigrants
generally start out.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:55.530
And the services that the
cities are going to provide

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.130
are going to be
very, very important.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:03.300
My wife, Ann, who is
sitting right behind you,

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:09.450
is an educator and
has school in Astoria,

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:16.560
where they teach people from,
what, 67 different countries?

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.590
Who are immigrants from
67 different countries.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:26.290
You don't get that
in too many places.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:32.520
So I think the cities are the
places where the immigrants

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.650
tend to go to first.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:41.670
And they have the social systems
that are there to help them.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:45.690
And in the old days,
the social systems

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.760
were by the
immigrants themselves,

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.970
or by the descendants
of the immigrants.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:54.250
So the Irish helped the Irish,
and the Jews helped the Jews,

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.149
and the Italians
helped the Italians.

00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:58.065
MARY SKAFIDAS: And the
religious institutions.

00:32:58.065 --> 00:33:00.800
ANDREW TISCH: And the religious
institutions were and are--

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.470
MARY SKAFIDAS: Very, yeah.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.290
ANDREW TISCH: --very important.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:09.540
So I think cities,
all municipalities,

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:15.960
we want to make it as easy
as possible for people

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:22.050
to come and become productive
members of society.

00:33:25.272 --> 00:33:27.657
JESSE HAINES: Thank you.

00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:28.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.620
AUDIENCE: My name's
Hannah Bradheim.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.400
I'm the granddaughter of
one of that people who

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.710
wrote in the book, and the
great granddaughter of one

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.380
of the people in the book.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.480
JESSE HAINES: Wow.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.950
AUDIENCE: So I'm Morris Turritz'
great granddaughter, who's

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.640
one of the people in the book.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.100
So for me, it was great to
be able to read from the book

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:44.600
and see--

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.210
I knew my great grandfather's
last name was [? Turritz. ?]

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.920
I had not known his first name.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.570
I knew he was from Lithuania.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.300
I didn't know where in
Lithuania he was from.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.870
So I was wondering, for the
people who worked on the book

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.570
and wrote in the book, how much
of it was a discovery for them,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.720
for yourselves also
included parts in it?

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.490
Did you find a lot
of the people writing

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.698
different chapters learned
a lot of different things?

00:34:06.698 --> 00:34:10.320
Were they sort of of interesting
or unusual things that came up?

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.199
MARY SKAFIDAS: Yeah.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.600
We stopped writing the stories
ourselves because people

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.250
hadn't done their homework.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.940
So when they had to write
the stories themselves,

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.699
they said they started
talking to family members

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:25.760
because someone always has
the aunt or the uncle that

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.100
has kept track of
everything in a notebook.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.130
They started to do some
research on their own.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.620
They discovered things.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.620
The family always believed
this, but then this was true.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:43.580
And I think it was
engaging for them.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.415
They were energized by it.

00:34:47.415 --> 00:34:49.790
Every couple of weeks, they
would say, oh, we found this.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:50.480
Can we add this?

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.770
Is it too late?

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.929
I think there were very
few people that we asked

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.230
that actually turned us down.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.563
And a number of them were
either writing their own book,

00:34:57.563 --> 00:35:01.380
or had completely lost
touch with history,

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.250
to the gentleman's point that he
was saying before you, just had

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.890
forgotten their family history.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.480
But I think of the
majority of the people

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.130
that we had asked
were so energized

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:11.700
to be able to
participate in this,

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:15.320
and really kind of used
this as a research project

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.310
for their own lineage.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.950
ANDREW TISCH: I'll
tell you my story.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.870
Our family lore was that we
came from [? Dniprovska ?]

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:25.580
in the Ukraine.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:31.670
And everybody thought that
in 1904, the entire family

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.440
went to Odessa.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.470
And half the family turned
left and went to Tashkent,

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.680
and the other half of the family
turned right and came here.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.060
And so when I was
doing the research,

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:50.090
I went to Ellis Island, and
they found the ship's manifest

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:54.110
that had my grandfather's
name on it in March of 1904,

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.210
and the ship was from Hamburg.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:01.850
Now, there was no way you could
go from Odessa to Hamburg.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.480
You really had to go, if you
were going from Dniprovska,

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.360
directly to Hamburg.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.820
So they probably took
a train to Hamburg.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.660
And we surmised that
there was some feeling

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:21.390
that they were in peril because
of recent pogroms in Russia.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:25.000
But the family went to Hamburg.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.580
My great grandfather
came over here in March.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.390
And then six months later,
my great grandmother

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.570
and her three children, one
of whom was my grandfather,

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:40.040
came over to join my
grandfather after he scouted out

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.950
and found a place
for them to live.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:48.470
So the whole idea that half
the family went to Tashkent

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:53.425
after we all went to Odessa
kind of went out the window.

00:36:53.425 --> 00:36:57.680
But doing the research
was a lot of fun,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:04.010
and it connected me with
a couple of relatives who

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.670
still remember what's going on.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:10.130
I am now pretty much in
touch with some of them

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.102
pretty regularly.

00:37:11.102 --> 00:37:12.560
MARY SKAFIDAS: Did
you love reading

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.540
about your family's history?

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.330
Was there a lot--

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.330
I mean, you didn't even know
your grandfather's first name,

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:17.926
right?

00:37:17.926 --> 00:37:18.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.390
It was fun.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.930
Every once in a while,
members of my family

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.594
have the same
Facebook post they do,

00:37:24.594 --> 00:37:27.426
because my great grandfather
had [INAUDIBLE] business,

00:37:27.426 --> 00:37:28.842
and [INAUDIBLE] granite.

00:37:28.842 --> 00:37:32.500
So that was the sum
total of what I knew.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.497
My grandfather, Joseph
Boward-- he found a bunch more

00:37:35.497 --> 00:37:36.372
information in there.

00:37:36.372 --> 00:37:38.530
And then recent, I
was in his basement,

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.826
and I found a bunch more
information about other things

00:37:40.826 --> 00:37:42.690
that I think he probably
dug out recently,

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.954
and that's why they were on top.

00:37:44.954 --> 00:37:46.370
ANDREW TISCH: And
your grandfather

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.732
was a professor of mine
in business school.

00:37:49.732 --> 00:37:50.482
JESSE HAINES: Wow.

00:37:50.482 --> 00:37:52.702
That's cool.

00:37:52.702 --> 00:37:53.610
Other questions?

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.889
Hi.

00:37:54.889 --> 00:37:55.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:56.763
Good afternoon, Andrew and Mary.

00:37:56.763 --> 00:37:59.240
Thank you for being
here this afternoon.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.240
So some of the more
sensational stories

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.065
that have animated new
activism amongst Googlers

00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:07.190
and young people everywhere,
and really just almost

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.170
any citizen--

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:13.162
border separations, the wall,
immigration bands, et cetera--

00:38:13.162 --> 00:38:14.870
they bring to mind
this question of, what

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:17.120
can we be doing, as
people of some privilege,

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.820
to give our leaders a little
bit more courage to address

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.920
the systemic issues that
underlie these outcomes

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.790
that we've seen in recent news?

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:29.365
What is your advice on
addressing those people,

00:38:29.365 --> 00:38:32.210
or participating as a
citizen, not just an observer?

00:38:36.225 --> 00:38:38.350
ANDREW TISCH: I'm a big
one for political activism.

00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:45.940
I would just say, vote.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.760
Most important thing
you can do is vote.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:54.220
Even if you think your vote
doesn't count, it counts.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.660
People read it.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.740
And I don't think
I've missed voting

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.740
since I was 21 years old.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.110
I even vote by
absentee ballot, just

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:10.550
to make sure that I'm
not going to miss it.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.740
But then, I've gotten
involved politically

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.440
in initiatives that I
find very important.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.270
One of the initiatives
I'm involved in

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.200
is the US Global
Leadership Coalition,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.160
which its sole purpose
is to keep foreign aid

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.990
in the federal budget.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.920
Foreign aid being 6/10 of
1% of the federal budget.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.906
But there's always some
idiot congressman who says,

00:39:37.906 --> 00:39:39.280
if we can just
cut out government

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.369
waste and foreign aid, then
we can balance the budget.

00:39:43.369 --> 00:39:45.160
Forget that we're
running a trillion dollar

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:51.190
deficit this year, and every
year as far as we can see.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:56.260
But get involved
and express yourself

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.080
because there's a
lot of things that

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:05.560
have to be done to get this
country, in my opinion,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.354
moving in the right direction.

00:40:07.354 --> 00:40:08.020
This country's--

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.390
MARY SKAFIDAS: I want to test
Andrew's memory for a second.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.310
And he's known for [INAUDIBLE]
for not forgetting anything.

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.537
You know, 50 years ago,
we signed this contract

00:40:17.537 --> 00:40:19.120
and that's what the
contract will say.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.860
But when he was in Monticello
giving the commencement

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.090
address, you had top
10 things that people

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.580
should do to get
involved that they loved.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:35.100
One of them was vote,
friends with your neighbor--

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.300
ANDREW TISCH: Make friends
with your neighbor.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.220
Visit America's sites.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.790
Go see the Statue of Liberty,
and the Liberty Bell,

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.650
and the Grand Canyon.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.650
MARY SKAFIDAS: Yes, activism.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.680
ANDREW TISCH: The big
thing is get involved.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.263
MARY SKAFIDAS: How
much of us actually

00:40:52.263 --> 00:40:54.850
spend times being American, and
celebrating America, and going

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.600
to the Grand Canyon, or making
friends with our neighbors,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.900
or getting involved locally?

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:07.750
Even if it won't give us any
grandeur on social media.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.920
And there were 10 things that
were really well received

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.680
by the new citizens, and
the existing citizens,

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.480
in the swearing-in ceremony.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.470
ANDREW TISCH: One of
the things, if you ever

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.410
have the opportunity
to do it, go

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.140
visit a swearing-in ceremony.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.440
Go attend a swearing-in
ceremony where

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.910
you get to meet new
citizens, and find out

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:35.797
how important being an
American is to them.

00:41:35.797 --> 00:41:38.380
MARY SKAFIDAS: If we could make
that a requirement for elected

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.840
officials, we would be having
a different conversation.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.381
JESSE HAINES: Is that something
that you need to get invited?

00:41:43.381 --> 00:41:45.070
How does one do that?

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:46.745
ANDREW TISCH: We
have to find a way.

00:41:46.745 --> 00:41:48.060
JESSE HAINES: So you
can't just show up.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:48.726
You can't just--

00:41:48.726 --> 00:41:49.710
ANDREW TISCH: You can.

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:50.230
A lot of them--

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.563
JESSE HAINES: --invite yourself.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.690
ANDREW TISCH:
Monticello, on July 4th

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.360
they have a swearing-in.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.430
I was fortunate
enough, Mary and I

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.890
were asked to be in attendance.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.959
And I gave a keynote address.

00:42:05.959 --> 00:42:07.750
MARY SKAFIDAS: That
one you can show up to.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:08.572
It's huge.

00:42:08.572 --> 00:42:09.280
JESSE HAINES: OK.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.380
ANDREW TISCH: There were
67 new immigrants who

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.650
were sworn in as new citizens.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.610
And there were, what--

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:17.485
MARY SKAFIDAS: 3,000.

00:42:17.485 --> 00:42:18.810
ANDREW TISCH: --3,000
people were there?

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:19.930
MARY SKAFIDAS: Yeah.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:21.011
It's hot.

00:42:21.011 --> 00:42:21.760
Bring an umbrella.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.970
But it was a
wonderful experience.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.990
And like Andrew
was saying, if this

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:28.720
was a requirement for
elected officials,

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.490
it would help change
the conversation.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:31.894
I think he's right.

00:42:31.894 --> 00:42:33.310
AUDIENCE: Someone
asked a question

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:38.020
about New York City and state
having many social programs

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:42.940
to help immigrants, and also
you can get free legal advice,

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.330
and so on.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.610
And I was actually
wondering, is it

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.180
all in New York City and
state who's doing it?

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.240
Or were more states
in the United States

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.690
who are also involved in
doing programs like that?

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.120
MARY SKAFIDAS: Well, just
from the stories in the book,

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.160
Ahmed Ahmed--

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.230
his family was sent to Michigan.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.290
And they had built-in programs.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.227
I don't know if it was provided
by the city or the state.

00:43:09.227 --> 00:43:11.060
It could have been a
nonprofit organization.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.830
But they helped them
find an apartment.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.480
They helped his
parents find a job.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.700
They helped them
register for school.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.750
I think more urban settings
are probably easier,

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:24.410
but there is Columbus,
Ohio, for instance.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:28.250
Actually, their mayor says,
we are open to immigrants

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.200
because they need them.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.170
They have plants there that
they can't find enough employees

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.990
for, so he was covered
in New York Magazine,

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:38.600
just maybe a year
ago, for setting up

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:45.680
this very pro-immigrant
city that attracted.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.180
And he actually
would raise his hand

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.390
and say, yes, I would like how
ever many new immigrants are

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.090
coming over this month.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.110
And they worked at
the sausage factory.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:56.840
There were different other
factories and plants there.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.390
But it's one of the
things that helped

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:03.422
their economy recover faster
than other parts of Ohio.

00:44:03.422 --> 00:44:04.130
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:05.000
MARY SKAFIDAS: Yeah.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.520
My cousin, actually,
is an American citizen.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.520
He lived for Greece
for a number of years.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.480
He's a mechanical engineer
and he just moved back here

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.000
a year ago.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.480
And there were great
systems in place.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.580
He's a citizen, but his
wife and his son aren't.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.780
There are great
systems in place,

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.720
free of charge in New York,
that helped him kind of settle

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.389
his family and assimilate.

00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:30.680
And the amazing thing is--
he's a mechanical engineer--

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.260
so within three weeks,
he had three job offers.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.940
AUDIENCE: Are your
stories in this book?

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:43.863
And how did they influence the
way you approached this book?

00:44:43.863 --> 00:44:45.910
MARY SKAFIDAS: Well, his
story started it all.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:47.165
It was the research.

00:44:47.165 --> 00:44:48.380
Go ahead.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.130
ANDREW TISCH: Yes.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.110
Yes, indeed, our
stories are in the book.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:55.340
And when we send out
the request to people,

00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.170
we led with our chins in that
we sent our stories to them

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:03.920
to say, we're willing to
put our stories in the book.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.390
We hope that you will join us.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:14.960
And we had very few turndowns
from people because they were

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.290
excited to be part of this.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:20.390
And one of the things
you'll find in the book

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:26.930
is that the last
eight pages are blank.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.450
And they're just lined
so that you can write

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.820
your story into your book.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.770
We also give you the
opportunity to go

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:38.780
to
www.journeysanamericanstory.com,

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:44.470
and put your story
onto our website,

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.700
so that there are
additional stories

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:51.860
on the website of people
whose stories came in too

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.260
late to make publication.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:59.660
So we're anxious that
people tell the stories

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:05.070
because the more
they talk about it,

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:11.120
the more we believe
people will remember

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:16.070
that we are all, as Americans,
from somewhere else.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:20.372
But we're here as Americans,
and we're here together

00:46:20.372 --> 00:46:22.830
JESSE HAINES: I think that's
a really great note to end on.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.220
Thank you again for being here.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.790
Thank you for creating this
book, for sharing your stories,

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.320
for sharing the stories
of so many others.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.280
And I hope you guys will
share your stories, maybe

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.160
by hand, maybe on the website.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.900
And thank you for
being here today.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.300
MARY SKAFIDAS: Thank you.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:37.850
ANDREW TISCH: Thank
you very much.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.400
MARY SKAFIDAS: Thank you.
