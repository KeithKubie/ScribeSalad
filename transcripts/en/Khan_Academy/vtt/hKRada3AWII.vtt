00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.190
- [Kim] Hey this is Kim from Khan Academy

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.730
and today I'm learning about Article IV

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.480
of the U.S. Constitution.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.370
Article IV lays out the nuts and bolts

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.060
of how federalism, the
system of shared governance

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.860
between the states and
the federal government

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.180
works in practice.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.590
Article IV has four sections.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.550
The first two,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.280
the Full Faith and Credit clause

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.040
and the Privileges and Immunities clause

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.590
talk about how states will

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.590
treat each other's citizens

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.550
as well as they treat the
citizens of their own states.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.770
Then the third section,
is an admissions clause

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.540
discussing how new states
will be added to the union

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.800
and the fourth section
is the guarantee clause,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.940
which guarantees every state in the union

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.940
a republican form of government.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.480
To learn more about Article IV,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.560
I sought out the help of two experts.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.410
Erin Hawley is an
associate professor of Law

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.910
at the University of Missouri.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.120
Her scholarship focuses
on the federal courts

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.540
and she teaches constitutional litigation,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.820
tax policy and agricultural law.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.850
Professor Gabriel Chin is the
director of clinical legal

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.440
education at the UC Davis School of Law.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.020
He's a teacher and scholar
of immigration law,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.280
criminal procedure and race and law.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.100
So professor Hawley can
take us a little bit

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.190
through why the framers
included Article IV.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.010
What was its purpose?

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.580
- [Erin] The founders of the Constitution

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.100
were very concerned

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.600
that the federal government
be one of limited powers

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.760
and because of that they saw the states

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.260
as having an active and critical role

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.890
in placing a check on
the federal government.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.500
So we've got the three
branches and their own checks

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.714
and balances and then we've
got the federal government

00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:36.570
and the state government
also playing a role

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.390
in checking and balancing each other.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.150
They wanted to establish a
strong central government

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.540
but also to ensure that it
didn't have too much power

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.930
and the states were
critical to this effort.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.940
Also, they very much wanted
the states to act collectively

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.750
not individually.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.870
As you'll recall,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.750
the states had not been doing so well

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.760
under the loose articles
of the confederation.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.740
They've sort of being going it
alone on critical issues like

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.870
trade and defense as to
the detriment of the union.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.940
So Article IV is also a
sort of key to making sure

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.360
that the states act sort
of as a unified whole

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.220
rather than going it alone.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.970
- [Gabriel] It's one country
made up of diverse states.

00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:17.480
And if you prefer the way things are done

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.710
in Nevada

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.880
you can move there.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.570
And if you think that some
other state has a better set of

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.581
answers to

00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:29.330
the problems of modern life,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.930
you can move.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.530
What the Full Faith In Credit clause,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.250
and the Privileges and Immunities clause

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.040
are designed to do is to facilitate

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.700
transactions, to facilitate moving,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.740
to facilitate

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.950
communications and commerce

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.180
and trade and travel among the states.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.230
But that doesn't mean that what's going on

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.080
in each of the states can't
be very, very different.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.540
- [Kim] We often think of checks

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420
and balances as being something

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.550
that was designed to
be kind of horizontal.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.520
That the legislature
and the executive branch

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.210
and the judicial branch kind of all

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.820
at the same level checking each other.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.850
But there is also kind of this
vertical checks and balances

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.460
happening too between the power
of the federal government,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.470
power of the states and the
power of the local governments.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.910
- [Erin] Absolutely so we've
got the three branches,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.040
and their checks and balances.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.670
We also have a strong central government,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.410
that's checked in large part
by strong independent sovereign

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.500
governments in each of the 50 states.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.690
And these states traditionally
have what are known

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.140
as police powers so they have
a lot of inherent authority

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.320
to govern the people in those states,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.220
subject to federal law.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.070
But it really does sort
of place a check on

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.210
federal authority and I
think this is precisely

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.770
what the framers wanted
because they did want

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.800
a strong government,
but they also were very

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.390
much of the view that
states were important.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.700
That their own states we're important

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.250
and they didn't want to lose
that in the new constitution

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.690
and new federal government.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.210
- [Kim] There are four
sections in Article IV

00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:04.790
and the first section deals
with full faith and credit,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.090
it says full faith and
credit shall be given

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.240
in each state to the public Acts, Records

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.030
and Judicial proceedings
of every other state.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.230
So what does full faith
and credit actually mean?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.550
- [Gabriel] It's designed
to make in a certain sense,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.510
all of the states of the United States

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.110
part of a single system.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.280
And so, full faith and credit means

00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:29.330
that a court judgment
for example in one state

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.020
will be recognized in every state.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.470
- [Erin] So if you have a value judgment

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.170
in New York for example,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.900
and you move to California,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.380
the California courts are
required to give effect to

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.129
that judgment, to that same court judgment

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.950
so long as it was validly issued.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.370
There was a federal statue known as

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.700
The Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.950
that was passed under president Clinton,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.300
and recently the Supreme
Court struck that down

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.100
as unconstitutional.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.950
So now under full faith and
credit, if you're married

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.077
in one state you're married
in another state as well.

00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:02.046
- [Gabriel] You can see the kinds

00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:03.471
of problems that would exist if

00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:08.160
states didn't honor the
legal decision that were made

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.910
by other states such as who is married

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:14.110
or who is divorced

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.700
or who owns a particular piece of property

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:20.810
or whether a particular child

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.320
is going to be in the
custody of one parent

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.880
rather than another.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.440
And the full faith and credit clause

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.690
is designed to say, in order for

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.920
our system to work

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.760
as a unified whole,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.250
while it's true that the courts of Georgia

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.240
are distinct from the
courts of New York, etc.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.580
They're separate systems,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.310
but they have to treat the work

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.740
that each other does with respect.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.430
- [Kim] If we move onto section II.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.950
This says that the citizens of each state

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.220
shall be entitled to all
privileges and immunities

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.350
of citizens in the several states.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.670
So what are these
privileges and immunities?

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.950
- [Erin] So the privileges
and immunities clause

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.800
has been one that's subject to a number of

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.660
sort of debates in the courts,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.860
in the academic literature.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.470
But basically privileges and immunities

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.040
have been construed to
be those sorts of things

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.900
that would go with citizenship.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.930
So the right to travel for example,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.260
is a privilege and immunity.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.010
Those sorts of things.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.000
- [Gabriel] Occasionally
in American history

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.930
there have been moments where states

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.320
didn't want to let citizens
of other states come through.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.310
So during the depression there
was an effort by some states

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.170
to limit the migration

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.670
of people from out of state to in-state.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.360
And the Supreme Court said,
that's not permissible.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.700
It also protects the right to travel.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.240
In 1999 the Supreme Court

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.060
dealt with a case called Saenz v. Roe.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.080
And what that case was
about is that California

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.400
had relatively generous welfare benefits.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.220
And California wanted to set up its law

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.100
in such a way that it
wouldn't encourage people

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.380
from other states to move to California

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.060
just to get the welfare benefits.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.150
So what they did is,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.120
they said that if you
don't live in California.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.650
If you're moving from out of state

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.160
and you apply for welfare benefits

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.330
then we're going to give
you the welfare benefits

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.870
that you would have gotten in
your state for the first year.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.470
We're not going to give you
the higher California benefits.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.080
We're going to give you
whatever you would of gotten

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.640
where you came from.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.980
That's unconstitutional
and the Supreme Court

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.400
said that violates the
privileges and immunities clause.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.760
We're one country.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.080
One nation.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.490
People are allowed to cross
the borders whenever they want.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.330
- [Kim] Interesting but there
is this second part of it

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.190
that says no person
held to service or labor

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.140
in one state, under the laws
thereof, escaping into another,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.570
shall, in consequence, of
any law or regulation therein

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.580
be discharged from service or labor.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.970
So what is that all about?

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.520
- [Erin] So that is one
of the most unfortunate,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.600
probably the most unfortunate clauses

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.570
in our Constitution,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.320
it's known as the fugitive slave clause

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.610
and that title is pretty descriptive.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.850
So if you have a slave
who is validly owned

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.690
as it were in those days,
under one state's law

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.330
and that person escaped to a free state

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.170
this clause gave the owner the right to

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.190
reclaim that slave and put them back

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.260
into sort of ownership in their own state.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.010
- [Gabriel] It is a sneaky
way of talking about slavery

00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:34.210
and this compromise with
slavery was necessary to create

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.480
the United States.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.890
Slavery, the word, isn't
used in the Constitution.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.740
They only use these euphemisms.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.690
These sort of complicated circumlocutions

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.940
and there is an argument that
there is a reason for that.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.930
And the reason for that is
that a lot of the framers

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.210
of the Constitution
didn't support slavery.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.600
Opposed slavery.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.980
They did think that it
was important to have

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.620
a United States and to
have a Constitution.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.030
So they wanted to do what
was necessary to achieve that

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.660
but they did the absolutely minimum

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.460
and they did it in such a way

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.730
that consciously doesn't recognize

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.140
and legitimize the institution of slavery.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.630
- [Kim] Alright so, then we get into

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.900
new states and territories.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.650
So, I think it was very forward looking

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.720
of the framers to
recognize that new states

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.100
might want to join the Union

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.790
and then to provide a process for that.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.140
So can you tell us a little bit about

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.700
what that process was like?

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.460
- [Erin] So article IV
section three clause one

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.150
provides the process for
admitting new states.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.840
Again it recognizes that
new states might want to

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.100
join the Union and it
gives wide latitude to

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.190
congress for admitting new states,

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.380
so basically the process
was that a territory

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.040
would indicate to the
congress that it wished

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.330
to become a state.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.540
Then they would submit a constitution

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.580
and congress would approve the new state.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.300
But the constitution
itself in article IV places

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.599
some limitations on that.

00:10:02.599 --> 00:10:05.820
Some of the eastern states
we're concerned that the large

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.450
western territories might
become too influential

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.960
so they had a couple of provisions

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.510
that no new states could be
created out of an old state

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.460
nor could parts of states be
combined to form a new state

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.360
unless there was consent from
all of the involved states.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.360
- [Gabriel] And it's not so
clear that purchase of territory

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.120
from foreign governments was a power that

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.100
was granted in the Constitution to anyone.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.340
Thomas Jefferson who was
the president at the time

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.820
of the Louisiana Purchase had doubts

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.810
that the Louisiana Purchase
was constitutional.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.150
He thought that it was
a great idea to purchase

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.570
all that land from France,

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.750
but he thought that it would
require a constitutional

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.840
amendment for the United
States to have that power.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.920
This is different from
Texas joining the Union.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.400
But the House and the
Senate didn't have the same

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.080
qualms that President Jefferson did.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.020
And so they agreed to approve
the Louisiana Purchase

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.880
and to fund it.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.250
When the bill got to Thomas
Jefferson's desk he signed.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.920
- [Kim] Moving on to section IV,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.910
there is this promise here
that the federal government

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.830
will guarantee every state a
republican form of government

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.470
and shall protect each
of them against invasion

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.000
or domestic violence.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.660
What does this mean?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.840
- [Erin] So we see here in
Article IV the end of Article IV

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.590
a really sort of famous, an
important promise to each

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.240
of the individual states.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.520
The federal government is promising,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.600
to basically aid them in keeping

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.470
a republican form of government.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.360
As well remember, Benjamin Franklin

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.470
famously said we've given you
a republic if you can keep it.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.270
- [Gabriel] So when we talk
about invasion in section IV,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.120
it talks about invasion,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.760
it's pretty clear that
what they're talking about

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.340
is invasion by some hostile state.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.030
And of course during this period

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.590
there was continuing conflict with England

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.720
and the idea is that if New York

00:12:05.784 --> 00:12:07.210
or South Carolina

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.490
gets invaded by England,
that's not just that particular

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.350
state's problem it's the nation's problem

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.180
and the national government
has an obligation

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.650
to protect against invasion.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.780
- [Kim] I imagine it also
prevents someone from

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.000
for example declaring
themselves the King of Maryland.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.470
- [Gabriel] The republican
form of government

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.000
clause does that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.920
It leaves the details to the states

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.080
but the basic idea is that there has,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.870
the concept of republican
government that's embodied

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.280
in article IV is majority rule.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.360
That even if there were
free and fair elections

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.330
the state could not
choose to have military

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.070
or hereditary government.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.820
So even if everybody in
California got together,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.653
and said you know,

00:12:54.653 --> 00:12:56.844
what we really need is

00:12:56.844 --> 00:13:00.600
a good family that
generation after generation

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.750
will lead us and they will be

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.430
the kings and queens of California,

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.440
and this is what we want so we're going to

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.190
amend our constitution
to provide for hereditary

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.420
leadership in our state
and we're going to find

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.340
somebody great and this
is what we want to do.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.410
Article IV would say, we
can't choose to do that

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.160
even through democratic means.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.240
- [Kim] So as we've learned Article IV

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.460
requires states to give

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.690
full faith and credit
to the legal proceedings

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.370
of other states and to treat the citizens

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.280
of other states as well as
they treat their own citizens.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.290
It provides a process
for adding new states

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.140
into the mix and guarantees
a republican form

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.620
of government to the
citizens of all the states.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.720
Article IV binds the
United States together

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.730
so it's not just a collection
of independent states

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.620
but rather a unified nation.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.280
