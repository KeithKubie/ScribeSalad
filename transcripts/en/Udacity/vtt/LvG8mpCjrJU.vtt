00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.540
It turns out that the overlapping model

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.880
is the most efficient for information storage.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.430
Now the reason why is pretty simple. If we look at our 6 bases in

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.980
the RNA code here, in the overlapping model, those 6 bases could code for 4

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.753
different amino acids. But in the non-overlapping model, we can only code for 2.
