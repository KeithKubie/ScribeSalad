AARON HARRIS: My
name's Aaron Harris.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.404
I'm a partner at Y Combinator.

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:05.820
And I'm going to tell you a
little bit about my experience

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.870
at YC and how crashing the
company that I started at YC

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.100
has actually made me
better at being a partner,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.880
giving advice,
and helping people

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.540
avoid the same fate
that we endured.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.330
So that's a reasonably
decent picture of me.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.710
Ignore the watermark behind it.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.880
And that's how you can
find me on Twitter.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.980
If anyone wants to
get in touch, that's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.210
probably the best way to do it.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.790
So what is Y Combinator?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.340
I know a lot of people know.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.830
But the truth is a lot of
people are kind of confused

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.900
about what we do.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.240
It's actually pretty simple.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240
YC is actually just
a big orange room

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.070
where once a week we have
really interesting speakers--

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.910
this is Mitch Kapor-- come
and talk to our founders

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.030
and tell them,
here's what happened

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.730
to me when I
started my start-up.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.277
Here are the things
that I learned.

00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:58.860
Here are the things
that I screwed up,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.070
did well, funny
stories, war stories,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.209
all these kinds of things.

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.250
And it's pretty great,
because sitting out there,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.450
especially as someone who
is a first-time founder,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.090
you have no idea
what's going on.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.840
And at YC, our goal is
to take really, really

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.416
amazing founders, whether
first time or repeat founders,

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:18.290
and try to make them
better, try to give them

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.040
advice, along with
some money, and improve

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.740
their chances of success.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.280
So actually, this
was my YC batch.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.500
And that's me right over there.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm lucky I made it into
the frame of this shot,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.030
because I almost got
bumped off, and then I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.196
wouldn't have a good visual.

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:36.670
But this was me
in winter of 2011.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.180
So about four years ago I
went through YC Combinator

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.990
with my company, Tutorspree.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.690
Now, when we first came up
with the idea for Tuturspree,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.500
we had really, really
bad design skills.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.300
And this is basically
what we put up.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.400
And we said, we're going to make
an online system for connecting

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.234
parents and tutors for
one-on-one learning.

00:01:58.234 --> 00:01:59.900
We're like, this is
going to be amazing.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.770
No one's ever tried
anything like this before.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.561
It's revolutionary.

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.074
It's amazing.

00:02:04.074 --> 00:02:04.990
What's the first step?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.880
Well, we're going to send
out a lot of emails to people

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.780
and just try to sign
up a bunch of tutors.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.863
And in order to do that,
we needed a sign-up form.

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:13.280
And so we put this up.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.480
Now, I wouldn't
call this a launch

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.620
of any kind, because
maybe 30 people saw it.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.860
But we sent it out
to a couple people,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.319
and we didn't make a big deal.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.610
We didn't want to send it
out to everyone we ever knew,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.655
because we thought, meh, not
really ready to be a company,

00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:28.530
not ready for launch.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.240
We couldn't set up any lessons.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.260
We couldn't take payment.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.260
We didn't have profiles.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.551
We didn't really have anything.

00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:36.042
It was really just
a landing page.

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:37.750
And so we went back
to the drawing board.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.710
We're like, OK, we've got to
make this a little better.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.980
It's got to be prettier.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.222
Let's show everyone all
the tutors that we have.

00:02:44.222 --> 00:02:46.180
And maybe now we're ready
to be a real company.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.460
Now we're ready to go raise
money and do this thing

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.570
and do that thing and
run people through it.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.250
But actually, this was
still just a landing page.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.170
And while it had
a little bit more,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.035
honestly, still not ready.

00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:02.670
But it was at this point
that we said, OK, we

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.840
want to build this.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.499
We're committing
to this full time.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.540
Let's see what we can do.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.680
And so we went and
applied to Y Combinator.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.700
And we applied with just
the shell of the website.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.990
This is actually roughly
what we applied to YC with.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.315
Still not that great
looking and really,

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:20.440
really basic functionality.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.533
Basically, if you filled
that little form out,

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:24.120
if you entered an
address, it would

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.922
show you a list of local tutors.

00:03:25.922 --> 00:03:27.755
And we could kind of
match you up with them,

00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:29.760
but we couldn't take
any payment from you.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.840
We had maybe 20
profiles on the site.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.315
Really not much there.

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.520
But we got into YC anyway,
because apparently we

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.700
fooled them into thinking
that we were actually

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.350
fairly credible and
fairly good and had

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.450
some idea of what we were doing.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.890
And as soon as we got
there, PG said, OK, launch.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.290
No, no, no, we're
not ready to launch.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.000
Launch site, it's unpolished.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.259
It doesn't do the thing.

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.300
We don't have full coverage
in all of our cities.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.190
They said, no, no, no, launch.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.730
Nah, we've got to build
all these new features.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.230
We know that people are going
to want fancy scheduling,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.040
launch this, launch that.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.609
And he kept
hammering away at us,

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:10.900
and we said, ah, what the hell.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.700
Let's just launch the damn
site and see what happened.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.275
And that was terrifying.

00:04:16.275 --> 00:04:20.019
That was kind of a weird moment,
because we didn't have any idea

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.160
whether or not anyone would
actually react to this thing.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.870
Would anyone actually
use it beyond the friends

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.840
that we had forced
to create profiles?

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.220
And on the day of our launch,
we got this really nice headline

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.220
off TechCrunch that Tuturspree
was the Airbnb for tutoring,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.160
which was exactly our message.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.550
That was our pitch.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.930
Airbnb for tutoring,
that's so cool.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.560
Airbnb was YC, we're YC.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.560
They help people make money
off things that they have.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.520
We're going to-- it's
going to be great.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.630
Our basic logic
boiled down to this.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.870
Airbnb is successful.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.310
We're kind of like Airbnb,
therefore we'll be successful.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.320
It was simple.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.490
It was honestly-- it
was a full-proof plan.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.760
It couldn't fail.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.990
And we even worked
out a really nice flow

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.400
for how our customers
would interact with us.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.647
Parents or students
would get to the site.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:14.730
They'd search for a tutor.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.760
They'd find the tutor.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.330
They'd send that
tutor a message,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.920
and we would make money.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.195
The problem was it didn't work.

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:26.070
There was this thing
that we saw that started

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.959
to happen where we definitely
had people starting

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.750
to come to the site
and looking for tutors.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.614
We got that because we
had had some nice press.

00:05:34.614 --> 00:05:36.530
And they were actually
sort of finding tutors,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.854
because we were localized to
the Bay Area and to New York.

00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:41.270
And we said, if
you're here, enter

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.228
your information and a
tutor's going to pop up.

00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:45.860
We were pushing through as many
tutors as we possibly could.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.401
And then we're like, OK, now
the Airbnb thing happens, right?

00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:50.850
We grow, we get really
rich, everyone's happy.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.720
Amazing.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.430
But there was something
funny happening

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.002
between the finding the tutor
and the booking the lesson.

00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:58.460
We weren't sure
what it was, but we

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.150
started taking a look
at our messaging layer

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.570
and actually
watching the message

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.760
traffic go back and
forth between parents

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.420
and tutors or
students and tutors

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.390
and watch what was coming back.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.390
And this really
weird thing started

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.710
happening that was completely
counter to what we believed

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.130
before we had
launched Tutorspree.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.230
We had this perfect
platonic ideal

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.090
of what our company would be,
of how the users would actually

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.990
use it.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.040
And the real world brutally
reminded us that we were wrong.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.720
So here's the things
that we learned.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.222
First of all, our
customers weren't

00:06:34.222 --> 00:06:35.680
students, as we
initially believed.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.180
We thought, well, if the student
was matching up with the tutor,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.840
then that student
was the customer.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.790
But in reality, the parents
were the ones paying for things,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.540
and they where the customer,
which is a completely different

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.130
set of user behaviors
and user models

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.970
around what actually
people want and how

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.490
they're going to interact.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.380
And so the thing
that we were missing

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.640
in this wide open marketplace
model where people were

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.770
basically bidding
on tutors and tutors

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.550
had all these crazy
prices and no one

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.450
knew what to do with anything
was that we were lacking trust.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.150
And what we really
needed was the trust

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.220
of not just the students,
not just the tutors,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.490
but of the parents.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.170
And we didn't know
how to get that.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.526
We didn't know why
they weren't using it.

00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:22.920
We could kind of
see in the messaging

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.690
that people were not
responding at quite the level

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.600
that we needed them to,
but we had no idea why.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.440
And so the thing we needed to do
was we needed to talk to them.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.600
And we needed to
talk to them a lot.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.754
This is one of these
really unsexy things.

00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:41.170
It's the thing
that you don't want

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.460
to think about as a founder.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.470
You want to think that, OK, I
built this brilliant product.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.780
I'm perfect, it's
perfect, so therefore it's

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.830
going to do great.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.620
The users will do what
I tell them to do.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.520
There's actually a
core message that we

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.550
tell our startups at YC.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.590
And this is-- this was like
me learning a lesson really

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.275
well by running face first into
a brick wall, Which is probably

00:08:05.275 --> 00:08:07.400
the best way to learn
things, because otherwise you

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.010
don't really remember it.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.580
And the truth is
what you have to do

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.288
is you have to get
the product out there,

00:08:12.288 --> 00:08:14.370
and then you have
to talk to the users

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.942
who you think are going to use
it, who you want to use it.

00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:19.650
But more important
than the ones that you

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.108
think are going to
use it, you have

00:08:21.108 --> 00:08:24.301
to talk to the people who are
actually using your product.

00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:26.800
Because if you haven't talked
to the people who are actually

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.600
using it, you won't
understand the behaviors

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.409
that they're going
through while using it

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.459
or their rationale
for wanting to use it.

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:36.125
And so we started
doing this thing where

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:39.010
we're talking to them, talking
to them, talking to them.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.280
And it actually led us
to completely change

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.640
the core model of Tutorspree.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.490
We realized that we weren't
this wide-open marketplace.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.620
We were not this ideal of a
place where people magically

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.660
find each other and agree to
pay one another for lessons.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.690
We were a system where we
actually had to hold hands.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.690
We had to work with each
parent and make sure

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.730
that they were happy until
we really figured out

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.670
how things were going.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.280
So we did that.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.590
And it worked
really, really well.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.270
In fact, in the six
months between when

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.370
we started doing that--
well, within six months,

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.850
we'd increased our
revenue dramatically.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.570
We had increased our profit
even more dramatically.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.840
And the thing that was
actually most important to us

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.090
was we increased the
engagement of our customers

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.310
by three times.

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.920
That meant they were doing
three times more lessons.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.170
They were also getting to
the point of booking lessons

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.290
much more quickly.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.850
They were much more satisfied.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.180
They sent us love notes instead
of hate mail, which was better.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.320
We were on the phones with
them, so they knew us.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.200
They saw us as a partner and
not just a random utility

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.930
that they could run back and
forth, in from and away from.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.860
And we never would
have known that had we

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.510
sat inside of our office,
which was just the living

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.550
room of our apartment,
not putting a product out

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.400
and had we not been
talking to the customers.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.390
And that's the core
of Y Combinator.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.790
We actually tell our
companies that there's

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.430
really only two things
to do during YC.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.820
You write code and you
talk to your users.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.900
And by doing those
two things, you

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.420
end up making
something people want.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.360
And at the end of
the day, a startup

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.210
is about making
something people want.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.904
A company is about making
something people want.

00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:31.320
Now, there are
variations of this.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.450
You could say you make
something people need.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.860
But the truth is, if you make
something people need and they

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.540
don't want it, they're probably
not going to use it that much .

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.230
And certainly, they're not going
to tell their friends about it.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.460
There aren't a lot of
school kids-- well,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.230
let's say a lot
of kindergartners

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.760
who are really excited
about broccoli.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.570
But they probably
need to eat broccoli.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.980
They don't want to,
but they need to.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.610
And so if you can
get to want, if you

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.080
can be the thing that
people really want,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.510
that's when you start winning.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.730
And as we started
building this product that

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.760
was working, as people
were starting to interact

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.900
with it more, we
noticed that more people

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.540
were showing up at the site.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.949
We hadn't really thought enough
about why that was happening.

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:19.240
And what we discovered was
there was a very good reason

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.860
why it was happening.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.060
There were some very
intelligent people

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.120
sitting in some
buildings in this campus,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.450
creating algorithms that were
sending people to our site.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.504
Google was where we
got our customers.

00:11:33.504 --> 00:11:34.920
And we were getting
our customers,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.830
because at that point
we had created something

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.460
that customers actually wanted,
which Google saw and measured.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.230
Google saw people
hitting our site,

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.060
sticking around, transacting,
and it worked out really,

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.152
really well for us.

00:11:47.152 --> 00:11:48.860
And so let's put that
aside for a second.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.630
We said, OK, well, SEO
is working really, really

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.110
well for us-- just
brilliantly good traffic.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:00.087
It's basically free for us,
converts really well, amazing.

00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:01.670
What else should we
be thinking about?

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.150
Well, we had ideas around
other things, right?

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.225
There are other ways
to acquire customers.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:10.150
You've got display
advertising, Facebook, SEM.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.180
We started to do partnerships.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.220
We talked to-- about
doing Rev shares.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.870
We talked about doing
affiliate marketing, giveaways,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.910
flyering communities.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:25.290
We talked to administrators
of schools, PTAs, colleges.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.940
We tried to get guest blogs.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.540
And everything we did paled
in comparison to the channel

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.500
that we had.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.580
But that led us to do
something a little strange.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.850
Because as we were
focused on SEO,

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.830
we actually started forgetting
about our customers.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.980
We started forgetting about
what it was they wanted

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.260
and started thinking
only of what

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.940
was going to drive more
traffic to the site.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.960
So we basically tried
to play games with SEO.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.310
We didn't do anything
particularly shady.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.440
But what we did start
doing was things

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.550
that were probably not what
customers actually wanted.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.990
And Google picked up on
that, because the algorithms

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.060
are designed to send people
to the things that they want.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.660
And so on March 16th of
2013, our traffic fell by 80%

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.070
overnight.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.060
It was a really crappy morning.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.270
Along with our traffic dropping,
our revenue fell off a cliff.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.370
Our customers couldn't find us,
new customers couldn't find us.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.890
And everything
basically went to hell.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.540
And we sat around, and we
kind of were tearing our hair

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.230
and trying to figure
out, well, what

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.600
was it that caused
this to happen?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.990
Hadn't we done the right things?

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.620
We had some customers
that liked us.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.790
They found us.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.064
They were using us,
so what was going on?

00:13:40.064 --> 00:13:41.480
So we started
trying to figure out

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.890
why it was that Google
had decided that we were

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.071
no longer making a thing as
good as our customers wanted,

00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:49.820
because they were
starting to bounce more.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.750
They were getting more confused.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.250
That's when we started learning
about the algorithm updates.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.360
Now, we had known how
the algorithm worked

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.750
when we started Tutorspree.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.310
We had paid a lot
of attention to it,

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.200
and it dovetailed
perfectly with our strategy

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.810
for making something that our
customers actually wanted.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.430
But the new
algorithm saw that we

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.660
were doing things
that weren't great.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.110
We had duplicate
content within our site,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.640
because we had tried to create
a lot of pages representing

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.100
different categories.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.380
We hadn't done it
in the best way.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.740
We had thin content on pages.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.950
So for instance, we had a
single math tutor in, let's say,

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.080
Wichita, Kansas.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.480
And for that one math
tutor, we had a page

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.050
for math tutors, algebra tutors,
calculus tutors, calculus II

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.290
tutors, and trigonometry tutors.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.400
That one tutor was showing
up on seven or eight pages

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.650
and is the only
content on that page.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.251
That was bad.

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:46.750
If a customer had hit that page
and then said, oh, well, let

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.290
me see what else
you have, they were

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.123
going to see the same
thing again and again,

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:52.840
get frustrated, decide we
were full of crap, and leave.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.720
And that's what
we were learning.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.970
Wrapped up in that was the
fact that our navigation

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.112
wasn't good enough.

00:14:58.112 --> 00:15:00.070
People couldn't find
their way around the site.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.360
Yeah, they could get from the
home page to one other page.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.940
But we discovered
they were actually

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.390
landing on deeper pages first
and then not understanding

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.570
what they were going to have to
do to get to where they needed.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.270
And finally, the
freshness of our pages,

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.540
the speed with which
we updated the pages

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.650
and actually made things
look like somebody was home,

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.905
fell off.

00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:23.030
And so looking at all that,
what we realized was we

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.790
had gotten lazy.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.170
We had had a model
originally, in the first days

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.170
of Tutorspree, of how
Tutorspree worked.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.590
And we brought
that out to market

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.756
and discovered it was wrong.

00:15:32.756 --> 00:15:34.670
And that led to all
this great iteration

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.570
and all this great building of
what people wanted us to do,

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.520
which is like the
core message of YC.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.690
But then we were out of YC,
and we stopped paying attention

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.100
to some of these signals.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.880
And as a result, we
started optimizing,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.650
not towards what
our customers wanted

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.030
but what we've perceived
certain channels wanted

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.040
us to do in order to
bring customers to us.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.700
So we took a step back, and
we redesigned everything

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.860
about the site.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.220
We actually built the site to
be what our customers wanted,

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.090
to model on their behaviors
of how they worked

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.720
through the flow of our site,
how we held their hands, how we

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.020
matched them up with tutors,
how we resolved conflicts

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.730
with tutors or made them
happy when things went wrong.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.050
And in doing so, we
completely changed

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.830
the architecture of the
site and what we had.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.620
We cut over a million
pages from the site.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.740
We made sure that every
single important page

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.050
had fresh, good,
useful content that

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.790
explained to our users exactly
what was on that page, what

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.330
kind of value they'd get from
it, what they could expect

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.370
to pay for tutors-- all
kinds of good information

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.680
that they actually found useful.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.730
At the same time, we eliminated
duplicate geographies.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.700
If someone was
looking for 90023,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.620
they should see the same thing
as 90024, or that location

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.870
if they entered in words.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.670
In New York, say, 1023 and
1024, both the Upper West

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.700
Side of Manhattan.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.550
It should show the same page.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:06.470
And as we started doing this,
we started seeing improvements.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.780
Our rankings on Google improved.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.700
Our better UX and better UI led
to our customers being happier.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.859
And overall, our
site was faster.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.359
It was friendlier.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.310
And quite frankly,
it was just straight

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.839
up betterer, which is not a
word, for all of our customers.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.150
And it was great.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.090
It was starting to
work really well.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:34.120
But at the end of the day,
it didn't help enough.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.980
When you try to get
to Tutorspree now,

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.070
you just get a 404.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:42.730
The reason was we had fallen
too far behind in that process.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.380
Startups basically
are constantly

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.400
fighting, in my mind,
against two things.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.960
They're fighting against
apathy, because no one

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.550
knows who you are.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.640
No one cares who you are.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.500
And they're fighting
against time.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.530
You only have a certain
amount of time to do things.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.220
And that's whether you run
out of money or the people who

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.100
work for you get bored
or the customers who

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.700
thought you had decide
you're not doing the things

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.640
that they want.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.830
Any of those things
can kill you.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.660
And for us, what
it came down to was

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.940
we realized that
we just could not

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.450
put enough people onto
the site in the way

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.270
that we thought
was best to keep it

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.035
as a rapidly scaling business.

00:18:28.035 --> 00:18:30.880
It was pretty tough
to understand,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.510
because we had gotten lazy.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.289
We have forgotten the
right things to do.

00:18:37.289 --> 00:18:39.330
And by doing that, we had
doomed our own startup.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.000
And that's kind of
a tough thing to say

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.374
when you spend
two or three years

00:18:42.374 --> 00:18:44.350
of your life on something.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.870
But what it does is it
makes it so that when

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.180
I talk to our new companies,
to new companies in the batch,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.692
I can tell them
how important it is

00:18:52.692 --> 00:18:54.150
to just get their
product out there

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.200
and to iterate-- and not only
that, never stop iterating.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.230
Launching doesn't just
mean getting your site up

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.720
on the internet
for the first time

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.490
or getting your first press hit.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.110
It means constantly launching
things for your users

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.080
that they want to use, that
they love, that make them happy.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.580
Because if you do
that, you actually

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.320
make something that they want.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.090
At the end of the day, that's
the only thing that counts.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.290
So if you ever find
yourself drifting away

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.750
from what people
want-- and you can

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.990
track that in a million ways.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.610
You can use Google
Analytics to see

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.680
how people are interacting
with your site.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.480
You can watch your revenue,
you can watch your user growth,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.817
engagement, all these things.

00:19:29.817 --> 00:19:31.275
If you find that
you're moving away

00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:33.770
from what they want, and
you're honest about that,

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.680
then you just repeat
the first step.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.810
You figure out what they
want, you talk to them,

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.409
and you launch new things.

00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:40.950
And that's kind of
the message that I

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.540
try to give to every
single one of our founders.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.170
And hopefully it'll
sink in better for them

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.120
than it did for me.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.720
That's it.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.487
Thank you.

00:19:51.487 --> 00:19:52.381
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:53.722
AARON HARRIS: What?

00:19:53.722 --> 00:19:55.549
Oh, thanks.

00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:57.090
I think I have about
10 minutes left.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.200
If anyone has any questions,
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.250
I also have two of my partners.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.140
Kevin Hale is back there and
[INAUDIBLE] is over there,

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.920
so they can also--
I'm volunteering

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.400
them to answer
questions as well.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.420
If anyone has specific
questions about YC afterwards,

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.470
we'll be hanging around.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.210
So any questions?

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:18.408
Yeah.

00:20:18.408 --> 00:20:21.324
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:21.324 --> 00:20:22.782
AARON HARRIS: Yeah.

00:20:22.782 --> 00:20:23.754
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:31.512 --> 00:20:32.970
AARON HARRIS: Yeah,
so the question

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.170
was, when our traffic dropped
off, why did it do that?

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.880
Didn't people still need tutors?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.020
And so the reason that we--
our core hypothesis on this

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.400
is that it's an incredibly
fragmented market.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.970
Actually, most of
the tutoring goes

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.117
to these little mom and
pop shops that are local.

00:20:50.117 --> 00:20:51.700
And that's what we
were fighting with.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.140
So we had to create
a better experience

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.840
than local recommendation
from one person to another.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.300
That's really, really hard.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.150
And so as soon as we
started falling below that,

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.710
we lost a lot of
our customer base.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.570
And once your reputation
starts getting tarnished,

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.100
it's really, really
hard to win it back.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.270
Parents don't give
you a second chance.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:12.950
Anyone else?

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.680
Yeah.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.740
AARON HARRIS: Yeah,
so the question was,

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.580
was there a specific
set of metrics

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.040
or were there specific
metrics that convinced us

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.480
that it was-- we were done?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.070
It wasn't any one metric.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.559
It was sort of a cumulative
view of everything

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:37.850
that was going on, looking
at what our user acquisition

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.910
cost was doing relative to
our value of a customer,

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.650
comparing that with
where we needed

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.837
it to be to rapidly scale
through multiple channels.

00:21:47.837 --> 00:21:49.420
And we realized that
those things just

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.060
were no longer going to
work out the way that we

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.610
thought they would.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.350
We couldn't figure out how
to really make them work.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.250
So it's kind of
just-- at some point

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.650
you hit this confidence interval
that-- alright, it's better

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.158
if we try to do something else.

00:22:04.158 --> 00:22:05.580
Yep.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.205
AUDIENCE: So the
mentality of walk

00:22:09.205 --> 00:22:12.620
before you're ready and
[INAUDIBLE] can sometimes

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.070
lead to quality loss,
so how do you balance

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.238
reaching more users
versus [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:19.866 --> 00:22:22.699
AARON HARRIS: Yeah,
so the question was,

00:22:22.699 --> 00:22:24.490
launching before you're
ready and iterating

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.650
can lead to quality
loss, so how do you

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.740
balance getting new
customers by launching

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.924
new features versus pissing
off your existing customers

00:22:32.924 --> 00:22:34.090
because you break something?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.530
It can be a tricky balance.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.010
But part of it is in defining
what your problem space is,

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.510
right?

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.760
And so defining the things
that you're going to launch

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.570
and iterate on.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.090
And your customers, if you're
good to them, and your users,

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.360
if you're good to
them and you've

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.550
done good things
for them, they'll

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.110
deal with a little
breakage, as long

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.530
as you don't break the
core of what they want.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.990
If you ever break something
that's really, really important

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.080
to them, you've got
to be apologetic,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.090
and you've got to do
good customer service

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.130
and explain to
them what happened.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.570
Google goes down-- Gmail goes
down every once in awhile.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.781
And it's crazy, but you
expect that it's normally up

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:09.030
and you know they're trying
to do good things for you.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.579
Same thing happens
with Facebook,

00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:13.120
although you could argue their
users aren't-- their users are

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.700
locked in in a different way.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.810
But it's really always a
balance in trying to figure out.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.160
In the scope-- in the
decision of launch,

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.050
don't launch, it's
basically like

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.240
if it's going to get
out there and not--

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.084
and it's slightly imperfect,
do it, experiment with it,

00:23:30.084 --> 00:23:31.250
and be able to roll it back.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.874
And roll it back as
soon as you realize

00:23:32.874 --> 00:23:36.700
it's hurting your customers and
hurting people who love you.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.803
And then do it again and again.

00:23:39.803 --> 00:23:40.765
Yeah.

00:23:40.765 --> 00:23:43.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
customers, how did you

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.499
know what to focus on?
[INAUDIBLE] 10 customers,

00:23:47.499 --> 00:23:49.864
you've got 20
different opinions.

00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:50.655
AARON HARRIS: Yeah.

00:23:50.655 --> 00:23:53.350
So when we first started and
started talking to customers,

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.320
how did we know
what to focus on.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.150
So this is kind of
where-- one of the things

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.060
we tell founders is to work
on problems that you have

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.150
and things that you know.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.360
So I had been a tutor.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.230
I had had tutors.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.780
So I knew the initial set of
criteria we had to work with

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.912
and so spared the
first iteration cycle.

00:24:08.912 --> 00:24:10.370
But then you've
got to keep talking

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.630
and you've got to form
consensus to some extent.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.450
You don't want to just go with
exactly what users tell you,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.450
because sometimes they'll
tell different things.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.100
It's a judgment question.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.620
There's no there's scientific
method to say, do this thing.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.537
When Steve Jobs launched
the iPhone, it wasn't

00:24:24.537 --> 00:24:27.120
like they had a whole bunch of
user groups who told them, hey,

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.760
we want a computer in this
form factor that makes calls

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.540
or whatever.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.500
He kind of understood what
people would want eventually.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.350
For us, it was constantly
talking to the users,

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.280
figuring out whether or not
what they wanted matched up

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.136
with how we thought
the product should grow

00:24:43.136 --> 00:24:44.760
and ultimately making
product decisions

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.440
based on our own expertise
on how to fit that advice in.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.016
AUDIENCE: Did you
by talking to them

00:24:50.016 --> 00:24:50.590
or by measuring
the way they acted?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.100
AARON HARRIS: Both.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.990
Did we measure by
talking to them

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.780
or by quantitative methods?

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.280
Both.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.522
You have to combine both.

00:24:58.522 --> 00:24:59.980
There's pretty much
never an excuse

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.140
not to talk to your
customers in person.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.570
Even when you get
to scale of hundreds

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.310
of thousands or
millions of users,

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.280
you can still talk
to pieces of them.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.650
This is why community-- the
community sites or community

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.710
forums work really
well as you scale,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.410
because you start seeing the
best-- the most active users

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.550
start rising to the top,
and you engage with them,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.870
because they are your biggest
fans and your best customers.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.410
And if you make
them happy, they'll

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.240
spread the love of how
happy they are with you.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.800
So you've got to do both.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.300
Yeah.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.920
AARON HARRIS: So how did we find
our users to do user testing?

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.320
So initially, the
people that we targeted,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.020
it was friends and
friends of friends.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.120
But then it was
our actual users.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.830
We had people paying us
money to use our service,

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.850
so we would call them on
the phone-- email them,

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.391
call them on the phone, badger
them, go meet them for coffee,

00:25:58.391 --> 00:26:02.760
just get-- find any way we
could to go talk to them.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.290
We never used a
user testing service

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.230
to find us probable people.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.631
We actually focused on
the people that we had.

00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:15.868
Because we had them, so
it made sense to use them.

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:18.790
Yeah.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.764
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:32.426 --> 00:26:34.470
AARON HARRIS: Yeah,
so I mentioned

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.210
that we cut a million pages-- or
the million pages we had ended

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.880
up being one of the things
that Google penalized.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.580
So we made that optimizat--
and whether or not

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.660
that was actually
bad for users, that

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.698
was an optimization
we did-- what?

00:26:51.698 --> 00:26:53.162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:53.162 --> 00:26:55.530
AARON HARRIS: So you're
saying that's not product,

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.880
but I disagree.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.860
Part of our product was
the search interface,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.670
the browse interface of
how people actually located

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.620
a tutor.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.040
And so the tutors
were distributed

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.770
across this large
corpus of pages.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.040
And how they interacted
with each individual page

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.330
was the start of their
experience with our product.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.750
AARON HARRIS: So where they
unqualified users because

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.375
of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:22.370
Even if they were
qualified users,

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.670
they weren't having the
best possible experience

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:25.550
on those pages.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.490
Yeah.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.460
Yeah.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.819
AARON HARRIS: So how many people
were working and our revenue

00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:42.110
numbers-- so I'll tell you
how many people were working

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:49.710
for us, but-- at
our peak, we had,

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:55.450
I think, 10 full-time,
5 part-time, and then

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.780
a whole group of
distributed people doing

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.470
even more part-time
work-- so 15 to 20 people.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:04.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:10.290
AARON HARRIS: I'm taking
it to the grave with me.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.060
No, we were generating
good revenue.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.990
We were profitable.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.810
We were edging on
profitability, growing quickly.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.320
It was going well for a while.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.750
What?

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.520
How much money did we raise?

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.360
We raised one-- just shy
of $2 million-- just shy

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.880
of $2 million.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.790
Anyone else?

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.980
Last question.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.342
AUDIENCE: Going back to
the [INAUDIBLE] position,

00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:41.800
did you have a really weird
niche that you were going after

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.915
and it might not be
your [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:46.915 --> 00:28:49.150
AARON HARRIS: So how do you
do user acquisition when

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.900
your users are not
your circle of friends?

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.650
It's like a weird niche?

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.960
I would go and talk to them.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.830
I don't know.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.492
Every niche of users
is going to have

00:28:56.492 --> 00:28:57.700
slightly different behaviors.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.950
Go find them and talk to them.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.340
Find out where they hang out,
what they do, what they read.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:07.280
And you can start
building off of that.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.630
So, yeah there's no
science to user--

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.540
there's some science
to user acquisition,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.860
but the science is in-- there's
no-- the science is constantly

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.200
iterating on and
trying different things

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.915
and then measuring and then
trying it again and altering

00:29:20.915 --> 00:29:22.150
it.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.290
All right, thank you very much.
