00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.939
Psychopath or sociopath, both can cold but
manipulatively charming and kind of emotionless.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:10.759
But what is the difference between the two
terms?

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.690
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.740
Until very recently “psychopath” and “sociopath”
could be used interchangeably.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.670
The terms described someone who was maybe
aloof, manipulative, and just couldn’t empathize

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.670
with other people.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.609
But lately even Sherlock Holmes debates the
difference, he tells his pesky coworker, “I'm

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.970
not a psychopath, Anderson.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.890
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.”

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.580
And scientists are also quick to draw a distinction.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.270
Jack Pemment, a biology graduate student at
the University of Mississippi, wrote in the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.630
journal Aggression and Violent Behavior, that
“psychopathy is a developmental disorder

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.550
that is associated with specific kinds of
behavior”.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.170
Psychopathy is mostly biological.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.090
Psychopaths have abnormalities in the brain.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.940
Although childhood upbringing might have some
effect, a traumatic home life might reshape

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.230
the growing brain.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.770
One study published in the journal Frontiers
in Human Neuroscience found that many areas

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.680
of the brain associated with empathy fail
to respond to emotional situations.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.450
The researchers used FMRI on 121 inmates in
a medium security prison.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.100
They were shown situations where someone else
is getting hurt like getting their fingers

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.170
slammed in a car door.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.490
(If you just winced when i said that, you
are probably not a psychopath).

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.130
The researchers looked at brain regions associated
with empathy for pain, regions like the anterior

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.259
insula, the anterior midcingulate cortex,
somatosensory cortex, and the right amygdala.

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.880
These areas activate when the inmates thought
about themselves in pain.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.500
But these area failed to activate when they
saw someone else in pain.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.090
But another area did light up, the ventral
striatum, an area that might be associated

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.189
with pleasure.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.680
So yeah psychopathic brains kind of like when
other people are in pain.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.979
Psychopaths also respond to rewards more strongly
than most people, according to research published

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.659
in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.580
Their brains release four times more dopamine
in response to drugs like amphetamine.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.479
So they seek a reward, like drugs or maybe
that CEO position, no matter what the cost.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.200
Sociopaths on the other hand, still exhibit
many of the same personality traits like manipulation

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.219
and disregard of others’ feelings, but not
because they don’t have any sense of morality

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.220
like psychopaths, it’s that their moral
compass might be a little off the mark.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.120
This could be because of upbringing or a belief
system.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.200
Pemment used the example of Anders Breivik,
who murdered 77 people in Norway.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.470
He did it not because he felt like it and
didn’t care about those people, which I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.310
mean he probably didn’t, but that wasn’t
his reason for it.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.010
His reason was tied to his belief system.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.640
He saw himself as a martyr for his cause.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.380
And Pemment wonders if these beliefs might
change the brain or if the sociopathic brain

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.580
might be inherently wired differently.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.910
He suggests that more research is needed.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.111
Sherlock Holmes, while not a mass murder,
tries to do what he thinks is right, but he

00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:47.060
goes about it by lying and manipulating because
he really struggles to empathize with anyone.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.180
So basically, the both psychopaths and sociopaths
have brains wired a bit differently from the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.180
rest of us.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.840
but psychopaths don’t have a sense of right
and wrong and don’t feel fear.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.800
While sociopaths do understand right from
wrong, but their right might just look a little

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.330
wrong to the rest of us.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.380
So maybe Sherlock is right - maybe he really
is a high-functioning sociopath.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.650
Now that you’ve watched this video, do you
understand the difference a little better?

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.942
Let us know if there are other topics you
want us to explain and maybe we’ll make

00:03:08.942 --> 00:03:09.942
a video about it.

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:11.710

click the link in the description to nominate
us for a Streamy Award.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.560
We bring you science every day, and we do
it because we love it, but together we can

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.010
spread the love of science around!

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.129
Thanks for watching DNews
