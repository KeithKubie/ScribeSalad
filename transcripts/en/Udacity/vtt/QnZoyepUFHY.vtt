00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.240
Laura, you're never going to guess what I found.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:03.820
&gt;&gt; What is it?

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.850
&gt;&gt; Well I've, I've found my parents' genomes.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.230
&gt;&gt; Really, what does it say?

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.980
&gt;&gt; Well I've been comparing them here for a little

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.330
while, but it seems pretty obvious that I'm an equal

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.110
mix of my parents. They each gave me half of

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.219
their genome, so I could have a whole genome myself.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.590
&gt;&gt; Well but yeah, that's how it works. Like, all

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.670
the parents pass down half the genome to all the siblings.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.185
&gt;&gt; Well, this is true. But it's not the same half that they give to everybody.

00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:25.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.530
But how does that work?

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.370
&gt;&gt; Well think about it. It's the reason that me and my sister don' t

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.630
look the same. We each got 50% of our DNA from our parents, but the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.430
half she got from Mom, and the half I got from Mom aren't the same

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.920
halves. This happens because of two really important

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.820
processes called recombination and independent assortment in myosis.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.030
&gt;&gt; Wait, what in what? Lauren, I think it's about time we zoomed out

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.440
and looked at the bigger picture of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.710
how genomes and chromosomes are passed down from

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.630
parent to offspring. Up to this point, we've learned about what traits

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.030
are and how our DNA codes for them, both coding and noncoding,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.250
how it can create and provide the foundation for these traits. But

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
we still don't even know how this material gets passed down. Sex.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.470
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, what?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.210
&gt;&gt; Sex. That's, I know that's how you pass down genetic information.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.230
&gt;&gt; this is true. Sex is the vehicle by which the hereditary

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.340
material is passed down from generation to generation. But. The question is do

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.810
any of you know what's going on at the genetic level? In this lesson,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.960
we're going to learn how our genes

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.130
and chromosomes get passed down in interesting

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
patterns from generation to generation, making us

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.200
a unique mix of our parent's DNA.
