00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.810
The Marvel Cinematic Universe may have seemed
like a risk at the beginning, but the release

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.290
of Iron Man, and the many box office successes
that followed soon made Marvel's pipe dream

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.290
a reality.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.060
The comic book heroes and villains kept on
marching to the big screen, but no matter

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.221
how fantastic, how dark, or how grounded the
stories got, audiences could trust that a

00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.009
Marvel movie would always deliver some memorable
action scenes.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.779
Some movies through Marvel's Phase One and
Two have raised the bar more than others,

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.640
but even the less-successful films have turned
in at least a handful of memorable scenes.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.820
Here is our look at the 20 Greatest Action
Scenes From Marvel's Phase One &amp; Two.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.330
Iron Man - The Cave Escape
It's only fair that we start at the beginning,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.733
when Tony Stark first introduced the world
to his alter ego: Iron Man.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:47.399
The Mark 1 armor may not be as polished as
the ones that came after, but striking from

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.399
the darkness, unleashing flamethrowers, and
making his first aerial escape proved in a

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.640
single scene that Marvel's second-rate hero
could be box office gold.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.059
The Incredible Hulk - Big Man on Campus
Fans of Marvel's big green monster were counting

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.790
the minutes to see him in all his glory, and
when Thunderbolt Ross cornered Bruce Banner

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.860
to force the Hulk out of hiding, he got more
than he bargained for - and fans got a fantastic

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.860
sequence.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.780
Watching Hulk take down Humvees, sonic cannons,
and even a gunship still never gets old.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.870
The Incredible Hulk - Harlem Shake
The campus battle was just an appetizer, since

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.770
the creation of the Hulk-sized Abomination
gave the green hero the real villain of his

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.290
first (and so far, only) solo MCU story.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.850
It was everything you want from a battle of
monsters: cars used as boxing gloves, entire

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.170
buildings as nothing but hurdles, and even
Hulk's fire-quenching super-clap (near the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.159
end of the fight, putting out the fire of
Betty's chopper crash).

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.860
Recasting the role for The Avengers may lead
some people to think Hulk's first movie was

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.530
a wash, but these scenes and more stand the
test of time.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.170
Captain America - Ride on The Valkyrie
There were plenty of fights in the wartime

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.720
setting of Captain America, but the film saved
the biggest spectacle for its final act.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.369
Starting with the daring leap onto the bomber,
the ensuing fight saw Cap battle onto, through,

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.600
outside of, and then back into the plane,
leading to a final showdown with Red Skull.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.470
It's the film's best action - the fact that
it leads into Cap's so-called death only makes

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.140
it more watchable.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.080
Thor - Frost Giant Frenzy
No Marvel hero had a bigger hill to climb

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.010
than the god of thunder, but his first solo
film wasted no time in showing that he wasn't

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.140
just deadly with his hammer - but the more
intense the fight, the wider the grin on his

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.140
face.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.570
Smashing skulls alongside the Warriors Three,
Thor's mocking screams, and devastating lightning

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.550
attacks showed what fans could expect - even
if he needed his daddy to come to his rescue.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.851
The Avengers - Shakespeare in the Park
When an Asgardian is taken into custody, some

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.600
hiccups are to be expected.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.000
So when Thor first arrives to confiscate Loki
from Iron Man, the billionaire takes exception.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.820
The fight that followed between Stark and
Thor was actually storyboarded before director

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.630
Joss Whedon even joined the film, which means
Marvel knew from the start that the heavyweight

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.670
rumble would be the perfect way to bring the
Avengers' big three onto the same page - and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.950
they were right.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.210
The Avengers - Attack on the Helicarrier
In Marvel's first team-up, the stakes couldn't

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.210
have been higher.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.310
It was lucky, then, that Loki was just the
kind of villain to hatch a plan sending every

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.700
member of the team into battle on different
fronts.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.930
The Helicarrier fight remains one of the most
diverse in the MCU: Hulk first threatens Widow,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.090
before Thor takes on the monster himself.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.260
Cap trades bullets with enemy soldiers, Fury
holds down the bridge, and Tony gets a close-up

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.480
look at the inside of the Helicarrier's turbine.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.640
Pick your favorite scene: it's one homerun
after another.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.590
Captain America: The Winter Soldier - Fury's
Ambush

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.470
Since he doesn't have any superpowers, audiences
were riveted to see Nick Fury cornered and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.090
ambushed by enemy forces in Washington, D.C..

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.950
The gadgets that allowed Fury to escape, and
the slower-speed, but insanely tense chase

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.120
scene that followed made The Winter Solider
a hit almost by themselves, delivering an

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.400
action scene to stand up against the best
of any genre, let alone comic book movies.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.470
Iron Man 3 - Barrel of Monkeys
One of Tony Stark's greatest action scenes

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.710
didn't actually require any firepower at all:
instead, he had to save the lives of over

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.380
a dozen people freefalling from Air Force
One.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.890
Using actual skydivers to get realistic footage,
and incredible CG to polish it up, the scene

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.430
was one of the most adrenaline-pumping in
Stark's career - even more impressive, since

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.390
he wasn't even IN the armor when he completed
the mission.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.190
Captain America: The Winter Soldier - Stealthy
at Sea

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.850
Shifting Steve Rogers from the old war to
the new one could have been tricky, but when

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.070
his sequel kicked off, he was already a master
of covert ops and silent takedowns.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.220
Using his feet, fists and shield to put down
an entire ship's crew himself, things only

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.489
got better as he drew the leader out in the
open.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.440
The directors made the most of UFC champion
Georges St-Pierre, pitting him against Cap

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.009
in one of the simplest, but most memorable
fights in the MCU.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.479
Iron Man 3 - House Party Protocol
Iron Man 3 might have taken Tony out of the

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.740
suit for most of the movie, but the final
act more than made up for it by calling in

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.759
the cavalry to help the hero save the day.

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.460
The cavalry, being every single specialized
suit of armor Stark had made, piloted remotely

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.110
by his A.I. co-pilot, JARVIS.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.259
Seeing Tony leap from one suit to another
was a truly inspired idea, but watching as

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.759
the suits take down their enemies in their
own special way always offers something new

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.870
on repeat viewings.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.349
Captain America: The Winter Soldier - The
Elevator

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.639
When Fury falls, Cap's not far behind.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.080
The elevator fight - which the directors compared
to watching ten men try to fight a gorilla

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.930
in a cage - was the first sequence to be shot,
taking more than four days.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.181
The results spoke for themselves, with Cap's
brutal up-close skills not just making the

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.289
scene incredible in the film, but actually
used to market the film as a first teaser.

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.860
Thor: The Dark World - Prologue
The opening prologue of a fantasy movie is

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.319
supposed to be good - but maybe not THIS good.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.270
The sequence, following Asgardians of old
defeating the Dark Elves, was created by director

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.199
Tim Miller's own studio, years before he would
helm Deadpool.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.509
The talent at work is obvious, since the CG-fueled
battle scenes are massive, fluid, and above

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.770
all, more entertaining and undeniably badass
- in a Lord of the Rings sort of way - than

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.449
any of the fights in the rest of the movie.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.099
Captain America: The Winter Soldier - Bucky's
Back

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.770
It was only a matter of time until Steve and
Bucky went head-to-head, and when they did,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.280
the bullets and smashed glass didn't disappoint.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.280
From Widow swinging from bridges to Cap being
smashed through city buses, the scene - and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.210
Bucky's knife skills - kept fans on the edge
of their seats.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.880
The reveal that Steve's new enemy was his
former best friend only guaranteed the scene

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.620
would never be forgotten - even though it
was never really a risk.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.560
The Avengers: Age of Ultron - Hulk, Meet Veronica
It's hard to choose one fight from the Avengers'

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.430
second team-up, since the movie is really
one battle after another.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.389
But considering how long comic book fans were
hoping to see Tony Stark's Hulkbuster armor

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.979
- a suit able to withstand, and defeat Hulk
- the final reveal is hard to beat.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.719
Especially with the added on-call part replacement,
making it even easier to beat Hulk by smashing

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:27.080
him through a skyscraper - one floor at a
time.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.229
Guardians of the Galaxy - The Kyln
Everyone loves a prison break, but the one

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.430
featured in James Gunn's space opera turned
out so well, so funny, and so perfectly tailored

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.409
to show each character's personality, Marvel
actually ended up releasing the sequence as

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.940
a free preview ahead of release.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.289
The response was even stronger in the finished
movie, when Rocket, Quill, Gamora, Groot and

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.689
Drax all showed that being a killing machine
doesn't mean you can't be hilarious, too.

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:53.669
Thor: The Dark World - Fun With Portals
The battle between Thor and Malekith may not

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.850
be as clear or satisfying as his fellow Avengers'
biggest fights, but that doesn't mean it isn't

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.319
just as much fun to watch.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.319
As the two men fight, the random, invisible
portals between this realm and others send

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.749
the pair tumbling from one planet to another,
from dirt to sky and back again.

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:10.819
For innovation alone, the scene deserves serious
credit.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.080
Guardians of the Galaxy - Xandar's Defense
Audiences didn't know what to expect when

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.659
Star-Lord teamed up with the Ravagers, but
what they got was a one-of-a-kind aerial attack,

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.990
sending an entire fleet of scavenger ships
to outsmart one massive cruiser.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.250
James Gunn turned to dogfighting references
instead of space ships, and the benefits show.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.559
Plus, once the dogfighting ends, it's time
for the Nova Corps' heroic arrival, and for

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:35.710
Rocket and the Ravagers to play a little live-action
Space Invaders to protect the civilians on

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.710
the ground.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.249
forget Marvel - this is one of the best action
sequences in years, period.

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:44.979
Ant-Man - Small Scale Showdown
From the very first trailers for Marvel's

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:49.430
most unlikely hero, it was obvious the idea
of a shrinking superhero would be played for

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.430
laughs.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.380
The final fights between Ant-Man and Yellow
Jacket didn't have to be fought on ant-scale,

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.620
but the model trains and harmless kids' toys
being turned into completely new weapons meant

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.110
action and comedy - a perfect mix that made
Ant-Man a welcome addition to a shared universe

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.539
already filled with heroes.

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:08.499
The Avengers - Battle of New York
Is it cheating when a movie turns its entire

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:10.949
third act into one massive fight sequence?

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:15.229
Who cares: the battle of New York was everything
a comic book fan could have dreamed of: Cap

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:19.749
leaping over cars and rescuing hostages, Thor
unleasing lightning from New York skyscrapers,

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:24.159
Iron Man flying through urban valleys at breakneck
speed, and Hulk... smashing.

00:08:24.159 --> 00:08:27.990
The cherry on top came in the sweeping shot
flowing from one Avenger to another, not to

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.220
mention the spinning look at the team that
cemented them as Hollywood legends.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.800
Those are the fight scenes from Marvel's first
two phases that most stick out in our memory,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.250
but which ones are your favorites?

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.720
Some memorable ones had to be left off our
list, but make sure to mention them in the

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.410
comments, and remember to subscribe for more
