one of the main streams of my research

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460
one of the main streams of my research
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.610
one of the main streams of my research
for the last more than 10 years have

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
for the last more than 10 years have
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.280
for the last more than 10 years have
been focusing on this honesty and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
been focusing on this honesty and
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.960
been focusing on this honesty and
dishonesty is really interesting because

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
dishonesty is really interesting because
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.790
dishonesty is really interesting because
it's not just about dishonesty it's

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
it's not just about dishonesty it's
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.499
it's not just about dishonesty it's
actually a phenomena that captures

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
actually a phenomena that captures
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.060
actually a phenomena that captures
almost all of the human principles of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
almost all of the human principles of
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.720
almost all of the human principles of
behavior

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
behavior
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.630
behavior
it's about selfishness versus generosity

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
it's about selfishness versus generosity
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.179
it's about selfishness versus generosity

it's about us versus other people it's
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830
it's about us versus other people it's
about rationalization it really kind of

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
about rationalization it really kind of
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.900
about rationalization it really kind of
in captures a lot of things and because

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
in captures a lot of things and because
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.120
in captures a lot of things and because
of these there are lots of forces that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
of these there are lots of forces that
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.030
of these there are lots of forces that
drive dishonesty but here is one way to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
drive dishonesty but here is one way to
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.580
drive dishonesty but here is one way to
start thinking about it when we grow up

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
start thinking about it when we grow up
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430

acceptable and not acceptable and in
that environment white lies are

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
that environment white lies are
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880

basically right so there is a lot of
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440
basically right so there is a lot of
things that we teach kids about how to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
things that we teach kids about how to
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.289

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
but they help you as well and then there
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499
but they help you as well and then there
are lies that are more and more selfish

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
are lies that are more and more selfish
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.170
are lies that are more and more selfish
over time but the interesting thing is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
over time but the interesting thing is
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.209
over time but the interesting thing is
that we learn to line these social realm

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
that we learn to line these social realm
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.340
that we learn to line these social realm
and then when we move to the business

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
and then when we move to the business
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.590
and then when we move to the business
world all of a sudden we're not supposed

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
world all of a sudden we're not supposed
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.949
world all of a sudden we're not supposed
to lie but can we make this transition

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
to lie but can we make this transition
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.930
to lie but can we make this transition
turns out it's very hard to make this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
turns out it's very hard to make this
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.400
turns out it's very hard to make this
transition and it's very hard to make

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
transition and it's very hard to make
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.230
transition and it's very hard to make
this transit

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240
this transit
 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.910
this transit
especially when your social circle and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
especially when your social circle and
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.480
especially when your social circle and
business circles are overlapping I think

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
business circles are overlapping I think
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.280
business circles are overlapping I think
a lot about students at the university

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
a lot about students at the university
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.860
a lot about students at the university
their social cycle which is circle which

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
their social cycle which is circle which
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.020
their social cycle which is circle which
is their friends and campus and the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
is their friends and campus and the
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.580
is their friends and campus and the
people they work with the people that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
people they work with the people that
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.280
people they work with the people that
they collaborate and do papers with and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
they collaborate and do papers with and
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.680
they collaborate and do papers with and
so on are the same people the overlap is

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690
so on are the same people the overlap is
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.530
so on are the same people the overlap is
is almost perfect can we expect them to

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
is almost perfect can we expect them to
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.840
is almost perfect can we expect them to
say oh this is a social realm it's ok to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850
say oh this is a social realm it's ok to
 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.970
say oh this is a social realm it's ok to
be polite this is a professional realm

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980
be polite this is a professional realm
 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.660
be polite this is a professional realm
left me not so so as those circles

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
left me not so so as those circles
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.820
left me not so so as those circles
overlap it's become harder and harder to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830
overlap it's become harder and harder to
 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.460
overlap it's become harder and harder to
keep honesty and not to be dishonest the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
keep honesty and not to be dishonest the
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.130
keep honesty and not to be dishonest the
other thing though is that you know

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
other thing though is that you know
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.509
other thing though is that you know
we've done lots of things in the lab

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519
we've done lots of things in the lab
 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.740
we've done lots of things in the lab
about dishonesty we got people to steal

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750
about dishonesty we got people to steal
 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.660
about dishonesty we got people to steal
money from us and we see when they steal

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
money from us and we see when they steal
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.360
money from us and we see when they steal
more and when they still less but in the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370
more and when they still less but in the
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.259
more and when they still less but in the
last few years I item DUP with the

the end but to start with the first step
 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.600
the end but to start with the first step
and then talk for hours about how the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610
and then talk for hours about how the
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.640
and then talk for hours about how the
first step go to the next step and the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650
first step go to the next step and the
 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.050
first step go to the next step and the
next step and the next step in the next

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060
next step and the next step in the next
 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.539
next step and the next step in the next
step and what is so interesting about

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549
step and what is so interesting about
 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.270
step and what is so interesting about
those stories is that all by one of

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
those stories is that all by one of
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.490
those stories is that all by one of
these stories were stories of slippery

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500
these stories were stories of slippery
 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.740
these stories were stories of slippery
slopes there were stories that you look

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750
slopes there were stories that you look
 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.900
slopes there were stories that you look
at the end and you say I can't imagine

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
at the end and you say I can't imagine
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.509
at the end and you say I can't imagine
doing it but you look at the first step

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
doing it but you look at the first step
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.910
doing it but you look at the first step
and you say you know what I understand

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920
and you say you know what I understand
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.979
and you say you know what I understand
the pressures of that particular

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989
the pressures of that particular
 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.569
the pressures of that particular
situation and under those particulars

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
situation and under those particulars
 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.729
situation and under those particulars
you know I might have acted in the same

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739
you know I might have acted in the same
 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.770
you know I might have acted in the same
way as well so as far as dishonesty goes

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
way as well so as far as dishonesty goes
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.100
way as well so as far as dishonesty goes
we're kind of blinded to the forces that

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110
we're kind of blinded to the forces that
 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.009
we're kind of blinded to the forces that
cause us to be dishonest you know we

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019
cause us to be dishonest you know we
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.180
cause us to be dishonest you know we
look at other people say oh my goodness

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
look at other people say oh my goodness
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.100
look at other people say oh my goodness
these are awful people I am really good

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110
these are awful people I am really good
 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.430
these are awful people I am really good
but we don't really understand how

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440
but we don't really understand how
 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.650
but we don't really understand how
pressures work on us and how likely we

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660
pressures work on us and how likely we
 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.140
pressures work on us and how likely we
could be to just go down take one wrong

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150
could be to just go down take one wrong
 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.060
could be to just go down take one wrong
step and then go down the slippery slope

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070
step and then go down the slippery slope
 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.310
step and then go down the slippery slope
just like lots of other people

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320
just like lots of other people
 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.380
just like lots of other people
