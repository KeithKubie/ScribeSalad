00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here are the series of x, y, and z value that hold in the program as russian(20, 1) executes.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As you can see, there are two times when the value of y is added into z.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Once when x is 5--28 and 0 get added in.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Another time when x is 1--28 and 112 get added in,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we get our correct answer of 140.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
An interesting thing to note here is let's take a look at the sequence of x values.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We have one that's even, another one that's even, one that's odd,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
another one that's even, one that's odd, and another one that's even.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's think for a second about the binary representation of the number 20.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It looks like this--1, 2, 4 plus 8, 16--4 plus 16 is 20. This is the binary representation of 20.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You can see that these zeros line up.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The 1, the 0, the 1, the 0.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Each times it's odd, we do an addition.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Essentially--actually exactly--each time there's a 1 in the binary representation

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of this first value there's going to be an addition that takes place.
