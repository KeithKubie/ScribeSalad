00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.130
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.180
S. Yup. Hey,

3
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:14.990
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. And today, uh,

4
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:19.240
we're gonna, uh, we're gonna feature a story from our friends over at reply all,

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.690
which is a podcast produced by gimlet media hosted by PJ Vogt, Alex Goldman.

6
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.540
We're gonna let you hear a taste of reply all. You know,

7
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.840
cause it's an amazing show. Every, the entire staff's like secret,

8
00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:33.590
favorite show, not even secret actually. And this story, uh,

9
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.230
it just kinda grabbed us now. They,

10
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.450
we're not gonna play you the whole story that they did.

11
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:41.810
We're gonna play you most of it and we may intervene from time to time just to

12
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.070
sort of, cause we, we bubble over with questions. Exactly. And this,

13
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:48.500
this story actually doesn't come from PJ and Alex. It comes from uh,

14
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.530
one of their producers. Shoot DP them on any yes.

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.200
And the story sort of centers around a couple and their son.

16
00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.160
<v 1>So let me start by introducing you to the couple. Amy Green</v>

17
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.720
and Ryan Green. Hello. We have our buffalo chicken. Oh wait,

18
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.460
you got hoppings from yesterday?

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.380
<v 0>No, I already ate those. I think that's why I'm suffering this morning.</v>

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
<v 2>They live in a small house in Loveland, Colorado.</v>

21
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280
They fell in love chatting online, got married. As soon as he turned 21,

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.710
they moved into this house the very next day. Oh. Um,

23
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.370
let me respond to some emails and then we'll head down.

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.650
They had their first son, Caleb, their second son, Isaac. Um,

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.410
Ryan was a computer programmer and Amy took care of the kids.

26
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.080
They were just living in a mess of diapers and toys,

27
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.850
going to church every Sunday.

28
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.823
<v 3>And then</v>

29
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.300
<v 2>in 2009, they had Joel</v>

30
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.390
<v 1>when Joel was born. How old were you? Um, I, gosh,</v>

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.550
I was thinking about this the other day.

32
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.520
If I was 25 when Kayla was born and then when Isaac was born,

33
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.400
I would have been like 27. Yeah, I think I was 28. I was 2,800 was born.

34
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
[inaudible] have figured it out. Everything was normal. Fine.

35
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.560
And then just a little before his first birthday,

36
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.770
Amy noticed that his head was a little tilted,

37
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.380
just kinda cocked to one side. A couple days later he starts throwing up,

38
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.240
can't keep any food down.

39
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.410
And so they do a bunch of tests and the doctor says, listen,

40
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.530
your son has a lesion to cancer.

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.270
So they biopsy the tumor and then they come back with this news that it's

42
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:27.020
something called an ATR t. It's very, very difficult to treat.

43
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:32.021
So when you have an ATR t you go through all the most intense chemotherapy and

44
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.730
all the most intense radiation,

45
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:39.590
they throw the kitchen sink at it and doing that you have about a 50% chance of

46
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:40.940
surviving for five years.

47
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.170
I double check this and it turns out the odds of survival or even grimmer,

48
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.100
it's a 50% chance of surviving just two years.

49
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.160
When you, when you hear it, this kind of news,

50
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.700
is there any part of you that's like, what if you don't do the treatment?

51
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.340
I remember before his first surgery,

52
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 5>asking them a lot about like really have to have chemotherapy and thinking to</v>

53
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.030
myself, cause I can't, we can't, we can't do this. This is crazy.

54
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:07.864
We can't do this.

55
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.260
But then as time wore on and by the time we actually even heard about the,

56
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.850
the tumor, then you're just thinking like, oh well 50% like that's half.

57
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.400
Like we've got a good shot that he gets through this.

58
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.720
<v 6>What do you think Isaac? He's, he's in the hospital,</v>

59
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:25.740
so they're taking care of him.

60
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.940
<v 1>Well this is from a home video of Joel's brothers meeting him in the hospital.</v>

61
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.570
Isaac is two-and-a-half looking kind of scared.

62
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.790
Joel is a little over a year old.

63
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.510
He's lying in a small red wagon hooked up to an IB.

64
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.540
He's skinny and his head is perfectly round. Yeah,

65
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.890
<v 6>this is food is food goes to that too. Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.440
<v 1>So they start going through this treatment.</v>

67
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.770
It starts off with intense radiation and then just, you know,

68
00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:58.250
months of chemotherapy, which I didn't know what that meant.

69
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.630
It means that you just hold the baby for six, seven, eight hours a day.

70
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.640
And you just lie in a bed with them while they get [inaudible]

71
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.120
<v 7>these infusions. Um,</v>

72
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.180
and so it'd be like this eight hour pump and you'd hook it up at night and it

73
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:13.060
would be this like this, a white milky substance, uh,

74
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.410
that would provide all of his nutrition because he couldn't swallow very well.

75
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.440
<v 1>One day it was Amy's shift. She was holding Joel,</v>

76
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.100
<v 5>I was sitting in his, um,</v>

77
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.150
room with him and I was singing him a song and clapping and he was clapping his

78
00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:29.390
hands and then he was sort of like Babel singing along.

79
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.750
And so like for me it was just one of those moments that you felt like, oh,

80
00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:34.070
I'm always going to remember this.

81
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:35.690
Like sometimes you just have a moment and you go,

82
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:37.610
I'm going to remember this the rest of my life.

83
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.180
And then that made me sad because I thought, oh, like,

84
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:44.000
but the reason I think I'll remember this the rest of my life is because he

85
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.710
could die. Um,

86
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.480
until eventually I did just kind of decide like, I think I need to be all in.

87
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:52.000
Like I think I need to love him.

88
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.220
Like mad and I think that we need to live our lives like he's going to live.

89
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.320
<v 1>And that's what they did for a year.</v>

90
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.070
And then in November, 2010 just before Joel second birthday,

91
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.960
the doctors call them in and they say we're really sorry,

92
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.130
Joel has another tumor. All these chemicals we've been pumping into him,

93
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.010
they didn't do anything. And so it's time for us to stop.

94
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.480
He will eventually die. We're not sure, but we think in about four months,

95
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.540
um, you know, this is it. But as shooting goes on to explain in the story,

96
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.980
that definitely wasn't it.

97
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.250
<v 8>Cause there's this one night when the situation was pretty much had its worst</v>

98
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.900
when something happened. Joel had a stomach bug, he was throwing up,

99
00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:40.260
got dehydrated. So Ryan spent the night with him in the hospital.

100
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.223
<v 7>I just remember him,</v>

101
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.890
him really wanting apple juice cause that was one of his favorite things at the

102
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:47.740
hospital. But then I'd give it to him and he just throw it up again

103
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.910
<v 1>and he's crying and crying and his cries just get more frantic and animal.</v>

104
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:58.280
And there's nothing that Ryan can do by the end of the night. Just sunken eyes.

105
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.970
<v 9>But I just remember like I wanted to hold him and I couldn't put him down</v>

106
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.810
because he would get so upset. And, and when Brian finally did put him down,

107
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.260
Joel would start hitting his head against the wall of his crib.

108
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.400
Eventually Ryan himself started to lose it. He was crying too.

109
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.000
And then in the early hours of the morning, you lay down

110
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.330
<v 1>and prayed. And I remember that's when he stopped crying and he fell asleep</v>

111
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.360
<v 0>and it was just one of those,</v>

112
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.910
it's one of those few moments in life where like,

113
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.630
it felt like an answer from God. And um,

114
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.900
it wasn't like I heard a voice or saw, you know,

115
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.270
a burning Bush or anything like that, but it was just,

116
00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:45.240
it felt so much like mercy

117
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.680
<v 10>and beyond just sheer relief. Ryan had this other thought, frankly,</v>

118
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.990
a weird thought. This whole ordeal reminded him of a video game.

119
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.860
Like you have to get the baby to stop crying. So you keep trying things,

120
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:02.840
give him juice, bounce him, talk to him.

121
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.120
But the weird thing is in this awful game, none of those things actually work.

122
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.810
They're all like fake choices. Brian Thought,

123
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.260
what if I could make a game like this where you the player you don't really have

124
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:20.600
control. And so he started [inaudible].

125
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.370
<v 1>I think like I wonder if I could make that I f I, if I could make that scene,</v>

126
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.900
if he could make the scene of Joel in desperation and then give him an option.

127
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.400
Is that the thing is, is there a act of saving? No, no, no.

128
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.670
So he's going to make a video game where everything you do doesn't work.

129
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:37.810
The baby's still Christ. Yeah.

130
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.610
I think he was just intrigued by that because it seemed bizarre. Yeah.

131
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.010
I'll make a video game where you can't do anything except pray.

132
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.990
You has a very high likelihood of being a popular game.

133
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.290
I think the popularity of it was so not essential.

134
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:58.360
He wasn't even thinking that cause he wasn't thinking,

135
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.220
Oh this is the game that I will release.

136
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:04.210
It was almost like a thought experiment right in his brain where he's thinking,

137
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.300
you know, usually people come into a game. I'm trying to solve it.

138
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.360
And I wonder how, if I could make this game where they couldn't,

139
00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:14.730
they would understand me. I how I feel right now. Uh,

140
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.120
I remember he really, he was like,

141
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:19.270
I want to make a game about that day that Joel was dehydrated in the hospital

142
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.780
and I said, that's terrible. That's not a game.

143
00:08:22.781 --> 00:08:23.890
And no one will want to play that.

144
00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:28.600
Like you think that that word game meant like something you do in your leisure

145
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:30.700
time, you know?

146
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:34.900
And so who wants to spend their leisure time reliving the worst moment of a

147
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:39.280
man's life? So I said, do not make that. That is horrible bait.

148
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.250
He caught him to the idea. So finally Amy said, okay,

149
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.390
I'll give you three months.

150
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.860
Thank you. So a few months later,

151
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.530
it's the game developers conference in San Francisco alongside assassin's creed

152
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.270
three battlefield for the new oculus rift VR headset.

153
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.770
<v 11>Okay. Hi everybody. My name is Brian. There was Ryan.</v>

154
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.610
I'm going to talk to you about a personal game that I am making. My son,

155
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:12.120
Joel had just turned one year old that day that we found the monster in his

156
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:16.290
brain standing in front of a bunch of young tech dudes.

157
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.450
They're listening. Diddly Joel is alive and fighting his eighth tumor.

158
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.250
Our doctors fight for him, our family fights for him and we serve a god.

159
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:27.330
That's the god of the living,

160
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:31.740
not the dead in the middle of all this pain and suffering and mud and morass

161
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.750
that cancer is rot in our family.

162
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:37.370
We have a drink of water that's made of hope and love, enlightened.

163
00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:38.340
We hope to share it with

164
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.111
<v 1>Amy,</v>

165
00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:47.030
stayed home fretting because they were almost out of money and she was worried

166
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:49.670
that Ryan would come home feeling crushed,

167
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.700
but that's not what happened. Ryan got back and said

168
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.580
<v 11>it was amazing. This person introduced me to that person.</v>

169
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:00.810
That person is just in that one.

170
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:05.690
There's two or three different people who want to fund my game. Wait,

171
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:06.600
so you're seeing this axiom

172
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.420
<v 1>market for a game like this, so,</v>

173
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.520
so I want to be clear that the world of these kinds of emotional games,

174
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:18.270
it's a small one, right? But there are people there,

175
00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:22.230
investors in there who are looking for games that are doing something different,

176
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.590
looking for games that are meaningful in some way. Um,

177
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.450
and so I think a few of them played through the scene, this dehydration scene,

178
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.330
and they thought, okay, let's,

179
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:37.080
let's like see what a full fledged version of this would be. Um,

180
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.490
and we're just, you know, there's,

181
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.400
it's like the video game generation has grown up, right?

182
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:47.490
Like if you were born in the eighties or the seventies,

183
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.060
like you played games for certain reasons when you're a kid and now we're grown

184
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:54.060
up and we're having these different experiences like a child going through

185
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:58.080
cancer or you know, the death of my father or these things,

186
00:10:58.081 --> 00:11:02.520
which suddenly you're like, why can't I tell these stories with video games?

187
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.120
And what was Amy's reaction when she heard people wanting to fund the game?

188
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.310
It really blew my mind because I'm still just like,

189
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.000
because of your dehydration game that I told you to never make,

190
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.760
and he realizes like, you've never played it.

191
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.880
Like you've never played the scene. So I put on the headphones

192
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.500
<v 2>and she finds herself back in the hospital room.</v>

193
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.070
You don't see Joel, you see an empty crib and you can hear him crying.

194
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.670
You're playing as Ryan.

195
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.340
You can move your mouse around the screen and options appear.

196
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.340
You can give him juice, you can try to bounce him.

197
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.030
You can walk into the bathroom, look at the window.

198
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.560
But no matter what you do, he's crying. Just gets worse and worse.

199
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.370
After five or six minutes of this, Brian sits in a chair,

200
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.210
drops his head into his lap and craze. Oh

201
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.870
yeah. And then with you,

202
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.270
<v 12>the crying stops. [inaudible]</v>

203
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.360
<v 5>so I put on the headphones</v>

204
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.800
and I just lost it and I was just crying and crying and I knew Joel was okay and

205
00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:24.530
he was like right there. Like Joel was right there with us. And,

206
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:30.490
and yet it brought me back to that space and I much more real way than I thought

207
00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:33.980
that a video game could

208
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.970
<v 13>[inaudible]</v>

209
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.260
<v 10>Amy didn't need any more convincing. She said, okay, let's do this.</v>

210
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.740
Let's pull the rest of our savings and make this game.

211
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:50.850
<v 14>[inaudible].</v>

212
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.250
<v 10>They named it that dragon cancer</v>

213
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.510
<v 13>[inaudible].</v>

214
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.840
<v 10>I'm just going to use the same tease that reply all use in their podcasts coming</v>

215
00:13:02.841 --> 00:13:07.550
up, Ryan and Amy encounter what might be the world's biggest design problem.

216
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.083

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and we are back with again,

238
00:15:04.591 --> 00:15:09.270
reply all story. It's about a couple who have a kid who's who's fighting cancer,

239
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.350
and the mom and dad have decided to express the experiences that they're going

240
00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:15.610
through in of all things of video game. Yeah,

241
00:15:15.611 --> 00:15:17.520
so Amy and Ryan and their six person team,

242
00:15:17.521 --> 00:15:19.890
they begin to build these scenes of the game,

243
00:15:19.891 --> 00:15:24.891
these surreal vignettes where you the player you take on different characters

244
00:15:26.071 --> 00:15:28.480
and every scene, your job,

245
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.580
your role basically is to kind of take care of baby Joel.

246
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.370
So let's now go back to the piece and to Cerruti.

247
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.700
The first scene is at the pond. You start off as a doc,

248
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.070
you paddled towards a little boy. It's Joel or this Origami version of him.

249
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.960
He doesn't have eyes or a mouth,

250
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.990
but he has a voice and that is actually Joel's laugh as you hand him pieces of

251
00:15:51.841 --> 00:15:53.890
bread and he throws them into the water.

252
00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:01.440
<v 15>[inaudible] you try to it over those five life. Yeah.</v>

253
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.690
The kids speaking here as Isaac Joel's brother,

254
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.720
but she can't talk. That's true. Yeah.

255
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.650
You can talk. Yeah, no,

256
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.370
it's all well, Joe got sick right after he turned one.

257
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.270
Kind of slowed him down a little bit, buddy.

258
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.260
<v 1>And there's other vignettes like there was this one time in a hospital when to</v>

259
00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:35.440
keep Joel entertained. Ryan blew up surgical gloves, like balloons.

260
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.660
It's this gorgeous scene where you see Joel floating into the nighttime sky,

261
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.230
towards the moon, holding onto these surgical bleedings

262
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.830
and then you see these black birds appear from the corner. Wow.

263
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.520
That's the cancer. And it popped the balloons one by one.

264
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.420
And throughout these scenes, you play many games. You discover rooms,

265
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.780
listen to voicemails from Amy. There's even little levels you can beat.

266
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.140
But the cancer is always around the edges of this world thorny and black and

267
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:12.064
creeping in.

268
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.343
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

269
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.140
<v 1>and at one point you'll arrive here.</v>

270
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:21.450
The waiting room were doctors tell Amy and Ryan that Joel's cancer is terminal.

271
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.010
As they break the news,

272
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.700
rain starts pouring into the room and Ryan slowly starts to slip under the

273
00:17:29.701 --> 00:17:30.534
water.

274
00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.150
<v 14>We've given you a lot to think about already today.</v>

275
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.470
We're going to have you come back on Monday and we can talk about palliative

276
00:17:37.471 --> 00:17:38.304
treatment.

277
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.030
[inaudible] care

278
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.953
managing.

279
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.560
<v 1>Just to jump in for one second, uh, we asked through t,</v>

280
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:04.770
so as Ryan and Amy and the team were crafting these scenes,

281
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.520
what was happening with Joel? And she says, what happened?

282
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.970
Surprised everybody thing that happened was that tumor where, you know,

283
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:15.300
the doctor said, listen, he's terminal. It's going to be over soon.

284
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.700
They radiate the tumor and it goes away.

285
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.280
And then a few months later he gets another tumor.

286
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.450
They radiate and it goes away. And then this happens again and again and again.

287
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.160
And so he's two years old. He's three years old, he's four years old.

288
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.890
He's doing things that the doctors never thought he would do. Like he,

289
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.470
<v 11>he turned two and a half and said his first word. Oh No, Nah.</v>

290
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.660
He starts to swallow again. Show, don't check.

291
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:49.590
The food starts to walk when he's three

292
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.750
<v 1>he just became this miracle baby.</v>

293
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.480
Somebody in their church said they had a vision.

294
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.930
A woman in the church told her that she had a vision that Joel would do great

295
00:19:01.931 --> 00:19:02.764
things.

296
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.950
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

297
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.840
<v 1>another reason they wanted to make this about Joel is because they felt as if,</v>

298
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.940
you know, as Christians,

299
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.960
they were living a miracle and they wanted to share this with people and show

300
00:19:16.961 --> 00:19:17.794
them

301
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.260
and then a doctor calls them in and he says, listen,

302
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.490
Joel has a new tumor, but this tumor is different.

303
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.250
It's in a place that we've already radiated.

304
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:35.110
He explained to us that the cannot continue to radiate an area too much or it

305
00:19:35.111 --> 00:19:40.111
can cause a brain death and it was right on the brainstem.

306
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.330
The doctors say, we're not going to radiate this time,

307
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.690
and what happened to Joel, his condition like very rapidly deteriorated.

308
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.730
He was having more trouble breathing. He can't swallow again.

309
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.850
A lot of the things that he was able to do like walk and eat, he's,

310
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.640
he stops and so

311
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.670
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

312
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.420
<v 1>they invite their entire church community to come to their house and pray.</v>

313
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.160
We had a prayer night just praying for him to be healed and we just had everyone

314
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:14.880
over and we spent hours just worshiping and praying.

315
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.330
There's video footage of this night. It's in their small living room.

316
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.660
There's family members, friends, people from their church community.

317
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.000
Ryan is holding Joel and they're praying,

318
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.580
<v 11>oh, we have his death here on this earth. That's all we have.</v>

319
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.800
The only hope we have is your resurrection gone.

320
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:38.180
So why would the hope hurt us? All I have is my disappointment.

321
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.890
That's what I start with.

322
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.563
<v 4>Wow.</v>

323
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.580
<v 11>But I hope that that you filled my disappointment that you make it right,</v>

324
00:20:45.581 --> 00:20:47.770
that you redeem it pink. You got it

325
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.450
<v 5>blind. Who See? And it's the deaf here and again,</v>

326
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.920
I've got, I believe you do all of them.

327
00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.080
[inaudible] my child.

328
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.380
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

329
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.150
<v 14>what's your strongest memory from</v>

330
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.103
<v 4>that night?</v>

331
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.480
<v 14>I think it's just realizing that he was going</v>

332
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.523
<v 4>did have that thing</v>

333
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.480
[inaudible]

334
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.480
<v 14>it's that space of being with a bunch of people that desperately want the same</v>

335
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:32.611
thing that you will and are crying out for that grace and that mercy to kind of

336
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:34.960
invade a situation.

337
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:45.410
Joel died later that night. It was march 13, 2014 I feel like in a way,

338
00:21:45.411 --> 00:21:48.440
because we were believing that he would be healed and because we were believing

339
00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:51.140
that even if he died, maybe he'd be raised from the dead. Like,

340
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.690
which is why all the new settle after. But that your story,

341
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.850
cause it's weird and I still get that. It's weird. Um,

342
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.260
but because we still believed that she could live,

343
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.350
I feel like we didn't go through all the processes of getting ready for him to

344
00:22:06.351 --> 00:22:10.310
die the way that maybe you would if you were certain that this was it.

345
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.210
<v 0>So at this point in the Tail Street, he tells us, well,</v>

346
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.950
they had to finish the game.

347
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:22.990
I mean they'd invested an enormous amount of time and heart and talent in

348
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:27.040
building this game. But now the facts have changed. Yeah,

349
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:31.030
it started as a game that was supposed to be about the experience of fighting

350
00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:36.031
cancer but also the experience of triumphing over cancer but can't be that game

351
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:40.030
anymore. So like what do you do as game designers, as parents,

352
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.300
how do you finish a game where you don't have many choices and you can't win for

353
00:22:46.021 --> 00:22:49.850
this part? As we were talking with street t, I mean it's so visual. Mm. Uh,

354
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.000
she just sat down and walked us through as descriptively as she could.

355
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.830
How Ryan and Amy Particularly Ryan tried to solve this design problem.

356
00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.720
<v 1>The end of the game, they weren't sure,</v>

357
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:06.220
but it was basically going to be a two part scene where there's the moment of

358
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:09.430
his death. Yeah. And they weren't sure how to do that,

359
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.680
but there's a moment of his death and right after that,

360
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:14.440
a moment where he goes to happen,

361
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:19.441
essentially there was this little island and so Ryan sets about making the scene

362
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:25.120
of his death. It starts off pretty simple. If it's in a hospital,

363
00:23:25.121 --> 00:23:29.890
there's little Joel sitting on a green chair and there are some tubes of this

364
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:33.380
neon fluid feeding into him. And there's, um,

365
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.070
these pipes that rise up above him,

366
00:23:36.071 --> 00:23:39.040
which are like pipe organ pipes and there was a little bit of game play where

367
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:42.430
you can play the pipe organ anyway. And then, and then after that he said,

368
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.840
well this isn't, this isn't enough. This is the where

369
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.430
<v 11>my son dies. And so it must be just like epic.</v>

370
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.520
And so he creates this almost European style,

371
00:23:53.521 --> 00:23:56.620
like oversized cathedral where, you know,

372
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.620
the walls are soaring up and the ceilings are intercut and contain all of these

373
00:24:01.621 --> 00:24:05.590
different, um, um, like body, like the,

374
00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:10.140
it's almost as if he's coding Joel's body into the architecture. So he has,

375
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:10.651
you know,

376
00:24:10.651 --> 00:24:13.950
pieces that look like ribs and there's this part that looks like his heart.

377
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.560
I can show you guys these pictures. It's, so, I'm trying to think,

378
00:24:16.561 --> 00:24:20.640
how are you doing on your laptop to the glass? Yeah, this is, so just quickly,

379
00:24:20.641 --> 00:24:24.870
I want to show you that this is, yeah. So that's, that's amazing, right?

380
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.100
That's amazing.

381
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:34.130
<v 1>He's so pretty. I was not prepared for the beauty of this.</v>

382
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.430
It's very intricate.

383
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.540
Interlacing arches light cascading down.

384
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.870
That's the catacombs and stained glass,

385
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.320
these very ornate ceilings. Um,

386
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:50.300
and so we start to building that and it's beautiful and it just gets bigger and

387
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:53.480
bigger. And then suddenly he feels like, you know, this is too light.

388
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.100
And so then the cathedral becomes a place of darkness and all the lights are

389
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:02.840
neon. Oh, so no, it's very dope. There's trees growing into the cathedral now.

390
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.740
That's the cancer. Huh? And then he's in this space and he's like,

391
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:10.340
so what should people be able to do in this space? We have all this, you know,

392
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:12.860
these tubes and things for, for Chemo.

393
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.040
I want to put in the machines that were keeping Joel alive.

394
00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:20.300
So we were feeding him, uh, with these nutrition ivy things.

395
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:25.301
We had these oxygen tanks and so he starts building actual equipment that the

396
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:28.850
user would have to like fiddle with the levers and you know,

397
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:30.890
make things just right. So that,

398
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.460
that Joel's getting what he needs to stay alive. But then he thinks,

399
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:40.250
oh well if they do it wrong, then they'll feel as if Joel died because of them.

400
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.550
And that's terrible. And so then he says, you know what, scrap this whole thing.

401
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.870
Shoot. They showed us maybe 60 different sketches,

402
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.340
a different iterations of the cathedral that were all super detailed in a kind

403
00:25:52.341 --> 00:25:56.330
of Terry Gilliam on steroids sort of way. Like for instance,

404
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.180
there was one sketch where Ryan had, had, had,

405
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:04.181
had built an entire amusement park in the cathedral and that was supposed to

406
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:07.190
represent all of Jill's favorite things. And then he's like, wait,

407
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:10.250
but now it's all, there's just like too much stuff. It's distracting.

408
00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:15.251
So then he takes out the whole amusement park and then he puts in these prayer

409
00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:16.724
candles

410
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.430
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

411
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.211
<v 1>cause he's like, you know,</v>

412
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:24.320
really what I want people to take away is this feeling I had on the last night

413
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:28.490
of Joel's life where all you can do now is pray. Um,

414
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.390
and so you light one of these candles and you hear a prayer from that night.

415
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:33.980
<v 14>Lord, my God,</v>

416
00:26:33.981 --> 00:26:38.090
with this Holly's life returned to him and let you go.

417
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.930
<v 1>Awesome. And it's been hard I think for both of us to get to a place where we,</v>

418
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.510
it can't say all the things,

419
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:48.360
the cathedral can't say all the things we want it to say.

420
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.090
Just have to cut something else and that game cause we couldn't finish it.

421
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.410
And it's hard cause you just want to never finish it and make it as beautiful as

422
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:58.140
possible. And I don't know,

423
00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:01.140
like there's a part of me that feels like we betray the project by finishing it

424
00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:04.740
and by saying it can only be so much, but of course they have to finish it.

425
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.320
There's investors, there's a release date.

426
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.200
<v 7>What's disappointing to me is how quickly it fades.</v>

427
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.920
Joel, how, how the memories and the,

428
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.810
that person of Joel Fades because he's not here. He's uh,

429
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.190
he becomes more and more an idea. This,

430
00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.580
this game is not him. It's just an echo of him. It's not,

431
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.920
it's not even the best echo of him.

432
00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.790
I think that's the thing that I'm struggling with as we've,

433
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.720
as we're approaching the end of this, like what did we do? What did we,

434
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:41.920
what did we do all this for a while. Why is it that, why did we do this?

435
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:42.880
[inaudible]

436
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.950
<v 1>the game is coming out mid January.</v>

437
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.130
The Cathedral to Ryan will always be,

438
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.260
<v 7>I'm finished. Can you show me the last scene with the pancakes? Sure.</v>

439
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.433
<v 16>Yeah.</v>

440
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.980
<v 1>Ryan was able to finish the place that comes right after the cathedral.</v>

441
00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.800

You find yourself in a boat next to Joel. There's no oars.
