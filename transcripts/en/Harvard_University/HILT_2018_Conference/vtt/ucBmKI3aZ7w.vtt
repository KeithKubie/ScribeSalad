00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.450
My name is Erin Driver-Linn,
and I am no longer the Director

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.920
of HILT. Yes, I am the dean for
education at the Harvard T.H.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.020
Chan School of Public Health--

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.500
best school in the
entire university.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.580
It's got an amazing,
amazing mission.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.860
Amazing students,
amazing faculty.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.840
I'm having a great
time five weeks in.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.170
I have the honor of
introducing our new president.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.130
Many of you will have been
reading lots about him.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.530
Many of you will be
attending his inauguration

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.510
and you'll hear more about him.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.330
There is a bio in the
program, so I'm not

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.060
going to do the
standard introduction.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.910
I will tell you a little
story about the first time

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.100
I met President Bacow.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.745
It was in 2011-- and he
will not remember this one.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:00.620
He remembers a lot of
things, but he will not

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.545
remember this one.

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:07.790
It was at a kind of event,
and there was a buffet table.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.130
And I was talking
with a friend of mine,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.840
and she said,
that's Larry Bacow.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.280
And I said, oh.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.930
And she said, do
you know who he is?

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.780
And he said, no.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.420
She said, just joined
the corporation.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.340
Former president of Tufts.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.460
Used to be at MIT.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.620
I was like, oh, wow.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.176
I probably should
have known who he was.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.300
She said, I want to say hi.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.085
Do you think that
would be too forward?

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:38.440
I said, I don't know,
do you know him?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.460
And she's like, a little bit.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.720
But I think he remembers
people, and I think he'd be OK.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.110
And then she said, he's the kind
of person I want to work for.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.290
And I said, why?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.680
And she said, because
I'd learned a lot.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.810
And I said, in a good way?

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.420
And she said, absolutely
in a good way.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.900
He is through and
through an educator.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.630
And no offense, not in that
like teaching and learning way,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.420
but really, he knows stuff.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.090
He's a role model, and
he gets stuff done.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.350
And I really remembered that.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.000
She interrupted him as he
was loading up his plate

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.590
and reintroduced herself.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.930
And introduced me quickly
and I gracefully left.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.180
But I remember that.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.780
All of those components, the
educator through and through,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.520
not in the teaching
and learning way,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.780
which is kind of interesting.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.730
And that he deeply cares
about learning and teaching

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.930
and it's part of who he is.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.760
And so we invited him to
our first TILT conference,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.760
and he said yes and
he came quickly.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.790
And-- I mean, he answered
quickly, not everybody does.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.840
Since he's been more
part of my mattering map,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.290
I've had the great occasion of
working with him several times.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.470
And the thing is, so many
of you have also had that.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.930
And it's another part
of my observation

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.970
here, which is that he--

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.610
President Barkow engages.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.500
He shows up, he is
involved, he is constantly

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.620
learning from all of us,
from every interaction,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.230
and he's constantly teaching.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.600
And I am really excited about
this next phase of Harvard's

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.510
history, and what
we're going to do

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.160
with this institution
in this next era.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.760
And I am happy that
he is at the helm.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.890
And you'll have to
forgive me for this,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.370
I hope he also has
a hand on the HILT.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.900
Please join me in
welcoming President Bacow.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.870
Wow.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.459
I've been introduced quite a few
times recently, here at Harvard

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.350
and elsewhere, but I
don't think I've ever

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.140
had an introduction quite
as nicer or as personal

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.390
as that one, Erin, so
thank you very, very much.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.200
It's really great to be here
on so many different levels.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.430
As Erin said, I was present
here at the very first HILT

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.600
conference.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.330
And Erin really helped to
bring this whole enterprise

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.900
into the world.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.100
And when we think about
what we do with our lives

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.780
and what we accomplished and the
people that we influence, Erin,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.930
through your good work, through
helping to elevate teaching

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.840
and learning on the
agenda for Harvard,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.990
you've had a profound
impact on a place

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.700
that I think really matters,
and I think all of us

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.640
should thank you at
this point for helping

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.128
to make this happen.

00:05:15.128 --> 00:05:18.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.600
But nobody gets anything
done on their own,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.120
and there are
other people who've

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.520
been involved here as well.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.160
And I just want to take
a minute and acknowledge

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.950
Peter Bol, Harvard's
first Vice Provost

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.840
for Advances in Learning.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.420
And I also want to
acknowledge his successor,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.050
and that's Bharat Anana and
his colleague Dustin Tingly,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.580
who I think are
going to continue

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.500
the great work that Peter
and Erin have really

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.850
started on our behalf.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.160
As I like to say,
nothing succeeds

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.920
in life like a successor.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.060
And we are fortunate that
we have good ones here.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.300
As Erin mentioned, and
I also just alluded to,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.510
I was fortunate to be here
for the very first HILT

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.570
conference in 2012.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.340
What she didn't mention, though,
is that that was actually

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.430
my first public appearance
as a member of the Harvard

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.270
Corporation anywhere.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.970
So this is where I--

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.550
like my coming out as
a corporation member.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.500
And I remember serving on
a panel with Youngme Moon,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.730
with Alan Garber, and
with Michael Sandel.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.610
And in retrospect,
the title of the panel

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.090
was quite prescient,
because it said--

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.010
it was entitled-- remember this?

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.620
"Looking to the Future."

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.210
Now I must say, I could not have
imagined this future [LAUGHS]

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.370
at the time, but as I
often say to my students,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.850
the best piece of career
advice I can give them

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.940
is to recognize opportunity
when it walks up and hits you

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.890
in the face.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.730
And in the interest
of full disclosure,

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.190
I did not go looking
for this job,

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.250
but I also could not
turn away from it,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.700
because these are difficult and
challenging times for higher

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.030
education.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.380
I see this as an opportunity
not just to lead Harvard,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.690
but to be an advocate for the
enduring values of colleges

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.760
and universities and
higher education more

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.110
broadly as enablers of
the American dream for so

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.440
many of us.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.850
And I would hope that
all of you would see that

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.310
as part of your
work, your mission

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:46.670
as well in trying to advance
teaching and learning.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.510
But here I am.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.349
I should also disclose to
you that this is the Harvard

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:54.890
Initiative for
learning and teaching,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.480
but it was really kicked off by
two extraordinary people, Gus

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.420
and Rita Hauser, whose
gift made this possible.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.030
And again, the
world is connected

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.160
in very interesting ways.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.180
I was the first Hauser
Leader-in-Residence

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.100
at the Kennedy School
after I stepped down

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.320
as president of Tufts.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.770
And so I remember at the
HILT conference thanking

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.220
Gus and Rita for their
generous gift, which made

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.650
all of this good work possible.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.580
And then I had a
second opportunity

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.800
to thank them when I was
appointed as the Hauser

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.700
Leader-in-Residence.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.557
And now that while
they're not here,

00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:35.390
maybe they're watching,
because Rita is very

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.090
good at watching things online.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.549
Gus and Rita, thank
you again for all

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:45.050
that you have made possible.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.310
I was talking to Bob Kerrey, who
you will hear from a little bit

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.220
later today, about
some of the challenges

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.960
that we face in
higher education--

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.390
as we face as Harvard.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.960
And one of them is that
we are perceived as elite

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.780
at a time in which that
has become a dirty word

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.250
in the United States.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.990
In fact, I like to
say, the only thing

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:11.060
which seems to be an appropriate
word to be modified by elite

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.660
is quarterback.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.270
To be an elite
university is bad,

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.500
to have an elite quarterback,
that's OK, people like that.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.950
And I prefer to think that
what we stand for is not elite,

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.130
but rather, we stand
for excellence.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.640
We stand for excellence in
everything that we do here.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.430
And one of the things which I
feel so good about with respect

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:43.850
to HILT is that you
have really elevated

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.990
our commitment to excellence
in teaching and learning.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.720
And just looking at what's
happened in the seven years

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.080
since the very first
conference, people

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.850
are talking about how
do students learn.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.440
We're digging into data,
we're mucking around

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.470
and trying to understand the
information, the meaning of all

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.000
the clicks and the online
work that's being done,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.480
and sorting through
the big data that way.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.870
In thinking about how we teach,
especially with technology

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.020
that's forced us to reflect
much harder about how

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.360
we organize our information.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.150
What are our students
actually learning?

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.830
And so I think this is an
incredibly interesting time

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.030
at Harvard, as faculty and
students and staff and others

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:32.500
are really focused in a
very concentrated, deep way

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.340
in trying to understand how
we can do a better job to help

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.720
our students learn--

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.160
how we understand different ways
in which our students learn,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.160
because one of the things
which we appreciate

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.440
to a much greater degree
is that not all students

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.010
learn the same way.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.980
How do we adapt our
teaching so that--

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.850
and now I will use an MIT term--
there is a far better impedance

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.750
match between what we're trying
to-- the information we're

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.940
trying to convey and the way in
which our students understand

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.440
it.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.230
We become sensitive to
all of those things.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.460
And as a result, I think we're
a much better institution

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.120
as a result.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.020
But I want to issue a
challenge for all of you

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.880
today in your work.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.710
And the challenge is this--

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.450
the reality is, only a very,
very small number of students

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.780
are ever going to
study at Harvard.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.850
And so the challenge
is, how do we

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.510
think about what
we are doing here

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.370
and what we are
learning here, how

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.870
can we ensure that that
benefits all of the students who

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.020
are seeking to get an
education in the United States?

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.490
Four out of five
kids in the US are

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.370
going to be educated at the
great public universities

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.640
of America.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.320
And I think it's
imperative that we take on

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.330
as our responsibility
that what we do here

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.980
translates elsewhere.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.830
That we reach out,
we extend ourselves,

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.470
we try and help
other institutions,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.430
and that we do so as
true partners, OK?

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.830
Not we're from Harvard and
we figured out how to do it

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.990
and here we are,
but rather where

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.660
we engage with
other institutions

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.070
as humble partners, as
generous partners, where

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.550
we try to learn from them and
we try to share what we have

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.920
learned here with them as well.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.260
That is a true partnership.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.140
Because we need to ensure that
the lessons that we learn here

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.920
benefit and help everybody,
and the education of students

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.860
who will never set
foot in Harvard Yard,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.440
never even see the
city of Cambridge.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.880
So today I ask that you
begin thinking through some

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.940
of these questions, some of
these critical issues, which

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.070
are so important, I think, for
all of us in higher education--

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.590
for the values
that we stand for,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.490
and I hope you will
also help to join me

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.050
as we seek to try and change
this narrative about higher

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.280
education.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.640
That to help people
understand that we

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.900
exist not to make
Harvard great, but rather

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.750
to make the world better.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.380
And that that, ultimately, is
what we are doing here today.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.780
So thank you very much for
inviting me to join you.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.510
Good luck with the work
that you will do today.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.370
I'm sorry that my
schedule will not

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.330
permit me to sit in
and attend, but I

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.760
have the privilege of ending
my day with Erin wearing

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.784
her other hat at the
School of Public Health,

00:13:43.784 --> 00:13:45.200
and she's told me
that she's going

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.110
to give me a full and complete
report on your conversations.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.050
So thank you all very
much and have a great day.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:52.650
Take care.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.000
