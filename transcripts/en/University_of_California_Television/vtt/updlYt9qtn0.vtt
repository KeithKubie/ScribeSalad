00:00:12.923 --> 00:00:17.090
- It is my pleasure to introduce
back to the podium again

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:25.322
at this conference for, I
dunno, the third or third time,

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:29.489
Dr. Elliott Sherr, speaking
on a neurologist's perspective

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:34.575
of the differential diagnosis of autism,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.325
and Elliott, as many of you know,

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:41.679
is professor of neurology and pediatrics

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.871
and with the Institute of Human Genetics.

00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:45.704
Dr. Sherr.

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:50.450
(audience applauding)

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.936
- Okay, let's see if I can make this work.

00:00:56.936 --> 00:01:00.033
Okay, those are my disclosures.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:04.200
And so in 29 minutes, I'm
gonna answer the question,

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:10.364
what is autism, what causes
autism, what looks like autism,

00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:13.513
how do we investigate,
how and when can we treat

00:01:13.513 --> 00:01:17.236
and how do we get to Tahiti
as quickly as possible.

00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:19.625
So I'm gonna touch on all of these topics

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.792
and see if I can provide a perspective

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.419
that'll hopefully be complementary

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.931
to Dr. Leventhal's that'll follow.

00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:33.098
So, you know, as somebody
who had the pleasure or not

00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:39.438
of majoring in philosophy
as an undergraduate,

00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:42.178
we always talked about
the null hypothesis,

00:01:42.178 --> 00:01:45.426
so that's the thing that
you're trying to disprove,

00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:50.127
but if you can't disprove
it, then that might be true,

00:01:50.127 --> 00:01:54.294
so maybe autism doesn't exist,
so that's the first question,

00:01:56.691 --> 00:02:00.858
and then its mirror image, if
you have a different idea is

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:05.236
that autism is a singular
biological entity,

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:07.382
and obviously, both of these are straw men

00:02:07.382 --> 00:02:09.799
to get you to think about the fact

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.118
that autism is a collection of conditions

00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:16.035
that have shared clinical features,

00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:22.754
and one sort of simplistic
way of thinking about this is

00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:31.945
at the top, you have the
clinical manifestations,

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:35.695
and those are supported
or caused by a number

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:39.729
of different layers that contribute

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.958
to that final clinical phenotype

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.138
that you're observing in your patient.

00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:49.120
So one whole group is the
kinds of clinical phenotypes

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.639
that are revealed by standardized
clinical assessments,

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.154
so something like an ADOS
or an IQ test shed light

00:02:56.154 --> 00:03:00.319
on what you're observing as a clinician.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.038
I'm not gonna talk a lot about it,

00:03:02.038 --> 00:03:06.332
but there's a developing field
that's looking at biomarkers,

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:09.999
so other surrogates for
the final diagnosis.

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.615
Obviously, one of the
things that I'm gonna talk

00:03:13.615 --> 00:03:17.378
zero about but I think is
probably incredibly important

00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:20.862
is gene by environment
interactions, and then finally,

00:03:20.862 --> 00:03:22.955
something I'm gonna
talk a little bit about,

00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:25.786
but you've probably heard
a lot about in the news

00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:27.413
are what we would call the primary causes

00:03:27.413 --> 00:03:30.905
of some cases of autism, and it turns out

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:33.784
that some of the cases of autism have

00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:37.201
single causes or highly penetrant causes.

00:03:41.798 --> 00:03:46.515
So if we think about the
overall etiologies of autism,

00:03:46.515 --> 00:03:50.894
this is sort of my
breakdown of what I think is

00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:55.061
the likely set of conditions,
and so idiopathic polygenic,

00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:00.666
so what we would call
a typical autistic kid,

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.953
that's gonna make up about 50%, and again,

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:09.272
I think that it's polygenic
but probably also has

00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:12.970
other roles, other etiologies,
and then I'm gonna talk

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.371
today more about the top 20%, the ones

00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:20.871
that we would call syndromic or monogenic,

00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:25.326
meaning a single gene
that's highly penetrant

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:27.348
that doesn't present in a syndromic way

00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:31.515
but just presents clinically
as autism and nothing else.

00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:37.851
Okay, so as a neurologist, I'm called upon

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:41.964
not to make a clinical
diagnosis of autism,

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:44.748
although that happens sometimes,
but I'm typically asked

00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:47.191
to help out to answer the question,

00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:52.182
is there a single genetic
cause or biochemical cause

00:04:52.182 --> 00:04:55.849
or brain anatomic cause
that leads to autism

00:04:57.652 --> 00:05:00.589
and/or other clinical symptoms?

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.756
And one of the main goals of
this kind of differential,

00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:08.920
this kind of investigation, is to make it

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.339
as efficient as possible,
so if I tested every kid

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:16.692
with autism with the full
battery of tests at my disposal,

00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:19.862
I would probably have a
low yield on those tests,

00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:21.580
and some of those tests would have a yield

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.393
as low as one percent
or even less than that,

00:05:24.393 --> 00:05:27.485
and so when it gets to
that level of yield,

00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:30.806
you begin to wonder
whether it has any utility,

00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:33.950
but rather, what I'm gonna
show you here in this slide,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.297
and this is actually kind
of like a springboard

00:05:36.297 --> 00:05:38.941
for the rest of the talk, is can you use

00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:43.159
your clinical skills
to enhance that yield?

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.052
So can you identify the kids that are

00:05:45.052 --> 00:05:47.966
much more likely to have single gene

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:51.967
or other single biochemical
or other causes,

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:54.200
and so what I've done here is I've tried

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.554
to outline some of those
things that I'm gonna look at.

00:05:57.554 --> 00:06:00.278
So one of them that I think
is very, very important is

00:06:00.278 --> 00:06:04.445
regression, so meaning that
a child clearly had language,

00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:10.266
clearly had social interactions,
and then lost them.

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:13.124
Now, there's a kind of
autism where people say

00:06:13.124 --> 00:06:16.441
it's regression where
they have a few words

00:06:16.441 --> 00:06:19.011
around a year of age
and then they lose them.

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.700
I'm leaving that out because I think

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.451
that that's probably a
different biological process,

00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:25.409
but I'm talking about the kid who,

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.362
at three years of age or
two and a half years of age,

00:06:28.362 --> 00:06:31.889
who had a couple hundred
words, starts losing them.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.056
That's when you pick up the
phone and call me that day.

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:39.847
Another term that we like to
use, but it's kind of like

00:06:39.847 --> 00:06:42.459
an overused term, but encephalopathy,

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:45.896
so is the kid alert and interactive

00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:48.815
or does the kid seem kind of zoned out?

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:52.709
And if the latter is true,
that can be concerning

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:56.235
for a number of different reasons.

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:59.081
Obviously, if the child is having seizures

00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:01.936
or other neurologic manifestations,

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:06.117
that should also trigger
this kind of an evaluation.

00:07:06.117 --> 00:07:09.928
Things like spasticity or actual weakness,

00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:12.098
not just hypotonia, but true weakness,

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.572
or if the weakness is asymmetric,

00:07:14.572 --> 00:07:19.158
so one side hemiparesis, one
side is weaker than the other.

00:07:19.158 --> 00:07:23.802
Exam findings, things
like dysmorphic features

00:07:23.802 --> 00:07:27.773
or changes in the head
size should also trigger

00:07:27.773 --> 00:07:30.429
an evaluation by a neurologist,

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:33.996
and then the other one is involvement

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:37.829
of other functional
systems, so if the kid has

00:07:38.787 --> 00:07:42.454
lung malformations or
has a heart condition,

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.192
those are other things that make you think

00:07:46.192 --> 00:07:49.859
maybe there's a metabolic
or a genetic cause

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:53.705
that underlies all of those conditions

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:56.589
in sort of Occam's razor
as a unified whole,

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:58.861
and then also, even though there can be

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:02.742
positive family histories
in idiopathic autism,

00:08:02.742 --> 00:08:04.886
I think if there's a
positive family history

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:09.383
that that also requires
a genetic evaluation.

00:08:09.383 --> 00:08:13.052
Okay, so keep all of that in
mind as we move along here,

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:16.442
and so now that you have those tools,

00:08:16.442 --> 00:08:19.507
you can then sort of use that information

00:08:19.507 --> 00:08:23.069
to decide who's gonna come
see a child neurologist

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:25.997
and if they come to see
me, what am I gonna do?

00:08:25.997 --> 00:08:28.609
Well, you know, it's
like basically saying,

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:31.940
if you have a carpenter and
he has hammers and nails,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.354
what is he gonna do?

00:08:33.354 --> 00:08:36.609
He's, you know, gonna use
them, and so as a neurologist,

00:08:36.609 --> 00:08:40.748
I'm gonna use the tools that
are at my disposal besides,

00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:44.410
obviously, a careful
examination and history taking,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.691
I'm gonna use other tools
to arrive at a diagnosis,

00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:50.608
and I've listed some of these here.

00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:57.263
A first pass, so if you
look at the guidelines

00:08:57.263 --> 00:08:59.374
from the American Academy of Neurology

00:08:59.374 --> 00:09:02.820
or the American Academy of
Pediatrics on evaluating

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.154
a kid with neurodevelopmental
disorders writ large,

00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:10.631
not just autism, but all
neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:12.798
that includes a brain MRI.

00:09:13.837 --> 00:09:16.187
It includes some basic genetic testing,

00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:19.283
which I've listed here,
microarray and fragile X.

00:09:19.283 --> 00:09:22.654
Oftentimes, but not always,
depending on the judgment

00:09:22.654 --> 00:09:26.821
of the clinician, it involves
biochemical evaluations

00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:31.555
and can also, depending on the patient,

00:09:31.555 --> 00:09:35.167
for instance, if there's
encephalopathy or regression,

00:09:35.167 --> 00:09:38.055
one of the things that you
should be thinking about are

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.647
abnormal electrical activity
that may not present

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:45.814
as a seizure overtly, but may
actually cause regression.

00:09:47.982 --> 00:09:52.700
Okay, and all of these, as
you see, lead to referrals

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.278
of specialists, whether
that be a child neurologist

00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:59.777
or my colleagues in genetics
who run an exome clinic,

00:09:59.777 --> 00:10:02.406
and I'll talk about
exomes in just a moment,

00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:05.637
or a referral to a metabolic specialist

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:08.304
if there are metabolic concerns.

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:13.610
Okay, so here are just
three simple examples

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.943
of brain imaging that, if you found this

00:10:18.556 --> 00:10:21.087
in a kid that had impaired cognition,

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:24.221
you would go down a very different pathway

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:26.252
in terms of working that kid up.

00:10:26.252 --> 00:10:29.757
Now, you still might want to
treat that child's behavior

00:10:29.757 --> 00:10:33.068
with behavioral intervention
or with medication,

00:10:33.068 --> 00:10:35.796
but there are other things that
you would wanna do as well.

00:10:35.796 --> 00:10:38.616
So the first one here is an example

00:10:38.616 --> 00:10:41.111
called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.

00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:45.634
This is a rare condition
but it presents in early

00:10:45.634 --> 00:10:49.671
school age children with
loss of cognitive milestones.

00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:53.061
That's sort of the
hallmark of this condition.

00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:57.144
Behavioral changes, loss
of developmental skills,

00:10:58.294 --> 00:11:00.755
and that should trigger
an immediate evaluation

00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:03.939
by a neurologist because if I catch this

00:11:03.939 --> 00:11:06.189
sort of at the phase that's shown here

00:11:06.189 --> 00:11:09.916
with these white areas
in the back of the head,

00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:11.880
then that child would be eligible

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.825
for a bone marrow transplantation,

00:11:13.825 --> 00:11:18.655
which would arrest the
progression of the disease.

00:11:18.655 --> 00:11:21.412
If you don't do that, then
the child can progress

00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:25.103
to basically a very, very
severe case of spastic

00:11:25.103 --> 00:11:29.514
cerebral palsy with profound
impairment in cognition.

00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:34.289
This now is being screened
for in the newborn blood spots

00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:37.880
as of literally just
this week, so we'll start

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.488
to pick these kids up early
and we'll follow them along

00:11:41.488 --> 00:11:45.066
and then right as they're
starting to show these symptoms,

00:11:45.066 --> 00:11:46.692
'cause to make life complicated,

00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:48.895
not everyone with a
genetic condition goes on

00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:51.858
to have the clinical disease,
we will then intervene

00:11:51.858 --> 00:11:54.775
with a bone marrow transplantation.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.033
Here's another example, so
this is a little bit subtler.

00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:01.367
Again, these are axial images,

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:03.790
so this is the front of
the head, this is the back.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.749
This is the right side and
the left side of the brain.

00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:09.598
You can see this kind
of fuzzy white area here

00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:13.105
and you had Dr. Joe
Sullivan earlier in the day

00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:14.910
and I'm sure that he probably talked

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.280
about focal cortical dysplasias.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.871
This is a very, very
common cause of seizures,

00:12:20.871 --> 00:12:23.158
but its location in the frontal lobe

00:12:23.158 --> 00:12:25.997
can also have behavioral consequences,

00:12:25.997 --> 00:12:29.102
and if a child is seizing sub-clinically,

00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:32.596
meaning you're not observing
them having physical movements

00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:36.763
but just maybe spacing out,
removing that lesion is

00:12:38.596 --> 00:12:42.500
frequently curative, 100% curative,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.417
and can cause those
behavioral problems to stop

00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:53.135
and for developmental
progress to ensue once again,

00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:55.039
and then this is another example.

00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:57.310
This is a child that I took care of

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.477
who had a in utero stroke,
and presented, as I said,

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:07.950
with hemiparesis, but he
also presented clinically

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.049
with features that were
consistent with autism,

00:13:11.049 --> 00:13:15.221
so even though it was
motivated or caused by this

00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:18.320
anatomic change, it's something
that we would wanna know

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.958
because that's gonna
change how we work him up.

00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.281
It turns out that he also had

00:13:22.281 --> 00:13:26.401
a heart condition and so he really needed

00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:29.484
the attention of lots of specialists.

00:13:30.473 --> 00:13:35.308
Okay, and then here I've listed
just a few different causes,

00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:38.043
and obviously, given the time constraints,

00:13:38.043 --> 00:13:39.743
I'm not gonna go through all of them,

00:13:39.743 --> 00:13:42.478
but I just wanna talk
about the top two here.

00:13:42.478 --> 00:13:46.670
So the first one is
phenylketonuria, or PKU,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.646
and probably all of you
have heard about PKU.

00:13:49.646 --> 00:13:53.420
It's a defect in an
enzyme that metabolizes

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.587
the amino acid phenylalanine,
and in the days prior

00:13:58.807 --> 00:14:02.087
to newborn screening, these
children would present

00:14:02.087 --> 00:14:05.271
with seizures, intellectual
disability and autism,

00:14:05.271 --> 00:14:08.037
as well as pigmentary changes because of

00:14:08.037 --> 00:14:11.537
the phenylalanine conversion into melanin.

00:14:13.283 --> 00:14:17.227
But we don't see that anymore
because, in the United States,

00:14:17.227 --> 00:14:20.810
all newborns are screened
with a blood spot

00:14:21.914 --> 00:14:25.914
and that's sent to a state
lab and in California

00:14:27.498 --> 00:14:29.413
and most of the rest
of the country, we test

00:14:29.413 --> 00:14:33.580
for 50 different conditions
with that newborn blood spot,

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.950
but as you can see, it's quite variable.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.849
There's only 12 tests in Germany,
two in the United Kingdom

00:14:40.849 --> 00:14:44.800
and many countries around
the world don't test for PKU,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.094
and so a child with PKU could
still show up in your clinic

00:14:49.094 --> 00:14:53.261
and could be significantly
helped by being put on diet

00:14:54.162 --> 00:14:56.539
that's restricting phenylalanine,

00:14:56.539 --> 00:14:59.197
and then there's another deficiency.

00:14:59.197 --> 00:15:01.229
Again, this is also not common.

00:15:01.229 --> 00:15:03.344
It's called arginase deficiency.

00:15:03.344 --> 00:15:05.808
It's a disorder of the urea cycle,

00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:10.069
so the way that the body
metabolizes excess nitrogen,

00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:13.640
and kids who have this deficiency present

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.998
initially as normally but then they start

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:19.047
to regress when they're toddlers,

00:15:19.047 --> 00:15:22.821
and they develop loss of
cognitive and motor skills

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:27.178
and they develop spastic
presentation, so again,

00:15:27.178 --> 00:15:31.345
something that should prompt
a more aggressive evaluation.

00:15:33.747 --> 00:15:36.650
Okay, so I think that
Dr. Sullivan may have

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.579
already talked a little bit about this.

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:41.569
There's a new technique
called whole exome sequencing,

00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:45.736
and what this is, is this
is the latest, greatest tool

00:15:46.636 --> 00:15:49.290
and what it allows us to do is to sequence

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.309
most of the genes and most of the letters

00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:54.867
in most of the genes all at once,

00:15:54.867 --> 00:15:58.409
so in the old days, if I
had a specific hypothesis

00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:01.376
about, let's just say Tay-Sachs disease,

00:16:01.376 --> 00:16:04.363
I could draw blood from
the patient and send it

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:07.390
to a laboratory and they
could sequence the gene,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.367
hexosaminidase, that causes Tay-Sachs

00:16:10.367 --> 00:16:12.736
and see whether the
mutation was there or not,

00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:15.499
but now, instead of just
doing one gene at a time

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:19.086
or if there was five
or 10 genes in a panel,

00:16:19.086 --> 00:16:23.253
I can do over 20,000 genes
simultaneously, looking

00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:28.605
for mutations that might account
for my patient's symptoms,

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:35.048
and it turns out that in about
10 to 20% of autism patients

00:16:35.944 --> 00:16:39.470
as well as other kids with
developmental disabilities,

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.001
that there is a new change and
the term for that new change

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:47.168
is de novo, so de novo
mutations, and so, you know,

00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:51.600
you have two alleles, one from your mom

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.993
and one from your dad and
what's depicted here is

00:16:54.993 --> 00:16:57.898
that when this chromosome is passed

00:16:57.898 --> 00:17:00.172
from either the sperm or the egg

00:17:00.172 --> 00:17:04.339
into the developing embryo,
that this gene that's green,

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.080
and so functioning normally, acquires

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.732
by this little thunderbolt
here, a mutation,

00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:15.943
so oftentimes, a single
letter of DNA will change

00:17:15.943 --> 00:17:20.208
and that change alone is
sufficient to cause the symptoms,

00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:23.144
whether the symptoms are idiopathic autism

00:17:23.144 --> 00:17:27.071
by clinical appearance
or autism plus epilepsy

00:17:27.071 --> 00:17:29.634
or autism plus cerebral palsy.

00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:32.202
All of these combinations can be caused,

00:17:32.202 --> 00:17:35.881
depending on where it happens,
by literally a single change,

00:17:35.881 --> 00:17:39.478
a single letter of DNA being mutated.

00:17:39.478 --> 00:17:43.375
Okay, so there are companies
that do this kind of testing

00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:48.023
and you know, I don't wanna
advertise any particular company

00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:50.900
but if you email me, I can send
you a list of different ones

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.950
and you can pursue them
yourselves, but I'm gonna give you

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.770
some reports to highlight
what these kinds of tests

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.209
can give us in terms of information.

00:18:02.209 --> 00:18:05.697
Okay, so the first one is a case

00:18:05.697 --> 00:18:07.804
where we find a known syndrome,

00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:10.207
so a child presented to my clinic

00:18:10.207 --> 00:18:13.742
and he had irritability
that was pretty severe.

00:18:13.742 --> 00:18:17.253
Also had autism and had had a few seizures

00:18:17.253 --> 00:18:20.642
but not enough to be on
any seizure medication,

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:23.938
and we did this genetic
test and we found a mutation

00:18:23.938 --> 00:18:26.392
in a gene that's called GRIN2B,

00:18:26.392 --> 00:18:30.592
so here is the protein
consequence of this change.

00:18:30.592 --> 00:18:33.925
Here's the cDNA, or the DNA consequence,

00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:38.186
and then here is their report
saying that it's de novo,

00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:42.043
meaning that it's not in
either mom or dad's DNA,

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:45.198
but their interpretation,
the laboratory's, is that

00:18:45.198 --> 00:18:48.781
it is what's causing
this child's symptoms,

00:18:49.775 --> 00:18:51.358
and what is GRIN2B?

00:18:53.047 --> 00:18:54.791
Actually, let me just go back for a sec.

00:18:54.791 --> 00:18:58.958
GRIN2B is a receptor for
glutamate on nerve cells,

00:19:01.012 --> 00:19:04.450
so many, many millions
of nerve cells respond

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.597
to the excitatory stimulation of glutamate

00:19:07.597 --> 00:19:11.149
in the nervous system, and when that is

00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:13.699
inappropriately regulated, you can get

00:19:13.699 --> 00:19:17.523
cognitive and behavioral
problems, as well as epilepsy,

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:20.550
and what I'm showing you here is a drug

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.717
that's called memantine and
it can, in certain cases,

00:19:25.788 --> 00:19:29.916
block the pathological
activation of these receptors,

00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:34.139
so a drug that was not
designed for this purpose can

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:39.087
actually be used to ameliorate
both the behavior, somewhat,

00:19:39.087 --> 00:19:43.348
and the seizures that
these children experience,

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:46.518
so by having a specific diagnosis,

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.685
I can target my therapies.

00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:53.961
Okay, sometimes, when we do these tests,

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:56.518
we find something new, and so this is

00:19:56.518 --> 00:19:58.709
an example of another patient of mine

00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:02.209
who had a mutation in a gene called DDX3X.

00:20:03.198 --> 00:20:06.811
Gene names are often
cumbersome and so I apologize.

00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:10.156
Just the thing to remember is
that it's on the X chromosome

00:20:10.156 --> 00:20:13.321
and so it turns out, there was a paper

00:20:13.321 --> 00:20:16.665
literally that came out like a week or two

00:20:16.665 --> 00:20:18.937
before I got these results back,

00:20:18.937 --> 00:20:22.884
so we were right plugged in
with when this was happening,

00:20:22.884 --> 00:20:25.800
and I took this information to the family

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.227
and they reached out to other families

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:32.209
that have children, and
these are almost all girls,

00:20:32.209 --> 00:20:35.715
have young girls that
are affected with autism

00:20:35.715 --> 00:20:39.523
and intellectual disability,
and they went together

00:20:39.523 --> 00:20:42.972
and formed a foundation
and a support group

00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:45.212
and this is the front page of that group

00:20:45.212 --> 00:20:48.545
that's called DDX3X.org, and this is not

00:20:50.773 --> 00:20:53.061
the only case where this has happened.

00:20:53.061 --> 00:20:55.378
This is actually happening in dozens

00:20:55.378 --> 00:20:59.545
or even maybe now 100 or more
specific genetic syndromes

00:21:01.381 --> 00:21:03.993
around the country and around the world.

00:21:03.993 --> 00:21:08.160
Families are aggregating
together and trying to promote

00:21:10.932 --> 00:21:13.569
either clinical or basic science research

00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:17.539
on their children's conditions
to advance our knowledge

00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:20.132
and to come up with better treatments.

00:21:20.132 --> 00:21:23.609
So that's an example where,
you know, you can see already

00:21:23.609 --> 00:21:27.776
that there's 95 known cases,
66 people are registered.

00:21:28.677 --> 00:21:31.301
They're just getting started, but I think

00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:34.670
that they'll have a lot of success.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.206
The families running this
are highly motivated.

00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:41.504
Okay, and then another
thing that you find out is

00:21:41.504 --> 00:21:43.596
something called incidental findings,

00:21:43.596 --> 00:21:47.656
and so there are approximately 50 genes

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:52.524
that a lot of very, very clinical
savvy geneticists decided

00:21:52.524 --> 00:21:55.391
should always be on these tests

00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:59.162
and should always be returned
as reports to patients,

00:21:59.162 --> 00:22:02.158
and you can opt out as a family.

00:22:02.158 --> 00:22:03.793
You can check a box saying I don't want

00:22:03.793 --> 00:22:06.381
that kind of information,
but if you don't do that,

00:22:06.381 --> 00:22:09.677
they'll report it to you,
and as you can see here,

00:22:09.677 --> 00:22:12.010
the gene is BRCA1, so BRCA1,

00:22:13.024 --> 00:22:15.969
one of the leading causes of breast cancer

00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:19.514
that's known genetically,
and you can see here

00:22:19.514 --> 00:22:22.853
that there's a known pathogenic mutation

00:22:22.853 --> 00:22:25.698
and that it's present in my patient.

00:22:25.698 --> 00:22:29.413
He's a male and young, so
he's not at risk right now

00:22:29.413 --> 00:22:32.015
but there are things that
will have to be done for him,

00:22:32.015 --> 00:22:35.928
but his mom also was a
carrier of that mutation,

00:22:35.928 --> 00:22:40.095
and so it turned out that
the mom's mother had died

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.023
of breast cancer as a young woman,

00:22:45.166 --> 00:22:47.667
It was always in the back
of her mind to get tested,

00:22:47.667 --> 00:22:49.235
but had never gone through it,

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:52.393
and this information,
obviously, pushed her

00:22:52.393 --> 00:22:55.399
to finally getting properly evaluated

00:22:55.399 --> 00:22:59.023
and so I think that, you
know, in an incidental way,

00:22:59.023 --> 00:23:03.190
we provided this family with
a lot of valuable information.

00:23:04.131 --> 00:23:07.714
Okay, so in addition
to some of these genes

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.986
that I've just talked about,
you've probably all heard

00:23:12.986 --> 00:23:16.736
of some of the more
common or syndromic cases

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.682
that are associated with autism

00:23:19.682 --> 00:23:23.774
and I've list sort of three
of the more well-described.

00:23:23.774 --> 00:23:26.993
They've been around longer
and they've been around longer

00:23:26.993 --> 00:23:29.826
simply because they are syndromic,

00:23:30.894 --> 00:23:34.524
so they have physical features
or other medical features

00:23:34.524 --> 00:23:37.191
that allow you to identify them,

00:23:38.115 --> 00:23:39.797
and so I've listed three of them here.

00:23:39.797 --> 00:23:43.848
Fragile X, obviously, that
mostly occurs in males.

00:23:43.848 --> 00:23:45.309
They have physical features.

00:23:45.309 --> 00:23:47.853
They have a long face and large ears,

00:23:47.853 --> 00:23:50.770
a tall forehead with a pointy chin.

00:23:52.428 --> 00:23:55.597
As they get older, they
have macroorchidism

00:23:55.597 --> 00:23:58.662
and many of these individuals have

00:23:58.662 --> 00:24:02.338
autism and intellectual disability,

00:24:02.338 --> 00:24:05.731
and Rett syndrome, as
you know, is a condition

00:24:05.731 --> 00:24:09.889
that shows up mostly in girls, and again,

00:24:09.889 --> 00:24:14.056
presents with more of a
regressive or progressive picture

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.502
where they have stunted
growth of their heads

00:24:19.502 --> 00:24:23.669
and they have a number of
typical behavioral manifestations

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:28.764
or physical movements, and then
finally, tuberous sclerosis

00:24:28.764 --> 00:24:32.583
is another condition that can
be associated with autism,

00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:35.950
both in cases where you
have severe epilepsy,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:40.440
and in other cases, where
the TS does not result

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.399
in epilepsy but just
has behavioral changes,

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:48.566
and then I've listed below
here two different categories.

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:52.315
With the kind of broad
based genetics tools

00:24:52.315 --> 00:24:54.650
that I've told you about, there are labs

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.419
across the country and
actually, one of them here,

00:24:58.419 --> 00:25:00.281
Matt State and Stephan Sanders

00:25:00.281 --> 00:25:02.230
in the Department of Psychiatry,

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.234
have pushed forward this advance

00:25:05.234 --> 00:25:08.524
where they've taken many
thousands of individuals

00:25:08.524 --> 00:25:11.624
who all have autism and tested to see

00:25:11.624 --> 00:25:14.523
what kinds of genetic changes they had,

00:25:14.523 --> 00:25:17.359
and by doing it in such a large number,

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:19.786
they could get the kind
of statistical evidence

00:25:19.786 --> 00:25:22.479
that they needed to be
able to say definitively

00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:27.298
that those genes or those
genetic changes lead to autism,

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:29.248
and I've listed some of them here.

00:25:29.248 --> 00:25:31.775
These are some chromosomal regions,

00:25:31.775 --> 00:25:35.192
and then here are a list of single genes,

00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:40.473
and I just wanna highlight that the one

00:25:40.473 --> 00:25:43.232
that I just told you earlier, DDX3X,

00:25:43.232 --> 00:25:47.774
is gonna be more common, we
think, than all of these.

00:25:47.774 --> 00:25:51.941
16p11.2, again, was not
found until people started

00:25:52.796 --> 00:25:57.014
using these microarrays,
these broad based tools

00:25:57.014 --> 00:25:58.880
of looking across a whole genome,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.312
and this probably accounts for
a full one percent of autism,

00:26:03.312 --> 00:26:08.180
so again, an important
condition to better understand,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.430
and so that's what I wanna close with here

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.389
in the next couple minutes,
is just to tell you

00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:19.256
that my lab and a few other
labs around the country

00:26:19.256 --> 00:26:24.069
have recruited many dozen
individual who have this

00:26:24.069 --> 00:26:28.009
genetic change on chromosome
16 and we've started to look

00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:30.584
at both their behavioral manifestations,

00:26:30.584 --> 00:26:34.001
which we kind of outline here, as well as

00:26:35.672 --> 00:26:39.061
some of these biomarkers
that I was telling you about,

00:26:39.061 --> 00:26:43.228
and so right up here is, these
are very funny looking images

00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:49.853
but basically, these
are fancy MRIs that are

00:26:49.853 --> 00:26:53.238
using a tool called
diffusion tensor imaging

00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:56.405
to map out the strength of connections

00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:59.417
in different parts of the brain,

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:03.250
and if, just to sort of
color code it for you,

00:27:04.368 --> 00:27:07.784
if it's in yellow, it means
that there's a deficiency

00:27:07.784 --> 00:27:11.022
in the connections, and if it's in blue,

00:27:11.022 --> 00:27:13.299
it means that there's an increase,

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:17.316
and it turns out that if
you carry the deletion

00:27:17.316 --> 00:27:21.132
on this region, so you only
have one copy, not two,

00:27:21.132 --> 00:27:24.153
that you have too few connections

00:27:24.153 --> 00:27:26.198
or these connections aren't strong enough,

00:27:26.198 --> 00:27:28.276
and that if you have the duplication,

00:27:28.276 --> 00:27:30.285
you actually have the inverse.

00:27:30.285 --> 00:27:34.743
You have too many connections,
and so there are other people

00:27:34.743 --> 00:27:39.022
who have reported similar
findings in idiopathic autism,

00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:42.272
where over or under-connectivity can be

00:27:43.764 --> 00:27:46.562
a part of the picture of
autism, but we were able

00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:49.789
to see that very, very cleanly by using

00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:52.872
these genetically defined conditions,

00:27:54.547 --> 00:27:57.704
and there's one other
thing that we saw here.

00:27:57.704 --> 00:28:01.037
Again, this is something called an M100,

00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:06.183
so when you hear sound, it
takes about 100 milliseconds

00:28:06.183 --> 00:28:09.104
for that sound to go through your ears,

00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:12.824
up into your brainstem and
into the part of the cortex

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:16.991
that perceives sound, and
we showed that individuals

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.385
who are normal have, as we'd expect,

00:28:21.385 --> 00:28:23.972
around 100 milliseconds, but children

00:28:23.972 --> 00:28:27.076
who are deletion carriers have over

00:28:27.076 --> 00:28:31.243
a 20 to 30 millisecond delay
in that perception of sound,

00:28:33.183 --> 00:28:35.679
so it's not as if their
hearing is problematic,

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:39.846
but it's a cortical problem,
and it's not surprising to me,

00:28:40.841 --> 00:28:43.086
but it was interesting to discover that

00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:46.754
those individuals also have
significant language problems

00:28:46.754 --> 00:28:50.678
and the degree of language
impairment correlates

00:28:50.678 --> 00:28:54.845
with how severe that delay
is in the perception of sound

00:28:56.327 --> 00:29:01.230
in the auditory cortex,
and again, my collaborators

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.371
at CHOP in Philadelphia
who were doing this with us

00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:08.460
were only able to see in autism
a five millisecond delay,

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.862
but by using a genetically
homogeneous group of volunteers,

00:29:12.862 --> 00:29:17.549
they saw this much larger,
robust delay, and now

00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:22.321
potentially have an angle to
think about treating them.

00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:24.558
Okay, I think I'm gonna skip that over.

00:29:24.558 --> 00:29:28.725
Just in closing, so you know,
not only is the field moving

00:29:30.776 --> 00:29:34.492
forward very rapidly in terms
of coming up with diagnoses.

00:29:34.492 --> 00:29:38.659
There are lots of people who
are working on novel treatments

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:43.664
and I've just outlined
a couple of them here

00:29:43.664 --> 00:29:46.635
that I think are quite
potentially interesting.

00:29:46.635 --> 00:29:50.635
The two neuropeptides,
oxytocin and vasopressin,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.807
are both in clinical trials in the US,

00:29:56.118 --> 00:29:59.899
looking to see how they
might help kids with autism,

00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:03.328
and there's some preliminary
data that's suggesting

00:30:03.328 --> 00:30:07.960
that literally insufflating or
administering it intranasally

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.336
leads to an improvement
in social cognition

00:30:11.336 --> 00:30:15.419
45 minutes to an hour
after delivery of the drug,

00:30:16.587 --> 00:30:20.081
and you'll be amused to
know that male volunteers

00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:24.248
also get better social
cognition, but not the women.

00:30:30.763 --> 00:30:33.753
And then finally, in terms of treatments,

00:30:33.753 --> 00:30:35.878
the other one that I wanna point out is

00:30:35.878 --> 00:30:37.750
that there are lots of disorders

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.480
that are rare individually,
but collectively,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.578
they make a large group
and that they can be fixed,

00:30:44.578 --> 00:30:47.677
potentially, by replacing the enzyme,

00:30:47.677 --> 00:30:50.918
and there are ways of
getting these enzymes

00:30:50.918 --> 00:30:54.502
that are quite clever across
the blood-brain barrier

00:30:54.502 --> 00:30:57.139
into the brain and there are
a number of clinical trials

00:30:57.139 --> 00:31:00.056
going on right now to address that.

00:31:01.158 --> 00:31:03.991
Okay, so just in closing, genetics

00:31:06.405 --> 00:31:08.855
and some of these other
platforms that I talked about,

00:31:08.855 --> 00:31:11.630
biochemical methods, allow us to lead

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:16.342
to earlier and earlier diagnoses
that will hopefully lead

00:31:16.342 --> 00:31:20.509
to earlier behavioral
interventions and maybe even

00:31:21.387 --> 00:31:25.554
leading to, you know, precision
medicine driven treatments

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.677
and that even the things
that I've talked about,

00:31:31.677 --> 00:31:35.319
enzyme replacement and neuropeptide use,

00:31:35.319 --> 00:31:38.323
is really just the beginning.

00:31:38.323 --> 00:31:41.040
There's a scientist across
the bay at UC Berkeley

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.287
who's probably on the shortlist
to get the Nobel Prize,

00:31:44.287 --> 00:31:48.294
Jennifer Doudna who along with
a couple other investigators

00:31:48.294 --> 00:31:52.191
came up with a way to
literally edit your genome

00:31:52.191 --> 00:31:56.283
and people are working on that
in cells and in animal models

00:31:56.283 --> 00:31:59.067
and I think it's probably not too long

00:31:59.067 --> 00:32:02.039
before people think about
doing that in patients

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:05.072
who have specific genetic conditions,

00:32:05.072 --> 00:32:07.533
and if you have any questions,

00:32:07.533 --> 00:32:09.879
I'm welcome to take them later

00:32:09.879 --> 00:32:12.326
or you're welcome to contact me.

00:32:12.326 --> 00:32:15.536
I left my contact information
up there and thanks very much.

00:32:15.536 --> 00:32:18.703
(audience applauding)
