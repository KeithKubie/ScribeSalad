00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.120
Hey, Vsauce, Michael here

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.260
And here, I am the real Michael

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.180
This Michael was created by a brilliant young man named Mitchell,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.320
who brought it to me at a meet-and-greet after Brain Candy Live

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.440
It is phenomenal and obviously the most handsome jack-in-the-box ever

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.960
Ever-est is a mountain that's 8.848 km tall

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.040
Its size is impressive

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.860
Or is it?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.360
(Characteristic music of Vsauce, get prepared to be mind = blown)

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.740
Let's cut Earth, the entire planet, right in half,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.760
straight through Everest, and then start zooming out

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:54.520
As you can see, Everest's monumentality quickly disappears against Earth's planetary ginormosity

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.400
Compared to Earth's diameter

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.340
Everest—in fact, all of Earth's ruggedness—barely registers

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.160
That can seem surprising, since we are often surrounded by diagrams and maps and globes

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.460
that exaggerate Earth's topography

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.020
There is a good reason to do that,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.180
but it leads to a misconception about just how smooth Earth is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.420
Here's a typical example:

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.460
a cross section of the United States that I found on reddit

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.880
The vertical axis spans about 10,000 ft,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.800
but the horizontal axis represents nearly 14 million ft

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.560
Stretched to the same scale so as to mirror reality,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.760
the actual smoothness of the Earth becomes apparent

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.800
On this 1 ft diameter globe,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.320
Everest is a bump about 2 mm high

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.240
Feels good!

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.720
But if the Earth was actually this small,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.400
Everest would be a bump only 0.2 mm high

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.600
It's 10 times taller than it should be

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.320
Only 24 people have seen the Earth, with their own eyes, as a circle small enough to be looked right at;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.760
not as the whole world, but as a little thing suspended alone in space

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.700
The further away you are from a ball, the more of its surface you can see

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.020
We don't always notice this,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.780
because in our day-to-day lives,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.600
most of the balls we deal with are so small

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.500
they're almost always many of their own radii away from us,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.060
and the available amount of their surface visible is near a maximum

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.880
Or, they're so big, like the Earth, that we rarely get far enough away fast enough to notice this property

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.400
But the next time you are near a ball, get close to it

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.500
You'll see that as you get nearer, more of its surface disappears behind the horizon,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.820
but moving back up will make it available again

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.920
For most of us, stuck our whole lives on Earth's surface,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.500
such an experience is impossible

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.880
WIth nothing around to block your view,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.940
5 km (about 3 mi) is about the furthest you can see

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.240
Haze can limit your view and atmospheric refraction can slightly extend it,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.960
but for the most part, everything you can see happens within an area of just 80 km^2

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.940
That's not bad, but it's tiny compared with what there is to see

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.260
The higher up you go, of course, the further away you will be able to see

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.240
That's why it's great to be a satellite

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.280
Here's the International Space Station

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.720
Yeah, look at that nice bit portion of the surface in view

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.760
Unfortunately, this isn't to scale

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.420
If the Earth were the size of an apple,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.260
how far away would the International Space Station  orbit?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.320
Like this far away?

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.760
Maybe this far away

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.700
Maybe this far away

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.400
Actually, it orbits… here,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.740
2.7 mm above the surface

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.600
That's how far the stem of this apple sticks up

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.180
It's not very far

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.680
Oh, here's another fun little to scale fact:

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.960
if the Earth were the size of an apple, your eyeball would be about the size of the moon

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.440
We often imagine that from the International Space Station,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.540
astronauts see the Earth like this, but they're just not that far away

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.620
From where they actually orbit,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.780
International Space Station residents only see about 3% of Earth's surface at any one time

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.940
And that 3% is too wide to all fit within a window

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.700
When I was in Pittsburgh, their science museum had a mock-up of part of the ISS

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.140
And as you can see, out of the window, Earth is still quite expansive

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.420
Using special lenses, images can be taken from the ISS that look like circular disk Earths,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.720
but the lens is distorting things here

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.300
It's fitting much more into the picture

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.500
In order to truly witness Earth's entire shape with your own eyes,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.700
you would need to either smash your face right up against the window

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.680
or just be floating outside the station

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.440
And even then, you would have to move your head to see from edge to edge

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.220
So, how high up do you have to go to see the edges of Earth all at once?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.180
And, even if you did that, how much would you actually see?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.960
How much is there to see?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.680
Earth is made of stuff,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.400
lots of stuff: water and dirt and rocks and air, all of which are composed of atoms

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.980
tiny things so teeny that a single drop of water contains not a million atoms,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:38.320
not a billion atoms, or a trillion, or a quadrillion, or a quintillion but 5 sextillion atoms

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.580
Earth is made of even more stuff:

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.700
not a septillion atoms, not an octillion, nonillion,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.640
decillion, undecillion, duodecillion, tredecillion,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:53.100
not even a quattuordecillion but 100 quindecillion atoms

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.800
But since we live only on the surface of our planet, we unfortunately can't see most of those atoms

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.880
If the Earth was shaped like a disk or an icosahedron,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:17.120
or, say, a cube, or a rectangular prism, or two stellated rhombic dodecahedrons,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.460
we could see more of the Earth than we normally can

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.260
But as things are, we actually see nearly the least of Earth's matter possible

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.880
because of all solids, a sphere, which the Earth approximately is,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:39.220
has the smallest surface-area-to-volume ratio—the most stuff inside and the least stuff outside

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.540
So, how many of these 10^50 atoms that make up Earth are on the surface for us to see?

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.320
That's not an easy question

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.420
For one thing, technically, atoms on the surfaces of opaque things like rocks and dirt

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.820
aren't the only parts involved in their appearances

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.780
Sub-surface scattering can and does happen

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.100
Regardless, attempting even a rough approximation is illuminating

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.300
I asked Grant from the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown for some help

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.660
And he pointed out that if you calculate the number of circles with atom-sized radii

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:24.540
that could, packed optimally, cover a sphere with the surface area of Earth, you'll get about 1.5×10^34

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.480
That's a lot of atoms

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.180
But then he pointed out that the Earth's surface isn't smooth

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.500
Its roughness provides extra surface area for atoms to occupy

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.100
Without a complete description of the shape of Earth's surface—every mountain and valley,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.700
every bump on every rock—this is just gonna be hopeless, right?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:53.900
Well, here's the thing, Earth is made of little rugged shapes that from far away make big rugged shapes

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.480
In other words, Earth's surface can be described as a fractal

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.500
There is a regularity to its roughness

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:09.060
In fact, mathematicians have even assigned a fractal dimension to Earth's surface: 2.3

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.820
To see what that means, I highly recommend Grant's video on fractal dimensions

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.920
It's fascinating

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:22.840
Using 2.3 and assuming that it applies from the scale of a human hair up to that of a mountain,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.840
Grant found that the number of atoms on Earth's surface changes significantly:

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.780
up from a power of 34 to a power of 37

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.180
That's 1000 times more atoms

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.080
So, maybe we shouldn't count Earth's roughness out just yet

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.320
It's smooth, but not perfectly

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.660
To put that number in perspective, the human body contains about 10^27 atoms

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.280
That's 10 powers of 10 less than the surface of the Earth

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.980
10 powers of 10 is 10 billion

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.000
There are about 7.5 billion humans

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:10.060
So, more or less, it can be said that there are the same number of atoms in every human body right now

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.560
as there are on the surface of the Earth

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:21.160
As I've shown before, all human bodies piled into one place would barely even fill the Grand Canyon,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:27.980
but all human atoms spread across the Earth would almost perfectly cover it just one atom deep

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.820
Fun fact: the mass of the atmosphere is about 2.5% less

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:42.640
than what you would get by multiplying sea level pressure (14.7 psi) by the surface area of the Earth

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.240
because Earth's terrain displaces about that much air

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.400
Huh, Earth's surface is pretty cool

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.200
Obviously, I mean it got lichen and monster trucks

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:59.300
and an island in a lake on an island in a lake on an island

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.460
But from down here, on its surface, we just can't see that much of it

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.140
Your view of Earth is obstructed by lots of opaque things: walls, buildings, trees, rocks, terrain

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:17.600
If Earth was flat, you could see further, but sorry, it's a rough world out there

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.960
Or is it?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.800
If you could hold the Earth in your hands like this, how bumpy would it actually feel?

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.180
We already saw that even our planet's biggest bumps barely register relative to Earth's size

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.420
But let's go somewhere famously flat,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:41.600
where relative to our size, terrain rarely gets in the way of seeing lots of the planet:

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.060
the US state of Kansas

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.600
I grew up here and took this footage while driving across the state last year

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.260
You can probably see why Kansas is often called "flatter than a pancake"

00:10:54.260 --> 00:11:00.680
However, although it is famously flat, Kansas is not the flattest US state

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.460
In a fantastic piece of research, Jerome Dobson and Joshua Campbell defined "looks flat" like this:

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:15.880
if, from a given point, any part of the terrain within the horizon rises more than 0.32° up

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.980
(about the height of a 30 m hill at the horizon),

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.720
a typical person would say, "Hey! That part's not flat!"

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:31.140
By cleverly applying this rule to topographical data, they were able to give every state a flatness score

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.600
West Virginia was the least flat

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.540
Kansas was only the seventh flattest

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:45.500
Delaware, Minnesota, Louisiana, North Dakota and Illinois are all, by this method, flatter than Kansas

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.260
As was the number 1 flattest state: Florida

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.020
Adam Savage and I had the pleasure of visiting Florida with our Brain Candy Live show this year,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:02.520
and as this footage from atop the King Center in Melbourne, Florida shows, it's pretty gosh dang flat

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.540
Even though Kansas is not the flattest,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.060
it is the state most often ranked flattest when the general population is asked

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.620
It is truly, scientifically flatter than a pancake—it's been demonstrated

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.980
But there's more to the story than that

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:25.480
In 2003, researchers took a 130 mm wide pancake procured from IHOP and analysed its local reliefs

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.440
They found the difference between high and low points was on the order of about 2 mm

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:36.880
If a typical pancake like this was the size of Kansas, 5 million times larger,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.180
2 mm high peaks would be 10 km high mountains

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:46.560
In comparison, Mount Everest is only about 8.8 km tall

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.620
and Earth's deepest scar, the Marianas Trench, is thought to be just under 11 km deep

00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:02.580
So, not only is Kansas about as smooth as a pancake, but so is every other state in the union

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.700
and so is the entire world

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.940
If you were a giant holding the planet in your hands like this,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.600
you and it would be torn apart by the immense tidal forces created by your gravities

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.700
If somehow you could avoid that though,

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.500
the planet would feel not much rougher than running your hands over a pancake

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.900
But a soggy one, right?

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.840
I mean, most of Earth's surface is covered in water—your hands would get wet

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.260
Or would they?

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:39.200
Yes, Earth is covered in liquid, but the depth of that liquid, like the mountains above,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.240
just doesn't compare to the total size of the planet

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:49.420
As it turns out, if the Earth was the size of a typical classroom globe like this one, 1 ft in diameter,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:58.720
the volume of water contained in, above and on it would only be about 14 mL

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.980
That's this much water

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.560
It's kinda hard to believe because at this scale, spreading this much water across all of the ocean surfaces

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.100
would be pretty much impossible due to surface tension

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.220
But, this is it:

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.280
all of Earth's water compared to all of Earth

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.480
90% of the space on our planet life can live in is in here

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.520
The other 10% is dry land

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.980
So, no, you wouldn't get wrinkly fingers playing with an Earth like this

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.060
You could sop it dry just with a paper towel

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.120
Despite the incredible area oceans cover on our planet,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.900
their depth is just nothing compared to the size of our entire planet

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.380
You may have heard it said that if the entire planet were shrunk down to the size of a billiard ball,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.880
it would be smoother than a billiard ball

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.360
After all we've seen so far, that seems believable, but as it turns out, it's not true

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.280
The misconception stems from the interpretation of the World Pool-Billiard Association's rules

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:09.440
According to them, a ball must have a diameter of 2.25 in ± 0.005 in

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.780
Some writers have taken this to mean that pits and bumps of 0.005 in are allowed

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:21.420
Proportionately, on Earth, that would mean a mountain that was 28 km high

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.360
So, since Earth has none of those, Earth must be smoother than a billiard ball

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.400
Except if bumps that high were actually allowed on a pool ball,

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.980
a ball covered with 120 grit sandpaper would be within regulation

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:43.400
Clearly, the 0.005 in rule is more about roundness, deviation from a sphere, and not texture

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:52.360
In fact, as microscopic photography has shown, imperfections on regulation balls are only 1/100,000 in,

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.720
or about 0.5 μm deep and high

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:03.460
Scaled to the size of a billiard ball, Earth's Marianas Trench would be 49 μm deep

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:10.500
So, Earth is smoother than a pancake but not smoother than a billiard ball

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.200
Nor, as xkcd wonderfully showed, is Earth smoother than a bowling ball

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.000
But hold on, earlier we were using the word "flat", now we were using the word "smooth"

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.680
That distinction is important

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.020
You see, the Earth isn't flat like a plane (or is it?)

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.940
Instead, it curves

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.600
It's a ball

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:41.720
Pieces of Earth, like Kansas, might be quite smooth, but they curve along with Earth

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.280
If you were to stand in the middle of Kansas,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:50.160
people on the eastern or western edges of the state would appear to be, not level with you,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.760
but about 8.1 km below you

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.000
That's nearly the height of Everest

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.740
And if they stood straight up, they'd be tilted nearly 2° relative to where you thought up was

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.680
Here is an interesting coincidence:

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:12.320
generally speaking, 1 mi from where you are, Earth curves down about 8 in;

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:18.520
1 km from where you stand, it curves down about 8 cm

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.800
The rate of drop due to curvature isn't a linear one

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.020
You can't just multiply any distance by 8 to get the drop due to curvature

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.500
Instead, use an online calculator like the one I have linked down in this video's description

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.020
You can put in any distance you want

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:38.500
Anyway, the visibility limit caused by Earth's curvature is your horizon

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.300
It encircles you like a visual cage,

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.460
but it's a cage whose radius is determined by how high up your eyes are

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:53.560
Conan O'Brien, at 6 ft 4 in tall, can see up to 5 km in any direction,

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:59.380
but Snooki, at 4 ft 8 in, can only see about 4.3 km

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.840
To find out how far away your horizon is,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.800
geometrically, just use the online tools I've put down in the description below

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:14.240
Earth's texture can get in the way of your horizon but can also cause things beyond the horizon to peek into view

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.080
HeyWhatsThat.com factors all of this in

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:24.700
If Earth was a smooth sphere, the view from atop Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the British Isles,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:30.660
would end at the horizon 131 km away (about 80 mi)

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.780
Such an area would look like this

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.700
But factoring in Earth's ups and downs, here's a more precise boundary of what you can see

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:46.000
Loch Treig, Scottish Gaelic for "lake of death", is only about 10 mi from the peak

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.840
That's within an 80 mi radius, but it can't be seen because terrain in the way blocks it

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:58.200
Parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea 8 times further away can be seen

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.380
They lie at the limit of the Earth's curvature, just before it bends the surface out of sight

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.660
These spikes extending beyond the geometric horizon

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.920
are caused by things beyond it that are tall enough to peek above Earth's curvature

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.340
In the case of Ben Nevis, this includes high elevation parts of Northern Ireland

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:22.340
OK, enough about the surface and what it's like close up, let's go further away and see more

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.680
This'll be fun, but there'll be a trade-off

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.300
The further away you are from something, the smaller it will appear to be

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:36.360
Moving away from Earth will make more area available to see, but that area will take up less of your field of view

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.620
It can be difficult to illustrate this in a YouTube video,

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:45.340
because your field of view, the shape and size of what you can see with you head still,

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:54.700
just by moving your eyes around, is about 120° up and down and more than 180° horizontal

00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:02.940
A screen is just a window of that space—nowhere close to filling it, unless you get uncomfortably close

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.240
To help us visualize large apparent sizes, let's replace the spherical Earth with a flat disk

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.100
that's always the same distance from the observer

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.140
This disk can be given an apparent size equal to Earth's from any altitude,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:23.920
and the disk can contain on it everything that would fit within your horizons from any altitude

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:33.360
OK, so, standing on the surface looking straight down, Earth will take up nearly a full 180° of your field of view

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.360
With your arms extended straight out, parallel to Earth,

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.380
your fingers will point to the edges of the planet: your horizon

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:48.120
From 400 km up, about where the ISS orbits, 3% of the Earth's surface is within your horizon,

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.380
but the Earth will only take up about 140° of your vision

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.300
Your fingers would point to Earth's edges if you narrowed your arms' angles,

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.740
each by the width of two outstretched fists

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.940
One fist is about 10° across at arm's length

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:10.280
You can move your eyes from edge to edge horizontally here, but you can't quite take in the full width vertically

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:18.300
But from more than twice this altitude, 1000 km away, Earth is only 120° across

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.560
That's one less fist width each

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560
This is perfect

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.540
That fits within our narrower vertical field of view

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.260
So, from 1000 km up (about 620 mi),

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:34.660
you can just start to see Earth as a complete disk right in front of you at once

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:40.520
However,  only 7% of Earth fits within the horizon form up here

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:46.220
Images of Earth taken by satellites this far up, like the Suomi NPP, look kinda weird

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.740
I mean, North America doesn't actually take up this much of the globe

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.840
Earth's 120° width has been compressed to fit in an image much narrower

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:02.200
Compare Africa from its height to the famous blue marble picture taken from 45,000 km away

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.100
The latter looks more realistic, like looking at a globe on your desk

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.360
Geosynchronous satellites are about 35,000 km high

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:18.320
From their altitude, 43.4%—nearly a whole half—of Earth's surface is visible,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.040
but the Earth only takes up a meager 17°

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.220
You could completely cover it with two outstretched palms

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.780
That's incredible

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.940
But what about from the Moon?

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:34.440
Well, from that far away, Earth is only about 2° across

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.880
You could block it out with your outstretched thumb

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.000
However, you can see more of Earth—you can see further around its curvature

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.880
From the Moon, 49% of Earth's surface is visible

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.940
Just 49

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:59.380
If you want to see 50, half of Earth's surface at once, you have to go even further away

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:05.500
In fact, you have to go infinitely far away, which you can't

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.260
The most of a sphere you can see at once with your own eyes is just half

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.120
But in the real world, way before you were actually infinitely far away,

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.280
the amount of light reaching you from Earth's surface

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.020
would become so small and infrequent that you wouldn't be able to see anything at all

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.500
Stars, like our Sun, are much brighter and bigger than the Earth,

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:34.960
but only a handful have, even with our best technology, been resolved as anything larger than just a single point

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:41.840
From 1/1000 of a light-year away, our own Sun would look like every other star in the sky:

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:49.540
a single point to the naked eye, only about as wide as R Doradus, the widest star in our sky

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:57.700
From 91 light-years away, the point of our Sun would dim to a level undetectable by the naked eye

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.480
It would disappear

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.820
Most of the stars in the night sky you can see with your naked eye are further away than that,

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.180
we can see them though because they're brighter and bigger than our own Sun,

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:16.260
which means if there's life out there, living in systems around the stars we've marvelled at

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.360
and written stories about since humanity began,

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:26.780
chances are, we are not part of their constellations or folklore

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.320
We're a dark patch in the sky to them,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.700
an ignorable emptiness framing other stars, the ones they marvel at

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.260
while not knowing we're here, or that there is anything here

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.700
And as always, thanks for watching!

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:59.440
(Music reinforcing existential crisis)

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:08.000
If you don't follow me on Twitter or Instagram, pffft, you are missing out on a treasure trove of premium content,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.180
so check that out

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.160
And, know this, I love you

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:19.880
Oh, and this Vsauce shirt is only available to Curiosity Box subscribers

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.020
This shirt comes in the latest box

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:26.840
If you sign up now, you will get this shirt, so long as you sign up before it sells out

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.300
The Curiosity Box is good for all brains

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:36.240
It comes to your door, 4 times a year, full of science gear and toys that I want you to have,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.100
I want you to hold and learn from

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.620
Also, a portion of the proceeds from every box goes to Alzheimer's research

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.080
I'm incredibly proud of it

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.700
But what's going on on this shirt?

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.220
Well, it's modular multiplication around a circle

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:57.120
We have the numbers 1 to 40, around the outside of a circle, connected to their product with the number 4

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:03.040
So, 1 is connected to 4, 2 is connected to 8, 3 is connected to 12 and so on, even past 40

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.260
You could keep imagining the numbers continuing

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.420
For instance, 1 can become 41, 2 can become 42

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.560
And this emerges—the Vsauce V

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.640
Many other shapes can be made by using different multipliers or different numbers around the circle

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.220
Mathologer has a fantastic video on this topic, which you should check out

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.400
I have linked it down in the description

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.600
Thank you for being curious and as always, thanks for watching!
