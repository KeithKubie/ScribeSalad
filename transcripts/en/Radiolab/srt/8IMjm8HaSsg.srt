1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,190
You're [inaudible] to too.
You're listening to radio lab.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,930
I just thought I'd see if I can
get the sound of babies sleeping.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,793
Okay.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,030
This is Radiolab. Today's
program is about sleep.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,553
[inaudible]

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,890
I don't have to tell
you how good sleep is.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,970
You do it yourself every night.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,790
Will you try and how wonderful
when it actually works.

9
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,791
When you can close your eyes and forget
the day and just drift off into oblivion

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,650
like a little baby. But let's
suppose that you are a little baby,

11
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,140
this little baby and you grew
up to become a scientist,

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,010
like one of the scientists we'll hear
from in this program and you decide to ask

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,010
what should be the dumbest question ever.

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,570
Why do we sleep and not just us.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,050
Pretty much everything. Sleep as far as
we know. All mammals do it. All birds,

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,430
bees, locusts, cockroaches,
crayfish, reptiles in sex, scorpions,

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,910
everything that's been studied has
something that looks like sleep.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,070
[inaudible]

19
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,903
it's a mystery.

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,220
Most things we sort of know what
they are for and also how they work,

21
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,910
but sleep is really in your
face. I mean everybody does it.

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,980
You do it from the cradle, the grave.

23
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,120
You can't help doing it because
if you try to stay awake,

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,240
you know at some point it's a
repressible and we don't know why.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,610
That's a shameful state of affairs.

26
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,360
How can you be a scientist and the 21st
century and not know the answer to that?

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,820
There you go. Okay.

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,050
That's a pretty good way to begin. No
shame. Yeah. Yeah. Today on Radiolab,

29
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:54,130
we're going to try to correct this,

30
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:57,280
a shameful state in the fingers when
it comes to the subject of sleep.

31
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:01,240
We'll talk with people who can help us
understand what it's for, why we do it,

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,100
and what happens when we don't. I'm
Robert Krulwich. I'm Jen. Boom. Ron,

33
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,443
stay with us.

34
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,750
[inaudible]

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,950
for centuries people thought that sleep
was kind of the opposite of being awake,

36
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,300
which reasonable thing.
Sure. Because you know,

37
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:25,150
during the day you're
doing all these things.

38
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:30,040
You're having all these
thoughts and feelings at
night. You just lie there very,

39
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:34,300
very still. Like sometimes a bomb
could go off and you wouldn't wake up.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,630
I can hardly wake up even in a fire.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,150
No, I'm a really highly sleeper. Amy.
Very heavy, heavy sleeper. The blended is

42
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,910
it?

43
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,910
If all you've got are your eyes to
go on sleep can seem like being well,

44
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,690
like being off. Yeah, like off
ness, right or worst? Well,

45
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,940
both Shakespeare and servant
is referred to sleep as death.

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
That's Dr Carlos Shank. He wrote a great
book about sleep called paradox loss.

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,980
We go to, we go to bed every night.

48
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,520
We die every night and then we wake
up in the morning. We're alive again,

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,420
and that was the prevailing
theory for centuries for Dr Shank,

50
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:18,421
the awakening to just
how wrong Shakespeare and
Cervantes were about sleep came

51
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,970
one day while he was sitting in a class
for med school my first year at medical

52
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,690
school,

53
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,980
this was back in 1972 we had an Ameritas
professor who actually was a Nobel

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,390
Prize winner of Dr Up Eccles,
Josh or John Kuru Eccles from us.

55
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,490
What happened is esteemed
lecturer walks into class,

56
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,900
pops the cassette into the tape
deck, hits play and outcomes.

57
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,170
This sound well, the sound was,

58
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,160
or wait a second, let me
get it right. Oh, here we go

59
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,990
and multiply this by a hundred

60
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,880
this is the professor announced is the
sound of a cat's brain while asleep.

61
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,270
My God shake almost fell out of the seat.

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,070
This is the brain during sleep
making these really rapid,

63
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:14,400
high pitch multiple sounds. That
just blew us away, wasn't it?

64
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:18,210
Clearly while that cat was curled up on
this little kitty basket, it's brain.

65
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,080
It was very, very alive. Much more
than anyone expected, and it's,

66
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,730
this is still a little weird revelation.
Like take my cat, Sammy, Amy.

67
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,840
All right. This is the sound
like cat Sam. He sleeping

68
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,420
to think that well Sam, Sammy is
sitting on my lap totally out.

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,380
No,

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,790
there's a circus happening in his
brain. What's going on in there?

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,670
You can imagine back in the
70s this was a paradigm shift.

72
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,950
People were suddenly like, oh my God,

73
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,270
we're going to figure out anything
about sleep. Right? All right,

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,730
we have to ask the brain,

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,780
and this is the room where we do
all of our surgeries and luckily

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,780
that's easily done if you're
willing to get your hands dirty.

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,361
Okay.

78
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:07,470
So the first step is you have to make
an incision on top of the animal's head.

79
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,760
When you've done that, we drill
holes through the animal skeleton

80
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,070
and uh, and then you insert
your electrode, your stands,
and that's simply it.

81
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,610
A little window into their brain. You can
see right there on the, on the screen,

82
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:24,280
you can see that mainly wait, are
you out of your mind? And you just,

83
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,390
did you just put a hole into a kittens
head? No, this wasn't my cat. Come on.

84
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,710
So what was it we were doing there?

85
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, you just heard was a
mock surgery in Guana actually.

86
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,480
And you didn't make one. I mean it's,
it's not a nice look, look, look,

87
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,320
look the animal,

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
within 20 minutes of coming out of the
anesthetic, the animal is moving around.

89
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,130
It's eating, it's climbing
and it's, it's basking.

90
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,100
It might seem like a rather invasive
procedure, but in actuality it's,

91
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,540
it's not too bad at all. Yeah. And
that, by the way, is John [inaudible],

92
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,500
he's a graduate student at the a Ecology
Department at Indiana State University,

93
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,370
which is where we are.
John gave our reporter

94
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,320
Kara older testing a tour of the lab or
a big noise here and they all have nice

95
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:07,610
hats, cheered with ego on us. These
kids are a little frightening to me.

96
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:11,090
They're pretty huge. They're like
four feet long, head to tail. Oh,

97
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:11,690
I didn't know that.

98
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,480
I mean they looked like baby alligators
sick that went up and John measures

99
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,780
their brainwaves at night to see what
happens in their head as they sleep.

100
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,411
In a way,

101
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,060
it's a continuation of that cat experiment
that Dr Shank just told us about

102
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,390
except what they're looking for is much
more peculiar than could ever happen in

103
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:31,870
a cat or an us. [inaudible]. What does
that, let me put it to you as a puzzle.

104
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,070
Okay. Forget Iguanas.
Dolphins. Dolphins. Yup.

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,470
How is it that a dolphin in the ocean
or even say the dolphins that you might

106
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:45,310
find at six flags in New
Jersey? They have to.

107
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,820
Cody is our 10 year old
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,740
Buddy Avalon is 12 years old and that's
their trainer Megan to Tarot of year.

109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,880
Mitra is holding the mic. Anyhow, here's
the puzzle. We asked Megan about this.

110
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:00,040
How is it it hurt two dolphins,

111
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,040
Cody and Avalon can successfully sleep.

112
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,670
Given the inherent challenges of
being a dolphin. I don't, I don't.

113
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,670
What do you mind are the
challenges of a dolphin? Well,

114
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,210
they have significant challenges. My
friend first, they've got to breathe.

115
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,240
They're not, they're conscious breathers.
They're not unconscious breathers,

116
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:19,090
so they, they have to think about
breathing. Making matters worse.

117
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:22,270
Dolphins are not fish, so
they have to breathe air,

118
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,590
which means they have to
constantly consciously come
up to the surface to greet

119
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,701
area every few minutes.

120
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:31,480
So you can imagine what would happen
if they decided to go unconscious for

121
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:34,570
awhile. Ala Drown. Right.

122
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,640
And yet they do manage to
sleep a lot. Oh, how long?

123
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,030
Eight hours a day. Like Eileen. Yeah,
eight hours. But how, that's the puzzle.

124
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,110
What happens is they do
what we call logging.

125
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:50,060
It's when they rest on
the surface of the water,

126
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,660
you know in a log floats down
a river. It just floats. Huh?

127
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,670
That's exactly what they look like. And
they rest half their brain. Yeah. Time.

128
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,560
Their brain is this, half their
brain is asleep at a time.

129
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,760
That is the nature of solution.
To cut the dolphin brain in half,

130
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,620
you mean literally, literally in a half.

131
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:12,760
So that one half can snooze while the
other half keeps the Dolphin Swimming and

132
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
surfing just enough to
breathe from the outside.

133
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:17,470
You can't really tell what's happening.

134
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,920
It just looks like the Dolphin is
sort of a wig but a little out of it,

135
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,830
but it's almost like the state
of when you're falling asleep.

136
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,870
But if something happened,
you'd wake right up.

137
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,690
So they're in that state all the time.

138
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,900
It sort of can be characterized
as groggy that Steve Lima,

139
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,850
he runs the one of the
labs back in Indiana.

140
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,610
There's sort of a wig and
you're sort of asleep.

141
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,910
It's just a way of staying awake
enough and again, it's easy to miss,

142
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:42,430
but if you look inside
that groggy dolphins brain,

143
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,060
what the brainwaves are doing
[inaudible] exquisitely obvious.

144
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,300
It's clear as that six year old can
figure it out when half of the brain has

145
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,700
these beautiful slow
waves, like a sign for

146
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,100
[inaudible]

147
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,933
and you other to just,

148
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,690
just jacking all over the place.

149
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,390
Oh, those are beautiful.

150
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,940
Wow. That is amazing. Yeah. It's
called the uni hemispheric sleep.

151
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,870
That's what the guys at Indiana state
are really interested in because,

152
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,590
and here's the next surprise. It
seems to go way beyond dolphins.

153
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,580
They're aquatic mammals like
whales, seals and sea lions.

154
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:24,460
John says that all the marine mammals
that have been studied seemed to do it too

155
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:28,540
recently. Walruses they're all found to
engage in uni hemispheric sleep as well.

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,880
And now the Indiana team
led by a okay. By this guy,

157
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm Charles M Lanner, chair
of the Department of Ecology
and organismal biology.

158
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,820
They have found this weird split brain
behavior in creatures of the air. Let me,

159
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:46,900
let me just back up a little bit
and describe, uh, this experiment.

160
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,030
Charlie and a student had been at the
park one day and they noticed something.

161
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,650
We observed that ducks, ducks,

162
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,420
sometimes we'll get together into
groups like on a log for ducks.

163
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:02,410
We'll get together and snooze in a
neat little lie and the birds that were

164
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,570
sitting in the middle of that line tended
to be sleeping with both eyes closed.

165
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,830
The birds that were sitting on the outside
of that row tended to look a little

166
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:17,140
bit more wary. The inevitable question,

167
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,810
what's going on here led to
a very simple experiment.

168
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:24,560
We put four birds in a row for Mallard
ducks this time in the lab and they watch

169
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:28,480
them sleep. The two birds in the center
of this row slept with both eyes,

170
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:32,260
closed the birds on the outset,
outer edges both left and right,

171
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,670
slept with one eye closed and
one I opened one more time,

172
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,530
slept with one eye closed and one eye
opened. It's just like in that song,

173
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,720
do you know? You know that

174
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,400
Metallica Song? I missed
it. I missed a good one.

175
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,470
I knew they were all bought in. This
is true, you know, no one knows this,

176
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:56,610
but that song is really about
adaptive sleeping behavior in dogs.

177
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,640
The outer eye, the eye that
was faced away from the group,

178
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,760
the eye that was facing towards where
potential predators might come from that

179
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,690
stayed open. At this point,

180
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:13,500
Charlie had a pretty good idea of what
was going on because he knew that inside

181
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:17,580
bird brains, each eye is attached
to the opposite hemisphere.

182
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,640
The left eye is attached
to the right hemisphere.

183
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,190
The right eye is attached
to the left hemisphere,

184
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,120
so his team and planted some electrodes
to measure what the duck brains were

185
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,830
doing and like the dolphins,

186
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:35,280
the ducks two were sleeping one
half of their brain at a time.

187
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,900
The bird could simultaneously
sleep and be awake.

188
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,080
Not only that, here's the
cool part. After a few hours,

189
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,620
what happened was is that the birds
that were on the outer edge then would

190
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,940
rotate, stand up,

191
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,950
turn around 180 degrees and then sit
back down and the other I would then get

192
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,950
sleep and consequently the opposite
hemisphere would get some sleep.

193
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,690
When we saw that, we said, Oh
yeah, this is my back. Good, good.

194
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:06,580
Because right there in the docs was the
perfect illustration of what these guys

195
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:09,910
think. It's all about you got
asleep for whatever reason. Right?

196
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,110
Sleep is dangerous.
Danger, danger, danger.

197
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,010
That's the headline for dolphins. The
main dangerous, drown danger, danger.

198
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,960
You know, for ducks getting eaten,
pager ain't ducks have to sleep nature,

199
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,290
but how can they nature when
lurking in the darkness or foxes?

200
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,480
Wolves in a hundred other eaters
of ducks. Do you like snakes?

201
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,690
I don't know. I don't dislike snakes.

202
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,280
He's good man. Good man. In another nifty
experiment, John took the residents,

203
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,150
snake Montes,

204
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,190
big snake. He is.

205
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:52,540
What about a four foot long python
and at night you're so cute.

206
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,100
John Brought Monte the python into the
room where his iguanas sleep and he

207
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:58,390
terrifies that really well.

208
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,240
I mean Monte was in a cage so he
couldn't really hurt the Iguanas.

209
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:05,640
But as soon as that snake appeared,
all the lizards popped one eye over

210
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,390
and they train that
open eye right on Monte,

211
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:12,280
the snake snake in the
room and they'll watch it.

212
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,550
When I oh night that Steve Lima
again, they don't like these names.

213
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:16,961
That's for sure.

214
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:20,230
And then remove the snake from the room
the next day and they're still looking

215
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,990
for the next night or two. So
they keep one eye, you know,

216
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,270
trained on that door for a
few more days or three days.

217
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,340
They go back to a regular sleep.

218
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,263
Whoa.

219
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,313
[inaudible]

220
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,210
so what does this all mean? Well, think
about this. Okay. All the sea mammals,

221
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,790
they do it right. We'll list
the ones I've been studied.

222
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:51,080
All the flying creatures, they do
it. The reptiles seem to do it too.

223
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,380
Who does that leave? You mean? Who's left?

224
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:57,350
Not Sleeping with a half a brain on
in the other half a brain off. Yeah.

225
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,713
Cool.

226
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,640
Um, us, we may be the strange ones. Well,

227
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:07,930
it is sort of strange in that terrestrial
mammals can't do it for estriol

228
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,550
mammals. Just for some reason to
have lost the ability to do this.

229
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,960
That all mammals says, John to terrestrial
mammals, the ones that live on land.

230
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,830
Ah, and here's this
theory. Sometime long ago,

231
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,110
our scaly ancestor wanted up on the land
and thought, I think I'll dig a hole.

232
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,660
Yeah, I'm going take a
hole. The hole was dark.

233
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,700
And it was safe and for the first
time, millions of years of evolution,

234
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:38,660
that little creature closed both eyes.

235
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,153
Ah,

236
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:44,810
[inaudible]

237
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,110
and so we lost it. Totally
speculative theory of course.

238
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:53,111
But the basic idea though is if you are
protected and you can afford to close

239
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:55,430
both eyes conk out completely.

240
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,300
And that simple idea of safety that
explains while these guys think almost

241
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:03,440
everything where you sleep, how
you sleep, how long you sleep,

242
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,210
it all boils down to two words.
Predation risk per dation,

243
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,800
risk prediction risk,

244
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,230
which is really just a fancy way
of saying generally speaking,

245
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,110
just your risk of being killed,
the risk of being eaten. Now

246
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,990
what does this have to
do with us? Here we are,

247
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,650
top of the food chain in our warm
beds, nice warm bed lock door,

248
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:29,890
a locked door covers
maybe a nice neighborhood,

249
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,680
a good police force looking
after you at nighttime

250
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,870
and you live in a country that has
a very secure living environment.

251
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,680
You would think that this whole predation
risk idea has nothing to do with us.

252
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,003
Wow.

253
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,690
So there's a few studies that have looked
at a c sleep patterns where people are

254
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:51,430
sleeping in novel environments.

255
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,050
What's a novel environment?
Did you mean like a hotel

256
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,220
that first night at a hotel?

257
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,880
Why is it no one could sleep well that
first night at a hotel on your first

258
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,710
night of sleeping in a hotel room,

259
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:06,600
you generally have less rem sleep and
less and deep slow wave sleep relative to

260
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:10,020
sleeping in your house. I,
I suffered from that myself.

261
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:11,240
I don't sleep well in hotel rooms,

262
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,510
especially if it's just one night
per place or something I have.

263
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,360
My sleep is terrible.

264
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,290
There are some folks that actually
hypothesized they're at certain Predator

265
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,830
relays in the brain,
danger, danger, danger,

266
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,130
and that these circuits to
remain active at all times.

267
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,790
Now what does that, it's true that, yeah,

268
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,040
we all have buried deep in our reptile
brain as sort of Predator alert system

269
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,820
perhaps in some of us it's
a little too sensitive.

270
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,030
Okay. We're in the sleep lab at the
Minnesota Regional Sleep disorders center,

271
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:52,620
mission control, we call it. We're
viewing the typical sleep terror episode.

272
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,070
This little girl who is a five years
old would engage in these sleep terror

273
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:01,740
episodes every single night.
Now that's Dr Carlos Shank,

274
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:02,640
who we heard from before.

275
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,450
We're in Minnesota now at the Hennepin
county sleep center here in a sleep lab

276
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:07,284
where he works.

277
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,190
We're standing in front of a grainy
black and white video of a little girl in

278
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,630
her PJ's screaming time.

279
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,970
Eight in the morning after
shank discovered an odd
category of sleep disorders

280
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,460
called Parasomnias, which is
why we came to talk to him.

281
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:25,320
Para means around Somnio
means sleep around sleep.

282
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:27,390
This might be the human
analog to the ducks.

283
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,280
People whose brains never quite shut
off completely drink sleep. Well,

284
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,910
this guy is interesting. He has seizures.
No, no, no. He doesn't. Wait a second.

285
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,550
He showed us tape after
tape. We're viewing a man.

286
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,780
We are very affectionately call
Santa Claus. Yeah. On the screen.

287
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,500
Large guys thrashing back and
forth. His legs are moving.

288
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:50,490
He's going back and forth for the sides
of his back and then suddenly he starts

289
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,324
to

290
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,053
[inaudible].

291
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,720
Oh, oh.

292
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:02,660
[inaudible].

293
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,200
Is this real? Yeah. This
guy is in and out of sleep.

294
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,340
He has no idea what he's doing.

295
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:11,810
One of the interesting things Dr Shuck
noticed when you first began to diagnose

296
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:15,050
parasomnias in the early eighties is
that while they were in that kind of

297
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,150
liminal space around sleep,

298
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,440
a huge percentage of the patients would
have these visceral dreams of being

299
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:21,921
attacked.

300
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:26,630
The common theme is a menace is posed
from nowhere coming out of nowhere.

301
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,800
It's an immediate threat that you, you
just can't ignore. Let's put it that way.

302
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:33,170
You have to either fight
it or run away from it.

303
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,670
Your dreams can be very
violent. This is Martin Sabelle,

304
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,010
h 88 he's another if Dr shanks patients,

305
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:44,260
I don't remember someone
coming up the stairway.

306
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,620
In Martin's case, the
attackers never had a face.

307
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,440
Sometimes it was a bear and I was
gonna fight with him. He'd yell at him,

308
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,170
get here. That's Martin's
wife Gertrude Glam.

309
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,900
It was always trying to protect me. Yeah,

310
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,080
I'd have black and blue bruises on my
arms and hands because I was hearing

311
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,680
English bored. Not Infrequently.

312
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:10,520
The man is dreaming in bed with his
wife that he is fighting to defend her.

313
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:12,710
If I'm an attacker. When in
fact he's beating her up.

314
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:17,620
The one night I was sleeping and all
of a sudden he's got his hands tightly

315
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:22,020
around my straw. I am
petrified. Quit mark,

316
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,930
you're dreaming. You're hurting me.
She should mark. You're dreaming.

317
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,200
Gertrude and Martin, Isabelle are
still married. Believe it or not,

318
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,370
after 57 years though, she did
force him to sell his guns.

319
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,420
He has never been happy about that.
Well, they were quite valuable.

320
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,910
So you're suggesting then that all these
people and the Iguanas and the ducks

321
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,970
and the dolphins all have a portion of
their brain which is weary in the night.

322
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,350
That's what I'm hinting at. I don't
want to go any stronger than hinted,

323
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,030
but there seems to be, uh,

324
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,180
something in us that's always
watching out. Always wary.

325
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,210
Bottom line here though is that sleep for
all creatures is a dangerous thing and

326
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:07,780
a few unfortunate people are still
awake to that fact. That's right.

327
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:08,561
Before we go to break,

328
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:12,190
I just want to thank Anne Habermann for
her excellent reporting in Minnesota and

329
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:13,660
also before her Cara older,

330
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,480
and to remind you to stay with us
because we're going to turn her attention

331
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,990
shortly from danger to deprivation.

332
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,000
Radiolab will continue in a moment.
