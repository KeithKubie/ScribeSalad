Welcome back. My name is Nate, and I want to thank you for joining me today on the king of random today

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.659
We're going to show you how to take a project that we've done before and ramp it up to the next level

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.979
In a previous video we showed you how to make a matchbook rocket-launching kit

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.129
So now we're gonna take what you learned in that video and step it up to the next level

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.398
Using simple parts to build a revolver that can shoot six rockets in a row now the previous video showing how to make an entire

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.529
Rocket launch pad was actually the first video

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.120
I ever saw on the king of random

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
So I'm really excited to show you how to take these little rockets and turn it into something bigger

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.599
There's two parts to this build and the first part is making the rocket themselves to make the rockets we need aluminum foil

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.960
Aluminum tape a box of matches and a couple of bamboo skewers the second part of the build is the revolver itself and for that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.789
all you're going to need is some cardboard from a cereal box of your choice some more bamboo skewers a

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.039
barbecue lighter and some small zip ties

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.199
the previous matchbox Rockets video explains in a lot of detail how to make these little Rockets

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.688
But we're just going to go over the process really quick for you right now

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.750
using the provided

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.040
Pattern cut the five sided shape out of aluminum foil the previous video shows how you can use paper towel or toilet paper to cut

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.389
Out several of these shapes at once which is what we're going to want to do since we have several rockets to launch

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.209
If you don't include the layers of toilet paper or a paper towel between the foil the edges will curl together

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.640
And you won't be able to separate your different pieces of foil

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.739
The provided pattern shows how far the bamboo skewers should be rolled into the foil rocket

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.160
Update guys, we have a bunch of our foil Rockets made

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.660
And we're ready to start building the revolver to launch them off the first thing you need to do is cut a flat piece of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.660
cardboard out of your cereal box

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.870
The next step is to figure out

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.330
what size of circle to cut out of the cardboard for our revolver on my barbecue lighter you can see that the flame is a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.690
little under 1 inch high after measuring your flame measure that same distance from either side of your barbecue lighter this measurement will give you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.290
a good estimate for the spacing of your six rocket revolver launch rods

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.389
We're going to want to trace out two sizes of circles the first is the size of the measurement you just took and the other

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.060
one should be

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.750
1/4 to 3/8 of an inch larger in diameter the best way to do that is with a compass if you don't have a compass

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.920
There are several household items

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.580
You can use to trace like a cup a roll of tape or the lid to a spray can

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.080
You'll want to take the diameter of the measurement and draw two circles that size now

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.809
We'll extend our compass by about an eighth of an inch and draw a second circle around each of our first circles now

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.060
We'll show you a trick to get six equally spaced points around your circle so that your rocket-launch rods will be equally spaced

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.160
Using the measurement of the radius of your first circle place the point of the compass on the edge of the circle

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.050
Mark where your pencil touches the line of your drawn circle as well as the point where your compass was

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.209
Using a drill bit the same size of your barbecue lighter you want to drill a hole in the center of each of your cardboard

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.449
Circles with my barbecue lighter. I'm using a 3/8 inch bit

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.369
Next using a drill bit the same size as your bamboo skewers drill out each of the six points around a circle

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.070
I find that a 1/8 inch fit is just the right size

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.480
If the edges of the holes are a little bit ragged once you've drilled them just go over them with a little bit of sandpaper

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.209
Once you've got all of your holes drilled you're ready to cut out your circles

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.429
Next find six bamboo skewers that are pretty straight at least on the top half turn all of the bamboo skewers about halfway down the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.859
Tapered point and then lightly sand the top two inches

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.550
We've got all of our parts ready and it's time to start assembling

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.969
But you know that here at the king of random we like to decorate and now is the time to do that

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.309
OK, we've decorated all of our pieces now

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:53.869
Let's put it all together start pushing your bamboo skewers through the holes that you drilled in both pieces of cardboard

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.459
Try to be sure that the tips of the bamboo all reach the same length in front of the cardboard and that the two pieces

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.460
Of cardboard are parallel to each other

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:08.209
Before we permanently attach the skewers to the cardboard we want to make sure the whole mechanism is properly aligned

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:14.119
To make sure that the extra bits of the bamboo skewer aren't hitting the handle of your lighter while you're doing the alignment clip everything

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.519
Off about a quarter inch behind the back piece of cardboard

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.908
Once you have all of your bamboo skewers inserted and properly aligned secure them in place with a few drops of superglue

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.060
Once the glue has dried your rocker revolver is almost finished, and there's just a couple more details

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.060
We need to add you want to move your revolver

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.400
Apparatus to where the points of the bamboo skewers lines up with the tip of the flame

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.729
Attach a zip tie to the barbecue lighter tighten it most of the way and move it forward until it is pressing against the cardboard

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:41.460
circle

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.269
Attach a second zip tie right behind it facing the other direction screw the revolver apparatus up to the front of the barbecue lighter

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.009
So you can really cinch the zip ties as tight as they will go add one more zip tie to the front of the barbecue

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.259
Lighter press it up against the cardboard and cinch it tight

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.659
Clip the front zip tie as close to the locking mechanism as you can get

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.389
on the back zip ties you'll want to cut one of them about one millimeter above the level of the bamboo skewer and one of

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.389
them halfway down the bamboo skewer a

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.749
Couple drops of superglue will secure the two zip ties together and permanently attach them to the barbecue lighter

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:15.200
the to cut zip ties work as a locking mechanism

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.100
To keep your revolver in place as you switch from one shot to the next and now your rocket revolver is complete and ready to

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.020
Use let's load up those Rockets. We made before and fire them off now while Nate's getting that set up

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.838
Let's take a second to talk about audible so audible is an app that I have on my phone

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.929
It's one that I use all the time professional narrators read books

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.759
You can just basically plug in your headphones and listen to audio books wherever you go now

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:40.039
I know a lot of you go to work. You're taking the car

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.438
You're getting stuck in rush-hour traffic, or you're waiting for the train

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.049
What are you doing with that downtime audible is a service that hires professional narrators to read books that you can download

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.898
Plug in your headphones and listen to at the bus stop or on your daily commute so instead of wasting time now

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:57.889

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.420
I'm reading called The E-Myth by Michael Gerber, which I highly recommend you ever wonder

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.529
Why so many businesses fail or so many youtubers experience creator burnout?

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.860
This book really opened my eyes, and told me why as I was reading this book

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.660
I related to it like that is me

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.610
But it really is a great service guys one of my favorite features is you can listen to the stories on two times or three

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.870
Times speed so you can actually cram information as fast as you can process it in your brain

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.040
I really like that feature a lot. I use it my wife uses it and pretty much everyone

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.530
I know

Join the club the book club has there were alright. Let's jump back and see what Nate's doing

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.070
Alright guys and here it is all put together the rocket revolver

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.409
We've got six rockets loaded onto the front we can rotate from one to the next and launch them off one after another

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.288
Let's test out with this bad boy can do

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.130
There you have it guys

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.080
That's how to take the matchbox rockets from a previous video and amp it up to the next level so you have your very own

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.999
Rocket revolver using this revolver you can shoot off six rockets in a row which is a lot more firepower

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.590
This is a fun build that you can do in not very much time that takes rocketry to a much more mobile

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.030
Level check the link in the description below for the template for these rockets and start launching

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.450
Thanks for joining me in this project and I look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.180
This is audible
