00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.270
My key project is a set of drawings, a set
of designs that Wright produced for a golf

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.370
resort in Nakoma, which is, a suburb outside
of Madison, Wisconsin.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.890
This very small drawing here shows both the
resort structure and the buildings are meant

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.579
to resemble American Indian teepees.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.449
As well as two sculptures that Wright designed;
an American Indian man and an American Indian

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.449
woman.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.739
This is clearly a career long interest of
Wright's.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.170
He was interested in American Indian culture
and you do see instances of this very early,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.710
in his Chicago days when he's working at the
turn of the century.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.140
He's using actual art and artifacts produced
by American Indians.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.719
There was very much a vogue for decorating
with the art and artifacts of American Indians

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.290
and also sort of using imagery of American
Indians in homes in this period.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.880
Some people did this to such a degree that
they had what were called Indian corners in

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.180
their homes.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.149
Then you also have him out at Taliesin West
in Arizona decades later designing and producing

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.420
a totem pole for his desert fellowship complex.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:32.920
This concept that non-native Americans, namely
white men, can adapt a sense of Americanness,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.340
a sort of national identity separate from
the identity of Europe by aligning themselves

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.950
with American Indian culture; it was one way
of displaying Americanness.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.579
Wright designed the resort and the accompanying
American Indian sculptures in 1923 and 1924.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:04.460
I chose this project in part because it is
a very surprising project because the reference

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.260
to American Indians is so literal, it is so
overt.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.540
It's a sort of fantasy of Indian-ness; it's
a fantasy that is not necessarily sensitive

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.170
to the specificities of various American Indian
people.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.760
He interchangeably uses the terms teepee and
wigwam to refer to the resort structure here

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.070
as a very generalized kind of reference to
American Indians.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.160
Teepees areâ€¦they're sort of tent like, they're
conical, they're usually portable.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.660
Wigwams are very different structures that
are-- that are domed; they are generally more

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.660
permanent.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.880
These are two very different forms.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.600
These figures are fascinating because they
show a very stereotypical attitude to both

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.050
race and to gender.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:05.360
The attire of the male Nakomis appears to
be something that a Plains Indian would wear;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.700
he's wearing a kind of headdress that is typical
of Plains culture, whereas Nakoma is holding

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.410
an example of pottery, as is the small child
beside her.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.920
They both appear to be holding these pots
and that would indicate that these figures

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.680
are more southwestern.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.400
So it's the collapsing of various American
Indian peoples into one, sort of, recognizable

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.630
visual compendium here.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.680
He used references to other cultures, other
traditions, other peoples throughout his career

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.590
and it's not relegated by any means to American
Indian culture, so this is just one facet,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.680
I would say, of his much broader interest
in other cultures.
