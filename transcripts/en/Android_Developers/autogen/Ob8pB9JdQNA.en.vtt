tinder was launched in 2012 we were
 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.450
tinder was launched in 2012 we were
really trying to help people meet people

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460
really trying to help people meet people

around them you've got your phone now
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.760
around them you've got your phone now
everybody's looking down at it at that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770
everybody's looking down at it at that
 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.890
everybody's looking down at it at that
time they're not really interacting with

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
time they're not really interacting with
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.810
time they're not really interacting with
the people around them we wanted to

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820
the people around them we wanted to
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.620
the people around them we wanted to
change that so we launched in 2012

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630
change that so we launched in 2012
 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.720

countries 1.6 billion swipes per day
 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.590
countries 1.6 billion swipes per day
that results in about 26 million daily

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600
that results in about 26 million daily

what really matters is 1.5 million dates
a week but to achieve all of that we had

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970
a week but to achieve all of that we had
 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.820
a week but to achieve all of that we had
to craft an ecosystem and we looked at

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
to craft an ecosystem and we looked at
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.860
to craft an ecosystem and we looked at
the things that existed prior to us most

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870
the things that existed prior to us most
 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.360
the things that existed prior to us most
of these things came from the desktop

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370
of these things came from the desktop
 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.180
of these things came from the desktop
world and we looked at what we felt

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190
world and we looked at what we felt
 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.960
world and we looked at what we felt
could be improved upon in addition to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970
could be improved upon in addition to
 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.000
could be improved upon in addition to
just doing a mobile first platform so we

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010
just doing a mobile first platform so we
 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.710
just doing a mobile first platform so we
had quite a few goals for the for the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720
had quite a few goals for the for the
 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.809
had quite a few goals for the for the
platform in the ecosystem but a few of

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819
platform in the ecosystem but a few of
 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.450
platform in the ecosystem but a few of
them stick out specifically for how they

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460
them stick out specifically for how they
 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.130
them stick out specifically for how they
relate to our monetization later on

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
relate to our monetization later on
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.670
relate to our monetization later on
so we really focused on location it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
so we really focused on location it
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.190
so we really focused on location it
turns out that locations this pretty

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200
turns out that locations this pretty
 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.770
turns out that locations this pretty
important thing when you're trying to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780
important thing when you're trying to
 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.260
important thing when you're trying to
match two people up to physically meet

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270
match two people up to physically meet
 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.600
match two people up to physically meet
in the real world so we focused on that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
in the real world so we focused on that
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.009
in the real world so we focused on that
a lot of the things before us had

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019
a lot of the things before us had
 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.860
a lot of the things before us had
allowed the user to search for whatever

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870
allowed the user to search for whatever
 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.530
allowed the user to search for whatever
or put where they were and all but we

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540
or put where they were and all but we
 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.720
or put where they were and all but we
made it required that you use location

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
made it required that you use location
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.790
made it required that you use location
services from the app the GPS and all

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800
services from the app the GPS and all
 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.680
services from the app the GPS and all
that was the only way you could do it so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690
that was the only way you could do it so
 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.750
that was the only way you could do it so
you could only see the people around you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760
 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.000
the next is that we had noticed that a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010
the next is that we had noticed that a
 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.270
the next is that we had noticed that a
lot of you a lot of people especially

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
lot of you a lot of people especially
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.170
lot of you a lot of people especially
women were getting tons of messages and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180
women were getting tons of messages and
 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.500
women were getting tons of messages and
it created a lot of noise so you had too

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510
it created a lot of noise so you had too
 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.539
it created a lot of noise so you had too
many you got all these messages from

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549
many you got all these messages from
 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.940
many you got all these messages from
people you didn't want to be interacting

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950
people you didn't want to be interacting
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.009
people you didn't want to be interacting
with and then you couldn't find the

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019
with and then you couldn't find the
 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.270
with and then you couldn't find the
people that you were interested in so it

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280
people that you were interested in so it
 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.520
people that you were interested in so it
was pretty overwhelming for especially

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530
was pretty overwhelming for especially
 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.089
was pretty overwhelming for especially
for women to go through the previous

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099
for women to go through the previous
 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.740
for women to go through the previous
products the next couple are pretty

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750
products the next couple are pretty
 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.170
products the next couple are pretty
crucial we were trying to reduce

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180
crucial we were trying to reduce
 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.720
crucial we were trying to reduce
feelings of rejection on the on the flip

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
feelings of rejection on the on the flip
 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.400
feelings of rejection on the on the flip
side this kind of goes actually hand in

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410
side this kind of goes actually hand in
 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.809
side this kind of goes actually hand in
hand with the filtering of noisy

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819
hand with the filtering of noisy
 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.930
hand with the filtering of noisy
messages so you've now got a system

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940
messages so you've now got a system
 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.090
messages so you've now got a system
previously where you're sending a whole

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100
previously where you're sending a whole
 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.580
previously where you're sending a whole
bunch of messages hopefully meaningful

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590
bunch of messages hopefully meaningful
 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.610
bunch of messages hopefully meaningful
and linked lengthy ones to try to stick

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620
and linked lengthy ones to try to stick
 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.720
and linked lengthy ones to try to stick
out but you had this outbox or this sent

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730
out but you had this outbox or this sent
 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.580
out but you had this outbox or this sent
messages list that was basically just

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590
messages list that was basically just
 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.840
messages list that was basically just
your rejection list so we really were

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850
your rejection list so we really were
 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.330
your rejection list so we really were
trying to solve that in an addition is

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340
trying to solve that in an addition is
 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.229
trying to solve that in an addition is
tube solved that we actually did one

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239
tube solved that we actually did one
 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.120
tube solved that we actually did one
thing to kind of solve both of the both

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130
thing to kind of solve both of the both
 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.809
thing to kind of solve both of the both
the the noisiness and the rejection we

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819
the the noisiness and the rejection we
 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.640
the the noisiness and the rejection we
added the double opt-in or what we call

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650
added the double opt-in or what we call
 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.009
added the double opt-in or what we call
the double opt-in so only two people who

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019
the double opt-in so only two people who
 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.870
the double opt-in so only two people who
swipe right on each other are allowed to

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880
swipe right on each other are allowed to
 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.990
swipe right on each other are allowed to
message each other that kept you from

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000
message each other that kept you from
 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.229
message each other that kept you from
getting unwanted messages and it kept

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239
getting unwanted messages and it kept
 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.729
getting unwanted messages and it kept
others from spending too much time on a

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739
others from spending too much time on a
 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.680
others from spending too much time on a
single user that they weren't going to

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690
single user that they weren't going to
 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.580
single user that they weren't going to
get a response back from to reduce the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590
get a response back from to reduce the
 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.810
get a response back from to reduce the
feelings of rejection we also did a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820
feelings of rejection we also did a
 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.220
feelings of rejection we also did a

of hard to feel rejected by somebody you

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400
of hard to feel rejected by somebody you
 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.970
of hard to feel rejected by somebody you
can't remember alcohol works too so we

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980
can't remember alcohol works too so we
 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.360
can't remember alcohol works too so we
also wanted it to be anonymous you don't

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370
also wanted it to be anonymous you don't
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.570
also wanted it to be anonymous you don't
feel quite as rejected if you if the

other person doesn't know that you're
 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.680
other person doesn't know that you're
out there it's the worst thing is

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690
out there it's the worst thing is
 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.330
out there it's the worst thing is
putting yourself out there and then say

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340
putting yourself out there and then say
 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.750

hearing no so nobody would know whether

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760
hearing no so nobody would know whether

thing we did was we tried to create

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090
thing we did was we tried to create
 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.730
thing we did was we tried to create
something that was fun and simple that

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740
something that was fun and simple that
 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.410
something that was fun and simple that
comes through and the the lightweight

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420
comes through and the the lightweight
 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.350
comes through and the the lightweight
the game-like interactions the swipe

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360
the game-like interactions the swipe
 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.160
the game-like interactions the swipe
itself and this sort of gets us to the

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170
itself and this sort of gets us to the
 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.400
itself and this sort of gets us to the
point where about two years after

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410
point where about two years after
 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.160
point where about two years after
launching we're now trying to figure out

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170
launching we're now trying to figure out
 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.840
launching we're now trying to figure out
how are we gonna make money off this

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850
how are we gonna make money off this
 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.720
how are we gonna make money off this
thing costing us a lot of money run this

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730
thing costing us a lot of money run this
 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.230
thing costing us a lot of money run this
and we started to think of how we wanted

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240
and we started to think of how we wanted
 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.150
and we started to think of how we wanted
to do that and we decided that we wanted

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160
to do that and we decided that we wanted
 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.150
to do that and we decided that we wanted
to accomplish this by adjusting the we

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160
to accomplish this by adjusting the we
 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.590
to accomplish this by adjusting the we
needed to adjust some of the rules of

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600
needed to adjust some of the rules of
 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.650
needed to adjust some of the rules of
the games which of the game which we

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660
the games which of the game which we
 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.370
the games which of the game which we
felt we'd learned from from some unseen

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380
felt we'd learned from from some unseen
 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.040
felt we'd learned from from some unseen
unforeseen behaviors but we also wanted

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050
unforeseen behaviors but we also wanted
 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.560
unforeseen behaviors but we also wanted
to perhaps let people break our initial

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570
to perhaps let people break our initial
 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.170
to perhaps let people break our initial
rules so in 2015 we launched tender plus

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180
rules so in 2015 we launched tender plus
 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.130
rules so in 2015 we launched tender plus
we did we launched it with three

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140
we did we launched it with three
 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.840
we did we launched it with three
different features and we did price

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850
different features and we did price
 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.690
different features and we did price
testing which showed us that we would

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700
testing which showed us that we would
 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.990
testing which showed us that we would
start out with a $9.99 price point those

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000
start out with a $9.99 price point those
 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.660
start out with a $9.99 price point those
features included passport passport

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670
features included passport passport
 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.120
features included passport passport
allowed us and allowed you to break the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130
allowed us and allowed you to break the
 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.420
allowed us and allowed you to break the
location rule and the and so you didn't

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430
location rule and the and so you didn't
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.980
location rule and the and so you didn't
have to go off the GPS and you could

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990
have to go off the GPS and you could
 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.040
have to go off the GPS and you could
virtually travel anywhere in the world

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050
virtually travel anywhere in the world
 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.580
virtually travel anywhere in the world
then we also had rewind which allowed

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590
then we also had rewind which allowed
 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.650
then we also had rewind which allowed
you to go back spend a little bit more

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660
you to go back spend a little bit more
 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.830
you to go back spend a little bit more
time maybe change your mind on whether

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840
time maybe change your mind on whether
 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.550
time maybe change your mind on whether
which way you swiped for somebody now

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560
which way you swiped for somebody now
 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.250
which way you swiped for somebody now
the next feature paired with was paired

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260
the next feature paired with was paired
 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.409
the next feature paired with was paired
with a change to the overall game

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419
with a change to the overall game
 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.189
with a change to the overall game
we hadn't really expected this when we

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199
we hadn't really expected this when we
 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:53.360
we hadn't really expected this when we
created tender what weather with your

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370
created tender what weather with your
 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.089
created tender what weather with your
finger or a piece of meat what you're

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099
finger or a piece of meat what you're
 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:57.559
finger or a piece of meat what you're
really doing is creating a lot of noise

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:57.569
really doing is creating a lot of noise

one of the things that we were really

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590
one of the things that we were really
 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.760
one of the things that we were really
trying to get away from you didn't have

trying to get away from you didn't have
 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.820
trying to get away from you didn't have
these earnest matches and so what we

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830
these earnest matches and so what we
 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.890
these earnest matches and so what we
decided to do was to limit the number of

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900
decided to do was to limit the number of
 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.649
decided to do was to limit the number of
match number of swipes right swipes that

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:09.659
match number of swipes right swipes that

you could do per day to hopefully make

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:11.189
you could do per day to hopefully make
 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:12.409
you could do per day to hopefully make
people think a little bit more about

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419
people think a little bit more about
 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:16.869
people think a little bit more about
their choices but because we like money

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:16.879
their choices but because we like money
 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.399
their choices but because we like money
and because we thought maybe there are

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:19.409
and because we thought maybe there are
 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:24.080

reasons for you to be able to to have a
 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.149
reasons for you to be able to to have a
little bit more we gave you unlimited

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:26.159
little bit more we gave you unlimited
 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.499
little bit more we gave you unlimited
right swipes and this concludes the

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:30.509
right swipes and this concludes the
 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:33.279
right swipes and this concludes the
first feature set that we had launched

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:33.289
first feature set that we had launched
 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.730
first feature set that we had launched
but as time went on we added a few more

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:36.740
but as time went on we added a few more
 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.320
but as time went on we added a few more
that included super like and boost super

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.330
that included super like and boost super
 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.730
that included super like and boost super
like allows you to sort of break the

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740
like allows you to sort of break the
 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.939
like allows you to sort of break the
anonymity rule it would allow you to

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:46.949
anonymity rule it would allow you to
 

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:48.680
anonymity rule it would allow you to
express interest in somebody which in

confidence or and makes it more likely

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:54.389
confidence or and makes it more likely

that that person is going to swipe right

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:55.830
that that person is going to swipe right
 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.230
that that person is going to swipe right
on you them knowing that you already

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240
on you them knowing that you already
 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.110
on you them knowing that you already
liked them and then we gave boost which

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120
liked them and then we gave boost which
 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.140
liked them and then we gave boost which
basically everybody has to stand in line

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.150
basically everybody has to stand in line
 

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.050
basically everybody has to stand in line
it's only fair but boost allows you to

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.060
it's only fair but boost allows you to
 

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.999
it's only fair but boost allows you to
cut in line a little bit for a temporary

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:08.009
cut in line a little bit for a temporary
 

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:11.869
cut in line a little bit for a temporary
amount of time we also added a slew of

00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:11.879
amount of time we also added a slew of
 

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.610
amount of time we also added a slew of
other features I won't really go into

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.620
other features I won't really go into
 

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.550
other features I won't really go into
them but what I think the real point

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560
them but what I think the real point
 

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.309
them but what I think the real point
here is is we had a whole bunch of

00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319
here is is we had a whole bunch of
 

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:22.070
here is is we had a whole bunch of
features and our price point stayed the

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080
features and our price point stayed the
 

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.050
features and our price point stayed the
same so we're giving you that much more

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060
same so we're giving you that much more
 

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.540
same so we're giving you that much more
value than we originally did with tender

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:26.550
value than we originally did with tender
 

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:32.300
value than we originally did with tender
plus so now that you kind of know where

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.310
plus so now that you kind of know where
 

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.639
plus so now that you kind of know where
how we got to all of this and and where

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:34.649
how we got to all of this and and where
 

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:36.889
how we got to all of this and and where
we were at this point how it ties into

00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:36.899
we were at this point how it ties into
 

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:40.159
we were at this point how it ties into
our ecosystem to the point of before

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:40.169
our ecosystem to the point of before

know to build kind of a global business
you don't need this massive team so if

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800
you don't need this massive team so if
 

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.269
you don't need this massive team so if
you're sitting in your office thinking

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279
you're sitting in your office thinking
 

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:29.259
you're sitting in your office thinking
you know that's great that tinder did

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:29.269
you know that's great that tinder did
 

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:30.819
you know that's great that tinder did
that but I probably can't do that you

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:30.829
that but I probably can't do that you
 

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:33.460
that but I probably can't do that you
you can you just need the right kind of

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:33.470
you can you just need the right kind of
 

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.269
you can you just need the right kind of
the right roadmap instead of ideas so as

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279
the right roadmap instead of ideas so as
 

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.280
the right roadmap instead of ideas so as
mentioned Jonathan just showed you all

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.290
mentioned Jonathan just showed you all
 

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.879
mentioned Jonathan just showed you all
the other rules that he created my job

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:42.889
the other rules that he created my job
 

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:44.230
the other rules that he created my job
when I walk in the office every morning

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240
when I walk in the office every morning
 

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.759
when I walk in the office every morning
is to think of what rules we can break

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:45.769
is to think of what rules we can break
 

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:48.490
is to think of what rules we can break
and and what features we can give some

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.500
and and what features we can give some
 

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.309
and and what features we can give some
subset of customers but not everybody

00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:51.319
subset of customers but not everybody
 

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:52.660
subset of customers but not everybody
because it would literally break the

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:52.670
because it would literally break the
 

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.790
because it would literally break the
game of tinder so if you think of Bruce

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800
game of tinder so if you think of Bruce
 

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.439
game of tinder so if you think of Bruce
as an example if everyone was boosting

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:56.449
as an example if everyone was boosting
 

00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:58.780
as an example if everyone was boosting
at the same time the whole world would

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:58.790
at the same time the whole world would
 

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.759
at the same time the whole world would
be boosting and the game would just

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:00.769
be boosting and the game would just
 

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:02.470
be boosting and the game would just
break and so I'm thinking of things that

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480
break and so I'm thinking of things that
 

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.379
break and so I'm thinking of things that
we can give people and limited cohorts

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:05.389
we can give people and limited cohorts
 

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:06.579
we can give people and limited cohorts
that that will make the game more

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:06.589
that that will make the game more
 

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:10.809
that that will make the game more
efficient or fun and the key thing here

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:10.819
efficient or fun and the key thing here
 

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.179
efficient or fun and the key thing here
is if you if you think that any rule

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:13.189
is if you if you think that any rule
 

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:14.740
is if you if you think that any rule
that you build in your products so all

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:14.750
that you build in your products so all
 

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.939
that you build in your products so all
those rules that Jonathan does should

00:10:15.939 --> 00:10:15.949
those rules that Jonathan does should
 

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.740
those rules that Jonathan does should
you if you think those are sacred and

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:17.750
you if you think those are sacred and
 

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.970
you if you think those are sacred and
you walk into work of it and you're like

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:18.980
you walk into work of it and you're like
 

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.059
you walk into work of it and you're like
you know we could never do that your job

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:22.069
you know we could never do that your job
 

00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:24.340
you know we could never do that your job
is to is to challenge that so go to work

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:24.350
is to is to challenge that so go to work
 

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.280
is to is to challenge that so go to work
every day think of what's what's in your

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.290
every day think of what's what's in your
 

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.920
every day think of what's what's in your
game your application that you can you

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:29.930
game your application that you can you
 

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.749
game your application that you can you
can unlock for a certain subset subset

00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:31.759
can unlock for a certain subset subset
 

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:35.530
can unlock for a certain subset subset
of people so if there's any two things

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:35.540
of people so if there's any two things
 

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.329
of people so if there's any two things
to take away today it's it's these two

00:10:37.329 --> 00:10:37.339
to take away today it's it's these two
 

00:10:37.339 --> 00:10:39.400
to take away today it's it's these two
it's this is how I think about

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.410
it's this is how I think about
 

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.569
it's this is how I think about
monetization its access and exposure and

00:10:43.569 --> 00:10:43.579
monetization its access and exposure and
 

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:46.480
monetization its access and exposure and
you can read all sorts of books on game

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:46.490
you can read all sorts of books on game
 

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.340
you can read all sorts of books on game
theory and how you how you design games

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.350
theory and how you how you design games
 

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.009
theory and how you how you design games
but if you just have those two things in

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:51.019
but if you just have those two things in
 

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:52.869
but if you just have those two things in
mind you can probably go to work and

00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:52.879
mind you can probably go to work and
 

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:56.590
mind you can probably go to work and
come up with some pretty cool ideas a

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600
come up with some pretty cool ideas a
 

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.139
come up with some pretty cool ideas a
lot of what we do and and this is this

00:10:59.139 --> 00:10:59.149
lot of what we do and and this is this
 

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:02.590
lot of what we do and and this is this
is a newspaper article from the 1800s I

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600
is a newspaper article from the 1800s I
 

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.379
is a newspaper article from the 1800s I

show you this because you don't always
 

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:08.319
show you this because you don't always
need an event something new what you can

00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:08.329
need an event something new what you can

so this is this is a a male paid 25

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:13.310
so this is this is a a male paid 25
 

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.950
so this is this is a a male paid 25
cents for this which is four dollars and

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:14.960
cents for this which is four dollars and
 

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.100
cents for this which is four dollars and
fifty cents now he took out an odd scene

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.110
fifty cents now he took out an odd scene
 

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.960
fifty cents now he took out an odd scene
he's an honourable gentleman waiting for

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:19.970
he's an honourable gentleman waiting for
 

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.750
he's an honourable gentleman waiting for
the right woman tinder is obviously a

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760
the right woman tinder is obviously a
 

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.050
the right woman tinder is obviously a
lot more efficient but you know we're

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:26.060
lot more efficient but you know we're
 

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.760
lot more efficient but you know we're
not always inventing new things and if

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:27.770
not always inventing new things and if
 

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.620
not always inventing new things and if
you if you look at some of the features

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:29.630
you if you look at some of the features
 

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.900
you if you look at some of the features
we built you can probably find something

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:31.910
we built you can probably find something
 

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.750
we built you can probably find something
historically that did something similar

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760
historically that did something similar
 

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.490
historically that did something similar
but our jobs to make them kind of 10x

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:36.500
but our jobs to make them kind of 10x
 

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.630
but our jobs to make them kind of 10x
better and so speaking of history this

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640
better and so speaking of history this
 

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.410
better and so speaking of history this
this is what we built last year 2017

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:43.420
this is what we built last year 2017
 

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.090
this is what we built last year 2017
it's a feature called likes you which we

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:46.100
it's a feature called likes you which we
 

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.310
it's a feature called likes you which we
package within tinder gold and I'm going

to show you kind of the crazy
development I've never shared this

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.130
development I've never shared this
 

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.470
development I've never shared this
actually so we'll see how it goes well

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480
actually so we'll see how it goes well
 

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.300
actually so we'll see how it goes well
show you the development process that

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.310
show you the development process that
 

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.210
show you the development process that
went into this we made some some really

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:58.220
went into this we made some some really
 

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.800
went into this we made some some really
bad decisions and some good decisions

00:11:59.800 --> 00:11:59.810
bad decisions and some good decisions
 

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.889
bad decisions and some good decisions
but ultimately really happy where we

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:02.899
but ultimately really happy where we
 

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:07.030
but ultimately really happy where we

basically what you're seeing here is is
 

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.389
basically what you're seeing here is is
this is the upgrade below so as you see

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399
this is the upgrade below so as you see
 

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:54.329
this is the upgrade below so as you see
here you can upgrade for $9.99 a month

00:14:54.329 --> 00:14:54.339
here you can upgrade for $9.99 a month
 

00:14:54.339 --> 00:14:58.180
here you can upgrade for $9.99 a month
we still feel like so at $19.99 you're

we still feel like so at $19.99 you're
 

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.120
we still feel like so at $19.99 you're
basically paying $29.99 a month if

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.130
basically paying $29.99 a month if
 

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.889

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.610
you're paying $14.99 we still felt like
that was probably low but we thought

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:06.620
that was probably low but we thought
 

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.870

$9.99 felt like a good place to start

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:34.700
in one feature to justify an upgrade
 

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.640

these questions ultimately we we solved
 

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.490
these questions ultimately we we solved
everything through testing so you know

our older cohorts showed us that they
were willing to upgrade and we proved

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.050
were willing to upgrade and we proved
 

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.590
were willing to upgrade and we proved
that through a very limited tests but if
