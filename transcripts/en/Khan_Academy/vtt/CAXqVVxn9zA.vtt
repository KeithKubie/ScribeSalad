00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.650
An electrician has the following
lengths of cable: 23

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.130
inches, 49 inches, and 8 feet.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.760
How much cable does
he have in Feet?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.810
So these are the lengths.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.940
Each of these are the
length of a cable in

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.120
inches, inches, and feet.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.150
And we want to know the total
length, if you add all of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.640
these up, and we need the
total length in feet.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.770
And so the best way to do that
is to convert each of these

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.130
lengths into feet, and
then add them all up.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.680
So let's start with this one
right over here: 23 inches.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.940
So it's always important to
have your intuition give a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.050
little bit of a check on what
the answer should look like.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.470
There are many inches per foot,
so when you convert this

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.790
into feet, you should have
a smaller number.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.250
There are 12 inches per foot.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.170
So this should be
a small number.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.770
This is not even 2 feet.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.420
24 inches would be 2 feet.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.760
So this should be less
than 2 feet.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.370
But let's do it mathematically.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.560
So to do it mathematically, we
want this inches to cancel out

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.270
with inches.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.330
And the way you do that,
is you put that in the

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.580
denominator.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.360
So it cancels out
with the inches.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.450
And so we want feet per inches,
or foot per inches.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.680
I guess I'll just write ft.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.580
It could be feet or
foot, singular or

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.230
plural, it doesn't matter.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.680
So how many feet are
there per inches?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.380
Or another way to think about
it, how many inches

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.710
are there per foot?

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.120
1 foot is equal to 12 inches,
or you could say 1 foot for

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.520
every 12 inches, or you could
read this as 1/12

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.780
of a foot per inch.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.480
Either way, if we multiply this,
the inches cancel out.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.520
That's why we know, at least
mathematically, if we just did

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.390
it mechanically, why we
shouldn't multiply by 12.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.070
But also it should make
complete sense.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.910
We should be dividing by 12
because when you express this

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.770
distance in feet, it should be a
smaller number, so we should

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.120
divide by 12.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.150
So what does this give us?

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:09.470
This is equal to 23
times 1 is 23/12.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.820
This inches cancels out with
that inches, and we're just

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.250
left with feet.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.840
So that is 23/12 feet.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.840
And this is an improper
fraction, but I'll leave it as

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.090
an improper fraction for now
because they're actually

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.370
easier to manipulate
than mixed numbers.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.660
So that's that first cable.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.190
Let's do the second one
right here: 49 inches.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.810
So the second cable
is 49 inches, and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.630
we do the same thing.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.160
We want to convert it to feet.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.760
We have inches in
the denominator.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.610
We should end up dividing by
something because we want a

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.280
smaller number.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.050
49 inches will be a smaller
number of feet

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.520
by a factor of 12.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.610
So what we care about is feet
per inches, and we know that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.840
there is 1 foot for every
12 inches, or 1/12

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.940
of a foot per inch.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.290
It can be read either way.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.770
When you multiply, the inches
will cancel out, and we will

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:04.590
be left with 49 times 1, which
is 49, over 12 feet.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.450
That is the second cable.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.310
And then we have this
last cable right

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.390
here, this 8-foot cable.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.950
The very last one is 8 feet, and
if we want, we can convert

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.710
that into an improper
fraction.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.500
At this point, there's two
ways we can do it.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.680
Everything is in feet.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.190
Here, it's improper fractions.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.360
We could, if we want, convert
these into mixed numbers and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.780
then add them up, or we can
convert this into an improper

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.350
fraction that has the same
denominator, and

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.280
then add them up.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.450
And the easiest way, I think, is
to just have this with the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.230
denominator 12.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.530
So 8 feet is the same thing
as what over 12?

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.870
Well, what's 8 times 12?

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.320
It's 96, right?

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.580
96 divided by 12 is 8.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.340
8 is the same thing as 96/12.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.610
These are equivalent.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.320
Let me make sure this 8 and
96/12 is the exact same thing.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.850
I picked 12 because these have
12 in the denominator.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.900
And then I said, 12
times 8 is 96.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.560
So 8 feet is the same
thing as 96/12 feet.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.470
And now I can add
everything up.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.780
The total length of cable he has
is-- I'll do it over here.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:22.200
It's 96/12 plus 23/12 plus
49/12, and everything is in

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.640
feet, so this answer will
give us in feet.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.650
We have all of the same
denominators.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.970
Our denominator is 12.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.080
And so our numerator's going
to be 96 plus 23 plus 49.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.360
Let's add that up over here.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.020
So 96, 23, 49, we have
to add it up.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.630
6 plus 3 is 9.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.010
9 plus 9 is 18.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.780
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.630
10 plus 2 is 12.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.650
12 plus 4 is 16.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.930
So that's 168.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.120
So this expression right here is
equal to 168/12, which is a

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.590
valid answer.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.840
And, of course, all of
these are in feet,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.090
so it's 168/12 feet.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.410
But let's write this now as a
mixed number, so that we have

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.890
a better idea of really
how many feet it is.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.410
And to do that, we just
divide 168 by 12.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.790
So 12 goes into 168.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.140
It doesn't go into 1.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.400
It goes into 16 exactly
one time.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.520
1 times 12 is 12.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.400
We subtract.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.580
16 minus 12 is 4.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.110
Bring down the 8.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.270
12 goes into 48 four times.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.610
4 times 12 is 48.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.840
And we have no remainder.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.140
So 168/12 is exactly
14, so this is

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.670
exactly equal to 14 feet.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:56.780
So our electrician has exactly
14 feet of cable.
