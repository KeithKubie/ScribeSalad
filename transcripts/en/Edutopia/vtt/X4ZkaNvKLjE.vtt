00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:08.356
&gt;&gt;Be careful.

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:10.696
I don't want you to think that I'm
saying that lecturing is wrong.

00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:13.706
There's a place for all
different modes of instruction.

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:15.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For decades,
America's schools

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.866
of education have spent
countless hours lecturing students

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.966
on teaching theory, leaving
many of them ill prepared

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.656
for the realities they'll
face in today's classrooms.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.536
Today, prospective teachers are
learning as much from working

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:32.726
with students as they are from
working with college professors.

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:36.736
And in places like the University
of Virginia's Curry School program,

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:38.976
they will graduate
with a solid grounding

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:42.336
in their academic subject
matter, and the teaching know how

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:46.156
to make concepts like the Doppler
effect come alive in the classroom.

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:49.216
&gt;&gt;Now what I wanna do is toss it
around the room, and I want you folks

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.666
to notice the sound
as it's approaching

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.926
or going away from you, all right?

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:54.236
Don't hurt anybody.

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:58.616
&gt;&gt;I wanted there to be an
opportunity for students

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:01.636
to experience the phenomena
in a classroom.

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:05.816
They have a basic understanding of
their content or their subject area.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.316
They're pretty green when it comes
to knowing how to teach that.

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:12.766
And I wanted to model how
you could start something

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:15.646
that really engages students.

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:17.136
&gt;&gt;Students: [applause, laughter]

00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.166
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We were trying to look
at if we could make mold grow.

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:22.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Curry, students
get into real classrooms

00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:24.276
with real kids, early and often.

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:28.326
Sophomore year is generally
limited to observing in classrooms.

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:32.266
Later in the program, students get
involved in one on one tutoring.

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.636
&gt;&gt;And try doing file, quit,
and see if that works.

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:37.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They also develop

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:41.316
and present some class lessons
before honing their teaching skills

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:43.226
as full time student teachers.

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:46.826
&gt;&gt;I want you guys to
think of a person

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:52.276
who you think exemplifies you know,
you like the way they present--

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:55.676
they're a good actor or actress,
or they're a good speaker.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.706
&gt;&gt;It looks so easy, until
you get in there and do it,

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:01.856
and then you're like,
"Whoa, this is so hard."

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:04.316
I mean, getting ready for
a lesson, hours go into it.

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:07.116
Classroom management, I
mean, that is a huge issue.

00:02:07.216 --> 00:02:10.816
&gt;&gt;When you present information,
that presents information--

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:13.686
&gt;&gt;Mary: There's nothing like
walking into a classroom of twenty,

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:17.666
twenty five, thirty active students
and you've got to teach them.

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.706
And the first thing you've
got to do is to be able

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.036
to manage the classroom, because
if you can't manage a classroom,

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:23.436
you're not gonna teach
very much of anything.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:27.676
And the second thing you've gotta do
is to be able to present the lesson

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:30.906
in a way that the children
understand they can learn

00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:31.986
and they'll want to learn.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:35.876
There's no place to do that better
than to actually be in a classroom

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:36.596
with a group of students.

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:40.196
&gt;&gt;Need to decide which piece of
artwork each person's gonna do

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:41.506
and then who's gonna
do the biography.

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:43.746
&gt;&gt;You find that picture
that you wanted.

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:47.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kindergarten teacher,
Virginia Coffey, serves as a mentor

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:49.496
for Curry students like Alexa Kane.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.956
Coffey graduated from
Curry before it began

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:55.416
to emphasize early classroom
exposure, which, she feels,

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:56.826
is essential for success.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:59.366
&gt;&gt;It's a very sink
or swim profession,

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:04.456
and so I think it's valuable
that Curry has chosen to put them

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:08.416
in earlier and give them more
exposure over a period of time.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:12.106
&gt;&gt;How much time do lawyers get and
how much time to medical doctors get

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:14.336
to work under supervision?

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.796
But I think it's the same in anything
you do, where the more you do it,

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.946
the better you get
because of that experience.

00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:21.536
&gt;&gt;All: Run, run, as fast as you can.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.526
You can't catch me, I'm
the gingerbread man.

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:27.536
&gt;&gt;Kenny, if you weren't so
dumb, we'd be done by now.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:28.396
&gt;&gt;Calm down, Leon.

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:29.556
Just 'cause you did all the work

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:30.976
on this assignment doesn't
mean you're better than us.

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:34.276
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To extend actual
classroom experiences,

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.406
Curry uses multimedia technology

00:03:36.406 --> 00:03:39.536
to offer the next best
thing, virtual classrooms.

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:41.706
&gt;&gt;Don't forget to work
on your project.

00:03:43.176 --> 00:03:45.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Developed by
Curry faculty members,

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:48.936
CaseNEX presents case studies
of teaching situations,

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:52.346
combining video recreations,
comments by experts

00:03:52.346 --> 00:03:55.936
and video conferencing
capability, delivered online.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.286
&gt;&gt;Okay, Edith, what's up?

00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:00.466
&gt;&gt;There have been several
reports about your unwillingness

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:03.416
to use the technology that's
available to you for your class.

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:05.356
Now to some parents,
that's very important.

00:04:05.356 --> 00:04:07.226
&gt;&gt;I have too much to teach now to try

00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:09.506
and incorporate video
games and the internet--

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.456
&gt;&gt;If I look at this
and I say, "Yikes!

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:13.836
This is something I might have to
deal with while I'm out there,"

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:15.576
then I'm gonna give it my all.

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:18.586
And so we're trying to prepare
people, edge them a little bit closer

00:04:18.586 --> 00:04:20.056
to what it's really like out there,

00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:22.486
and up their chances
for being successful.

00:04:22.786 --> 00:04:26.796
&gt;&gt;CaseNEX allows diverse groups
of students to share their views

00:04:26.796 --> 00:04:28.126
on common teaching dilemmas.

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:28.546
&gt;&gt;I don't know.

00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:32.976
There's these two sides to that
issue, so what do you think of that?

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:35.196
&gt;&gt;For this case, a Curry class links

00:04:35.196 --> 00:04:37.216
up with students at
Hampton University.

00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:43.066
&gt;&gt;We set up the video conferencing
camera and using iVisit,

00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:45.146
we saw each other online.

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:47.836
&gt;&gt;Okay, I agree with
what your student said.

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:50.256
&gt;&gt;I thought that was really
interesting, being that--

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:53.716
&gt;&gt;Then we brought up some of
the things that we really wanted

00:04:53.716 --> 00:04:56.996
to delve deeper into and challenge
each other's ideas on more.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:05:00.646
&gt;&gt;The first time I saw that case
got my mind working overtime.

00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:04.246
&gt;&gt;When you're able to take a look
at another culture, another school,

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:06.696
another neighborhood, much easier.

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:10.446
And form partnerships with people
through the Internet and email,

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:15.066
that opened lines of communication
that haven't been open before.

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:17.556
&gt;&gt;One of our students has commented.

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:20.016
Is this a good time for
me to share her comment?

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:20.976
&gt;&gt;Please do.

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:25.086
&gt;&gt;As the technology becomes
more commonplace in society,

00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:28.266
I think more people will be
talking frankly with each other

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:32.946
and that's got to improve, both
teaching and learning and society.

00:05:32.946 --> 00:05:35.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With the
combination of technology training

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:37.116
and early classroom exposure,

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:40.616
Curry is helping promising
teacher candidates achieve their

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.256
full potential.

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:45.076
&gt;&gt;I know you all have the
potential to be the kind of teacher

00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:50.026
that can change students' lives
and make students enjoy subjects

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:51.666
that they never thought
they could enjoy,

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:53.386
or that they could
have success in before.

00:05:54.836 --> 00:05:56.966
