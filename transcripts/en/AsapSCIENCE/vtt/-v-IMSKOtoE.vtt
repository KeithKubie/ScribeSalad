00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.540
For years scientists believed that
the brain was static, unchanging and locked.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.200
But our understanding has changed drastically to
the point where we now see the brain as

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.340
plastic and constantly changing.  But what
if I told you that simply thinking could

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.039
affect not only the way your brain works
but its physical shape and structure as

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.689
well?

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.259
It turns out this is exactly what
happens.  From a neuroscientific

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.340
standpoint imagining an action and doing
it require the same motor and sensory

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.270
programs in the brain.  For example, if you
were to close your eyes and imagine the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.349
letter "B" the primary visual cortex
lights up in the same way it does when you

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.980
look at the letter on the screen.  Take a
moment and imagine yourself writing out

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.960
your signature with your dominant hand.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.500
Chances are the amount of time it takes
you to simply imagine doing it is

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.100
similar to how long it actually takes to
write it out. Try doing the same thing

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.590
with your non dominant hand and it
actually takes you longer to write and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.429
imagine.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.620
How is this relevant?

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.640
Well because imagination and action are
actually integrated and engage the same

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.550
neural pathways, practicing one actually
influences the other.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.090
One fascinating study took two groups
and had them practice piano for two

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.079
hours a day.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.870
Except one group was only allowed to use
mental practice, they couldn't touch the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.159
piano but would sit in front of it and
imagine practicing. The surprising result,

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.630
the exact same physical changes took
place in the motor cortex of both groups.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.619
And after three days their accuracy in
playing was the exact same,

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.509
beyond five days the physical
practice group did begin to excel faster

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.229
but the imagination group, when given the
chance to practice physically, was able

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.069
to catch up to their skill level quickly.
 Perhaps more incredible is an experiment

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.560
which used imagination in an effort to
strengthen muscles.  Both groups did the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.229
same figure muscle exercises for four
weeks

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.820
though one group simply did it mentally.
Those who actually did the physical

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.280
exercise increased their strength by
thirty percent while those who imagined

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.930
doing it increased their muscle
strength by twenty two percent.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.520
This is because the neurons responsible
for the movement instruction were still

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.170
being used and strengthened, resulting in
increased strength when the muscles

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.900
actually contracted.  So while your
thoughts don't have some mystical or

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.820
magical power, mental practice is an
effective way to prepare for a physical

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.119
skill.  Each thought actually changes the
structure and function of your brain by

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.829
affecting the neurons at the microscopic
level.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.739
Though as much as we wish you could sit
there and become the next Mozart, it won't

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.510
happen without a lot of hard physical
work, but a little imagination never hurts.
