other strategy was to not let the device
make noise so let it just vibrate or

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050
make noise so let it just vibrate or
 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.650
make noise so let it just vibrate or
don't even let it vibrate at all another

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660
don't even let it vibrate at all another
 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.199
don't even let it vibrate at all another
strategy was to not let sources contact

is important for us to respect our users

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.130
is important for us to respect our users
 

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.730
is important for us to respect our users
attention and to allow them to have more

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.740
attention and to allow them to have more
 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.700
attention and to allow them to have more
control so this inspired some major

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:56.710
control so this inspired some major
 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.909
control so this inspired some major

who here has ever wished that they could

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:26.849
who here has ever wished that they could
 

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:28.609
who here has ever wished that they could
get some of the notifications from an

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:28.619
get some of the notifications from an
 

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:32.180
get some of the notifications from an
app but not all of them that's that's

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.190
app but not all of them that's that's
 

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.110
app but not all of them that's that's
almost all of you yep so knowing that we

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120
almost all of you yep so knowing that we
 

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.420
almost all of you yep so knowing that we
definitely wanted to add support in the

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:38.430
definitely wanted to add support in the
 

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.730
definitely wanted to add support in the
Android system so that users could have

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740
Android system so that users could have
 

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.459
Android system so that users could have
more granular control over an apps

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:43.469
more granular control over an apps
 

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:47.600
more granular control over an apps
notifications in oh we're introducing

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:47.610
notifications in oh we're introducing
 

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.199
notifications in oh we're introducing
channels and here's how it works

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:50.209
channels and here's how it works
 

00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:52.670
channels and here's how it works
you define a channel for each

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680
you define a channel for each
 

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.129
you define a channel for each
notification type that you want to send

00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:55.139
notification type that you want to send
 

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:58.610
notification type that you want to send
and then your users are able to make

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:58.620
and then your users are able to make
 

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.829
and then your users are able to make
decisions about notifications at the

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839
decisions about notifications at the
 

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:03.759
decisions about notifications at the
channel level let's look at an example

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:03.769
channel level let's look at an example
 

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:06.590
channel level let's look at an example
suppose that we are all the designers of

notifications you see here have to do
 

00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:34.519
notifications you see here have to do
with the executive program so let's make

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:34.529
with the executive program so let's make
 

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:38.319
with the executive program so let's make
a channel and call it executive program

now when we categorize notifications

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.310
now when we categorize notifications
 

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.340
now when we categorize notifications
into channels we want to look for

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:58.350
into channels we want to look for
 

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.590
into channels we want to look for
similar subject matter and similar

importance to users here we have a
 

00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:05.240
importance to users here we have a
number of notifications that could be

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.250
number of notifications that could be
 

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.699
number of notifications that could be
sent in the hours and minutes leading up

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:07.709
sent in the hours and minutes leading up

to the flight so they're pretty
 

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.840
to the flight so they're pretty
important let's create a channel for

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:11.850
important let's create a channel for
 

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.350
important let's create a channel for
them called flight updates and now with

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360
them called flight updates and now with
 

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.470
them called flight updates and now with
this example in mind let's shift over to

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480
this example in mind let's shift over to
 

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.280
this example in mind let's shift over to
how users experience channels

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.290
how users experience channels
 

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.650
how users experience channels
the UI design for channels is optimized

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660
the UI design for channels is optimized
 

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.930
the UI design for channels is optimized
for the number one most important use

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940
for the number one most important use
 

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.990
for the number one most important use
case which is I don't want this type of

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000
case which is I don't want this type of
 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.519
case which is I don't want this type of
notification from this app now without

notification from this app now without
 

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:37.040
notification from this app now without
channel any support for this use case

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.050
channel any support for this use case
 

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.710
channel any support for this use case
has to come from within the app with

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720
has to come from within the app with
 

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.930
has to come from within the app with
settings to block notifications by type

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940
settings to block notifications by type
 

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.269

now how did the user find out if an app

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279
now how did the user find out if an app
 

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:47.090
now how did the user find out if an app
provides this they have to open the app

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100
provides this they have to open the app
 

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.180
provides this they have to open the app
and look at the settings and it's not

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:50.190
and look at the settings and it's not
 

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.160
and look at the settings and it's not
like all apps are going to do it the

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.170
like all apps are going to do it the
 

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.780
like all apps are going to do it the
same way but a lot of the time there

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:56.790
same way but a lot of the time there
 

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.700
same way but a lot of the time there
won't be any way to block notifications

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:58.710
won't be any way to block notifications
 

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.190
won't be any way to block notifications
by type and at that point the user has

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200
by type and at that point the user has
 

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.800
by type and at that point the user has
to decide what they're going to do they

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:03.810
to decide what they're going to do they
 

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.630
to decide what they're going to do they
can ban the app from sending any

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:05.640
can ban the app from sending any
 

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.519
can ban the app from sending any
notifications at all they could

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:07.529
notifications at all they could
 

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:10.220
notifications at all they could
uninstall the app or just live with it

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.230
uninstall the app or just live with it
 

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.970
uninstall the app or just live with it
and none of these are ideal but with

and none of these are ideal but with
 

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.370
and none of these are ideal but with

channels it's a different story one
 

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.470
channels it's a different story one
that's straightforward and consistent

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480
that's straightforward and consistent
 

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.280
that's straightforward and consistent

most important insight that led to our

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:05.890
most important insight that led to our
 

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.180
most important insight that led to our
approach was that people are the VIP

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.190
approach was that people are the VIP
 

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.529
approach was that people are the VIP
notifications and absolutely all

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:10.539

what or
and so the opportunity here is pretty

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:16.630
and so the opportunity here is pretty
 

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.530
and so the opportunity here is pretty
simple make people notifications VIPs of

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:19.540

through these through this ordering and
 

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.980
through these through this ordering and
lastly we're going to be ranking

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:40.990

notifications within each section this

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:43.150
notifications within each section this
 

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.400
notifications within each section this
means if you have two message

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.410
means if you have two message

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.830
separated by something else in the
middle they'll always appear together so

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840
middle they'll always appear together so
 

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.600

people are the VIP notifications so
 

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.110
people are the VIP notifications so
we're going to put them right at the top

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120
we're going to put them right at the top
 

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.060
we're going to put them right at the top
of the drawer in the number one position

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:25.070
of the drawer in the number one position
 

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.980

since major ongoing is going to be
 

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.280
since major ongoing is going to be
pretty rare to get this type of

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:30.290
pretty rare to get this type of
 

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.480
pretty rare to get this type of
notification you should be set you

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:31.490
notification you should be set you
 

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.490
notification you should be set you
should be using messaging style with

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:33.500
should be using messaging style with
 

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.880
should be using messaging style with
direct reply or attaching a contact

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:35.890
direct reply or attaching a contact
 

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.960
direct reply or attaching a contact
to it so as it stands today a message

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:39.970
to it so as it stands today a message
 

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.390

notification is really not that valuable

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400
notification is really not that valuable
 

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.520
notification is really not that valuable
and until you interact with it there's

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:44.530
and until you interact with it there's
 

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.960
and until you interact with it there's
like one line of the message so you

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:45.970
like one line of the message so you
 

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.760
like one line of the message so you
don't know if it's worth actually

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:47.770
don't know if it's worth actually
 

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.560
don't know if it's worth actually
expanding and reading and then you

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:49.570
expanding and reading and then you
 

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:50.580
expanding and reading and then you
thought to make the decision if you

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:50.590
thought to make the decision if you
 

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.440
thought to make the decision if you
should reply to it and you may not be

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.450
should reply to it and you may not be
 

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.760
should reply to it and you may not be
able to reply to it directly within the

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:53.770
able to reply to it directly within the
 

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.020
able to reply to it directly within the
drawer you have to jump out of the

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.030
drawer you have to jump out of the
 

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.470
drawer you have to jump out of the
drawer

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480
drawer
 

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.350
drawer
so it's it's really just not that

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:58.360
so it's it's really just not that
 

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.500
so it's it's really just not that
valuable so in oh we've made one really

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:01.510
valuable so in oh we've made one really
 

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.150
valuable so in oh we've made one really
subtle change that has actually made a

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:03.160
subtle change that has actually made a
 

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.070
subtle change that has actually made a
really big impact on the messaging

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080
really big impact on the messaging
 

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.690
really big impact on the messaging
experience and that is that we're

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.700
experience and that is that we're
 

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.580
experience and that is that we're
exposing more lines of content in the

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:08.590
exposing more lines of content in the
 

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.260
exposing more lines of content in the
collapsed state of the notification so

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:10.270
collapsed state of the notification so
 

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.000
collapsed state of the notification so
now you can read up to three lines of

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.010
now you can read up to three lines of
 

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.010
now you can read up to three lines of
the message without having to spend the

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:14.020
the message without having to spend the
 

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.020
the message without having to spend the
time expanding the notification and

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.030
time expanding the notification and
 

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.330
time expanding the notification and
deciding what you want to do with it and

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:18.340
deciding what you want to do with it and
 

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.920
deciding what you want to do with it and

notifications and it's pretty simple to

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:40.570

notifications and it's pretty simple to
send one you just need to set the

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:45.280
 

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.720
so an N the visual representation of

so an N the visual representation of
 

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.340
so an N the visual representation of

all the other notifications the only
 

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.250
all the other notifications the only
difference was a slightly different

heavyweight presentation for content
 

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.490
heavyweight presentation for content
that's actually very lightweight it's

00:25:59.490 --> 00:25:59.500
that's actually very lightweight it's
 

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.200
that's actually very lightweight it's
bothersome of the users it takes up a

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.210
bothersome of the users it takes up a
 

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.960
bothersome of the users it takes up a
lot of space so what we've done in o is

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:03.970
lot of space so what we've done in o is
 

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.180
lot of space so what we've done in o is
we've taken the app name and the first

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:06.190
we've taken the app name and the first
 

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.340
we've taken the app name and the first
line of the notification and simplified

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:08.350
line of the notification and simplified
 

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.850
line of the notification and simplified
that down into a single line so the new

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:11.860
that down into a single line so the new
 

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.530
that down into a single line so the new
presentation is really meant to feel

presentation is really meant to feel
 

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.390
presentation is really meant to feel
lightweight so that users don't feel

lightweight so that users don't feel
 

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.190
lightweight so that users don't feel
bothered by them they don't need to

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200
bothered by them they don't need to
 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.570
bothered by them they don't need to
manage them because they're out of the

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:18.580
manage them because they're out of the
 

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.460
manage them because they're out of the
way and it's okay if they can glance

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:20.470
way and it's okay if they can glance
 

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.020
way and it's okay if they can glance
that and don't want to take action on it

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.030
that and don't want to take action on it
 

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.180
that and don't want to take action on it
right now you can also set your

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:24.190
right now you can also set your
 

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.160
right now you can also set your
notification to automatically expire so

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:26.170
notification to automatically expire so
 

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.200
notification to automatically expire so
that users also don't have that burden

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.210
that users also don't have that burden
 

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.270
that users also don't have that burden
of having to manage them as well the

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:30.280
of having to manage them as well the
 

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.400
of having to manage them as well the
advantage of this is that instead of

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:32.410
advantage of this is that instead of
 

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.590
advantage of this is that instead of
risking annoying your users by sending a

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600
risking annoying your users by sending a
 

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.360
risking annoying your users by sending a
notification in that general bucket you

notification in that general bucket you
 

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.810
notification in that general bucket you
can send it as a bTW instead this way

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:39.820
can send it as a bTW instead this way
 

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.250
can send it as a bTW instead this way
you don't have to hurt users trust by

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:41.260
you don't have to hurt users trust by
 

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.990
you don't have to hurt users trust by
risking something you can just put it in

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000
risking something you can just put it in
 

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.010

the bTW section also the full

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:47.020
the bTW section also the full
 

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.510
the bTW section also the full
functionality still remain so if the

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520
functionality still remain so if the
 

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.550
functionality still remain so if the
user taps on this bTW it expands the

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:50.560
user taps on this bTW it expands the
 

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.470

and if the notification has actions with
 

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.790
and if the notification has actions with
it those will appear as well so when you

00:26:59.790 --> 00:26:59.800
it those will appear as well so when you
 

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.400
it those will appear as well so when you
put it all together that comes it comes

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:02.410
put it all together that comes it comes
 

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:03.840
put it all together that comes it comes
together really nicely you can actually

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:03.850
together really nicely you can actually
 

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.720
together really nicely you can actually
tell a very intentional order within the

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:06.730
tell a very intentional order within the
 

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.840
tell a very intentional order within the
drawer and when we compare that with n

drawer and when we compare that with n
 

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.940
drawer and when we compare that with n
that's when you can really start the

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:11.950
that's when you can really start the
 

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.320
that's when you can really start the
difference you can really see the

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.330
difference you can really see the
 

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.120
difference you can really see the
differences come out if you squint your

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.130
differences come out if you squint your
 

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.070
differences come out if you squint your
eyes and look at n which is on the left

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080

correlate the notifications of icons of
 

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.770
correlate the notifications of icons of
how they appear in the set

ways to do this in the drawer so let's

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880
ways to do this in the drawer so let's
 

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.070
ways to do this in the drawer so let's
say you're in a meeting and you get a

or dismissing it altogether you can
 

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.770
or dismissing it altogether you can
snooze it and this is how you can do a

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:40.780
snooze it and this is how you can do a
 

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.660
snooze it and this is how you can do a
partial swipe which reveals two

vibration zone when it came in the first
 

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.120
vibration zone when it came in the first
time and you can use it it'll by
