00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.770
The idea of concativity
will show up a lot in

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.800
your calculus class.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.110
Well, what I want to do in this
video is, one, show you what

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.440
concativity is, or what concave
upwards and what concave

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.280
downwards is, and to have an
intuition of what those mean,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.090
and then discuss the ideas of
inflection points, which are

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.690
really just transition points
between being either concave

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.090
upwards and downwards or
between downwards and upwards.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.670
So the two ideas that we'll
talk about, one is being

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.460
concave upwards-- I'll write
that in this column right

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.710
here, and maybe in pink I'll
show you what the concave

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.900
downwards looks like.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.260
So a very simple way to think
about it is that concave

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.450
upwards is kind of a U shape.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.080
That's why it's called
concave upwards.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.230
It might look
something like this.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.090
Let me draw some axes so
you know that I'm actually

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.740
graphing something and
not just drawing a U.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.330
So maybe if that is my axis
right there, a concave

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.320
upwards graph would look
something like this.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.590
And we do it in green.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.140
It could look
something like this.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.030
So this graph, it'll just
keep going as x goes

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.050
positive and negative.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.160
Over the entire domain of this
function, this is my f of x

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.000
right here, it is concave
upwards, and you can see

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.260
it has this U shape.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.840
And I'll discuss in a second
what implication that has for

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.510
its slope or what the slope is
doing, but this is just very

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.580
easy to recognize visually.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.680
Similarly, let me
draw an axis again.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.775
I want to show you what
concave downwards looks like.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.460
Let me draw some
axes right there.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.770
I'm just trying an
arbitrary function f of x.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.470
It could be anywhere.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.140
It doesn't have to be-- you
know, the bottom point doesn't

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.640
have to be in the first
quadrant like this.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.500
It's just the general U
shape I wanted to show

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.070
you for concave upwards.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.410
Concave downwards, you could
probably guess what it looks

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.580
like based on-- if this is
upwards, downwards is just

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.130
going to be opposite.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.866
It might look
something like this.

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:07.170
It might look something like
this, so maybe this is some

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.490
other function g of x.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.680
And notice, it looks
like an upside down U.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.120
Over the entire domain
of this function, it

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.480
is concave downwards.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.490
So you can look at it, and
immediately see that, oh, well,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.560
if it's like a U, it's upwards.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.635
If it's like an upside
down U, it's downwards.

00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:25.100
But what does that actually
mean for the slope?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.950
So to understand that, let's
think about what's happening

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.180
to the slope here.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.420
So I'm just going
to do it visually.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.480
So at that point, the slope of
the tangent line, or the slope

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.400
of the actual graph, or the
instantaneous slope, however

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.020
you want to view it-- let me
see how well I can draw it--

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.690
it'll look something like that,
and that's the tangent line.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.420
Then as we increase x, so
that's at this x-value

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.500
right here, right?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.460
At that x-value, the
slope looks like that.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.240
It's fairly negative.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.800
Now, as we increase x, maybe
we go to another point

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.370
right here, what happens?

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.265
The tangent line will
look like this.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.180
It's still downward sloping,
but it's less downward

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.220
sloping now, right?

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.960
Here, it was a very
steep downward slope.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.520
Now it's a less steep
downward slope.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.920
And we can keep going if
we go to this point.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.590
We're still downward sloping,
but even less steep.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.840
And that keeps happening.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.740
We keep getting less and less
downward sloping, or less steep

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.590
in the downward direction,
until we get to this minimum

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.660
point, and you've seen this
before, where our slope

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.230
actually gets to zero, and
it just keeps increasing.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.340
It keeps increasing over here.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.350
If we go to this point, now
we're going-- we have a

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.630
steep upward increase.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.260
As we increase our x even
further, the slope at this

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.590
point right here, it's
increased even more.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.620
It's a steeper upward
sloping curve.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.520
So I want to make it very
clear, even though if we go to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.410
this left-hand point here, we
had a very steep downward

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.850
sloping curve, and as we went
up here, we went upward sloping

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.820
the whole time as our x
increased, the whole time as

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.290
we increased x, what was
happening to the slope?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.450
The slope was increasing.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.950
So as we increased x,
the slope increased.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.270
And this is the definition of
a concave upwards interval

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.340
or section of this curve.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.590
In this case, it was
this entire curve.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.580
I'll start showing you
functions that mix it

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.670
up in a little bit.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.630
Over here, we were
very negative.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.970
We became less negative.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.530
Becoming less negative is the
same thing as increasing.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.640
Even less negative over here.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.090
Then we were completely flat.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.490
Zero is a higher slope than
some negative slope here.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.760
And then we became positive,
and more positive, and even

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.550
more positive, so the entire
time our slope is increasing.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.820
Now, let's look at the
concave downward scenario.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.710
Let's start with a relatively
low x, maybe right here.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.340
Here we have a pretty high
slope, right, at this point?

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.060
We have a very steep
upward slope.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.320
As x increases, so we go to
a less negative x, so x is

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.740
increasing, we still have an
upward slope, but

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.050
it's less upward.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.860
So our slope has decreased.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.180
And over here, it's still an
upward sloping curve, right?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.180
It's going from the bottom
left to the top right,

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.790
but it's flatter.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.510
It's flattening.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.060
It's becoming less positive
until we get to this point.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.550
I didn't draw the original
curve that well, where we get

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.840
to maybe a maximum point
because the slope goes to zero.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.880
And as we increase now, our
slope becomes negative.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.930
It becomes even more negative.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.950
It becomes even more negative,
so as we kind of travel, as we

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:53.310
increase our x, as we increase
our x over this curve,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.010
our slope decreases.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.150
Slope is decreasing.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.105
Slope decreases.

00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:01.310
I want to make that very clear.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.600
The slope was very positive.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.740
This doesn't mean that
the slope is negative.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.910
It's just saying that over the
entire interval, the slope

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.180
continues to decrease.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.610
It goes from very positive,
to less positive, to less

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.010
positive, to zero, to slightly
negative, to more negative, to

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.000
very negative, so it just
decreases the whole time.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.630
In concave upwards, it
increases the whole time.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.330
So let me draw an example
that might have the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.900
combination of the two.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.510
Maybe I'll leave this
around just so we can

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.680
look at it for reference.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.160
Let me draw an
axis right there.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.660
Not the straightest line
in the world, but it'll

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.820
suit our purposes.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.380
Let me just draw
some curve here.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.780
So maybe I have something
that looks like that.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.040
Maybe I have a curve that
looks something like that.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.770
Now, over what interval of this
function's domain, maybe I'll

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.620
call it h of x, is this curve
concave upwards or

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.890
concave downwards?

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.470
Well, you can look at it just
from inspection, just from

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.680
that original definition.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.500
I said that concave upwards is
when you're like a U, concave

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.330
downwards is when you're
like an upside down U.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.380
So over here it looks like
a U from roughly this

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.120
point onwards, right?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.560
We have this U shape.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.220
We have this U shape and
maybe the curve just

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.000
keeps going on there.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.440
So, from here onwards, we are
concave-- let me write it over

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.762
here-- from there onwards, we
are-- I don't know want to

00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:34.625
do it in the same color--
we are concave upwards.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.050
And then on the interval before
that, from here and before

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:48.270
this point right here, we
are concave downwards.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.260
You can just recognize that.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
And let's explore what's
actually happening

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.380
with the slope.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.146
So over here, the tangent line
has a pretty high-- let me do

00:07:57.146 --> 00:08:00.460
it in a different color-- over
here, the tangent line has a

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.690
pretty high positive slope.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.420
Then it has a less positive.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.950
Then at this maximum
point, it goes to zero.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.150
Then it goes slightly
negative, even more negative,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.440
even more negative.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.800
So up until this point, the
slope is decreasing, which is

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.700
completely consistent with
what we said about being

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.240
concave downwards.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.120
But then something interesting
happens at a point

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.100
right about there.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.580
I'm not being very accurate or
precise right there, but right

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.930
about there, you see that the
slope of the tangent line

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.680
looks like that, right?

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.560
And that was more negative than
right here, which is more

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.950
negative than right there.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.770
But over here, something
interesting happens.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.910
All of a sudden, my slope
starts to increase again.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.570
It starts to-- I
want to draw it.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.990
Let me draw it as neatly as
I could possibly draw it.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.500
So over here, the slope
look something like this.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.330
So if we go backwards from
there, if we go into more

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.870
negative x's, the x's before
that had a less negative slope,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.780
so the slope was decreasing.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.470
But all of a sudden here,
when we go here, the

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.120
slope is slightly higher.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.630
It's less negative there, then
it's even less negative there,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.450
then it goes to zero here, then
it goes slightly positive,

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.350
and even more positive.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.830
So up until this point in
are functions domain, our

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.590
slope was decreasing.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.750
Our slope was decreasing
up until this point.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.976
And then after that point,
our slope is increasing.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.920
So this point, it seems like
we should call it something,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.650
and we do call it something.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.320
This point right here, where we
go from concave downwards to

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.440
concave upwards, and it would
actually be true if it was the

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.420
other way around, this is
called an inflection point.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.520
And this would also be called
an inflection point if

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.240
it was the other way.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.550
If we went from a curve-- let
me draw a curve that looks like

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.060
this-- that was concave upwards
and then it's concave

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.010
downwards, the point that we're
switching, the point at which

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.260
you go from one to the other,
essentially your rate of the

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.420
change of slope switches signs,
that is an inflection.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.820
So this is also an
inflection point.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.660
So what does this mean?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.480
Hopefully, you understand
visually what concave upwards

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.800
and concave downwards means,
and an inflection point, but

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.520
what does this mean for
the second derivative?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.500
Remember, the derivative is
the rate of change-- so

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.140
let me write this down.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.700
So f of x, that's just
the function, right?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.310
That's just the function.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.990
That's what we've
been graphing.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:42.020
f prime of x, that's the slope
of the function, slope of

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.310
function at any point x.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.560
You've seen that
multiple times already.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.900
What's the second derivative?

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.960
Well, you could view it
as the derivative of the

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.430
first derivative, right?

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.440
That's the slope of the
slope, or the rate of

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:05.440
change of the slope itself.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.620
So what did we say
about concave upwards?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.370
concave upwards is when the
slope is increasing, which

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.890
means that the rate of change
of the slope is positive.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.170
Well, what that means is that
the second derivative, which is

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.010
the slope of the slope, f prime
of x, is going to be

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.090
greater than zero.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.190
That's what concave upwards
just tells us, right?

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.110
Because if this is greater than
zero, then that means that the

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.420
rate of change of the
slope is positive.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.540
That's what we said
was concave upwards.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.590
Now, in concave downwards,
the slope is decreasing.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.300
The rate of change of the
slope is decreasing,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.810
or it's a negative.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.030
So in that case, the
second derivative would

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.020
be less than zero.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.830
And then in the situation when
we're switching, if over here--

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.830
let's look at this situation.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.940
We're concave downwards.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.380
We're concave downwards over
this interval right here.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.980
That means that the second
derivative has to be less than

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.940
zero over this interval.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.220
The rate of change of
the slope is negative.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.760
It's decreasing.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.050
So over this interval, our
second derivative is less than

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.750
zero, but then we go concave
upwards, so our second

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.510
derivative has to be greater
than zero over this interval,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.140
which implies if our second
derivative is continuous, that

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:29.310
the second derivative had to be
equal to zero at that point.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.710
I'll do that with some
examples in future videos.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.420
Now, this condition by itself
isn't enough to say that

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.600
it's an inflection point.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.750
In order for something to be an
inflection point, the second

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.850
derivative has to switch signs.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.160
It has to go from being
negative in a concave downward

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.670
to positive in concave upwards,
or it has to go from positive

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.100
in concave upwards to negative
in concave downwards.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.200
And obviously, in between,
it's going to switch.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.610
If you're switching signs,
you're going to hit zero.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.860
So when the second derivative
is zero, it might be an

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.940
inflection point, and then you
want to test around it to see

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.280
if it's actually switching
signs, and I'll show you

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.470
that in the next video.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.240
But hopefully, you at least
have an intuitive sense of what

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.770
inflection points look like and
what the second derivative

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.650
is telling us.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.160
If the slope is constantly
increasing, then the rate

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.770
of change of slope is
positive, then the second

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.250
derivative is positive.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:26.350
If the slope is decreasing,
then the rate of change of

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.760
slope is negative, which
tells us that the second

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.550
derivative is negative.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.850
And the point in which you're
switching from a positive

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.920
second derivative to a negative
one or a negative one to a

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.140
positive one, that is what is
called an inflection point.
