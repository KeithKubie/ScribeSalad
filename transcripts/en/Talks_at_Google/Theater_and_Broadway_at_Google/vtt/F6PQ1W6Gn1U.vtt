HENRY FAULKNER: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Talks at

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.000
presents "Drunk Shakespeare."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.876
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:12.375
Yes.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.880
We are very excited to
have this show here.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.300
This is an amazing production,
a self-professed "drinking club

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.520
with a Shakespeare problem."

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.450
They have come today
to perform and wow you

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.750
all, and especially on Take
Your Parents to Work Day.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.850
How many parents?

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.100
It's a dark room, by applause.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.886
There we go.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:40.010
But you're all very polite.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.350
I like that.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.650
A little bit of housekeeping.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.800
Before we get started,
phones, laptops,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.140
if you have a Zune,
anything that makes noise,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.000
if you could turn it off.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.350
Silence it.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.090
And rather than have
me explain everything,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.450
we will welcome the cast
for "Drunk Shakespeare"

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.600
to the stage.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450
I'm going to turn this
over right now, so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.370
that we can set what's about
to happen for you, to the very

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.145
talented, the very lovely future
Tony award winner, Mike Sause.

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:16.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.270
MIKE SAUSE: Future
Tony award winner?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.760
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends, Romans,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.870
people who think an iPhone X is
just a fancy, expensive Samsung

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.090
Galaxy, lend me your ears.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.740
We are the Drunk
Shakespeare Society.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.200
And it is an honor to
be here with you today.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560
There are some of the most
brilliant minds in all

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.015
of the world in this building.

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:36.390
And then there's
also people that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.560
thought Google Plus was
really going to take off.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.160
We are the Drunk
Shakespeare Society.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.210
And we gather every night
in a hidden library on 43rd

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.667
and Eighth to pay homage
to the Swan of Avon,

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.000
the brilliant Bard, the
eloquent Elizabethan, of course,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.290
I'm talking of
William Shakespeare!

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.248
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Whoo!

00:01:53.248 --> 00:01:54.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.091
CAITLIN MORRIS: Good man.

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:55.664
Good man.

00:01:55.664 --> 00:01:57.080
MIKE SAUSE: Now,
folks, what makes

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.038
us different than your
average run of the mill,

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:00.860
stick up your ass
Shakespeare company

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.070
is that we have found that
Shakespeare, his poetry

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.070
was for everybody, not just the
well-to-do academics watching

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.949
from above, but also these
inebriated groundlings,

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.500
these belligerent folk
who gave their day's wage

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.540
to laugh at a
well-penned dick joke.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.950
Thank you for coming, sir.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.860
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have been asked today

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.400
to curate a special
brief and boozy rendition

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.410
of Shakespeare's
star-crossed lovers.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.870
And we are going to celebrate
the only way we know how,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.660
by having one of our
very own society members

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.090
give in to the muse,
release their performance

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.116
to the spirits.

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:34.490
That's just a
fancy way of saying

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.540
we're going to get
someone hammered

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.370
and throw them into
a Shakespeare play.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.259
So your drunk actor
today, drumroll, please!

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.300
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Get it.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.800
Come again.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.390
MIKE SAUSE: Give it up for your
drunk actor, Caitlin Morris!

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.300
CAITLIN MORRIS: What?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.420
2:30 on a Friday?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.680
What is my life?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.108
Aw, yeah.

00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:54.536
Where my people at?

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:55.604
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yes.

00:02:55.604 --> 00:02:56.645
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh, good.

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:57.050
Hands in the air.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.590
Yeah, good.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.215
Thank you, sir.

00:02:58.215 --> 00:02:59.180
Thank you.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.630
MIKE SAUSE: That one guy.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.110
CAITLIN MORRIS: He was ready.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.540
MIKE SAUSE: Caitlin has been
day drinking like it's Sunday

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.770
brunch in Williamsburg.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.830
And we're going to add a little
bit more spice to her life

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.900
in the form of Bulleit bourbon.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.886
We have six shots of Bulleit
right now, four of them

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:13.760
are going to Caitlin.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.460
But two of them are for two
very lucky audience members,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.890
to prove to you this
is real alcohol she's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.690
about to get drank on, OK?

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.140
Now we understand this is
Bring Your Parents to Work Day,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.640
because most of you
are millennials,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.431
and you won't have
children till you're 50.

00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.610
So could I please have a
volunteer with their parent

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.810
to come drink?

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.520
Who would like to come drink
a shot with their parent?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.196
CAITLIN MORRIS: Come on,
what's better family bonding

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:37.450
than that?

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.630
MIKE SAUSE: Oh, no,
we saw you in back.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.470
We saw you in the back.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.890
Come on up!

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.310
CAITLIN MORRIS: Come on up!

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.968
MIKE SAUSE: Hurry,
hurry, hurry up!

00:03:40.968 --> 00:03:42.676
CAITLIN MORRIS: Come on up!

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:43.408
All right.

00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:45.505
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Aw,
that's-- yeah, get up here!

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:46.880
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah,
take your time.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.660
We don't have all day.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.270
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Don't worry about it.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.969
It's good.

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.010
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh my god,
did Mom initiate that?

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.801
MIKE SAUSE: Well, Mom
was the one doing it.

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.070
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah!

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.290
MIKE SAUSE: How's it going?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.810
Come on up.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.310
Come on up.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.595
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah.

00:03:55.595 --> 00:03:56.660
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah, watch
your step, my dear.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.360
What's your name?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.901
ELISE: Elise.

00:03:57.901 --> 00:03:59.030
MIKE SAUSE: Elise and?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.690
NICK: Nick.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:00.200
MIKE SAUSE: Nick.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.800
Elise and Nick.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.034
Give it up for Elise
and Nick, everybody.

00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:03.366
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yes, snaps.

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:04.700
Snaps.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.310
MIKE SAUSE: So can you
tell us what your son does?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.810
ELISE: No.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.605
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:10.730
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Go ahead.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.650
Any shot you want.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.860
Take any one you'd
like, not that one.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.280
MIKE SAUSE: Ooh.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.779
Gambit.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.570
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.529
All right.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.510
So this is to you guys.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.170
Thank you for loving
alcohol as much as I do.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.500
And I hope you got all your
projects done this morning.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.505
Cheers to you!

00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:30.920
Woo!

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.669
MIKE SAUSE: Now, is
that real alcohol?

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:33.210
NICK: Mm-hmm.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.730
CAITLIN MORRIS:
She's sipping it!

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.560
MIKE SAUSE: I like
how mom's a sipper.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.635
And the son's just like,
let's just do this.

00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:38.510
CAITLIN MORRIS: Good.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.230
You can savor that.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.040
Just take it back to your seat.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.310
It's good.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.980
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Yeah, just take them.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.410
CAITLIN MORRIS: You're awesome.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.836
Thank you.

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:43.636
MIKE SAUSE: Give it up
for them, everybody.

00:04:43.636 --> 00:04:44.510
Elise and Nick.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.560
CAITLIN MORRIS: You
know what they say,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.360
a family that drinks
together, stays together.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.970
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Or fights
a lot on Thanksgiving.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.220
CAITLIN MORRIS: And Christmas.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.180
OK.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.775
This next shot,
you know, I would

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:54.650
like to raise a glass
to all the amazing work

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.940
that you guys do here.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.440
It really is, like,
incredibly shiny and perfect.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.550
And specifically, I
want to give a shout out

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.247
to whoever created
the algorithm that

00:05:06.247 --> 00:05:08.330
ensures that every time I
type my name into Google

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.420
search, a picture of me in
the ensemble of "Kiss Me,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.580
Kate" from high school comes up.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.820
Thank you for your service.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.590
Cheers.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.620
Oh, my god.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.290
OK.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.470
Oh.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.678
Sorry that was a little burp.

00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:27.370
Sorry.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.705
This next shot I would like to
dedicate to funfetti cupcakes.

00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:32.986
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:35.451
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.150
CAITLIN MORRIS: They're the
best of all the cupcakes.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.440
They're my favorite.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.190
Thank you so much.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.080
Thank you.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.980
Since I do have this
platform, I would

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.744
like to take a moment
to discuss politics.

00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:48.410
No, I'm kidding.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.251
I'm not going to do that.

00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:50.750
I'm not.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.590
I'm just kidding.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.722
No, I just want to thank
you guys for coming out.

00:05:53.722 --> 00:05:55.430
I know this is like
a really random thing

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.770
to be doing in the
middle of your work day

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.000
with your parents.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.359
But imagine how much weirder
it is for me, you know.

00:06:04.359 --> 00:06:05.400
Thank you for being here.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.966
Thank you for all you do
to support Warby Parker.

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:10.840
There's some amazing
eyewear in the audience.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.577
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Really good frames.

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:12.391
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah.

00:06:12.391 --> 00:06:15.180
CAITLIN MORRIS: I hope you
guys have fun, and TGIF.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.312
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Let's go!

00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:17.770
MIKE SAUSE: Give
it up for Caitlin!

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.837
She's four shots in, everybody.

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:20.920
CAITLIN MORRIS: [MUMBLING]

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.434
MIKE SAUSE: And now we're
going to let that settle inside

00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:24.600
of Caitlin for a little bit.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.750
CAITLIN MORRIS: It's jumping
around inside me right now.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.541
MIKE SAUSE: And we're
going to turn it over

00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:30.880
to a moderated Q&amp;A with our
moderator, Mr. Henry Faulkner,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.350
and our creative team--

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.970
our producer, Scott Griffin;
our director, David Hudson;

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.054
and our resident
director, Lisa Klages.

00:06:38.054 --> 00:06:38.554
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:38.554 --> 00:06:39.051
CAITLIN MORRIS: Woo!

00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:40.045
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Pronounced with a lay-gus.

00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:41.039
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah.

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.530
Klages.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.937
CAITLIN MORRIS: Ah.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:46.520
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Hey, how's it going?

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.030
MIKE SAUSE: All right.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.290
Thank you guys for coming out.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.511
DAVID HUDSON: Yeah.

00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:50.895
CAITLIN MORRIS: Ireland.

00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:51.686
Cool shirt, thanks.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.600
HENRY FAULKNER: So
David and Scott,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.450
as the creators of
this show-- let's

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.680
go back first to the history.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.530
How long has this
show been running?

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.220
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Sure, so--

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.680
HENRY FAULKNER: There's a
little switch on the side.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.260
CAITLIN MORRIS: We
don't work in tech.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.750
So we don't--

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.260
HENRY FAULKNER: No.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.280
SCOTT GRIFFIN: How's that?

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.520
HENRY FAULKNER: We barely do.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.186
SCOTT GRIFFIN: So,
the show's been going

00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:14.840
for about 3 and 1/2 years.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.860
We've done almost
1,400 performances.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.021
And one of the three
performers you're seeing today

00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:24.770
has been with us since
the very beginning.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.020
And you can try and
guess who that is.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.550
Someone who's done
almost 800 shows.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.964
WHIT LEVENBERGER: God, help.

00:07:30.964 --> 00:07:32.380
SCOTT GRIFFIN: You
can place bets.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.670
DAVID HUDSON: 20% of
those have been drunk.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.690
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.120
DAVID HUDSON: More than
you know, but that's fair.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.200
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Do you want
to hear about the beginning

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.080
of the show, how it came about?

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.060
HENRY FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.790
Because this is highly
unusual, I would imagine.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.980
I mean, that I'm aware
of, other Broadway shows

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.220
are not-- consistently
cast members are drunk.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.840
But it could be true.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.680
So how did this come about?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.040
SCOTT GRIFFIN: So, I have
a background as a software

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.470
engineer and an
accountant from Australia.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:03.605
And after doing that for about
15 years, I decided to quit.

00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:05.382
I was, like, I want
to do something more--

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:06.548
HENRY FAULKNER: We feel you.

00:08:06.548 --> 00:08:07.797
SCOTT GRIFFIN: --entertaining.

00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:11.460
So I spent a year looking for
ideas for theatre productions.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.730
And then came across
this idea of doing

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.440
drinking and Shakespeare.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.810
And fortunately,
I was introduced

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.390
to David Hudson
and his wife Laurie

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.100
and their friend Beth Gardner.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.680
And they have a company
called Three Day Hangover,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.030
which is appropriate.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.610
And they create
classic plays in bars.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.570
And I think it was just
kind of a perfect match.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.777
And we started work on this
show, "Drunk Shakespeare."

00:08:35.777 --> 00:08:36.860
HENRY FAULKNER: And then--

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.870
so then how do you
put out the call

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.900
of, hey, we're looking for
Shakespearean actors, also

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.440
drunks?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440
CAITLIN MORRIS: [LAUGHS]

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.010
DAVID HUDSON: The kind
of remarkable thing is we

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.980
literally just put
it on Playbill,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.680
which is the theatre
website, the casting call.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.680
And we got close to
1,200 submissions

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.130
the first time around.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.730
So clearly actors
in New York were

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.040
interested in drinking onstage,
excited about the idea.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.039
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Getting paid to
drink and perform every night.

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:06.830
DAVID HUDSON: And we
hosted some auditions.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.570
And we saw probably
about 250 people

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.140
the first time around, over the
course of two or three days.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.510
And we saw some really
incredible auditions.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.782
We had one girl chug an entire
bottle of wine in front of us,

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:18.490
and then do her--

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.115
HENRY FAULKNER: And
that's my question.

00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:22.010
Do they come to
the audition drunk?

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.440
Do they get drunk
while they're there?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.430
Are they acting drunk?

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.030
DAVID HUDSON: We didn't ask them
to come to the audition drunk.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.860
We got a lot of people
who did come in.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.440
They brought maybe drunken
resumes, their history

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.186
as a drunken person.

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:36.560
SCOTT GRIFFIN:
One girl brought--

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.470
like, her friend had written
a resume, a reference

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.760
letter for her.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.680
HENRY FAULKNER: A
drunken reference letter.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.540
DAVID HUDSON: About
what she's like.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.540
HENRY FAULKNER: You can
find them on LinkedOut.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.290
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Binge
drinking many times,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.240
and she's, you
know, a happy drunk.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.948
DAVID HUDSON: We had
many people bring us

00:09:48.948 --> 00:09:51.560
gifts of small nip
bottles of bourbon

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.090
or whatever, just
trying to help--

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.570
MIKE SAUSE: Bribery.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.330
DAVID HUDSON: --win them over.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:54.560
Yeah.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.910
MIKE SAUSE: Bribery.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.380
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.870
DAVID HUDSON: So
it was quite fun.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.840
HENRY FAULKNER: And then
you've got to direct drunkards

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.650
at that point.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.980
DAVID HUDSON: Yes.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.960
HENRY FAULKNER: You don't
what kind of a drunk

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.460
you're dealing with until
you're in the moment.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:04.730
CAITLIN MORRIS: Mm-hmm.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.313
DAVID HUDSON: Yeah,
I mean, we don't--

00:10:06.313 --> 00:10:11.727
so the rehearsal process
is sober, which is fun.

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:13.810
We spend a lot of time
focusing on the Shakespeare

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.320
and focusing on
the comedy of it,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.810
really trying to get everybody
on the same page with how

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.316
the story is going to be told.

00:10:19.316 --> 00:10:20.690
And the amazing
thing is, is that

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.340
out of the now probably
25 to 30 people who

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.460
have been in the company over
the course of 3 and 1/2 years,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.410
we've always had really fun,
awesome people who have come in

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.010
and have been great drunks.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.710
And so we've been very
lucky in that regard.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.650
But it's nice.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.794
We spend a lot of time just
playing and having fun.

00:10:39.794 --> 00:10:41.210
And then the first
time they drink

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.220
is in front of an audience,
which is exciting for everyone.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.340
CAITLIN MORRIS: And scary.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.965
DAVID HUDSON: Especially
the audience--

00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:51.380
so they get to see some
wild and crazy choices that

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.480
are made in the moment.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.440
HENRY FAULKNER: So,
Lisa, on that note,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.470
what is the wildest
thing, either that you've

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.535
seen from a cast member
or an audience member?

00:10:59.535 --> 00:11:00.410
LISA KLAGES: Oh, wow.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.576
So we sort of have a mantra
among the society, which

00:11:02.576 --> 00:11:04.740
is that anything can happen.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.090
And that comes from both
the actors and the audience.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.970
We have had actors at one point,
one actor issued a challenge

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.050
to another actor.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.210
And when he lost the
challenge, the drunk actor

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.330
shaved his initials
into his chest hair.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.400
So it goes as crazy as that.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.240
I think what--

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.080
HENRY FAULKNER: During the show?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.840
LISA KLAGES: During the show.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.180
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
During the show, yeah.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.840
LISA KLAGES: In front of
an audience, absolutely.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.673
Anything can happen.

00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:27.074
HENRY FAULKNER: OSHA
must love you guys.

00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:28.490
LISA KLAGES: I
mean, our casts are

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.230
amazing at taking
something ridiculous

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.813
that the audience
brings into the room

00:11:31.813 --> 00:11:33.730
and just parlaying it
into something awesome.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.210
And like any of
the other shows, we

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.210
get audience members who
have cell phones go off

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.300
during the show.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.140
And one of our actors
heard a cell phone

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.960
and ran over and answered
it, and then proceeded

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.090
to do their entire
monologue to this person.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.460
And then about 40
minutes later, the person

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.022
that was on the phone
shows up at our theater.

00:11:52.022 --> 00:11:53.730
They were so excited
by what had happened

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.966
that they came to watch
the whole rest of the show.

00:11:55.966 --> 00:11:57.466
CAITLIN MORRIS:
That was you, right?

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:58.890
HENRY FAULKNER: That
is solid marketing.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.320
Yeah.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.180
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah, it is.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.760
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Person
to person, door to door.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.926
LISA KLAGES: You never know.

00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:03.760
Anything can happen.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.842
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:12:04.842 --> 00:12:06.450
And so for the actors--

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.792
Caitlin, Mike, and Whit--

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:10.750
what's your background?

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.110
How do you prepare
for a show like this?

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.430
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Years of drinking.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.400
No, I'm kidding.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.660
That's totally inappropriate.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.180
Don't do that.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.888
It's bad for you.

00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:20.670
It's bad for your liver.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.920
I went to school for acting.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.646
And I did some classical
training at school.

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.020
But then I also
moved to the city

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.060
and started doing comedy
and improv and stuff.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.170
So it was kind of the perfect
combination of things.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.035
And yeah, I also
do like alcohol.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.410
But not too much.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.850
I'm safe.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.210
MIKE SAUSE: My
background is not--

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.930
HENRY FAULKNER: "Do alcohol."

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.130
How you'd describe it
in, like, 11th grade.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.159
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:54.450
MIKE SAUSE: I mean, I've been
an improviser in New York

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.250
since 2012.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:57.930
That's pretty much
my main training.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.090
I didn't go to acting school.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.160
I have an English degree,
which I guess works

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.600
for this show in some ways.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.010
But yeah, mostly improv,
sketch comedy, stuff like that.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.200
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah, I
come from the Shakespeare

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.150
side of things.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.140
Before this show-- this
is the first, like,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.060
real comedy show
I've ever been in--

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.930
I did, like, every off,
off, unpaid Shakespeare

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.110
show under the sun,
a lot of them, like,

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.660
one night performances, not
rehearsed sort of thing.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.410
So I came to the show
more from that side.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.820
But it's been a wild ride.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.010
It's been a lot
of fun, you know.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:36.510
DAVID HUDSON: 3 and
1/2 years later.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.730
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.850
HENRY FAULKNER: What are your
favorite Shakespeare plays?

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.050
MIKE SAUSE: I mean, it's
completely hackneyed to say it,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.627
but "Hamlet."

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:48.210
I mean, it's--

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:48.450
CAITLIN MORRIS: It's a good one.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.240
MIKE SAUSE: --cliche, but--

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.720
HENRY FAULKNER: It's
cliche for a reason.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.428
MIKE SAUSE: --yeah,
it's my favorite one.

00:13:51.428 --> 00:13:54.877
I just saw the one at The Public
with Oscar Isaac, and it was--

00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:55.710
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yum.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.210
MIKE SAUSE: --incredible.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.706
Keegan-Michael Key was
my favorite part, though.

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:00.580
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.110
Whit?

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.890
WHIT LEVENBERGER: I'm
a "Twelfth Night" guy.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.595
Love "Twelfth Night."

00:14:03.595 --> 00:14:03.870
HENRY FAULKNER: Ooh.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.828
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah.

00:14:04.828 --> 00:14:05.929
Well, it's a really--

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:07.470
the great thing
about "Twelfth Night"

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.803
is there isn't a bad role in it.

00:14:08.803 --> 00:14:11.790
So if you're in the show,
you're going to have fun.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.440
And all of the characters are
so distinct from one another.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.170
And they're all completely
insane in opposing and fun

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:17.670
ways.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:22.560
And I've never not enjoyed
seeing "Twelfth Night."

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.045
Which is-- I've really
unenjoyed a lot of shows.

00:14:25.045 --> 00:14:26.286
So that's a good thing.

00:14:26.286 --> 00:14:28.036
CAITLIN MORRIS: Um,
"Shakespeare in Love."

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.100
They have the best sex scenes.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.319
MIKE SAUSE: I cannot--

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:34.360
CAITLIN MORRIS: Whatever.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.850
Or I like "King Lear," too.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.960
Ugh.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.840
MIKE SAUSE: Did you just give
an "ugh" for "King Lear"?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.600
HENRY FAULKNER:
So that's-- yeah,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.016
if you're scoring this at home,
thumbs up for "Shakespeare

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.265
in Love," eh for "King Lear."

00:14:46.265 --> 00:14:48.169
CAITLIN MORRIS: It's impressive.

00:14:48.169 --> 00:14:49.960
HENRY FAULKNER: So is
it Three Day Hangover

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.140
who's also produced
"Drunkle Vanya," which

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.850
is a Chekhov adaptation?

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.552
DAVID HUDSON: Yes.

00:14:55.552 --> 00:14:57.510
HENRY FAULKNER: Do you
just start with the name

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.152
and then work backwards?

00:14:59.152 --> 00:15:01.110
DAVID HUDSON: That's the
way to do it, I think.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.315
That's Marketing
101 right there.

00:15:03.315 --> 00:15:05.226
HENRY FAULKNER: Is
someone writing this down?

00:15:05.226 --> 00:15:06.642
SCOTT GRIFFIN: I
think someone is.

00:15:06.642 --> 00:15:08.239
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah,
this is so freaky.

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:09.780
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Yeah, that's amazing.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.910
MIKE SAUSE: Everything's
being transcribed

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.371
in the moment-- laughter,
laughter in parentheses.

00:15:15.371 --> 00:15:15.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.744
CAITLIN MORRIS: Caitlin
Morris for President!

00:15:17.744 --> 00:15:18.949
HENRY FAULKNER: Right.

00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:20.490
You know, it'll be
freaky in a moment

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.870
when it starts anticipating.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.920
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.840
DAVID HUDSON: Yeah,
we did "Drunkle Vanya"

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.220
in off-Broadway this past
winter at the Russian Samovar

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.669
on 52nd and Eighth.

00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:32.460
But we've also done a
bunch of other shows.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.850
We did a boozy
version of "Dracula,"

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.520
where we changed the
famous vampire slayer Van

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.780
Helsing to Van Yuengling.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.770
CAITLIN MORRIS: Always had
a Yuengling, like, on the--

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.230
DAVID HUDSON: We did a
two-person version of the Henry

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.396
plays, where we kind of
mashed all of them together,

00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:52.470
that culminated in the audience
doing a massive 150 cup

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.440
game of beer pong,
just hurling beer pong

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.789
balls at the middle of the
room, which was very fun.

00:15:58.789 --> 00:16:01.330
And yeah, we've got some good
ideas coming down the pipeline.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.680
We're thinking Wasted
Williams, or something maybe

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.180
like that, a little Tennessee
Williams' "Streetcar" drunken.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.013
HENRY FAULKNER: Ooh.

00:16:07.013 --> 00:16:08.830
DAVID HUDSON: So
that's some good stuff.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.320
HENRY FAULKNER: OK.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.770
DAVID HUDSON: Yeah.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.030
HENRY FAULKNER: Fantastic.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.170
CAITLIN MORRIS: Did
someone say "Star Wars?"

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.804
Oh, Stella.

00:16:13.804 --> 00:16:14.970
DAVID HUDSON: Stella Artois.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.803
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Stella
for star, you know?

00:16:16.803 --> 00:16:18.375
There you go.

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:21.480
HENRY FAULKNER: And you
perform this-- how many times

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.730
a week are you doing this?

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.430
Because you're doing two shows--

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.920
SCOTT GRIFFIN: So yeah, we
currently do about seven

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.050
or eight shows a
week over the summer.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.547
And then over winter, in
between Christmas and New Year,

00:16:31.547 --> 00:16:33.630
if you have family in town,
come and see the show.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.270
We do about 15
shows in one week.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.800
MIKE SAUSE: We have a
two-show night on a Tuesday.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.300
HENRY FAULKNER: So all right.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.080
So let's break that
down for a minute.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.560
Because if there's
two shows a night--

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.370
so somebody gets hammered
in the first show.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.079
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah.

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:48.578
HENRY FAULKNER:
Does that actor then

00:16:48.578 --> 00:16:50.130
get more hammered
in the second show,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.170
or does the second show
just have more drunks?

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.211
WHIT LEVENBERGER: No, no.

00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.570
It's one person.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.604
The idea being that
it's better to have

00:16:57.604 --> 00:17:00.710
one very, very flat tire--

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.089
--than two flat tires.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.079
You might as well
just let the wheel

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.290
just hit the rim on the road,
let it spark at that point.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.540
It's just easier to deal with.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.956
SCOTT GRIFFIN: So really, did
we say in the beginning what

00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:17.490
the show is?

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.290
I'm just thinking, people.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.700
We have five actors.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.300
Four of them are sober,
and one of them is drunk.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.099
And we try and do a
Shakespearean play

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.609
in 90 minutes.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.020
That's the show.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.032
HENRY FAULKNER: That's
a perfect encapsulation.

00:17:31.032 --> 00:17:32.740
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Hence,
the flat tire joke.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.950
HENRY FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.634
So the second show is really
the one you want to be at.

00:17:36.634 --> 00:17:37.800
DAVID HUDSON: The 10:00 PM--

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.820
the second show, the late show--

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.240
is always a wild ride.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.140
There's a lot of crazy
stuff that happens.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.980
Because not only is the
actor double drinking,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.760
but it's usually like
a 10 o'clock show.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.945
So most of the audience has
pre-gamed and showed up,

00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:54.435
you know,
well-lubricated as well.

00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:55.635
So they're ready to party.

00:17:55.635 --> 00:17:57.426
HENRY FAULKNER: There's
just like plastic--

00:17:57.426 --> 00:17:59.430
sheets on the floor.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.090
Wow.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.300
All right.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.090
And at this point,
do you sort of have

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.780
a sense of the other actors?

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.830
Like, I kind of know how Mike
is when he's a little sauced?

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:12.830
It's actually your name.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:13.955
MIKE SAUSE: That's my name.

00:18:13.955 --> 00:18:15.330
Yeah.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.045
It's not a stage name, either.

00:18:18.045 --> 00:18:18.920
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.750
No, I feel like once you
do a couple performances,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.840
you kind of know what
kind of drunk they are.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.830
And sometimes that means,
like, batten down the hatches.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.514
Everyone's going to get weird.

00:18:29.514 --> 00:18:31.680
Sometimes it just means,
like, watch your ear drums.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.240
Because some people
are like screamy drunk.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.290
I am kind of a screamy drunk.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:34.956
MIKE SAUSE: Yes.

00:18:34.956 --> 00:18:36.840
DAVID HUDSON: Yes, you are.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.240
CAITLIN MORRIS: So, sorry
in advance for this mike

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.650
situation in the back.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.990
Good luck with levels.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.157
MIKE SAUSE: Doing a lot of--

00:18:43.157 --> 00:18:44.906
CAITLIN MORRIS: But
generally, everyone's,

00:18:44.906 --> 00:18:47.040
like, really fun and
just, like, down to clown.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.510
DAVID HUDSON: Yeah.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.930
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Does that mean sex?

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.846
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yes.

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:50.900
Yes, it does.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.650
CAITLIN MORRIS: I said
that the other day.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.356
HENRY FAULKNER: A very
specific kind, I think.

00:18:53.356 --> 00:18:54.120
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK, OK.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.190
WHIT LEVENBERGER: I
think, yeah, I think the--

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.030
HENRY FAULKNER:
Puffy shoes, and--

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.821
WHIT LEVENBERGER: The
thing about preparing

00:18:59.821 --> 00:19:02.650
for this show is that in
a normal stage production,

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.479
it's this kind of very rigid
world that you live in.

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:07.020
Because you have to
hit your marks so

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.978
the lights can get you.

00:19:07.978 --> 00:19:10.950
And you have to kind of do
this very intense choreography

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.440
on this stage to kind of
do the director's vision.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.410
But in our show,
the acceptable space

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.430
of what is allowed in our room
or in our show on a given night

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.380
is much, much broader.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.660
And so the real
preparation for the show

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.000
is just having a really
intense knowledge of the people

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.820
you work with, what they
will be and will not

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.045
be comfortable with doing.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.470
Who is the audience in the room?

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.000
What kind of jokes
will they like?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.620
What kind of jokes
will they not like?

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.550
Yeah, so it's more
about just kind

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.830
of having a feel for the
people you're working

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.349
with on any given night.

00:19:47.349 --> 00:19:48.807
HENRY FAULKNER: In
that vein, Lisa,

00:19:48.807 --> 00:19:50.060
do you ever have people
who just show up,

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.460
like, I had no idea this is
what I had signed up for?

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:52.850
LISA KLAGES: Yeah.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.590
I mean, we definitely
get people some of whom

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.930
have Shakespeare backgrounds,
some people are into improv,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.490
and some people just
read "The New York Times"

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.590
and heard about us in
"The New York Times."

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.140
So yeah, the audience
is very diverse.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.720
And we as a cast and an ensemble
talk throughout the show.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.970
Like, these jokes are landing.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:08.511
These aren't.

00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:09.230
Let's adjust.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.796
So it's an active
living process.

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:14.462
HENRY FAULKNER: All
right, live theater.

00:20:14.462 --> 00:20:15.920
Caitlin, how are you feeling?

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.620
CAITLIN MORRIS: I am just
ready to sit on a couple laps.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.935
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:21.935 --> 00:20:23.810
HENRY FAULKNER: I want
that to be a metaphor.

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.166
CAITLIN MORRIS: I'm
going to sit on--

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:29.760
I'm going to sit on
Shakespeare's lap.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.632
HENRY FAULKNER: Sit
on Shakespeare's lap?

00:20:30.632 --> 00:20:31.024
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:20:31.024 --> 00:20:31.810
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:32.596
CAITLIN MORRIS: [LAUGHS]

00:20:32.596 --> 00:20:34.280
HENRY FAULKNER: I think
his lap may be ready.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.606
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Yeah, I think it is.

00:20:35.606 --> 00:20:36.002
MIKE SAUSE: Let's do this.

00:20:36.002 --> 00:20:37.168
HENRY FAULKNER: Let's do it.

00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:38.135
MIKE SAUSE: All right.

00:20:38.135 --> 00:20:40.340
Well, Caitlin is
sufficiently inebriated.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.160
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh, really
quick, just add me on LinkedIn,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.440
please.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.330
MIKE SAUSE: Don't-- don't--

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.010
CAITLIN MORRIS:
No, it would help--

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.990
MIKE SAUSE: They
don't own LinkedIn.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.466
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Not the right room.

00:20:46.466 --> 00:20:47.936
CAITLIN MORRIS:
I'm a professional!

00:20:47.936 --> 00:20:49.580
It's going to help my situation.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.940
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Think
of other social networks.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.530
CAITLIN MORRIS: No,
I can't think of any.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.446
MIKE SAUSE: All right.

00:20:52.446 --> 00:20:55.010
Strap in, nerds.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.750
Hold onto your Chromebooks.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.010
Put on your Google Glass.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.140
And whatever you
do, for God's sake,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.172
do not reply-all to the
company diversity memo.

00:21:03.172 --> 00:21:06.720
We are the Drunk
Shakespeare Society.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.135
And please enjoy this 15
minutes' traffic of our stage.

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:11.510
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Three, two, one--

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.230
UNISON: Shakespeare!

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.605
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Two households,

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:14.630
both alike in dignity.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.960
MIKE SAUSE: In fair Verona,
where we lay our scene.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.126
CAITLIN MORRIS: Ancient br--

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:21.230
[RASPBERRY] From ancient
grudge break to new mutiny,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.840
where civil blood makes
civil hands dirty.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.110
WHIT LEVENBERGER: It's not.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.650
From forth the fatal
loins of these two foes--

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.570
MIKE SAUSE: A pair of
star-crossed lovers

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.380
take their life.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.088
CAITLIN MORRIS: Who
misadventured piteous

00:21:32.088 --> 00:21:34.585
overthrows do with their
death bury the hatchet.

00:21:34.585 --> 00:21:35.210
MIKE SAUSE: Oh.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.585
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:21:36.585 --> 00:21:38.330
So, start of the
play, Capulets verse

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.994
Montagues in a blood feud for
as long as anyone can remember.

00:21:40.994 --> 00:21:42.410
This is a major
rivalry, you guys.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.035
We're talking about, like, white
wine versus red wine drinkers.

00:21:45.035 --> 00:21:47.750
We're talking T Swift
fans v. T Swift haters.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.730
We're talking deplorables
and snowflakes,

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.470
you know what I'm saying?

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.490
So there are fights
breaking out in the streets,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.545
indiscriminate thumb biting,
hashtag shit's going down.

00:21:55.545 --> 00:21:57.170
So now we know what's
happening, right?

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.378
Now we're going to introduce
our players for tonight.

00:21:59.378 --> 00:22:01.660
Our title character,
Romeo Montague.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.660
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Ay me!

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.940
Sad hours seem long.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.231
CAITLIN MORRIS: That's so good.

00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:06.860
That's played by
Whit Levenberger.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.680
And much like Whit, Romeo
is like that misfit theater

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.165
kid with too many feelings.

00:22:11.165 --> 00:22:12.650
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah,
I'm a 30-year-old man

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.566
playing a 16-year-old.

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:14.750
What does that say about me?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.000
CAITLIN MORRIS: You're useful.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.570
No wrinkles.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.700
Juliet Capulet will
be played by moi.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.180
And much like me, Juliet
is super-popular and really

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.230
beautiful and knows the perfect
angle to take a good selfie,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.300
also maybe peaked
in middle school.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.255
So lastly, playing everyone
else is Mike Sause.

00:22:34.255 --> 00:22:34.963
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah.

00:22:34.963 --> 00:22:35.860
CAITLIN MORRIS: Super.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.030
So at the top of the play,
my parents, the Capulets,

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.975
are throwing this rager, right?

00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:41.600
And they're trying
to get a head count.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.820
But everyone's replying
interested to the Facebook

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.910
event, so they have no idea
what their numbers are.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.130
So they send out this
messenger, right,

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.320
to relay all the information
and invite people

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.370
and get a head count.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.350
But he works for Equifax.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:58.014
So he actually not only
shares the party information

00:22:58.014 --> 00:22:59.930
with literally everyone
he sees on the street,

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.870
he also shares home addresses,
social security numbers,

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.560
dates of birth.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.393
One of the people he
shares information with

00:23:05.393 --> 00:23:07.670
is Romeo, who would never
be invited because he's

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.750
their mortal enemy.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.190
But Romeo hears about the party.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.620
He hears that his former love,
Rosaline, is going to be there.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.911
Like I said, a lot of feelings.

00:23:13.911 --> 00:23:15.110
So prepare yourself.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.777
So he decides he has
to go check it out.

00:23:16.777 --> 00:23:17.943
So he shows up to the party.

00:23:17.943 --> 00:23:19.220
You guys remember this part.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.680
He and Juliet spot each
other through an aquarium.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.490
And the first
thing he notices is

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.870
Juliette's enormous and
perky set of angel wings.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.110
And so young and beautiful
Leonardo DiCaprio

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.510
launches into this
love ballad, right,

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.820
from the bow of a ship
while she's frantically--

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.490
he's forging checks.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.710
And then he crawls into
the carcass of a dead horse

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.566
to keep him warm in the winter.

00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:46.940
WHIT LEVENBERGER: You didn't
see "The Revenant," did you?

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.310
CAITLIN MORRIS: No.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.810
No.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.280
WHIT LEVENBERGER: That's clear.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:49.970
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Anyway, the point

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.860
is they fall in love
instantly, which sets,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.500
like, a super-unhealthy
standard for romance

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.910
for the rest of time.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.720
But they meet, right?

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.340
And they dance bachata,
and then they're separated.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:09.095
And then the next time we see
them is the scene de la scenes,

00:24:09.095 --> 00:24:10.220
the most famous scene ever.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:10.951
What is it?

00:24:10.951 --> 00:24:13.200
MIKE SAUSE: When Alan Rickman
falls off the Nakatomi--

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.020
CAITLIN MORRIS:
You're dead to me.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.480
WHIT LEVENBERGER: No.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:14.980
OK.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.580
It's Swayze, but
it's the second time

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.330
they're outside the roadhouse.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.920
And it's the fight.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.520
He doesn't want to kill the guy.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:18.790
CAITLIN MORRIS: No.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.290
No!

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.750
It is the balcony scene.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.985
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Oh,
that one's pretty good.

00:24:21.985 --> 00:24:23.140
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah,
OK, let's make a balcony.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:23.536
MIKE SAUSE: OK.

00:24:23.536 --> 00:24:24.630
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh, no.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.490
Ginger ale down.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.240
It's fine.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.920
MIKE SAUSE: Jesus Christ.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.290
CAITLIN MORRIS: It's fine.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.065
Hey, hey, hey.

00:24:28.065 --> 00:24:28.690
It's all right.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.190
Can we get a clean
up on aisle four?

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.020
Thank you.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.790
Romeo, Romeo!

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.650
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.960
Deny thy father and
refuse thy name.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.930
Or, if thou will not,
be but sworn my love.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.420
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.650
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.870
Thou art thyself,
though, not a Montague.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.340
What's Montague?

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.840
It is nor hand nor foot nor
arm nor face nor any other part

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.860
belonging to a man.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.805
Oh, be some other name!

00:24:58.805 --> 00:25:02.700
That which we call a Magnolia
Cupcake by any other name

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.960
would smell as sweet.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.710
So Romeo would, were
he not Romeo called,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.810
retain that dear
perfection which

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.070
he owes without that title.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.050
Romeo, doff thy name.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.470
And for thy name, which is no
part of thee, take all myself.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.240
WHIT LEVENBERGER: But soft,
what like through yonder window

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.990
breaks?

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.500
It is the east, and
Juliet is the sun.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.170
Arise, fair sun, and
kill the envious moon,

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.160
who is already sick
and pale with grief

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.050
that thou her maid art
far more fair than she.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.352
Oh, be not her maid,
for she is envious.

00:25:33.352 --> 00:25:34.810
CAITLIN MORRIS:
I'm so sorry, Whit?

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.080
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah?

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.560
Hi.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:35.960
CAITLIN MORRIS: Hi.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.260
You're doing so great.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.810
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Am I?

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:38.851
CAITLIN MORRIS: Um, yeah.

00:25:38.851 --> 00:25:40.300
But I just-- I was
thinking you're

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.260
a teenager, right, in this play.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.080
And what we know about
teenagers in love

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.760
is that they're
always, like, searching

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.800
for the version of themself
that the other person is

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.850
going to be into, right?

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.030
They're like, I'm malleable.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.210
Which kind of me do you like?

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:51.490
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Right.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.114
CAITLIN MORRIS: And
so I think that you

00:25:53.114 --> 00:25:56.560
should do this monologue as
a variety of options for me.

00:25:59.908 --> 00:26:00.540
I'm going to--

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:00.890
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Great.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:01.305
Perfect.

00:26:01.305 --> 00:26:02.690
CAITLIN MORRIS: I'm going
to suggest some as we go.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:04.720
Let's start, in honor
of my favorite show,

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.180
"Outlander," start
as a Scotsman.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.900
I'm going to imagine
you in a kilt.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.550
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Three, two, one--

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.030
UNISON: Shakespeare.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.460
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
[USING SCOTTISH ACCENT]

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.700
Her vestal livery is but sick
and green and none but fools

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.310
still wear it; cast it off.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.090
Ew!

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.564
It is my lady, ew!

00:26:22.564 --> 00:26:24.170
It is my love!

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.359
Ew, that she knew she were.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:27.150
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.130
I can't understand a
word that you're saying.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.380
WHIT LEVENBERGER: That's fine.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.160
That's fine.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.420
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.130
How about instead of
that, like, give me

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.710
like a "Downton Abbey," kind
of, like, stuffy British guy.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.980
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Great, great.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.380
She speaks-- oh, yes--

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.404
she says nothing, what of that?

00:26:43.404 --> 00:26:44.195
CAITLIN MORRIS: Um.

00:26:44.195 --> 00:26:45.854
Who's passing a stone.

00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:48.578
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:48.578 --> 00:26:52.860
WHIT LEVENBERGER: (DRAWN OUT)
'Tis not to me she speaks,

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.413
but to-- to-- to--

00:26:56.413 --> 00:26:59.870
of the fair, oh, ooh--

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.136
the caliber of this bullet, it's
too great for the rifle I bear!

00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:05.354
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:05.354 --> 00:27:06.929
Halcyon!

00:27:06.929 --> 00:27:08.470
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK,
wait, wait, wait.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:11.502
I've decided that actually I'm
a little bit more home grown.

00:27:11.502 --> 00:27:12.710
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah, sure.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.335
CAITLIN MORRIS: Can
you give this to me

00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:17.130
like a Brooklynite who is, like,
really mad about his Con Edison

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.200
bill?

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.355
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:22.730
She speaks, yet
she says nothing.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.910
What of that?

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.242
Oh, her eye discourses.

00:27:25.242 --> 00:27:25.950
I will answer it.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.680
Oh, nay.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.361
'Tis not to me she speaks.

00:27:28.361 --> 00:27:28.860
No!

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.540
What she does is,
she comes by, she

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.855
estimates the amount of fucking
money she wants to charge.

00:27:33.855 --> 00:27:34.800
Think about it.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.790
Wake up, America!

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.110
You're paying for
a goddamn dream.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.437
What is an estimated value?

00:27:41.437 --> 00:27:43.270
Can someone tell me
what a kilowatt hour is?

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.090
I feel like this
is the right room.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:45.930
I feel like-- I've
gotta get an--

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:46.230
OK.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.430
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK, I
just got a brilliant one.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.760
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
That's too much.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.220
MIKE SAUSE: Too much.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.345
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Too much.

00:27:49.345 --> 00:27:51.660
CAITLIN MORRIS: How about
let's finish this off as--

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.110
ooh, like a Southern voyeur--

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.510
WHIT LEVENBERGER: OK.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.610
CAITLIN MORRIS: --who does
all of his business out

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.210
of the back of his Lincoln.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.300
And his only client is--

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:04.990
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Ryan Phillippe.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.940
Yeah, I got the reference.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.440
I got it.

00:28:08.515 --> 00:28:10.140
[MIMICS MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY]
All right.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.640
All right.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.220
All right.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:18.230
See how she leans her
cheek upon her hand thus?

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.950
Uh-- that I were a
glove upon that hand

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.760
that I might touch that cheek.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.275
You all want to buy a Lincoln?

00:28:28.275 --> 00:28:30.135
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Whit Levenberger!

00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:31.065
Thank you.

00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:33.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.110
OK.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.920
So blah, blah, blah, love
and shit, he was a boy.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.790
She was a girl.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.350
Could I make it anymore obvious?

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:41.370
No, no, really.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:41.870
No.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:42.730
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Children.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.070
Children.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.130
CAITLIN MORRIS: They're
actually children.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.900
They're like 14 years old.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.550
But they're convinced that
they're in love with each other

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.925
and that their
feelings are real.

00:28:48.925 --> 00:28:50.370
We all remember that.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.350
And so the second
time they hang out,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.950
they decide they should
get married, which sounds

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.660
like a 14th century TLC show.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.520
So they get secret married.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.014
And Juliet-- guys,
Juliet is ready

00:29:04.014 --> 00:29:06.430
for that 2-step verification,
if you know what I'm saying.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:12.565
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:12.565 --> 00:29:14.850
But the nurse keeps coming
in to interrupt them,

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:19.539
so they can't, you know,
consummate the marriage.

00:29:19.539 --> 00:29:20.580
So that's where we're at.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.746
And in the street, at the
same time that all of this

00:29:22.746 --> 00:29:24.300
is happening, this
fight breaks out

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.740
with Juliet's cousin Tybalt.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.943
Now, Tybalt is like the short
guy on the wrestling team who's

00:29:29.943 --> 00:29:34.500
way too aggressive, or like
this unfathomably incompetent

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.150
businessman with
little baby hands

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.972
who accidentally tripped
into the Oval Office.

00:29:38.972 --> 00:29:40.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.940
Do you want to give us that?

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.020
Thank you so much.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.030
Good.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.634
I'm just going to clean up.

00:29:45.634 --> 00:29:47.425
MIKE SAUSE: (IMITATING
DONALD TRUMP) Romeo.

00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:48.383
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Wait.

00:29:51.796 --> 00:29:52.770
MIKE SAUSE: Romeo.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.299
Romeo?

00:29:56.299 --> 00:29:57.840
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
How did you see me?

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.400
I was in incognito mode.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.170
Whatever.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.795
I can only make that
joke in this room.

00:30:02.795 --> 00:30:04.020
I had to try.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.050
MIKE SAUSE: The hate I bear
thee can afford no better

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.570
term than this.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.130
Thou art a villain.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:14.590
You're a crooked liar, sad.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.380
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Tybalt, the love

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.290
I bear thee doth much
excuse the appertaining rage

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:20.620
to such a greeting.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.100
Crooked-- you still
with me here, bud?

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.580
MIKE SAUSE: I'm like one of
those birds that dips in water,

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.690
and bounces backward.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.490
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Crooked liar am I none.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.510
Therefore, farewell.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.630
I see thou knowst me not.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.360
MIKE SAUSE: Boy?

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.500
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Don't assume my gender.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.681
MIKE SAUSE: Boy?

00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:43.530
This shall not excuse the
injuries thou hast done me.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.850
Therefore, turn and draw.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.080
I'm going to make your
insides great again.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.500
WHIT LEVENBERGER: I do protest.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.540
I never injured
thee but love thee,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.790
better than thou canst
devise till thou shalt know

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.560
the reason for my love.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.840
And so, good Capulet, whose name
I tender as dearly as mine own,

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.305
be satisfied.

00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:03.430
CAITLIN MORRIS: Cool, cool.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.970
So this would be where
Mercutio jumps in.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.250
And Mercutio is
Romeo's ride-or-die.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.494
He is, like, going
to sacrifice himself

00:31:11.494 --> 00:31:12.660
in honor of his best friend.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.820
He is like Fred Weasley or
the blind guy in "Rogue One."

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.440
But it turns out our
Mercutio actually isn't here.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.849
Yeah, she used Apple Maps to
try to find this location.

00:31:26.849 --> 00:31:27.765
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Ooh.

00:31:27.765 --> 00:31:28.640
CAITLIN MORRIS: Burn!

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.300
So she's in Cupertino.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.690
So she didn't make it.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.320
But we do need a Mercutio.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.102
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
And I got that.

00:31:37.102 --> 00:31:37.430
You find the person.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.430
CAITLIN MORRIS: Actually,
I feel like you,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.680
sir, you with the blue.

you're saying because
your syntax is so weird.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.760
So anyway, moral of the story
is that, like, Romeo has

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.700
been banish-shed from the area.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.250
And he's super bummed about it.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.125
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
[YELLING] Banish-shed equal

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:21.760
than or greater than
death, hashtag angry,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.140
hashtag all caps,
hashtag pray for Houston.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:29.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:29.365 --> 00:37:30.820
CAITLIN MORRIS: Mm, super.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.320
MIKE SAUSE: That
went over great.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:32.950
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Just for you.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:33.880
CAITLIN MORRIS:
So Romeo finds out

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.950
that he's about
to be exiled, too.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.670
He's, like, before
I go, before I go,

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.580
I should see Juliet
one last time.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.070
So he sneaks into
Juliet's bedroom window

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.711
so they can catch the
last train to Bone Town.

00:37:44.711 --> 00:37:47.120
[MUSIC - MARVIN GAYE, "LET'S GET
 IT ON"]

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.400
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Ooh, yeah.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.316
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh, show
me that dongle, baby.

00:37:50.316 --> 00:37:51.797
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Ooh.

00:37:51.797 --> 00:37:54.380
Let's suspend the disbelief and
forget that we're 14 years old

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.922
and all we know about this was
taught to us by a gym teacher.

00:37:56.922 --> 00:37:57.796
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah!

00:37:57.796 --> 00:37:58.310
Bring it.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.490
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
You ready for this?

00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.920
Here we go.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.840
UNISON: Simulated sex!

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.330
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Sex!

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:00.820
UNISON: Sex!

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.310
Sex!

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.752
WHIT LEVENBERGER: And--

00:38:01.752 --> 00:38:02.194
CAITLIN MORRIS: Sex!

00:38:02.194 --> 00:38:02.693
Sex!

00:38:02.693 --> 00:38:03.520
Wait, is that it?

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.145
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Ooh, yeah, that's it.

00:38:05.145 --> 00:38:08.428
[LAUGHTER] Woo!

00:38:08.428 --> 00:38:10.570
CAITLIN MORRIS: Man, it
really is so much worse

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.070
than I thought it
was going to be.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.370
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
That's life, baby.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.870
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.640
So needless to say,
they do the deed.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.110
Juliette's parents
are downstairs.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:21.460
They have no idea that Romeo is
currently mining her back end

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.300
for dirty data.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:25.895 --> 00:38:28.420
But because they have no
idea about the relationship,

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.630
they've already betrothed
her to someone else,

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.490
to one of Lord Capulet's
golf buddies, Paris.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:35.110
And Paris is like--

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.020
Paris is like the Verona
equivalent of Paul Ryan, right?

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.680
Like he's handsome enough,
he's got a nice set of abs,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.940
but he has no spine.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.434
MIKE SAUSE: [LAUGHS] Oh!

00:38:44.434 --> 00:38:46.350
CAITLIN MORRIS: Juliet
is not about that life.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.212
She's, like, I just spent the
best 14 seconds of my life--

00:38:50.212 --> 00:38:51.670
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
I'm 14 years old.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.400
Leave me alone.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.610
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK,
well, a second per year.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.510
And she doesn't want
to get into that.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.810
So she goes to the Friar, right?

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.020
Now, the Friar is the
lovers' mutual drug dealer--

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.570
think, like, Jesse Pinkman
from "Breaking Bad"--

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:10.249
and he's always providing Romeo
with grass, Juliet with oxy.

00:39:10.249 --> 00:39:11.790
He's just generally
way too involved.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:12.480
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Very dark.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.438
CAITLIN MORRIS: I know.

00:39:13.438 --> 00:39:15.445
It is-- it's a tragedy!

00:39:15.445 --> 00:39:16.070
So he comes in.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.195
He's like, I've got a plan.

00:39:17.195 --> 00:39:17.810
Hit it!

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.004
MIKE SAUSE: Yo!

00:39:19.004 --> 00:39:19.920
WHIT LEVENBERGER: God.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.410
MIKE SAUSE: Listen, Juliet,
I got a perfect plan.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.440
You're going to take
a potion, bitch.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.250
And then, it's going
to be like you're dead.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.640
But you're actually asleep.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.720
Science, bitch!

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.089
CAITLIN MORRIS: First of all,
I am offended by the B word.

00:39:37.089 --> 00:39:39.130
Second of all, with a plan
like that, she's like,

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.020
what could possibly go wrong?

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.490
Turns out "everything"
is the answer.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:47.150
Because Romeo does not get
the DM about the potion plan.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.530
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Oh, I should
have trusted all of my data

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.380
with just Google Drive.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.540
Fuck Microsoft Office
Suite, am I right?

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.300
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah,
that's what did it.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.477
So he doesn't know that
she's just sleeping and not

00:40:00.477 --> 00:40:01.060
actually dead.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.370
He shows up to the tomb,
thinks she's really dead.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:04.420
Freaks out.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.710
Kills Paul Ryan.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.820
And then he stands
over her lifeless body.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.820
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Right.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:09.805
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Let's make a tomb.

00:40:09.805 --> 00:40:10.575
WHIT LEVENBERGER: A tomb.

00:40:10.575 --> 00:40:11.380
MIKE SAUSE: Why are you--

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.080
CAITLIN MORRIS: I'm
going to do it this way.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.090
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah,
that would make sense.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.006
CAITLIN MORRIS: Great.

00:40:14.006 --> 00:40:14.890
Great.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.750
I'm just going to
get in my tomb pose.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:17.470
Hold on a second.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.450
I have to look pretty
while I'm dead.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.875
Also, I have Spanx
on, don't worry.

00:40:21.875 --> 00:40:22.720
OK, thank you.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.090
MIKE SAUSE: You good?

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.423
CAITLIN MORRIS: Thank you, yeah.

00:40:24.423 --> 00:40:26.410
I'm sleeping.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:29.860
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Oh, my love!

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.800
My wife, death that hath
sucked the honey of thy lips

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.170
have had no power
yet o'er thy beauty.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:38.270
Thou art not conquered.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.120
Here will I remain.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.080
Here, in this gawdy auditorium
with more collective wealth

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.370
than the country of Liberia.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:50.030
Here, with worms that
are your chambermaids.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.090
Here will I set up
my everlasting rest

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.710
and shake the yoke
of inauspicious

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.350
stars from this
world-wearied flesh.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.769
Eyes, look your last.

00:40:59.769 --> 00:41:00.810
CAITLIN MORRIS: [GIGGLES]

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.420
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Nice.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.370
I'm 14, be cool.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:05.420
Arms!

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.560
Take your last embrace.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.180
And lips, oh you, the doors of
breath, seal with a righteous

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.769
kiss a dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

00:41:13.769 --> 00:41:15.060
CAITLIN MORRIS: [KISSING SOUND]

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.160
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Oh, that
must be the rigor mortis

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:16.930
pucker setting in.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:17.560
That's good.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.170
That's good.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.020
And mwah!

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.060
OK, here's to my--

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.952
I didn't-- I did not bring
a potion with me for this.

00:41:23.952 --> 00:41:24.910
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh, no!

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.395
You don't have a potion?

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680
I like drinking buddies.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.228
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Green apple, thanks.

00:41:34.228 --> 00:41:35.209
Here's to my love.

00:41:35.209 --> 00:41:36.750
CAITLIN MORRIS: Give
it a chug, yeah.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.220
UNISON: Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.220
MIKE SAUSE: Chug, chug--

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:40.700
CAITLIN MORRIS:
You've been iced.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.840
MIKE SAUSE: Chug, chug, chug.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.250
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah,
pink in the face.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.458
MIKE SAUSE: Chug, chug, chug.

00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:45.480
Yeah!

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.030
CAITLIN MORRIS: Wow, what a man.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.803
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:47.803 --> 00:41:48.886
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Oh, god!

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.466
Oh, true apothecary!

00:41:54.466 --> 00:41:58.330
Thy drugs are-- very sugary.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:01.317
Thus, with a kiss,
oh, I need that.

00:42:01.317 --> 00:42:02.400
MIKE SAUSE: You need that.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.400
WHIT LEVENBERGER: I die.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.986
Oh!

00:42:04.986 --> 00:42:07.770
CAITLIN MORRIS: [GASPS]

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.190
What's this?

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.153
A cup?

00:42:10.153 --> 00:42:10.940
Thank you.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.300
Closed in my true love's hand?

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.620
Poison, I see, hath
been his timeless end.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:19.160
O churl, drunk all and
left no friendly drop

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.364
to help me after--

00:42:20.364 --> 00:42:21.530
can I just get up for a sec?

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.130
WHIT LEVENBERGER: I'm dead.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.110
CAITLIN MORRIS: I'm
just-- but my legs--

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:23.910
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
I'm a method actor!

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:24.330
Fine.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.205
CAITLIN MORRIS: Both
legs are going to sleep.

00:42:26.205 --> 00:42:27.140
Thank you.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.780
I will kiss thy lips.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.700
Happily some poison
yet doth hang on them

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.190
to make die with a restorative.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.030
MIKE SAUSE: Oh, god.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:36.733
Oh, no!

00:42:36.733 --> 00:42:38.316
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Really worth it, guys.

00:42:38.316 --> 00:42:39.230
Wow.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.876
Thy lips taste of green apple.

00:42:41.876 --> 00:42:43.250
Yea, noise?

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.232
Then I'll be quick.

00:42:44.232 --> 00:42:45.690
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Yep, right there.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:49.764
CAITLIN MORRIS: O happy
dagger, this is my sheath.

00:42:49.764 --> 00:42:55.061
Thus, there rust,
and let me die.

00:42:55.061 --> 00:42:55.560
Ah!

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.750
Come, tears
confound, out, sword,

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:03.987
and wound the pap of Pyramus.

00:43:03.987 --> 00:43:06.362
WHIT LEVENBERGER: This is not
"Romeo and Juliet" anymore.

00:43:06.362 --> 00:43:11.052
CAITLIN MORRIS: Ay, that left
Pap, where the heart doth hop.

00:43:11.052 --> 00:43:11.904
Thus die.

00:43:11.904 --> 00:43:12.820
Can I sit on your lap?

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.569
Thank you so much.

00:43:13.569 --> 00:43:16.572
Die, die, die, die, die, eh!

00:43:16.572 --> 00:43:18.280
It's so much more
comfy to die like this.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.000
So good.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.650
MIKE SAUSE: A glooming peace
this morning with it bring.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:22.925
CAITLIN MORRIS: Now am I dead.

00:43:22.925 --> 00:43:23.350
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Oh, damn it.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:23.680
Damn it.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.929
CAITLIN MORRIS: Now am I fled.

00:43:24.929 --> 00:43:27.164
My soul is in the sky.

00:43:27.164 --> 00:43:29.040
Tongue, lose thy light.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.290
Moon, take thy flight.

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.710
Get out of here, moon.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.010
Thus die I. I'm going
to die on you again.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.974
MIKE SAUSE: The
sun, for sorrow--

00:43:35.974 --> 00:43:37.640
CAITLIN MORRIS: OK,
now I'm really dead.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.377
MIKE SAUSE: --and all--

00:43:39.377 --> 00:43:40.960
CAITLIN MORRIS: Is
this comfy for you?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.200
MIKE SAUSE: Are you dead yet?

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.491
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah, I'm dead.

00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:44.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.070
MIKE SAUSE: For never was
a story of more woe, than

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.270
this of Juliet--

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:50.641
CAITLIN MORRIS: What's up?

00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:53.170
MIKE SAUSE: --and her Romeo.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:54.476
There, we did it!

00:43:54.476 --> 00:43:55.714
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Hey!

00:43:55.714 --> 00:43:56.630
CAITLIN MORRIS: Buddy!

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:57.287
Nice to meet you.

00:43:57.287 --> 00:43:57.714
You smell amazing!

00:43:57.714 --> 00:43:59.963
MIKE SAUSE: The fastest,
drunkest Shakespeare's "Romeo

00:43:59.963 --> 00:44:01.250
and Juliet."

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.590
Now we're going to have a
quick Q&amp;A here in a second.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.580
But make sure you go to
online DrunkShakespeare.com.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.980
Also, check us out at our
hidden library at 43rd

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.120
and 8th for a show.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.380
And please check us out on
social media @DrunkShakes.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.190
And let's bring up
Henry and the gang.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:16.648
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Henry and the gang!

00:44:16.648 --> 00:44:18.112
MIKE SAUSE: Henry and the gang!

00:44:18.112 --> 00:44:19.086
CAITLIN MORRIS: Cuckoo!

00:44:19.086 --> 00:44:19.580
WHIT LEVENBERGER: I'm going to--

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.560
HENRY FAULKNER: One more time
for our cast, Mike, Caitlin

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.059
and Whit.

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:24.137
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:24.137 --> 00:44:25.220
MIKE SAUSE: And the Sause.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.678
HENRY FAULKNER:
Not only incredibly

00:44:26.678 --> 00:44:28.160
entertaining and informative--

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:28.890
CAITLIN MORRIS: Where do I sit?

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:31.431
HENRY FAULKNER: --but probably
one of the greatest challenges

00:44:31.431 --> 00:44:33.020
our transcriber has
ever encountered.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:33.967
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:33.967 --> 00:44:35.050
CAITLIN MORRIS: Nailed it.

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:35.770
Nailed it.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.515
HENRY FAULKNER: My
favorite was just

00:44:36.515 --> 00:44:38.660
the parentheses, the part
where they just gave up,

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.890
"speaks foreign language."

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:43.214
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:45.880
WHIT LEVENBERGER: America has no
official language, just saying.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.363
LISA KLAGES: That's true.

00:44:46.363 --> 00:44:47.446
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:48.900
Do we have questions?

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.135
Oh, so many questions.

00:44:52.135 --> 00:44:53.010
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.051
Thank you for coming out.

00:44:54.051 --> 00:44:55.160
This was wonderful.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.380
How do you decide which
show you what to do

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.952
each night, for each show?

00:44:59.952 --> 00:45:01.160
SCOTT GRIFFIN: It's a secret.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.800
So we don't actually
say what the show

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.600
is until after the first
four shots of whisky.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.600
AUDIENCE: To each other?

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.120
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Oh no.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.120
We know what's going on.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.142
MIKE SAUSE: We know.

00:45:11.142 --> 00:45:12.725
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh,
I like your shirt.

00:45:12.725 --> 00:45:13.967
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:15.050
MIKE SAUSE: Just in case--

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:19.040
just in case you ever forget
where you're at, you know.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.087
AUDIENCE: Kind of a
thing we wear here.

00:45:22.087 --> 00:45:24.420
HENRY FAULKNER: No one here
pays for their own clothing.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.543
CAITLIN MORRIS: This
is a caramel brownie.

00:45:27.543 --> 00:45:30.010
HENRY FAULKNER: Other questions?

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:32.642
CAITLIN MORRIS: You
guys have great snacks.

00:45:32.642 --> 00:45:34.600
HENRY FAULKNER: Those
are the hazelnut meringue

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.184
from La Place?

00:45:35.184 --> 00:45:36.183
CAITLIN MORRIS: So good.

00:45:36.183 --> 00:45:37.010
They're so good.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:38.876
HENRY FAULKNER: They're
on fleek, as the kids say.

00:45:38.876 --> 00:45:40.050
CAITLIN MORRIS:
They're fleek, yeah.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.091
HENRY FAULKNER: They are.

00:45:41.091 --> 00:45:45.115
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:45.115 --> 00:45:48.712
Now, this has got to be,
like, this is probably

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:50.170
what you guys enjoy
every night, is

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:51.630
that you've done
this whole thing

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:52.838
and you have this adrenaline.

00:45:52.838 --> 00:45:56.786
And you have a drunk friend
who's just hanging out.

00:45:56.786 --> 00:45:57.660
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.380
What's up, Columbia?

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.672
HENRY FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:46:01.672 --> 00:46:03.380
AUDIENCE: Do you guys
have after parties?

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.470
And if so, what do you
do with the flat tire?

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.975
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:09.975 --> 00:46:12.350
CAITLIN MORRIS: Listen, I'm
the transmission of that car.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.402 --> 00:46:16.860
I don't know anything about
cars, but that seems important.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.280
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
That's cool, yeah.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.560
We don't really have--

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.780
we do cast outings, which,
much like an event like this,

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.780
is about bringing everybody
together, or sharing

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.180
a different experience than
what we do on a day to day.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.370
A cast party is
usually, like, after you

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.530
wrap, after you end the show.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:37.280
And our little
independent-show-thatcould

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.110
just keeps rambling onward.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:42.069
We do go out after the show.

00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.610
We went out--

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.460
MIKE SAUSE: We went
out last night.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.790
It started out as
fun drinks, and then

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:49.269
as my Bengals started
to suck and suck more,

00:46:49.269 --> 00:46:50.310
it was sad drinks for me.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.370
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Sad drinking,
a lot of sad drinking.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:52.550
A lot of yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.970
CAITLIN MORRIS: I'm so sorry.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.500
LISA KLAGES: Also, the
flat tire gets a car home

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.499
at the end of the night.

00:46:55.499 --> 00:46:56.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:56.435 --> 00:46:58.393
MIKE SAUSE: It's all
about that Uber, you know.

00:47:02.457 --> 00:47:04.540
HENRY FAULKNER: And parents,
please, don't be shy.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.952
You're also welcome to the mic.

00:47:05.952 --> 00:47:07.660
CAITLIN MORRIS: Parents
are so important.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.460
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Let's
just answer the first one.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.418
I'll answer the first
question from the parents

00:47:11.418 --> 00:47:13.492
who are at the back--
huge disappointments.

00:47:13.492 --> 00:47:14.194
Huge.

00:47:14.194 --> 00:47:15.130
MIKE SAUSE: To our families.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:16.181
WHIT LEVENBERGER: No problem.

00:47:16.181 --> 00:47:17.143
CAITLIN MORRIS: Do
you have a question?

00:47:17.143 --> 00:47:18.105
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

00:47:18.105 --> 00:47:18.896
CAITLIN MORRIS: Hi.

00:47:18.896 --> 00:47:20.080
AUDIENCE: Awesome show--

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.205
I wonder if you guys have
ever heard of Shakespeare

00:47:22.205 --> 00:47:23.394
Improv from Chicago.

00:47:23.394 --> 00:47:24.310
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yes.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:24.970
Oh, my god.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:25.270
They're good.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:26.603
AUDIENCE: It's my favorite show.

00:47:26.603 --> 00:47:27.916
And you guys are now up there.

00:47:27.916 --> 00:47:29.284
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:29.284 --> 00:47:30.200
HENRY FAULKNER: Wow.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:30.690
MIKE SAUSE: Oh.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:31.130
CAITLIN MORRIS: Drunk seconds.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:32.080
AUDIENCE: But I'm kidding.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.622
MIKE SAUSE: The
treasured "up there."

00:47:33.622 --> 00:47:34.788
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Take that.

00:47:34.788 --> 00:47:35.288
Whoo!

00:47:35.288 --> 00:47:35.996
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:47:35.996 --> 00:47:36.910
You guys are amazing.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.887
Do you guys ever want to do
a collaboration or anything?

00:47:39.887 --> 00:47:40.720
MIKE SAUSE: I would.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.180
I mean, because I'm
an improviser, that's

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.150
my main background, I saw them
in Chicago two months ago.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.964
And I was just blown
away that anyone

00:47:48.964 --> 00:47:50.380
would have an hour
and a half show

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.720
with an intermission for improv.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:57.220
And it was, by far, one
of the top improv things

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.010
I've ever seen.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:59.710
I mean, I would die to
do something with them.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.720
AUDIENCE: If you guys could make
that happen, that would be--

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.000
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah?

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.490
CAITLIN MORRIS: We're on it.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:03.290
We're on it.

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.940
Do you know any people?

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.720
HENRY FAULKNER: So are we
officially challenging--

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.390
MIKE SAUSE: Producer?

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.150
CAITLIN MORRIS: Make
it happen, Scott.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.890
MIKE SAUSE: He's the one
that's gonna make it happen.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.330
HENRY FAULKNER: A
Shakespeare off.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.260
Or a Shakes off.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.160
WHIT LEVENBERGER: A shakes off?

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.940
HENRY FAULKNER: Shake it off.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.190
MIKE SAUSE: That sounds dirty.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.151
HENRY FAULKNER: Oh.

00:48:16.151 --> 00:48:18.400
This is where we're drawing
the line on the show, now?

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.775
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:19.775 --> 00:48:21.276
We don't make dirty jokes here.

00:48:21.276 --> 00:48:22.310
Come on.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.305
What's up, Vinnie?

00:48:24.305 --> 00:48:25.680
MIKE SAUSE: Do
you know his name?

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.644
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Yeah, we're friends.

00:48:26.644 --> 00:48:27.460
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Jesus.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.290
CAITLIN MORRIS: I died on him.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:29.289
I have to know his name.

00:48:29.289 --> 00:48:31.840
Come on.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.764
HENRY FAULKNER: Oh.

00:48:33.764 --> 00:48:35.620
And this is great,
now that we have--

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.860
you guys are going to
live forever on YouTube.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:38.761
Oh, no!

00:48:38.761 --> 00:48:40.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.050
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Well,
it will definitely

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:44.120
be the first time any
portion of our show

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.880
has appeared on YouTube.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.664
CAITLIN MORRIS: My
grandma is so proud.

00:48:49.664 --> 00:48:51.330
HENRY FAULKNER: Which
begs the question,

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.329
how often do your parents
come and see the show?

00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:55.370
And if you know
you've got parents,

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.290
do you want to especially
be drunk or not

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.485
be drunk that night?

00:48:58.485 --> 00:49:00.982
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah, my
parents have come a lot.

00:49:00.982 --> 00:49:01.940
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.150
CAITLIN MORRIS: I think maybe
they're just checking in on me.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.590
But they come-- oh, my god.

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:07.550
It's the same guy.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.450
HENRY FAULKNER: We
actually all look the same.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:12.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:13.610
CAITLIN MORRIS: Google shirt!

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.410
Google shirt!

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.260
MIKE SAUSE: Freaking
me out, man.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.093
AUDIENCE: I have a twin
who also works here.

00:49:17.093 --> 00:49:18.380
I'm not the same guy.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:19.370
CAITLIN MORRIS: You're
wearing the same shirt.

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:20.640
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about the impersonations.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.240
Do you guys give each other the
set-ups to do characters that

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.300
you know each other can nail
every time, or are you really,

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:26.870
like--

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:30.320
HENRY FAULKNER: And can you
answer that question in voices?

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.400
MIKE SAUSE: Like?

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.140
What voices do you want?

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.098
WHIT LEVENBERGER: I mean,
it kind of works out,

00:49:35.098 --> 00:49:37.220
like, we try a bunch of stuff.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.700
And some stuff works,
and some stuff doesn't.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.780
And so the next time--

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.820
HENRY FAULKNER: That
happens here, too.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.190
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yeah.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.780
And the next time
we do it, we will

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.280
keep most of the
ones that worked

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.630
and then try new ones for
the ones that didn't work.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.463
And then, over time,
you just kind of learn.

00:49:50.463 --> 00:49:53.540
We always want to
keep a few wild cards,

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.882
just to keep exploring
and keep finding

00:49:55.882 --> 00:49:56.965
new material for the show.

00:49:56.965 --> 00:49:57.240
MIKE SAUSE: (AS
GEORGE W. BUSH) Yeah.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.240
Sometimes you gotta just
throw spaghetti at a wall.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.406
WHIT LEVENBERGER: All right.

00:50:00.406 --> 00:50:03.575
MIKE SAUSE: And whatever
sticks, that's what you keep.

00:50:03.575 --> 00:50:05.602
That's my life philosophy.

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:06.810
CAITLIN MORRIS: Thank you, W.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.361
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Thank you, W.

00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:09.860
CAITLIN MORRIS: We
also had one show

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.277
where someone made all of us
do Michael Caine impressions.

00:50:12.277 --> 00:50:13.484
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Oh, my god.

00:50:13.484 --> 00:50:15.196
CAITLIN MORRIS: And
that was really bad.

00:50:15.196 --> 00:50:17.810
WHIT LEVENBERGER: That was
really, really spectacularly--

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:19.851
CAITLIN MORRIS: All I
could say was Master Bruce.

00:50:19.851 --> 00:50:21.560
Master Bruce.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.370
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
You sound like--

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.240
CAITLIN MORRIS:
Oh, Master Bruce.

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:25.985
She was only 16.

00:50:25.985 --> 00:50:28.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.800
MIKE SAUSE: She was only 16.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.840
WHIT LEVENBERGER: She was
only 16, Master Wayne.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.660
CAITLIN MORRIS: Yeah,
we sort of made a rule

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.380
that that bit was
never allowed again.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.255
MIKE SAUSE: Oh, yeah.

00:50:35.255 --> 00:50:37.010
That bit was banned.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.910
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Forever
in our hearts, mate.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.930
HENRY FAULKNER: If you could
keep one thing for posterity,

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:39.680
that was it.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.390
MIKE SAUSE: Oh.

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:41.110
CAITLIN MORRIS: Hi.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:41.650
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Hi.

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:42.140
AUDIENCE: How are you doing?

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:42.680
CAITLIN MORRIS: Great.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.430
WHIT LEVENBERGER: So good.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:44.105
So good.

00:50:44.105 --> 00:50:46.760
AUDIENCE: OK, so have you ever
done a show with two people

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.468
drunk?

00:50:47.468 --> 00:50:48.517
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:48.517 --> 00:50:49.808
CAITLIN MORRIS: Not on purpose.

00:50:49.808 --> 00:50:53.090
MIKE SAUSE: Officially?

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.024
CAITLIN MORRIS: Not officially.

00:50:55.024 --> 00:50:56.690
DAVID HUDSON: There
certainly, early on,

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.700
were several shows where
the entire cast started

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.950
drinking midway
through the show, which

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.700
turned into crazy,
crazy nights of chaos.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.980
We try to do a good
job now of limiting it.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.287
Because there is
drinking-- they are already

00:51:09.287 --> 00:51:10.370
drinking enough each week.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.310
So we try to make sure that--
and we want to keep that single

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.700
flat tire and not the whole car
just slow rolling down the--

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.033
WHIT LEVENBERGER: On fire on
the side of the road, yeah.

00:51:19.033 --> 00:51:21.248
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:21.248 --> 00:51:22.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:22.720
MIKE SAUSE: Thank you.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.261
HENRY FAULKNER: Have
you ever thought

00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:26.600
about a matinee of just,
like, hungover Shakespeare?

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.170
MIKE SAUSE: Oh, baby.

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:28.170
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh, man.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.580
That would be brutal.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.455
That would be--

00:51:30.455 --> 00:51:32.150
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Just
coffee for everyone.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:33.530
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Just so angry.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.800
CAITLIN MORRIS: And lots
of bagels and fried eggs.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.258
WHIT LEVENBERGER: We could do
"Titus" that way, just scream

00:51:38.258 --> 00:51:39.401
the whole way through.

00:51:39.401 --> 00:51:41.900
SCOTT GRIFFIN: So we're actually
about to launch a new show,

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.710
which we haven't announced yet.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:45.080
But we can announce it now.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:45.690
MIKE SAUSE: A Google exclusive!

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.035
HENRY FAULKNER: As
good a time as any.

00:51:47.035 --> 00:51:47.370
LISA KLAGES: I'm excited.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:47.990
CAITLIN MORRIS: And YouTube.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:49.614
SCOTT GRIFFIN: We
get a lot of requests

00:51:49.614 --> 00:51:52.640
from teachers, high
school teachers,

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:57.580
who think this is a really fun
introduction to Shakespeare.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.330
Of course, we can't
bring all the drinking

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.580
into the classroom, as much
as the teachers would like to.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.320
So we're launching a new show
called "Junk Shakespeare."

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.660
And it's kind of like
extreme food challenges

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:12.434
meeting Shakespeare.

00:52:12.434 --> 00:52:14.100
CAITLIN MORRIS: Adam
Richman, watch out.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.370
SCOTT GRIFFIN: With a lot
of opportunity for revenge

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.430
from the performers.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:20.060
So this will be for
high school students,

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.040
similar to the kind of thing
that you're seeing today.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.950
But taking out the
alcohol and replacing it

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.384
with things like a shot of--

00:52:27.384 --> 00:52:28.300
DAVID HUDSON: Mustard!

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.870
SCOTT GRIFFIN: --espresso
with soy sauce.

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:30.510
DAVID HUDSON: And mustard.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:31.130
LISA KLAGES: Pickle juice.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.110
CAITLIN MORRIS: Boo.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:32.220
MIKE SAUSE: Ew.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.470
DAVID HUDSON: That
sounds super-fun.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.880
CAITLIN MORRIS: Pickleback.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.830
DAVID HUDSON: A lot
of eating chilies.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:35.800
LISA KLAGES: Pop rocks.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.760
WHIT LEVENBERGER:
Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.130
LISA KLAGES: Barbecue sauce.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.380
WHIT LEVENBERGER: We did that.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:38.934
That was fun.

00:52:38.934 --> 00:52:40.600
SCOTT GRIFFIN: We've
been experimenting.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.933
LISA KLAGES: We've been playing.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.927
HENRY FAULKNER:
Like, wow, that's--

00:52:46.927 --> 00:52:48.760
CAITLIN MORRIS: Do you
need a minute, Henry?

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.634
HENRY FAULKNER: You're
just basically letting

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:51.990
high schoolers dictate the show?

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.717
Right?

00:52:52.717 --> 00:52:53.550
SCOTT GRIFFIN: Yeah.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.620
So it's high schoolers
giving challenges.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:53:00.420
But it's also the cast giving
challenges to each other.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:03.810
So there will be
challenges set up, and then

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.836
revenge challenges that come
back throughout the show.

00:53:06.836 --> 00:53:08.460
HENRY FAULKNER: So
there's a whole meta

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.274
arc to this theater company.

00:53:10.274 --> 00:53:11.190
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Yes.

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:12.480
HENRY FAULKNER: You're
drinking together.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.330
You're sort of all
over each other.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:15.535
And then the next day--

00:53:15.535 --> 00:53:16.490
CAITLIN MORRIS: What?

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:18.050
HENRY FAULKNER: --you're,
like, challenge.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.066
WHIT LEVENBERGER: The dagger.

00:53:19.066 --> 00:53:19.941
HENRY FAULKNER: Yeah.

00:53:19.941 --> 00:53:23.682
CAITLIN MORRIS: Oh, it's
my new hair accoutrement.

00:53:23.682 --> 00:53:24.640
You guys should try it.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.264
It's very cute.

00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:29.560
HENRY FAULKNER: Well,
thank you very much.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.740
This has been absolutely
one of the-- certainly,

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.681
one of the best Fridays
we've had in a while.

00:53:33.681 --> 00:53:36.180
Actually, no, If you're a parent
here, this is every Friday.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.820
This is formal.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.950
It just works as intended.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.130
Another big round of
applause for the cast

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:43.093
of "Drunk Shakespeare."

00:53:43.093 --> 00:53:45.458
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:48.769
CAITLIN MORRIS: Now do we
get to ask them questions?

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:49.720
MIKE SAUSE: Yeah.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.400
DAVID HUDSON: Caitlin wants
to ask the audience questions.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.000
HENRY FAULKNER: Oh, yeah.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.930
That's-- totally.

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.346
CAITLIN MORRIS:
I've got questions

00:53:54.346 --> 00:53:57.436
for all of you involving
my SEO situation.

00:53:57.436 --> 00:53:58.600
Anyway, I'm kidding.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.663
I have to pee.

00:53:59.663 --> 00:54:01.140
OK.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.070
I gotta go pee.

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:05.362
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Caitlin
Morris, ladies and gentlemen.

00:54:05.362 --> 00:54:06.611
HENRY FAULKNER: She's a peach.

00:54:06.611 --> 00:54:07.120
All right.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.650
Well, thank you very much.

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.820
We look forward to seeing
more from you guys.

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.570
And yeah, come back again.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:14.510
We have nine cafes.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.390
So there's all sorts of
weird food challenges

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:17.350
you can make here.

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:18.260
Bring it back.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.902
We come up with
some weird dishes.

00:54:20.902 --> 00:54:21.860
WHIT LEVENBERGER: Cool.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:22.450
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:22.960
MIKE SAUSE: Thank you so much.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.650
Thanks for having us.

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:24.250
HENRY FAULKNER: All right.

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:24.749
Cheers.

00:54:24.749 --> 00:54:26.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.730
MIKE SAUSE: Thank you.
