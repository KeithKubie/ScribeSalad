00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.080
It could seem bizarre quite how long we spend
on those strands of stringy keratin that sprout

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.990
– unreliably – from our scalps. We will,
over a lifetime, devote thousands of hours

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.650
and even more money on hairdressers’ careful
attempts to coax and sculpt our coiffure into

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.319
exactly the right colour, shape and dimension.
There are days when our entire mood will be

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.910
supported by a sense that our hair is cooperating
and others when our spirits will be just as

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.750
powerfully ruined by an unfortunate glimpse
of our disobedient locks in an elevator mirror.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.210
Why does it matter so much? Because – however
odd this may sound – we are using our hair

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.190
to speak. We’re trying, through the syntax
of coloured protein filaments, to express

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.540
key aspects about who we are.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.360
It is always precarious for us to transmit
our identities to those around us. We

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.630
rely on
other, accompanying details: our shoes, our

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.971
jewellery, our clothes – and of course,
most centrally, those strands of hair. Everyone’s

00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:13.399
hair speaks in a slightly specific dialect,
but we can with relative ease define some

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.920
of the main entries in humanity’s vast and
nuanced Dictionary of Hair:

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.240
Tightly pulled back: We’re letting the world know that
we are busy, organised and not to be interrupted

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.490
lightly. Long, flowing and tangled: We are
reminding society of our opposition to some

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.430
of the demands of modern capitalism. We’re spiritual
beings, our hair is saying, we have a heart

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.899
and make the time to notice what really counts.
Emphatic side-parting: We’re using hair

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.201
to tell others that we’re careful, modest,
patient, sensible and very willing to be realistic.

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:57.119
We can be relied upon. Brushed forward, closely
cropped, in the manner of a Roman General:

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.549
We’re too immersed, our hair informs society,
in the real battles of life to care about

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.999
trivia; we make our hair obey. We have grown
indifferent to criticism and – in a good

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:14.940
way – hard to impress. Hair truly is a subtle
and intricate language. The problem – or

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.670
even the tragedy – is that other people
aren’t necessarily paying very much attention

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.300
to what it is saying. We encounter this awkward
reality in the difficult moments after our

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.860
return from an expensive and slow-moving hairdresser.
We rejoin our friends or lovers with an expectant

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.460
‘what do you think?’ only to receive mildly
confused responses: ‘those trousers suit

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.570
you’ or ‘have you lost weight?’ We felt
that it mattered so ardently that the locks

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.760
are now combed just a little more to the left
and are one shade closer to blonde: others

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.740
don’t give a damn, though in the privacy
of their own bathrooms, they too will take

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.360
immense care about what their hair is saying.
The conversation we have with hair appears

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360
close to an immensely expensive, laborious,
self-conscious dialogue of the deaf. And yet

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.250
what we’re encountering, in the limited
context of hair, is simply a problem that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.370
haunts us throughout our lives: the essential
loneliness of the human animal. We have an

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.930
extraordinarily limited power to get others
to care about and understand us the way we

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.540
so crave to be grasped. And vice versa. We
should not mock others for caring so much

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.590
about their hair – or berate ourselves for
doing the same. We’re just engaged in the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.410
poignant business of attempting to communicate
who we are. With all those dyes, curlers,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.020
tongs and scissors, we’re just trying to
make ourselves a little more clearly understood

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.480
in a world with painfully little inclination

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.640
to care. .

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.960
