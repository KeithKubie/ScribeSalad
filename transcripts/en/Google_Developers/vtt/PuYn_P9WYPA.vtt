[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.770
STEVE BAZYL: Hi everyone.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.030
Thanks for coming.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.720
We're back after a small
delay this morning.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.870
We were supposed to be on
earlier this morning at 10:00.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.230
A few little scheduling mishaps,
but everything got

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.040
worked out fine.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.510
So, no worries, and we're glad
to be back with today's topic

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.490
of questions from
the community.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.950
There are few that were
posted already.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.430
If you are watching and you
would like to ask additional

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.020
questions, feel free
to just post

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.660
something in the community.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.210
You can do that either on the
original event that was

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.210
announced or just add a new
topic in the discussions, and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.580
I'll get to those at the
end, if there are any.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.060
If not, no big deal.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.200
We'll be doing these
again now and then.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.710
And of course, we'll always be
happy to answer whatever

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.420
question you ask, either
in the community or in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.170
StackOverflow.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.815
So I'm going to take a quick
look down at a few that were

00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:25.520
asked on the original event--

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.540
a couple of good ones in here
that I think are interesting.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.450
The first, from Will Scott, is
asking about how our Open and

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.240
Create actions work in
the context of mobile

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.200
applications.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.880
And this is actually a really
good question, because you're

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.960
right that these URLs are
somewhat meaningless on a

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.430
mobile application,
particularly if

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.710
it's a native app.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.010
And for Android, this is
something that we're actually

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.700
handling partially
through intents.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.160
So the way that you can handle
and Open With-like action with

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.050
the native Drive client
is through a

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.280
special Drive Open intent.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.360
And there is an Android example
in the docs that shows

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.670
how to take advantage of this.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.970
Apps can also just use the
regular Open intent as well

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.770
just to handle any generic
file open.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.959
But if you want to get specific
drive metadata and

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.940
handle things in a different
way-- where you handle the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.620
file transfer yourself, get
the file ID so you can do

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.890
uploads and everything--

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.360
the Drive Open action is the
one that you'd want to take

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.170
advantage of.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.440
On iOS, we're a little
bit behind there.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.690
It's something that
we are looking at.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.590
And I would just say, in
general, the integration with

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.540
native apps on mobile is not
quite to the level that it

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.500
really should be compared to the
integration that we have

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.480
in the Drive UI on the web.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.380
This is something that's
important to us, of course, so

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.010
stay tuned over the next few
months as we refine that

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.900
experience and give you a
few more options on the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.720
development side to have those
apps nicely integrated with

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.260
the Drive applications
on Android and iOS.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.520
But today, we're not quite
there, other than

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.730
Open With on Android.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.040
And again, take a look at the
examples that are already

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.440
there today.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.820
Arnie had a good
question here.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.170
It's a little bit more of
a product question.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.530
So I'm not going to go into too
much detail about this,

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.630
but he was asking, how do
we optimize disk space?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.650
And this is somebody who's
trying to move some of his

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.370
attachments into Drive from
Gmail but, of course,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.400
wondering about the storage and
quota usage of having two

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.080
copies of the attachments.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.890
So a couple people have pointed
to some really helpful

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.340
tools to help do some of this
stuff automatically.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.750
These are some apps that have
been written in Apps Script,

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.460
which is actually a great way to
do this kind of automation.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.630
From a product perspective, I
can't really say of any plans

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.830
that we're doing other than
just, in general, we're always

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.310
looking for opportunities to
improve the integration

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.830
between Drive and other products
to make this a more

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.490
seamless experience for users.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.740
So expect the products
to evolve.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.500
Expect the integrations to
evolve, what they end up

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.780
looking like.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.890
I don't know, but obviously,
we're very interested in

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.340
making this as seamless as an
experience for you as a user

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.200
and for developers as well.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.250
So I want to go back, and a good
question from Alexei--

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.760
is there a way to generate a
preview for custom files in

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.870
Google Drive?

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.640
They are creating and editing
specific files, and they have

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.930
the capability to generate a
PNG and JPG and then would

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.815
like it to display,
presumably, in

00:06:51.815 --> 00:06:52.790
the thumbnail view.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.250
Or [? she ?] just recently
was some redesigns

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.580
of how we do previews.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.250
So the answer to that is yes.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.590
This is probably a poorly
documented feature.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:10.330
It's something we launched back
in October, probably did

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.760
a blog post on it.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.065
But in terms of the
documentation, it's actually

00:07:14.065 --> 00:07:15.200
just buried.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.825
It's one field on the Files
resource and then a small

00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:19.080
blurb somewhere in our docs.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.900
And we were actually just
talking about this the other

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.210
day, about how we can make this
a lot more prominent,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.330
because we think it's actually
a really cool feature,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.270
particularly with some
improvements in the Drive UI

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.280
to make previews much
more prominent.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.100
The short answer is when you
upload the file metadata,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.790
there is a property
that you can set.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.700
It's just called Thumbnail.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.780
And it takes the base64 encoded

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.080
data for your thumbnail.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.342
You can upload anything up to
about two megabytes in size.

00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:54.320
The higher the resolution
you can do to fit

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.400
inside that the better.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.310
Anything above 1600,
though, probably

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.440
isn't going to be used.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.340
We will downsample and downsize
that thumbnail for

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.510
the appropriate views.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.080
We won't, however, try
to upsample it.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.630
So try to give us as big as
a one you can within two

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.860
megabytes, base64 encode it,
shove it in the thumbnail

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.410
property, and we will take
advantage of that.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.010
There are a couple
catches to that.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.840
So any time that the binary
content changes--

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.250
so if this is a file that
you're storing the BLOB,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.750
you're storing the raw
data in Drive--

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.800
any time that the content
changes, you do need to

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.330
provide a new thumbnail because
that's going to get

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.080
invalidated.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.110
If you're using more of the
shortcut-style applications

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.809
where you're only storing
metadata in Drive but the

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.299
content is held elsewhere, we're
not going to invalidate

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.360
those when the content changes
because we simply don't know

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.750
when the content changes.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.780
But it would just be your
responsibility to make sure

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.170
that those thumbnails are
updated on an appropriate

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.740
basis so that they reflect
the content of the file.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.060
But yeah, it's a cool feature.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.550
If you have custom files in
Drive, strongly encouraged to

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:08.090
do, especially now that
thumbnailing and preview usage

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.480
is becoming much more prominent
in the Drive UI.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.570
So next question is are there
plans for public HTML hosting?

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.970
To enhance this, so this is the
HTML hosting feature we

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.710
launched a little while ago.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.830
It would be nice to have some
Apps Script integrations and

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.810
version managers and so on.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.150
So these are actually really
good suggestions.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.290
So some of this is already
available in Drive.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.860
So version management, for
example, Drive is a version

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.890
file system, so the revision
history is there.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.930
Those revisions do get cleaned
up periodically in the

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:45.550
background.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.690
So if, as a user, you want to
keep them around, you have to

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.570
go in and you have to pin
certain revisions if you want

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.450
to guarantee that you can always
roll back to them.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.300
It's not really featured
prominently in the UI, and nor

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.540
is the UI really an IDE
or an authoring

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.380
tool for HTML content.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.180
But there are some really cool
ones that people are building

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.140
in the Chrome Web Store.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.860
There are some apps like
Neutron Drive.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.720
There's ShiftEdit--

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.520
can't remember the name of it.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.070
But there's a couple of really
cool Cloud IDEs that are being

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.400
backed by Drive.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.940
I don't know which of those
have a nice revision

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.950
management integrated.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.130
But if you're the developer of
those and you haven't done it,

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.690
that would be a really
good thing to add.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.470
And then in terms of Apps Script
integration, that's a

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.460
really good question.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.740
I don't know the answer to that
right now, but I do know

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.230
that the Apps Script team is
very interested and always

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.090
adding features and making
it easier to build

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.740
apps with Apps Script.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.500
They are a, I would say,
cousin of Drive.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.590
Definitely, we have
a common origin.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.130
But there's probably a
lot that we can do.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.590
Nothing that I can really talk
about or say concretely, but

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.320
it's something that we'll talk
to those teams about and see

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.170
how can we make these features
work really well together?

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.680
And it's probably something
that would be really

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.870
interesting and fun
to work on.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.720
So let's see, Alexei says he'd
like to run some code on an

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.190
event in Google Drive, such as a
file or folder creation, and

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.600
Edit, like a new version.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.160
Are there ways to do it?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.250
Yes.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.180
So there's a couple options.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.992
One is, as, actually, somebody
pointed out the in the

00:11:29.992 --> 00:11:32.940
threads, you can use Apps
Script, which does have some

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.250
basic triggering support.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
If your code can't run in the
Apps Script container--

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.010
you want to run code on your
other thing, and you don't

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.460
want to have that glue code
where you're using the

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.410
triggers of Apps Script but
then having to call out to

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.870
another service--

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.120
there is a way to do it
with the Changes feed.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.450
So any modification to a user's
collection is reported

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.410
as a change in the feed.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.470
You can poll that feed to
get a list of all the

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.140
modifications since the
last time you checked.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.180
So polling may be an option if
the frequency that you poll at

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.410
isn't too high.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.390
If it's OK that there's a little
bit of a delay for when

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.920
that action happens and when you
need to know about it, you

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.290
can poll every 10, 15
minutes, and that

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.010
would be totally fine.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.330
For more real time, reactive
stuff's, the Apps Script

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.150
integration will give you a
little bit better accuracy, or

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.260
at least a smaller window.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.150
And then something that we
announced a few weeks ago when

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.210
we talked about our Early
Access Program is we are

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.330
working on Push notifications,
which does give you that lower

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:43.670
latency, chance to subscribe
to files, subscribe to

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.210
folders, and get notified when
they changed or if an item is

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.960
added to a collection
or so on.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.170
So some things, you could do
today, depending on your use

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.060
case, either Apps Script
or polling.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.650
In the future, we're going
to make it a little

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.100
bit better with Push.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.650
And then yeah, you should be
able to do that just fine.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.760
And there's a whole
bunch of apps that

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.600
are doing this today.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.240
There's some really cool
services like IFTT--

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.160
If This Then That.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.590
There's a couple on mobile
devices that do this type of

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.850
automation.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.840
Another used to be
called Wappwolf.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.100
Now it's called iBeam.it.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.120
Really, just awesome apps that
are doing exactly what you

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.510
described of watching Drive or
Dropbox or any other service--

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.190
they're doing Twitter.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.930
You name it, they're watching
it and allowing you to do

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.240
these types of triggers.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.610
So that's actually even another
option is going to

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.660
somebody who already has an
infrastructure and see if you

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:45.350
can piggyback on that and do
your own custom actions for

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.790
one of these services
like IFTT.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.580
Let's see what else.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.935
So I'm going to jump up to the
top here, and actually it

00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:58.190
looks like there may even
be a few new posts.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.390
This one from Colby, of course,
which is, yes, did

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.260
anyone else get tricked into
watching the YouTube video

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.870
this morning?

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.575
Yes.

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:03.860
No.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.280
Of course we're sorry about
that, but it's fine.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.570
Better late than never.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.090
Tom had a good question about
Drive scopes on Android.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.650
And it's actually a really
important question.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:22.710
So I was thinking, can we do
things, more restrictive than

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.900
just asking for everything
in Drive on Android?

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.090
And you can.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.700
There is one particular
catch, and it brings

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.080
up a broader point.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.030
So we do have the drive.file
scope.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.700
This is something that when we
did Drive version one, this

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.120
was actually the only
scope that we had.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.970
And then in version two,
we added the full

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.310
scope back in again.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.580
That used to be in the
Documents List API.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.940
And the drive.file scope
does work with Android.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.400
What this will allow you to do
is have access to any file

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.140
that your application creates
as well as any file that the

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.030
user explicitly opens.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.960
So in the case of you were doing
the Drive Open intent.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.620
Somebody launches a file
from the Drive UI.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.510
That will enable your app to
open and read that file.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.030
But everything else
is off limits.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.980
And this is exactly the
type of use case

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.580
that Tom asked for.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.720
The catch, though, on Android
is you have to be using the

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.410
newer ways of authenticating
and gaining access--

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.600
basically, using Google
Play services.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.610
The reason has to do with how
application identity is

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.790
established.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.760
If you're using the older,
pre-Google Play services

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.390
methods of authenticating and
authorizing access to your

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.580
app, you're actually, even
though you're getting access

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.250
for the user, the application
that we see it as is actually

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.510
just Android.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.300
It's not your specific
application.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.330
And so when it comes to doing
this fine grain permissioning,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.530
that doesn't really work,
because it means every

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.310
application on that device would
have access to the same

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.910
set of files, which is really
not what the intention of that

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.910
feature is nor what the
user would expect.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.680
And so a while back, we actually
turned off that

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.970
feature, at least for
using the shared ID.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.190
If you use the Google Play
Services, GoogleAuthUtil,

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.820
basically, that capability
is restored.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.490
So when we see a request from
your app, it actually maps

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.620
back to a project in the Google
API's console, and we

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.780
have a really strong way of
establishing that identity.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.800
And then we know for sure
that, yes, this is your

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.340
application.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.800
These are the files that the
user authorized you to see,

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.630
and then we can have that
level of security again.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.730
So if you switch over to using
that take-up, it can then use

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:49.320
the drive.file scope and then
have the level of security

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.010
that you are looking for.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.430
One thing we're actually
planning to do later in July

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:01.880
is disable use of the older
authorization mechanism for

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.510
Drive completely.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:09.300
And it's not necessarily from
a security perspective, just

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.790
because if you're using the full
Drive scope, every app

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.210
has access to every
file anyway.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:18.530
It's really just more for
quota management, for

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.410
reporting, just make sure
that we have a much

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.690
more accurate picture.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.050
Plus, the new way of doing it
is just much more secure in

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.369
general, and we really want
to get people using it.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:30.270
So if you're not using Google
Play services yet, already, on

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:36.420
Android, switch now, just get
it out there to your users.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.590
And then sometime around June
or July, if you're still on

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:44.970
the old way, we're going to
start turning that off, and

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.280
chances are, your
apps will break.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.460
So obviously, you don't
want that to happen.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.920
And it's only a handful
of apps that are

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.270
still on the old one.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.340
We'll be reaching out to people
individually just to

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.150
make sure people are
keeping up to date.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.980
But for anyone doing a new
app, Play services

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.230
is the way to go.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.340
David had a really good
question, actually related to

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:14.190
this, is there a way to limit
applications to a folder?

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.190
Currently, the answer is no.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.350
So as I explained earlier,
we have just these two

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.380
One is everything, and then
the other is down to an

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.170
individual file basis.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.570
The idea of doing it on a folder
basis is something that

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.000
we've heard quite a bit
of from developers.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.110
It's something that we've been
working with the engineering

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.180
team to figure out if we can
have this and what that

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.380
timing might be.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.890
There are various technical
issues that are keeping us

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.480
from doing it as soon as we
would like to, but it's

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.830
definitely something we've
gotten a lot of requests for,

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.990
something that we're anxious
to see added at some point.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.490
But right now, it's just still
something that we're working

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.850
through to figure out whether
it's feasible or not.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:00.590
So stay tuned.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.850
Hopefully, we'll have some good
news, but nothing on the

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.270
short term roadmap that really
is going to solve for this

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.970
particular use case.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:14.870
And somebody was asking
about converting MP3s.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:20.820
That's not what Drive is for, so
the short answer is no, you

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.450
cannot use it as a way to
convert your audio files into

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.150
different formats.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.000
It would be kind of
cool, but just not

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.680
something that we can do.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.593
And let me just check
my notifications.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.460
Oh, and just a couple
of people sitting

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.870
there watching now.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.400
But Colby, if you are watching
and you have questions, we

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.110
don't have a live chat up--

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.636
unless, Dylan, do you have
a live chat up anywhere?

00:19:49.636 --> 00:19:52.350
DYLAN: People could comment
on the YouTube video.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.730
STEVE BAZYL: So, yeah.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.650
There is some commenting
on YouTube.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.820
Dylan can read them to me.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.560
But easiest thing for me to see
them is actually just to

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.110
post to the community,
and I would happily

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.260
answer whatever is posted.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.040
Let me just see if there's a
couple last questions that I

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.820
want to talk about.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.150
And if not, we'll wrap up.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:21.860
But let em just scroll through
here a little bit.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.310
And a lot of stuff about Google
Apps Script, people

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.560
doing some really
creative things.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.790
But it looks like
that may be it.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.600
Colby, since you were asking
about live questions, feel

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.230
free to post things later.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:47.400
We'll follow up in the community
or on StackOverflow.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.200
And again, just always happy to
talk to people and figure

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.760
out what you're doing.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:58.470
And certainly, just post in the
forum about what you're

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.800
actually building.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.720
We get a little bit of insight
from our logs and from the API

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.840
projects, but a lot of times,
all we're seeing is an

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.705
application title, which
isn't always the

00:21:08.705 --> 00:21:10.590
most informative thing.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.520
So if you are building something
that you think is

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.970
just really cool, post in
the community about it.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.770
Let people know.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.840
Let other developers know.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.830
Let us know.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:22.140
And if it's something really
interesting, we'd love to chat

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.790
more about it and see what we
can do to make it better.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.940
So with that, since we're out
of questions, I'm going to

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.450
wrap it up.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.810
We will be back next week.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:38.600
Either Tuesday or
Friday, we'll be

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.540
broadcasting from Zurich.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.070
It will be Nicolas.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.335
And lots of cool stuff
on the horizon.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.770
Actually want to just quick
shout out to everyone who

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.270
joined the Early
Access program.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.880
We've gotten a lot of
people in there.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.050
If you haven't heard back,
chances are it means you

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.020
weren't in.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.010
I haven't sent emails to
everyone to confirm that, but

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.910
I'll try to get confirmations
out to everyone just so you

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.330
know for sure that we did look
at you and it just wasn't

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.700
right fit at this time.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.030
But the people who are in, we're
really happy to see that

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.390
people are doing really
interesting stuff and getting

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.510
us feedback.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.580
So, keep it coming.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.510
And if you haven't heard and
you still think you can do

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.910
some really cool stuff with the
newer features, just apply

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.870
again and we'll reconsider.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.490
But we're actually really happy
with how that's turning

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:37.620
out, so great job everyone
who's doing that.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.430
And that's it.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.680
So come back Tuesday, and
we'll see you soon.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.930
All right, thanks.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:23:26.153
