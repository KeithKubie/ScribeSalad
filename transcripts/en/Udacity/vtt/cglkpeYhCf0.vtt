00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.445
Now before we get any further, I want to stop

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:04.324
using this word weight. After all we’re

00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:06.060
supposed to be talking about pressure. And

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.489
pressure is a little bit more fundamental

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:11.089
here than weight. Weight, you see, depends

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.532
on the area of this column of air. If we

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:16.608
made it twice as big, we would have had

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:18.706
twice as much air and twice as much weight

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:20.662
. So, why don’t we do this? Why don’t we

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:24.996
do the weight of air and divide it by this area

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.924
. And this in fact is exactly what air pressure

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:30.519
is. The weight of air divided by the area

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.478
for which we’re talking about. In fact,

00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:34.904
pressure in general which we usually label with

00:00:34.904 --> 00:00:37.604
a big P is equal to any force – remember

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.344
weight is a force, divided by an area.

00:00:41.344 --> 00:00:43.403
Okay. So now we can stop using this word weight

00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:46.279
and type of pressure. Down at low altitude, we

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.752
have high pressure and once we start getting

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:52.000
towards outer space we have low pressure.
