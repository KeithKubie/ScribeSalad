FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello and
welcome to today's talk

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.530
at Google.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.970
We're incredibly pleased
to host David Burkus, who

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.830
is the author of "The
Myths of Creativity",

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.950
"The Truth About How Innovative
Companies and People Generate

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.570
Great Ideas".

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.190
David is a contributing writer
for "Forbes" and "Psychology

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.410
Today", and has
also been featured

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.700
in "Fast Company, Inc.",
"Bloomberg Business Week",

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.750
"Financial Times", and
even on "CBS This Morning".

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.060
So I'm sure that you're
all excited to spend time

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.930
with him over the
next 40, 45 minutes.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.540
He'll be sharing a little bit
of insight about his book,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.300
and then opening
up to questions.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.360
So without further
to do, over to you.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.556
DAVID BURKUS: So,
thank you, thank you.

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:45.930
Yeah, the CBS
thing, it was cool.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.180
I saw a couple people
nod, there, quite cool.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.397
Unfortunately, I was on
the Saturday edition.

00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:50.980
So I did not get to
meet Charlie Rose.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.960
But life goal for the next book.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.320
So I want to talk to you
a bit about this book now.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.690
And really I want
to tell you a bit

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.521
about the story of a
realization that I had.

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.020
The weird thing
about writing a book

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.090
is you learn things
after you publish it.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.700
After you send it
to the publisher

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.130
people then start
discussing you.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.089
And you realize that, I set
out to write a business book,

00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:12.880
or I thought I was
writing a business book.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.270
And I found I've written a book
that has I hope a little bit

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.530
broader implications for
how we rethink things.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190
And it's this one sentence
that I didn't really

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.340
figure out until
after I had published,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.330
which was, the stories we
tell ourselves are true,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.781
even if they're not true.

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:32.280
So the things that
we tell ourselves

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.420
are true even if
they're totally false,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.160
even if they have
no basis in reality.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.220
Because if we tell it
to ourselves enough

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.710
we eventually start
to believe it.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.251
And there's a
psychological principle

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:44.450
called confirmation
bias that confirms this.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.620
Confirmation bias that
confirms this, that's funny.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.380
What confirmation
bias essentially does

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.210
is it says that you
filter out things

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.370
that don't conform to
what you already believe.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.910
And you willfully
seek out things

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.930
that will conform to
what you already believe.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.260
It will confirm your beliefs.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.520
So, you probably
have realized this.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.480
If you've ever been
car shopping you

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.440
have found confirmation
bias at work, right.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.190
Who has been car
shopping recently?

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.944
And what kind of car
did you decide on?

00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:15.330
AUDIENCE: A Ram 1500.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970
DAVID BURKUS: A Ram 1500.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.817
How many RAM 1500s did you see
shortly after you bought it?

00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:21.650
AUDIENCE: Oh, a lot.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.980
DAVID BURKUS: They're all
over the place, right?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.800
And it's not like
anything changed, I mean,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.910
unless you decided to drive
through Texas after you bought

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.410
it.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.701
It's not like anything changed.

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:31.760
It's still a Ram 1500.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.009
There were still just as
many on the street as before.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.220
But your mind is drawing
attention and flagging

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.307
and signaling you
when it's there.

00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:40.640
And interestingly, the things
that you chose not to buy,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.830
it sort of just fades
to the background.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.980
Now if you really, really want
to get a taste of this wait

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.020
until this fall, because we have
an election season coming up.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.740
And this is when
confirmation bias

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.050
is on display for
the world to see.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.140
So if you still don't believe
in the Ram 1500 example,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.840
get into a political argument
with someone who thinks

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.290
differently than you on some
social network, via Twitter,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.874
Google+, Facebook, whatever.

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:08.540
It has to be a social
network because it

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.600
has to be asynchronous.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.160
You have to give them time to
find some blog that supports

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.002
their world view and
then come back to you.

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:17.460
So it can't be a face to face
discussion because then it'll

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.390
be like human and you'll
find common ground.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.181
We don't want that.

00:03:20.181 --> 00:03:22.181
We're showing
confirmation bias at work.

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:23.930
But what eventually
happens is the stories

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.300
that we tell ourselves become
true because of confirmation

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.894
bias.

00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:29.810
And this happened in
this case with this book.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.520
I used the term myths
because myths are stories.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.370
And myths are stories
that we make up

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.730
to try and explain things that
we can't really explain fully.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.650
And what happens over
time is those myths

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.170
become true, even
if they're not true.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.300
So I set out, actually, to
write a leadership book.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.130
I did my Doctoral work on
strategy and leadership.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.650
And I set out
wanting to know, what

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.790
is it that the
leaders of amazingly

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.730
creative organizations do
that other people don't do.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.630
And it came down to
this idea of stories.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.585
And it really-- the
deep dark secret-- it

00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:03.130
wasn't all that much
about the actual leader.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.720
It was just about
what are the stories

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.200
that people are
telling themselves.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.066
So we tell a lot of different
stories, lots and lots

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:10.940
of different stories.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.390
One of my favorites is,
if you pay attention

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.390
to the way we
describe creativity,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.390
we tell an almost religious
story around creativity.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.000
It almost feels like
it's some religion.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.730
And if you go to certain parts
of the world-- San Francisco,

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.790
Austin, Texas, parts of
New York-- creative people

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.190
actually look like priests
of some near eastern religion

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.487
you've never heard of.

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:38.320
Piercings, tattoos,
things that you're like,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.670
wow, you really could be a
guru on a mountain somewhere.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.720
But you're a barista.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720
But you know what I mean.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.970
So we talk about it in these
weird, almost religious terms.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.105
And I think we do
that to our detriment.

00:04:51.105 --> 00:04:52.480
Because in reality
it's something

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.840
that's sort of
accessible to everyone.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.870
So we talk about creativity
like it's a gift from the gods.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.090
We talk about innovation
like it happens in a flash.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.640
In reality it's actually a
little simpler to explain.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.200
I can do it with a picture.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.240
So a woman by the
name of Teresa Amabile

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.440
did this amazing
series of research

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.440
and came up with what she
calls the Confidential

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.400
Model of Creativity.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.830
Which essentially says,
every creative insight

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.755
happens when four things
are at play together.

00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:20.380
Now I already know
what you're thinking

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.040
because I see people's eyes.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.280
There are only four
circles on the slide.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.260
We'll get to that.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.850
So four things essentially
in play, expertise,

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.000
creative thinking,
skills, and motivation.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.060
Expertise, you actually
have to know something

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.450
about where you want
a creative insight in.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.120
Interestingly enough,
too much expertise

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.680
can sometimes be a bad thing.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.140
We'll get to that.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.480
Creative thinking skills.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.700
Do you actually
know the processes,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.390
especially in groups, for coming
up with lots of great ideas?

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.900
Or are you just
sort of winging it?

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.483
Or are you throwing
yourself in a room

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.780
and doing what we call
brainstorming but looks nothing

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.609
like what its creator intended?

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:56.150
So creative thinking
skills, I think,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.810
we have a hard time
thinking that expertise,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.310
in particular, and
creative thinking

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.600
skills are two
different circles.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.245
Most of the time we use
this term creatives a lot.

00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:07.370
We use this term creatives.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.930
We describe advertising
copy as creative copy now.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.680
And what I think is
interesting about that

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.390
is that's actually merging
these creative thinking

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.444
skills with expertise.

00:06:16.444 --> 00:06:18.110
But you can use
creative thinking skills

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.040
and, even in fields
of expertise,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.990
that no one would call
creative, like accounting.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.680
Now sometimes you do that at
the detriment of the world.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.620
But, I mean, I use
mint.com every single day.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.830
It's an amazingly
creative product.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.060
So the last one is motivation.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.350
And intrinsic motivation
is generally better

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.754
than extrinsic
motivation, things

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:39.920
like bonuses and incentives.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.430
But there are things we can
do to structure and align

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.400
those two to actually have
an even more powerful force.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.320
But in general intrinsic
motivation works really well.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.230
It's often been said necessity
is the mother of invention.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.300
I'd say necessity is
the mother innovation.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.810
Why?

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.920
Necessity is a really
good intrinsic motivator.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.460
If you have a problem that
desperately needs to be solved,

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.390
you have a lot of motivation
to solve said problem.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.980
Now three circles,
four components.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.940
The fourth component is
the social environment.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.580
What is the environment in which
you are actually operating in?

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.670
Is it generally supportive
of new and creative ideas?

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.710
Does it squelch ideas?

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.380
Does it support idea sharing?

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.800
Does it support what a friend
of mine calls little bets?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.460
Does it support the idea of
taking lots of little risks,

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.430
deferring judgment?

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.190
All of these sort of things
help shape a social environment

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.660
that can harbor creativity.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.540
And what I think
is interesting is

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.760
when I think about the
perfect social environment,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.910
I actually think about a
kindergarten classroom.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.350
Does anyone have
kindergartners or younger kids?

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.080
So I have a two-year-old
and a two month old,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.217
which means we're
looking at the beginner

00:07:43.217 --> 00:07:45.300
programs-- preschool
programs, working our way up.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.010
And if you go in and
visit a kindergarten,

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.010
you'll see a classroom of 25
people and maybe four really,

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.920
really frazzled
looking teachers.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.600
But you'll see 25
kids, little people.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.960
All of them are
incredibly creative.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.780
I teach college most
days out of the year,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.410
and when I get a
classroom of 25 students,

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.810
if I asked them if they think
they're creative, two of them

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.267
will raise their hand.

00:08:08.267 --> 00:08:09.850
And both of them are
marketing majors.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.558
That doesn't even
count because they just

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:13.400
think they're giving
me the right answer.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.510
So we go from 25 to two.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.697
And I just think this is
incredibly depressing.

00:08:19.697 --> 00:08:22.030
And the reason that we do is
that the social environment

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.530
changes.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.680
As you move through life
you become more and more

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.640
aware of the fact that not
everyone loves your crazy,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.710
off the wall ideas.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.510
And eventually it becomes easier
to just not bring them up.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.230
You learn that regurgitating the
right answer back to a teacher

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.450
is just easier.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.590
And even if you have a
very forward thinking,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.429
progressive school, we
still have a society

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.752
that doesn't really value
creative, new ideas.

00:08:44.752 --> 00:08:46.460
And we'll talk about
that at the tail end

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.056
because I think that's the
most devastating story that we

00:08:49.056 --> 00:08:50.055
tell ourselves.

00:08:50.055 --> 00:08:52.180
But again, to go with this
idea that the stories we

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.763
tell ourselves are
true, there's a lot

00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:56.330
of stories I've found
that we tell ourselves

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.220
around creative people,
creative companies,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.150
that we use to
discount ourselves.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.321
One of my favorites
is this Eureka story.

00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:05.820
And I'm indebted
to a lot of people.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.870
I'm not the first person that's
taken aim at the Eureka story.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.261
One of the most fascinating
examples of this

00:09:14.261 --> 00:09:15.260
is Newton and the apple.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.200
How many people have
ever heard the story

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.310
of Newton and the apple?

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.580
Tell it to me,
Newton and the apple.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.390
So Isaac Newton is sitting
under an apple tree.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.620
What happens?

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.440
Apple falls.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:35.230
Isaac Newton discovers gra-- no.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.920
Does something related
to gravity, right.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.020
Great story.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.820
Great lesson for
aspiring, creative people.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.000
What's the lesson?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.682
Sit under a tree and
wait for stuff to happen.

00:09:47.682 --> 00:09:49.390
Now, I can tell you
because I've searched

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.810
lots and lots of sources.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.450
The Story is not actually true.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.539
There's a version of the
story very similar to it

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:57.330
that does involve an
apple that has already

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.060
hit the ground and Isaac
Newton talking about apples.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.720
But the actual hitting never--
we can't source that story.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.639
Over time, of course,
so Isaac's over here

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.930
and he's talking about the
apple falling to the ground.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.180
Over time we retell the story.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.455
And the apple levitates and
Isaac moves closer to it

00:10:12.455 --> 00:10:14.610
and eventually we
arrive at this moment.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.230
And it's a good story.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.210
But the lesson is
a terrible one.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.960
I don't have time to
sit under apple trees

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.690
and wait for stuff to happen.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.392
But again, if you
remember, myths

00:10:24.392 --> 00:10:26.850
are things we tell ourselves
because they sort of feel true

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.400
and then the confirmation
bias takes over.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.640
So there is some
truth to the story.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.860
And fortunately a
researcher by the name

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.190
of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,
whose name is so awesome you

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.840
should say it any
time you get a chance.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.780
It's like plus 10 on perceived
IQ if you can say it.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.715
So he did this
amazing study where

00:10:46.715 --> 00:10:48.720
he surveyed outstandingly
creative, renowned

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.860
creative people in a
variety of different fields.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.150
Essentially he asked
lots of different people

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.090
in different fields,
who do you admire?

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.490
And then when they sort of
aggregated around a name,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.390
he went out and sought
that person out.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.571
And he just asked them, describe
to me your creative process.

00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:04.820
And then he did sort of a
qualitative factor analysis.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.085
And he arrived at,
everybody's creative process,

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:10.150
as he described it, goes through
these five different stages.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.606
So we start out
with preparation.

00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:13.730
This is where you're doing
research on the problem.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.890
You're gaining expertise.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.350
And then most people who
have these insights go

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.880
into a period of incubation.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.410
So they actually set it aside.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.600
They don't just plow
right through the problem

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.391
and try and prepare
and prepare and prepare

00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:29.250
until they arrive at a solution.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.750
They take some time off.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.890
They grab a Google bike and
they go for a ride sometimes.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.160
They sit under an
apple tree sometimes.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.030
More often than not they
actually just switch projects.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.550
So while one project
is incubating

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.180
they're working on
a different one.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.104
And so sometimes you can
move into the third stage,

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:46.020
which is that insight.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.700
That's the aha moment.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.360
And sometimes it really
does happen directly out

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.570
of incubation.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.500
So if you think about
a story like Newton

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.690
and the apple, Archimedes
in the bathtub,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.095
I think there probably was
some sort of aha moment.

00:11:58.095 --> 00:12:00.309
He was incubating and
then it came to him.

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:02.100
And then gradually over
time the story just

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.520
gets better if you
merge those two events.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.241
And we've all had
those moments, right?

00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:08.990
We think about it.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.380
My best ideas come to me in
the shower or when I'm jogging

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.769
or when I'm doing something
that forces that incubation.

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.560
But the thing I think
is really interesting

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.072
is you can
deliberately incubate.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.030
And when you get done
with an incubation period

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.660
you can deliberately
set back to it.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.441
So research supports
the idea that if you

00:12:25.441 --> 00:12:27.690
work on a problem for a
while, then you incubate, then

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.680
you return and do something like
a brainstorming or an ideation

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.630
technique, you will generate
more and better ideas

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.090
because you spent
that time incubating.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.385
So a lot of times I get asked,
great, but how do I do that?

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:41.260
And one of the things
that I've started doing

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.070
is, I use email as a
form of incubation.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.306
Because most of the emails
I get are not important.

00:12:47.306 --> 00:12:48.350
No offense.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.227
But there are things like, come
to this address at this time.

00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:53.560
There are things like, hey
can you confirm this meeting?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.893
They're just little things
that I need to click through.

00:12:55.893 --> 00:12:57.430
They're not all that important.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.080
And so I turned on my phone.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.260
I turned off all of my
notifications around email.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.360
My email on my computer does
not automatically update.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.650
It does it when I do it.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.140
And I do it when I need
to take a little break,

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.911
when I need to feel
or look productive.

00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:13.660
And I need to take a
little bit of a break

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.270
and then I need to return
to what I'm working on.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.870
A lot of times
I'll write a piece.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.870
I'll write an article.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.940
Then I'll check email.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.370
Then I'll return to the article.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.870
And then if I have
enough time, if I

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.330
didn't wait till
the last minute,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.746
I'll actually print it out,
wait a day, and read it again.

00:13:26.746 --> 00:13:30.240
But most of the time it's
write it, email, proof read it.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.340
And I find that it
actually sort of works.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.880
You get newer ways
to phrase things

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.996
just by taking that
little bit of time off.

00:13:35.996 --> 00:13:37.870
So the question isn't
sit under an apple tree

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.245
and wait for
something to happen.

00:13:39.245 --> 00:13:41.660
The question is, how can I
structure into my workflow

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.710
these actual periods
of incubation?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.294
Now I know what some
people are doing.

00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:47.543
They're looking at the fourth
and fifth egg and going,

00:13:47.543 --> 00:13:49.430
OK, I already want to
know what those are.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.180
You're the same
people who wanted

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.600
to know about the circles.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.170
It's the fourth and fifth egg.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.378
Evaluation, you actually
have to judge whether or not

00:13:54.378 --> 00:13:55.430
the idea is good.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.550
And then you have
to elaborate on it.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.646
You have two
externalize it, you have

00:13:57.646 --> 00:13:58.585
to bring it out into the world.

00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:00.480
All right, so those are
all parts of the process.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.063
But what I think is
really interesting

00:14:02.063 --> 00:14:03.780
are stages two and
three because most

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.590
of the time those are not
in our normal work rhythm.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.240
We don't actually
work in this idea

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.880
of how can I incubate
to get better ideas.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.582
So one of the other
myths that I think

00:14:13.582 --> 00:14:15.540
is particularly devastating
is this breed myth.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.520
I joked about it earlier with
my Near Eastern guru barista.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.420
But a lot of times
when we describe

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.850
creativity or creative
people we say things like,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.820
oh, they're just
naturally a good whatever.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.239
Which is sort of a damaging
thing for two reasons.

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.780
Assuming it were
true would be great.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.760
But it's not.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.850
It's damaging for two reasons
because what you're doing

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.650
is you're essentially,
presumably,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.410
taking yourself off the hook.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.980
They're just a natural blank.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.700
I'm not.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.110
Therefore I don't
have to work hard.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.740
The other thing
you're doing is you're

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.200
insulting that person because
they worked ridiculously

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.200
hard to get to the point
where you called them

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.830
a natural, which is
a little insulting.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.190
And we've tried hard to
verify this breed myth.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.940
We've looked at a lot
of different places.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.856
We looked at genetics.

00:15:03.856 --> 00:15:05.370
We looked at personality.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.340
Personality essentially, there
are five personality traits,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.080
the Big Five.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.020
And we've tried to
correlate every type

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.780
of creative expression
to personality types.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.360
Can't do it.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.340
Actually, one of the Big Five is
called openness to experience.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.840
And that correlates a little
bit, which kind of makes sense.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.798
If you're open to new
ideas and new experiences

00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:22.822
you'll be more creative.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:23.530
That makes sense.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.170
The rest of them
don't correlate.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.485
Introverts are just as creative
as extroverts, All of that.

00:15:28.485 --> 00:15:30.520
And the other thing we
tried to do is genetics.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.450
We've looked at studies of
identical and fraternal twins.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.780
We've compared them to each
other, to the baselines.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.370
We can't find
anything that suggests

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.100
there's a creativity
gene or creativity

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.230
combination of genes.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.680
The way that I describe
it is that nature has yet

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.730
to disprove nurture.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.000
But some of us still love to
believe in the idea of nature,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.730
because if somebody
drew an incredibly

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.600
creative genetic hand and
I didn't, I'm off the hook.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.106
It's over.

00:15:57.106 --> 00:15:58.480
And I think this
also has lessons

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.730
for how we perceive
interactions with other people.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.230
Because if we think that some
people are naturally creative,

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.884
when we need an idea
who do we gravitate to?

00:16:05.884 --> 00:16:07.550
But who do we need
to be gravitating to?

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.690
Probably everybody.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.770
And especially the people
who aren't necessarily

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.770
experts in that field.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.880
And we'll talk about
that in a little bit.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.464
But first, let's take a pause
around this expertise idea.

00:16:18.464 --> 00:16:20.130
One of the things I
think is interesting

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.380
is, expertise is sort
of a double edged sword.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.590
Because there's this idea around
originality and creativity,

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.539
that creative ideas are
incredibly original.

00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:31.080
And so if they're
incredibly original

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.640
then you need tons of outsiders
and you need no experts.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.810
And that's not actually true
because almost all new ideas

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.650
are combinations of
preexisting ideas.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.740
In no place is this more
aware than in software, right?

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.120
It's why we have so many
intellectual property

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.529
debates, is where is the line
between copying and infringing

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:52.570
and true original things.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.240
But we see it everywhere.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.200
Anybody in here a
fan of "Star Wars"?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.800
I know, it's sort
of a trick question.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.110
I know, I know.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.020
So "Star Wars" is an incredibly
wonderful combination

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.200
of Joseph Campbell's "Hero
with a Thousand Faces"

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.730
mono-myth plot line, some
Akira Kurosawa samurai films,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.400
some spaghetti
westerns, and then

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.319
a couple "Flash Gordon"
and "Sinbad" movies

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.780
thrown in just for good measure.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.377
A lot of people say it this
way, it's a total remix.

00:17:18.377 --> 00:17:20.460
And that's OK, because
it's a very original remix.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.940
And it's a very wonderful set.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.869
And it's probably going to be
ruined with the next three.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.599
But whatever, right?

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.760
The original one is still
a great combination.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.710
We do this in music
all of the time.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.500
We do this in literature
all of the time.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.990
Mark Twain actually
has this amazing quote

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.510
about how the entire
concept of plagiarism

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.814
is a farce because no writer
just sat down and wrote

00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:45.480
and came up with
anything worth reading.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.396
Instead they studied all
sorts of other works.

00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:49.770
And they incorporated
different ideas and techniques.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.480
And their voice is really
just an original combination

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.662
of their influences.

00:17:54.662 --> 00:17:56.370
Music, I think, at
least has a little bit

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.500
of intellectual honesty
around this idea.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.660
Because you can ask a musician,
who are your influences.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.280
And that's code for who did
you listen to a lot of times

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.910
and who did you copy.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.860
And that's OK as
long as you copy too.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.750
I teach college so one
source is plagiarism

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.023
but multiple, that's
just research.

00:18:13.023 --> 00:18:14.660
Right?

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.747
So it's cool.

00:18:15.747 --> 00:18:17.330
It's about those
sort of combinations.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.871
And what I find is
really interesting

00:18:18.871 --> 00:18:21.370
is your brain is actually
wired to do this.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:25.050
Your brain is
designed to combine.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.140
So your brain is essentially
two fundamental structures.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.970
And this, I have to apologize to
a gentleman named Rex Young who

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.910
I borrowed a lot
of insights from

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.850
and probably ruined with
gross oversimplifications.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.110
Because he is a neuroscientist
and a neurosurgeon.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.260
And I'm a management
professor and a writer.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.810
So I'm probably not describing
this perfectly but it works.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.370
So your brain essentially
has two things, gray matter

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:50.680
and white matter.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.500
Gray matter is that
spongy stuff we

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.580
think about when we
think about thoughts.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.800
It's kind of what
we think about when

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.500
we look at an image like this.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.224
And gray matter is where
your thoughts are stored.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:02.890
But then there's this
other white matter

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.850
that's like strings,
almost like wires and cords

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.100
that connect all these
different things.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.320
And the way that
your brain works

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.540
is by connecting different
areas of gray matter

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.032
in different times.

00:19:14.032 --> 00:19:15.490
One of the most
interesting things.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.030
If you ever read an
article that says,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.830
oh, we have found the
spot in your brain

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.300
responsible for blank.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.770
That will be proven out of
date within the next 10 years.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.186
Because what we're
finding is it's

00:19:26.186 --> 00:19:27.780
not about this little area.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.900
It's about combinations
of areas in your brain

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.496
that light up because
of the white matter.

00:19:32.496 --> 00:19:34.120
And right down the
center of your brain

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.703
is a thing called
the corpus callosum.

00:19:35.703 --> 00:19:39.940
And it is the thickest area
of white matter in your brain.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.900
And it's the reason we
thought about this left brain,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.570
right brain thing, and why
they need it to communicate.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.764
In truth that whole analogy
is coming out of vogue,

00:19:49.764 --> 00:19:52.430
because we're understanding that
this white matter is incredibly

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.790
important.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.990
Because the white matter
connects different ideas.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.602
So if the gray matter
is what you think,

00:19:57.602 --> 00:19:59.310
the white matter is
almost how you think,

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.920
because it's the connections.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.350
Now this is why if you've ever
lost your train of thought

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.130
and you try and
redo it, you feel

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.365
like you're zig zagging
all over the place.

00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:10.240
It's because your brain
doesn't think linear.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.760
It thinks in connections.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.130
This can also be
used to your benefit.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.640
Has anybody watched the
BBC version of "Sherlock"

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.930
where the mind palace
idea comes from?

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.180
It basically comes from
connecting a visual image

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.200
of a house to something
you want to remember.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.801
It's not like it's stored right
next to it in the gray matter.

00:20:29.801 --> 00:20:31.300
It's that the white
matter is firing

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.760
in that right combination.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.480
So our brain is actually
wired to combine.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.180
And this, I think, has
incredible implications

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.110
for you.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.630
What are you consuming?

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.900
What are you putting in there?

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.650
The more and the more diverse
an amount of gray matter

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.500
you're putting in,
and the more you're

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.580
experimenting with
original new combinations

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.610
of that gray matter, the
more your white matter

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.010
could be growing.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.090
We don't actually
know for sure, but we

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.390
do think that white
matter is very elastic

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.960
and it can grow over
time with expertise.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.150
There's actually a
factual error in my book.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.810
Because before it was published
we thought that Albert

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.540
Einstein's brain looked
like everybody else's.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.030
And now we actually know
from some photos of his brain

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.780
that was, against his wishes,
taken out of him after he died.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.320
We know from photos that he
had a very, very thick corpus

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:19.820
collasum.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.050
He had an unnatural
amount of white matter.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.444
We don't know if he was born
with it or if he grew it.

00:21:25.444 --> 00:21:27.110
The evidence is leaning
towards the idea

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.030
that you can actually grow
additional white matter

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.530
connections.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.040
You can strengthen
those connections

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.380
the more you play around
with combining ideas.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.600
And I think this has
interesting implications

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.410
because the other side of the
coin of this expertise thing

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.210
is what I actually
call the expert myth.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.442
That when we have a problem
we need to seek out experts.

00:21:45.442 --> 00:21:46.900
We need to seek
out people who have

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.630
studied the most in their field.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.050
And it's generally a good
idea, but it turns out,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.840
it kind of falls
apart over time.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.430
In essence what happens,
we've studied the careers

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.219
of lots of different creative
professionals, playwrights.

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:02.760
There's a joke in
physics that if you

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.635
don't do Nobel Prize
winning work by the time

00:22:04.635 --> 00:22:08.797
you're 30 you should just
retire at least from research.

00:22:08.797 --> 00:22:11.130
And it's kind of funny because
the aforementioned Albert

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.815
Einstein won the Nobel Prize
at 46, but for a paper that

00:22:14.815 --> 00:22:16.380
was published at 26.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.710
And if you look at the ages
of when publications that

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.324
won the Nobel Prize
in physics were,

00:22:20.324 --> 00:22:22.490
the ages of the authors
when they were published it,

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.780
actually does sort of
aggregate around 30.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.614
There's some truth to the joke.

00:22:27.614 --> 00:22:29.030
What's going on
here is that a lot

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.880
of times as your expertise
goes up your creative output

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.240
can actually go down.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.950
It can look like an inverted U
instead of just an ever rising

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.790
screen.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.530
The reason for
this, we think, is

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.030
that there's two
parts to an idea.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.880
Remember there's coming
up with the insight.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.920
We call that an ideation rate.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.740
And then there's also evaluating
it and elaborating on that.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.800
We can call that an
elaboration rate.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.450
And as your expertise grows
your ideation rate does go up.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.150
But you're elaboration
rate goes down.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.970
If you study the careers in
a variety of different fields

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:02.300
of creative individuals,
their elaboration rate

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.450
goes down over time.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.200
What we think is
essentially happening is,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.980
as they're coming up with ideas
they're coming up with reasons

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.747
why not to even bother
trying that idea.

00:23:10.747 --> 00:23:13.330
I have all of this expertise so
I know it's not going to work.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.540
It was a fun idea but it's not
going to work and here's why.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.490
And what happens,
I think, in physics

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.919
or in any other field like that,
is that you know around that 30

00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:24.460
time you just got
out of grad school,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.380
maybe you're in a post-doc.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.710
You're playing around
with new ideas.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.668
You have enough expertise
to be able to come up

00:23:28.668 --> 00:23:31.770
with new combinations
of ideas, but not enough

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.190
to know it'll never work.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.850
So you test it.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.080
And most of the time
you waste your time.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.670
But every once in a
while you find something

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.710
nobody else bothered to test.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.910
And we fly you to Scandinavia.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.120
We give you a metal.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.850
We tell you you're amazing.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.460
We see this all of the time.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.960
And I think this is
not a death sentence.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.600
I don't believe
that this is always,

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.070
everyone who has
more expertise always

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.547
has their creative
output go down.

00:23:58.547 --> 00:23:59.630
Earlier I talked about it.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.985
Expertise is a vital part
of that creative process.

00:24:02.985 --> 00:24:05.610
But I think the key is to really
take a look at our influences,

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.132
to be someone like Paul Erdos.

00:24:08.132 --> 00:24:09.590
Does anyone know
who Paul Erdos is?

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.880
Do I have any
mathematicians in the room?

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.200
Do You have an Erdos number?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.792
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:12.792 --> 00:24:13.500
DAVID BURKUS: No?

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.375
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:15.660
DAVID BURKUS: No, no, no.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.970
So he and I just had a
conversation, none of you

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.440
know what we're talking about.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.722
So let me elaborate.

00:24:19.722 --> 00:24:21.180
So an Erdos number
is essentially--

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.870
Paul Erdos has more peer review
publications than anyone ever.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.940
We lost count around 1,500.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.030
I have like 12.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.090
He's 1,500.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.200
20 will get your tenure
anywhere you want.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.190
20 in reputable
journals, I should say.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.590
1,500, and the reason was the
man was an intellectual nomad.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:40.405
So he would study in his field.

00:24:40.405 --> 00:24:41.780
And he'd read a
paper by somebody

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.970
who was in a different subset.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.340
And he would show up, usually
at the office or sometimes

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.530
the house, of the
author of that paper.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.604
And he would say
"my brain is open."

00:24:50.604 --> 00:24:52.520
He actually has a biography
written about him.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.570
It's that title,
"My Brain is Open."

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.710
And he would move in to
the office, sometimes

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.202
into the house, of that person.

00:24:58.202 --> 00:24:59.410
And they would work together.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.390
And they would share insights.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.430
They would publish
a couple papers.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.580
Then when he got bored
he would move on again.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.790
So as a result, what you
have is an Erdos number.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.180
What you have is a number
that represents how close you

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.197
are to have published
with Paul Erdos.

00:25:10.197 --> 00:25:12.530
If you have an Erdos number
one, you published with him.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.821
Two, you published with
someone who published with him.

00:25:14.821 --> 00:25:18.650
It's like "Six Degrees of
Kevin Bacon", but for nerds.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.580
Actually, "Six Degrees
of Kevin Bacon"

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.210
is also for nerds, just
a different kind of nerd.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.375
So Paul Erdos is sort of
this intellectual nomad

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:28.750
that is constantly
moving around.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.541
And I think we can take
that same approach,

00:25:30.541 --> 00:25:32.300
but so often we don't.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.940
Our area of expertise
is really comfortable.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.340
And to admit that we don't
have an expertise somewhere

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.480
and begin to study that
is really uncomfortable.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.100
It takes a lot of guts to show
up at the door of someone else.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.140
Especially-- think about
when Paul Erdos arrived

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.380
at, oh I don't know,
600 publications.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.010
Think about the
kind of courage it

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.250
takes to show up at the office
of somebody with maybe six,

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.020
but is doing new stuff.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.570
And to say, I want
to learn from you.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.800
That takes a lot of
courage to admit that like,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.890
I'm not going to play
this comfortable expertise

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.930
card that I have
developed over time.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.710
I'm going to take on this
beginner's mindset all over

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.370
again.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.860
And I think so often we
don't do that, but we can.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.730
And when we do that, we think
back to the originality myth.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.450
We fill our mind
with more gray matter

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.200
and more potential connections.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.190
So we fill our mind
with more raw material

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.700
to make combinations out of it.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.430
But it takes a little
bit of courage.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.990
Now, one other way that
you can get really good

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.480
in a very short period of
time, like Paul Erdos did,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.880
is by collaborating.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.110
And we live in a world
that's getting better

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.890
at collaboration.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.370
But we still tell ourselves what
I call the Lone Creator Story.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.880
We tell ourselves stories
about Thomas Edison.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.216
Thomas Edison invented the---

00:26:43.216 --> 00:26:44.090
AUDIENCE: Light bulb.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:45.230
DAVID BURKUS: Sort of.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.685
Some people are like, I
know it's a trick question

00:26:46.685 --> 00:26:48.930
so I'm just going to sit
there and shake my head.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:49.790
Thomas Edison did.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.820
He was the 22nd or
23rd-- depending

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.035
on how you count-- person
to invent the light bulb.

00:26:55.035 --> 00:26:58.012
Not bad, not bad, right.

00:26:58.012 --> 00:26:59.720
His patent for the
light bulb is actually

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.630
called improvements
in electric lights.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.770
So at least he, like,
even he admitted it.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.380
But when we think
about Thomas Edison,

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.449
think about his great story
about trying thousands of times

00:27:09.449 --> 00:27:10.740
to try out different filaments.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.614
What do you envision?

00:27:11.614 --> 00:27:15.800
You picture Thomas Edison alone
in a room somewhere trying out

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.530
lots of little different fibers.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.920
But it didn't happen
like that all.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.380
I would submit to you that
Thomas Edison's greatest

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.110
invention was actually
his Menlo Park workshop.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:30.210
He had some of his initial funds
from patents in the telegraph

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:30.710
industry.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.251
And he used that to
build a workshop.

00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:36.204
And he invited sort of, Thomas
Edison the Super Friends.

00:27:36.204 --> 00:27:38.120
They actually called
themselves the "Muckers",

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.310
but that feels
like a dirty word.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.755
So I prefer Thomas Edison
and the Super Friends.

00:27:42.755 --> 00:27:44.130
So he invites all
of his friends.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.380
And there are about 15
to 20 people in there

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.630
at any given time, working
on lots of different stuff.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.970
Most of them
actually share space

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.440
on the patents, their name
space on the patent with Thomas

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.136
Edison.

00:27:55.136 --> 00:27:56.760
Some of them worked
on their own stuff.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.250
Some of them worked on
projects outside of Edison.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.166
But eventually they
actually kind of found out

00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:04.580
that the money was in promoting
this myth of Thomas Edison.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.060
Thomas Edison became
the marketing mouthpiece

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.960
of this broader organization.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.480
So they basically found a way
to take advantage of two things.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.460
That we love this lone
creator story and that

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.060
we all benefit
from collaboration.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.970
Now sadly the damaging
thing they did

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.590
is they propagated
this lone creator myth.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.257
But they're also, if
you know the truth,

00:28:24.257 --> 00:28:26.381
they're a testament to this
power of collaboration.

00:28:26.381 --> 00:28:28.640
And there's a lot of
researchers that are doing work

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.670
showing, OK, so we know
collaboration works.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.994
But how do we do this?

00:28:31.994 --> 00:28:33.660
What's the right level
of collaboration?

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.570
And one of my
favorites is a study

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.750
by two guys, Brian
Uzzi and Jarrett Spiro.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.590
Sorry, not "Uzi",
Uzzi, like the gun.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.570
I had the opportunity to talk
to Brian a little while ago

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.079
much more in depth
about his study.

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:47.870
And I learned that I've
been mispronouncing

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.060
his name for several years.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.970
But anyway, so their
study looked at Broadway,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.990
because Broadway is an
interesting ecosystem.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.510
To put on a Broadway show
you need six people in you're

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.945
senior leadership team.

00:28:59.945 --> 00:29:01.870
You need a composer, a
librettist, a lyricist,

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.425
a choreographer, a
director, and a producer.

00:29:04.425 --> 00:29:06.550
You don't have to know what
all of those things do,

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.479
but you need all six of them.

00:29:08.479 --> 00:29:10.020
And so at any given
time you can have

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.185
a show that has all six people
who have worked together before

00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:14.950
or have been totally new.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.420
So you think about red,
all new connections,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.512
and black, all old connections.

00:29:21.512 --> 00:29:23.470
So you can have people
who have worked together

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.300
on projects before and
be incredibly successful.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.175
They're a super team.

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:28.960
Or you can have a team of
total newbies and strangers.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.310
Now which team would you
want to put your money on?

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.800
Let's number them.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.550
So like a scale of one to five.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.050
You want to put
your money on one?

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.595
You want to put
your money on five?

00:29:40.595 --> 00:29:41.269
of course not.

00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:42.560
You know it's a trick question.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.010
How many people want to
put their money on three?

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.850
You're also wrong.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.446
2.6, that's how
you know it's true.

00:29:51.446 --> 00:29:53.320
That's how you know they
did proper analysis.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.290
It didn't magically
work out to be three.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:56.370
2.6.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.920
So what they found is
that in any given year--

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.490
essentially this
2.6 number is what

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.840
they call small world quotient.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.760
And it's representative of how
many different combinations

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.066
in the entire year for
Broadway that they had.

00:30:07.066 --> 00:30:08.940
They found that the
best years for Broadway

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.990
were when if you graphed this
phenomenon, you arrive at a 2.6

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.301
on a scale of one to five.

00:30:14.301 --> 00:30:15.800
And so I said earlier
I had a chance

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.590
to talk to Brian
about this study.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.590
And one of the questions
that I asked him was,

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.020
hey, I've read about
your study before

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.610
and I'm not the first
person to write about it.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.540
What's the most frustrating
thing about your study

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.104
that people, when they write
about it, that people do?

00:30:33.104 --> 00:30:34.520
He said the most
frustrating thing

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.860
is that people assume that
means we need 2.6 teams, right.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.200
We need teams that are at 2.6.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.910
Our study is not about that.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.560
Our study is about
something much broader.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.490
Because they didn't
graph the team.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.285
They graphed the network.

00:30:49.285 --> 00:30:51.250
So at any given
year for Broadway

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.640
we give it a score
of a 2.6 and it's

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.830
going to be one of
the better years.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.672
And that's a really
interesting ramification

00:30:57.672 --> 00:30:59.630
because here's the thing
if you think about it.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.580
A 2.6 team doesn't stay
a 2.6 team for very long.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.620
You can arrive at building a
2.6 team, a great combination

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.330
of old colleagues
and new fresh ideas.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.090
But it won't stay that way.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.150
Eventually it'll
devolve into a one

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.720
as people get too experienced.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.860
So the question isn't how do
you find and build a 2.6 team.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.640
It's how do you build a network
that allows a 2.6 team to form,

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.600
and then at the
right moment disband.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.308
The beautiful thing
about a Broadway show

00:31:26.308 --> 00:31:29.040
is that if it's not "Cats"
it will eventually end.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.060
And those connections,
those ideas, they

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.110
will all go to a different show.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.729
So how do you
structure a company,

00:31:34.729 --> 00:31:36.270
how do you structure
an organization,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.728
how do you structure
a society that

00:31:37.728 --> 00:31:41.070
allows for those connections
to be made and then disband

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.020
after the mission is complete?

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.750
Now that's an
interesting question.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.660
And we could think about it
at an organizational level.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.951
How do we do this in a company?

00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:50.440
But I think much easier
and much more important

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.300
is to think about it on
your own individual level.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.710
Are you currently
in a network that

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.110
allows for you to form
a 2.6 team around people

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.330
when you have a need?

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.661
When you need an insight do
you go to the same six people?

00:32:03.661 --> 00:32:05.160
Or do you have a
network that allows

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.190
you to tap some people who
have no experience in the field

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.690
and you don't really even know
all that well and some people

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.190
who are old friends?

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.240
Most of us, I would argue,
go to the old friends,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.822
go to the people
we know, we trust.

00:32:16.822 --> 00:32:18.780
Even inside an organization,
we have a problem,

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.864
we go to the person
we know we trust.

00:32:20.864 --> 00:32:22.280
Most of us don't
think about, hmm,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.349
I need a 2.6 team around me.

00:32:24.349 --> 00:32:26.640
So I think that's a really
interesting question to sort

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.550
of audit your own life,
your work life, career with.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.690
Is am I in a network,
a small world network,

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.250
as Uzzi and Spiro would call it?

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:38.060
That allows for 2.6 teams to be
formed and disbanded properly.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.210
Now, you can do all
of this stuff right

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.242
and still not get it.

00:32:44.242 --> 00:32:46.200
The most devastating
story, I talked about this

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.570
a little bit earlier, that
I think we tell ourselves,

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.540
is the story that I call
the Mousetrap story,

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.700
the Mousetrap myth.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.991
And it's taken from this
phrase-- you've all heard it--

00:32:54.991 --> 00:32:56.367
if you build a
better mousetrap--

00:32:56.367 --> 00:32:57.741
AUDIENCE: The
world will beat a--

00:32:57.741 --> 00:33:00.020
DAVID BURKUS: The world will
beat a path to your door.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.170
It's a catchy saying, right.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:06.090
It's total rubbish,
total rubbish.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.450
The actual mousetrap, right.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.620
So everybody
picture a mousetrap.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.290
Picture a mousetrap.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.500
You're picturing a wooden board,
a metal spring, some cheese,

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.340
because there's always
free cheese in a mousetrap.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:22.010
You're picturing a device
that was invented in 1899.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.820
And every year since then
400 patent applications

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.930
come in to the US Patent Office
for new and better, supposedly

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:29.875
better, mousetraps.

00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:31.250
Some of them
actually are better.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.750
About 20 of them
have been developed

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.820
into commercially
viable products.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.900
You call an exterminator,
they will not

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.310
bring spring loaded mousetraps.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.140
You'll buy them.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.230
But they won't bring them.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.790
Maybe it's that expertise
thing, who knows.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.700
But you're picturing something
that was invented in 1899.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.980
Interestingly enough, this
is a total coincidence

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.880
but it's a fun one.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.770
In 1899 Charles Duell, the
chief of the US Patent Office,

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.450
actually told the government
we should close up shop.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.340
Nothing new is going
to be invented.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.510
Those both happened in 1899.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.880
What's going on here?

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.600
Why does this happen?

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.040
We live in-- you
live, we live, I

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.060
live in the middle
coast of America.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:14.360
But you all live in a valley
built on the idea of so and so

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.480
invented it, didn't develop
it, somebody else did.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.449
I drove by the
Computer History Museum

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.199
and it's basically that story.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:25.429
The same thing happens in
a variety of other fields.

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:29.889
And great ideas get
rejected all the time.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.889
My favorite example,
actually, comes from music.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:34.039
Anyone a fan of Igor Stravinsky?

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:35.580
I have a two-year-old
son which means

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.246
that I watch a lot a
"Little Einsteins."

00:34:37.246 --> 00:34:40.520
Which means I am now a
fan of Igor Stravinsky.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.900
Igor Stravinsky's
greatest work was what?

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.900
"The Rite of Spring."

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.370
How many people have heard
"The Rite of Spring"?

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.270
Actually, all of
you, because I'm

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.650
going to guess at some
point you watched Fantasia.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.935
And it's in there.

00:34:53.935 --> 00:34:55.560
"The Rite of Spring"
is famous not just

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.018
for shifting the history of
ballet and musical composition.

00:34:58.018 --> 00:35:01.360
It's famous for causing not
one, but two riots on it's

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.170
opening night in Paris.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.120
So the show went on.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.540
It was very different from a
traditional ballet at the time.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.420
Some people loved it.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.020
Other people hated
it, loathed it.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.880
And those people
began to argue, didn't

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.730
wait to go out for
coffee afterwards

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.230
and discuss the pros and cons.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.740
They started arguing while
the show was going on.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.350
Arguments turned
into shouting, turned

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.800
into pushing and shoving,
turned into fistfights,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.830
turned into riots.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.170
Parisian police
actually storm in,

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.520
separate out the two parties.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.770
And then on with the show.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:31.574
I have no idea why.

00:35:31.574 --> 00:35:33.490
Brief intermission, and
then on with the show.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:34.740
Same thing happens.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.890
Stravinsky, himself,
actually fled

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.300
the theater, feared
for his life,

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.460
never got to see the
curtain close on what

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.070
would become his
most famous piece.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.330
History is filled
with great ideas.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.080
They get rejected.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.371
They get rejected all the time.

00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:48.910
There are the
literal mousetraps,

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.410
and there are
metaphorical mousetraps.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.249
What's happening is that for
an idea to be innovative,

00:35:54.249 --> 00:35:55.790
for it to be a
disruptive innovation,

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.360
for it to be a great
idea, it has to be new

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.730
and it has to be useful.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.360
And it turns out we're really
bad at reconciling those two

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.710
things.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.990
Because if something
is new, by definition,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.590
it diverts from the status quo.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.690
But if something we
want to judge is useful,

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.660
what do we rely on to
judge whether or not

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.540
something is useful?

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.385
Status quo, older ideas,
our past expertise.

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:19.760
This is that
expertise myth, sort

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.730
of all over again, but
on a societal level.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.040
And what you get, what we
find in research, especially

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.900
in times of uncertainty and
in situations of uncertainty,

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.210
we may say we love new ideas.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.020
But we will always
cling to the comfort

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.360
of what appears to be useful.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.130
And so on the surface we
say, I hear this all the time

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:38.290
from organizations.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:40.919
You can title a book about how
companies generate great ideas.

00:36:40.919 --> 00:36:41.710
And people read it.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.251
Then you give them
this last chapter,

00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:45.290
mousetrap myth thing
about, it's not actually

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:47.100
about generating great ideas.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.620
Odds are your people
are already doing that.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.270
It's about how bad we
all are at recognizing

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:53.934
the great ideas
that are coming out.

00:36:53.934 --> 00:36:55.600
And there are a bunch
of different tools

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.567
that you can use.

00:36:56.567 --> 00:36:58.900
So there are companies that
have internal stock markets.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.316
And there are other
companies that

00:37:00.316 --> 00:37:03.360
allow for a little,
sort of, hackathons.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.550
There are other companies that
allow for sort of a burn fund.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.550
We know we can lose this
much money on new stuff

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.040
and we'll just write it off.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.390
And I don't want to talk
about the techniques

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.050
because the
techniques are great,

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:17.090
but unless we actually talk
about the psychological bias we

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:19.110
all have against great ideas.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.140
It's sort of like an
Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.710
Call it Creatives Anonymous.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:27.140
Hi I'm Dave and I have a
bias against great new ideas.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.449
And until you actually
become aware of that bias,

00:37:29.449 --> 00:37:31.240
and when you're presented
with a new idea--

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.990
even if it's something small--
until you become aware of it

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.910
and you realize that I am
evaluating this idea based

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.610
on my past experiences and that
might not be the right thing.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:45.140
Until you come to that we
run into a big problem.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.300
See I talked earlier about, you
have a Kindergarten classroom.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.629
25 kids, they're all creative.

00:37:49.629 --> 00:37:51.170
They get to college,
two of them are.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:53.040
And even they're cheating.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.410
So what is it that
happens in those years?

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.680
It's not necessarily
the education system.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.980
We can tweak the education
system all we want.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.000
It's that we as
people, when we're

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.930
evaluating the ideas of
these kids who are coming up,

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.771
we are suffering this bias.

00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:09.270
And they get a new
idea that doesn't

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.240
jive with our status quo.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.380
And we say, that's
a terrible idea.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.510
Maybe it's a good idea.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.929
Maybe it's a good idea
for where that person is.

00:38:17.929 --> 00:38:19.220
And then we graduate into work.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.090
And, by the way, it's not
all that different, right?

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.300
I used to get a report card.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.055
Now I get a
performance evaluation.

00:38:25.055 --> 00:38:25.930
It's the same system.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:26.910
The letters changed.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.240
That's about it.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.035
The competencies might change.

00:38:30.035 --> 00:38:31.950
I haven't had to solve
for x in a long time.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.890
But that's because
of where I work.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.640
So the competencies
change, but it's still

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.540
an evaluation system.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.410
It's an evaluation
system based on this idea

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.590
that our old experiences
define what good looks like.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.090
And when you present
a new idea that

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.950
doesn't jive with
our old experiences

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.994
it's not going to work,
until, of course, it does.

00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:50.660
See the beautiful
thing that, the lesson

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:55.290
that I like to really
emphasize in the mousetrap myth

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.090
is that you all heard
"The Rite of Spring."

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.570
You all, presumably, have
used a personal computer,

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.130
another great idea that
got rejected at first.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.930
You all have used
a digital camera.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.160
That got rejected by the
people that developed it.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.950
How may people have
been to Disneyland?

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:14.710
That was rejected
301 times for a loan.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.300
Legend says.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.008
I actually had a hard
time sourcing that.

00:39:17.008 --> 00:39:19.504
But it's too good
to not be true.

00:39:19.504 --> 00:39:21.420
So you all have presumably
been to Disneyland.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.640
All of these great ideas
that are truly great

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.600
eventually persist.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.420
And so I think the
best place to begin--

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.700
there's a much broader
long term discussion

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.325
we need to have about structure
and organizations in societies.

00:39:33.325 --> 00:39:36.050
But the best place to begin is
if you've ever had a great idea

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.940
and it got rejected, take heart.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.612
You're in really good company.

00:39:40.612 --> 00:39:42.320
You're in the company
of Igor Stravinsky.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.861
You're in the company
of Walt Disney.

00:39:43.861 --> 00:39:46.370
You're in the company of people
who eventually did actually

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:47.210
arrive at that.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.910
So take heart.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.701
Know that they're doing that
with-- they had that bias.

00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:51.450
They're suffering.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:52.390
It's their problem.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.610
But at the same time
realize this means

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.706
I need to work on mine too.

00:39:57.706 --> 00:39:59.080
Because most of
the organizations

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.250
that I talk to start
with this idea of how do

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.230
we get more great ideas.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.670
And for most of them the
truth is all the same.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.585
We don't need more great ideas.

00:40:07.585 --> 00:40:09.900
We just need to get
better at recognizing

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.940
the great ideas we already have.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.050
We need to tell
ourselves that story.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.050
We need to make sure
that that idea spreads.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.210
So thank you so much.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.430
I know we covered a ton of
different stuff in this.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.080
And there's a lot of different
ideas to spread and myths

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.260
we need to rewrite.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.000
But we also covered
a ton of stuff.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.480
And I want to know what
questions do you have for me.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.980
AUDIENCE: So is
this your next book?

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.171
Or how do we get
better at recognizing

00:40:31.171 --> 00:40:32.670
the ideas that we've
already gotten?

00:40:38.141 --> 00:40:40.140
DAVID BURKUS: So I talk
about a couple companies

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.265
that are really good at it.

00:40:41.265 --> 00:40:42.980
My favorite in the
book is a company

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.270
called Right Solutions that
actually has an idea stock

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.090
market.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.989
So you can basically
invest in virtual currency

00:40:48.989 --> 00:40:51.530
and different ideas that people
post on this internal market.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.710
And that doesn't
necessarily counteract

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.310
our psychological bias.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:59.280
But it sort of spreads out
the pain of being wrong.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.337
If I green light an idea and
it cost me 10 virtual dollars.

00:41:02.337 --> 00:41:03.920
And it turns out to
be a terrible one,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.310
I didn't lose much.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.310
But as you think about
a traditional hierarchy

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:09.770
organization, the higher up
you go in an organization,

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:12.950
the more-- let's be honest--
the more your job is just

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.140
to not get fired.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.500
You get to that top, top level.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.052
And this is pretty sweet.

00:41:17.052 --> 00:41:19.260
You think about-- the Fortune
500 list just came out.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.451
Every Fortune 500 CEO is
like, this is a sweet gig.

00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:23.450
I don't want to lose it.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.090
So I don't want
to take big risks.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.090
That's the sort of
psychological thing, I think,

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.330
that's behind much
more empirically proven

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.940
concepts like Clay Christensen's
"Innovator's Dilemma."

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.404
We're just trying
to not get fired.

00:41:33.404 --> 00:41:35.320
In marketing there's a
saying that nobody ever

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.900
got fired for running
a Super Bowl ad.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.889
It's good advice.

00:41:38.889 --> 00:41:40.180
If you don't want to get fired.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.350
If you want to do a
disruptive innovation,

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.100
you got to think a
little bit differently.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:50.640
So it's actually not the next
book because I wish I knew.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.740
I'm hoping to start a
much bigger conversation.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.110
And maybe it's the third
book because there's

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.654
a lot more talk that
needs to happen.

00:41:55.654 --> 00:41:57.820
I will say there is some
interesting work by Everett

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.420
Rogers.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.010
He's actually the
guy that came up

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.791
with the diffusion
of innovation curve.

00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:03.290
And he has some
interesting research

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.600
on-- there are five
factors that ideas,

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.250
that make it all the way
through that curve, all share.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:12.109
And so it's kind of a good guide
of when you have this idea,

00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:13.400
does it have these five things.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.941
Well, then maybe I
should green light

00:42:14.941 --> 00:42:16.137
even if it says it's crazy.

00:42:16.137 --> 00:42:18.095
And so those things are,
is it easily try-able?

00:42:20.657 --> 00:42:22.240
Even if it diverts
from the status quo

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.448
can you see the connection
between what you use to do

00:42:24.448 --> 00:42:25.990
and what you do now?

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.750
Are the results
easily observable?

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.870
So can the improvement
be seen really easily

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.180
or does it take forever?

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.530
And I'm blanking
on the other two.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.560
But they're there.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.127
So Everett Rogers is the
author of these five factors.

00:42:38.127 --> 00:42:39.960
I actually wrote a piece
about it for "99U."

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.510
And I'm blanking
on the other two.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.230
But that's OK.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.180
They're there.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.820
Why bother to remember
when Google can tell me?

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.760
AUDIENCE: So in
the Amazon reviews

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.690
that I peeked at
shortly before coming--

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.440
DAVID BURKUS: Wow.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.800
That's incredibly intimidating.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.500
OK.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.180
AUDIENCE: It's not bad.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:02.310
No, I saw some stuff about
the creativity process

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.550
at Pixar that you
had written about.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.310
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:07.101
DAVID BURKUS: Yeah.

00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:09.960
So I don't want to steal
too much of Ed's thunder.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.610
Ed Catmull just
wrote an amazing book

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:15.450
called "Creativity, Inc." that's
his, for lack of a better term,

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.254
opening up the kimono and
saying here's how we do it.

00:43:18.254 --> 00:43:19.670
And what's funny
is I tried really

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.245
hard to get more than what
had been previously written.

00:43:22.245 --> 00:43:23.870
But because Ed was
working on that book

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.090
I didn't really want to talk
to somebody else writing

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.000
about their process.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
But there's a lot that's
already readily shared.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.160
And the thing that I
think is most telling,

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.510
the most useful thing
I think about when

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.690
I think about the
process of Pixar's, Ed

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.940
is fond of always saying
that every film at Pixar

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.474
sucks when its first
idea comes out.

00:43:41.474 --> 00:43:42.890
And then they go
through a process

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.640
of going from suck to non-suck.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.400
And presumably when it
non-sucks enough they ship it.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.830
And that process is
actually using criticism.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.840
So there's a chapter
in the book that I

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.780
call the cohesive myth, because
we have this idea that it

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:59.280
always works out happy
go lucky, free food, all

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.890
that sort of stuff.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.820
And from an outside
perspective looking in,

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.290
you just feel like these
people never fight.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.030
Well, at Pixar they
fight all the time.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.880
They fight at these
things called dailies.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.090
They're not personal fights.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:11.977
But they are, I don't like
this about this frame.

00:44:11.977 --> 00:44:13.810
And the thing that Pixar
does a lot of times

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.240
is they steal from improv.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.140
Anybody ever taken
an improv class?

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.180
So first rule of improv,
always accept an offer.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.697
I always say yes and--.

00:44:21.697 --> 00:44:23.280
So they do this thing
called plussing,

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.830
where even if you're
criticizing you are building off

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.220
of that criticism
with a suggestion.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.790
So Even if you're criticizing
you're still staying positive.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:34.380
And when your complementing,
you're still building off of.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.272
The idea is you're
criticizing people.

00:44:36.272 --> 00:44:37.980
You're not doing the
compliment sandwich.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.410
Has anybody ever eaten
a compliment sandwich?

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:41.790
They don't taste good.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:43.970
You're not saying like,
here's an unrelated thing

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:44.600
you're good at.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.340
Here's where you suck.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.120
Here's an unrelated
thing you're good at.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.020
But it's this part sucks.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.460
And by the way, it's not you
suck, but this thing sucks.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.260
And here's my idea to fix it.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.230
And I accept or reject
that you can take it.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:58.770
But I accept that if
I'm going to criticize

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:02.930
I have an obligation to give you
a suggestion to make it better.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.680
Unfortunately I wrote
about this too much.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.990
I don't like to share it
because then when I criticize,

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.634
people look back at me and go
well, you owe me a plus now.

00:45:09.634 --> 00:45:11.550
You're under an obligation
to give me back it.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:12.770
And sometimes I just
don't have them,

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.559
because we're really
good at criticizing.

00:45:14.559 --> 00:45:16.600
But it takes time to really
get it into your head

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.891
that every time I'm going to
criticize something I also

00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:22.630
have to offer a solution,
or a potential solution.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.950
AUDIENCE: Have you witnessed
any meeting structures

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.840
or organization layouts,
they way they set up

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.990
the company, that
destroy creativity?

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.360
DAVID BURKUS: Hierarchy,
cubicles, lots of stuff.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.472
No, I mean, a particular one?

00:45:39.472 --> 00:45:41.305
I think one of the
really interesting things

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:44.080
is, I think what we have, and
this interestingly enough--

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.030
he ran off-- is the
subject of the next book.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:50.934
At least for me, is I
think we have, in general,

00:45:50.934 --> 00:45:53.600
a philosophy of management and a
philosophy of leadership that's

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.120
based on making a car, or making
some product in an assembly

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.890
line format.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:03.902
And gradually, over time, some
more enlightened companies

00:46:03.902 --> 00:46:06.110
with multi-colored logos
have come to the realization

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:10.280
that you can't use
that stuff over here.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.102
But at a worldwide
level I don't think

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:13.560
we've gotten to
that awareness yet.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.630
And even inside
of those companies

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.540
I don't know that they've
gotten to the idea

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.500
that we need to
think about building

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.720
systems around the needs and
the capabilities of people

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.730
and not of the product.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.030
Because when you have a
knowledge work economy

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:28.719
your people are your product.

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:31.010
There's this phrase, our
people are our greatest asset.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.000
You've heard it?

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.160
I hate that phrase.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.840
I loathe it because assets
can be bought, sold.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.820
Assets have systems to control
them, to leverage their value.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.320
Your people are
your greatest source

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.000
of competitive advantage.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.500
And that's a much
different approach

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.875
because that's not something
you can buy, sell, and trade

00:46:45.875 --> 00:46:49.460
like a stock or a major
league baseball player.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:50.736
Those people might be assets.

00:46:50.736 --> 00:46:53.360
But normally our people are our
source of competitive advantage

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.318
or our source of ideas.

00:46:54.318 --> 00:46:58.290
And any system that doesn't
start with the idea of here

00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.060
are the people.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.510
And now based on what
we know about the needs

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.660
and capabilities
of people, we'll

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.070
build the system around them.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.280
I wish I could say this system
is bad and this one's great.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.155
And everybody should do
holacracy or whatever

00:47:07.155 --> 00:47:08.792
the current management fad is.

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:11.250
The point is to build a system
of management and leadership

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.365
around the needs of your
people, and then go from there.

00:47:14.365 --> 00:47:16.490
And never be afraid to
tweak as those needs change,

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.886
because they will.

00:47:17.886 --> 00:47:19.260
AUDIENCE: So at
the beginning you

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.610
mentioned society or
the environment that

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:26.070
might be encouraging creativity
or not or a lot of judgment.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.890
So I wonder, like
Silcon Valley is

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:31.800
famous for a lot of projects,
exciting companies, and so on.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.565
But what happened other places
that the culture is totally

00:47:34.565 --> 00:47:35.730
the opposite.

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:38.550
How can you still succeed
in that kind of environment

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.114
or what suggestion do you have?

00:47:41.114 --> 00:47:43.280
DAVID BURKUS: So we have
two layers to that question

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.050
if I may.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:48.384
So there's the idea of what
about these other companies.

00:47:48.384 --> 00:47:49.800
First of all, how
did that happen?

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.350
Some really interesting
research that basically

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.446
non-compete clauses
and some other stuff.

00:47:55.446 --> 00:47:56.820
Essentially you
have this culture

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.280
of secrecy in a lot of places.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.730
Like why did Silicon Valley
beat out Route 128 decades ago?

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:03.890
Well, one was about
keeping ideas secret,

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:04.810
very, very secret.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:06.770
Other was about open
sharing of ideas.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.990
There are always exceptions
that prove the rule.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:10.480
One is not far from here.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.140
The rest of them
are-- usually you

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.370
have the more your open
with sharing of ideas

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.436
around an organization
and the more tolerant

00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:18.560
you are of those new ideas.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.440
So what do you do
if you're stuck

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.740
in one, if you're
stuck on Route 128?

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.200
First of all you may
not be there for long.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.739
I grew up not far from there.

00:48:26.739 --> 00:48:28.530
I remember in Lowell,
Massachusetts there's

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.960
this massive building,
the Wang building.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.305
And it was empty for years.

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:34.970
And it was a testament to
like, this doesn't work.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.810
And I never forgot that.

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:40.549
I moved away fairly often
but I never forgot that idea.

00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:42.340
You're smiling because
you've probably seen

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.230
the Wang building, right.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, right
off [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:45.180
DAVID BURKUS: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.410
Exactly, exactly.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:49.637
So testament too that the
social environment matters.

00:48:49.637 --> 00:48:51.220
So what do you do
if you stuck-- first

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.400
of all if you're stuck in
a company like that you

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.470
won't be there for long.

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.664
It'll fold up and you'll
go somewhere else.

00:48:55.664 --> 00:48:57.080
The other thing,
I think, is a lot

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:02.000
of us don't appreciate that
we have this work life balance

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.690
approach of like it's
two different things,

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:08.451
and we need to balance the two
instead of integrate and merge

00:49:08.451 --> 00:49:08.950
around.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:10.980
And there are obviously
legal limits to how much

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.021
you're supposed to share.

00:49:12.021 --> 00:49:13.500
My wife's an ER
doctor so there's

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.800
some stuff she's not
legally allowed to share.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.841
But there's other things
that she comes home with

00:49:17.841 --> 00:49:18.680
and we talk about.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.263
And so I think if you're stuck
in a company that doesn't allow

00:49:21.263 --> 00:49:23.480
that, find some
other way to at least

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.787
be in a social environment
that supports that,

00:49:25.787 --> 00:49:28.120
even if you know it's not
going to work in your company.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.160
And build an exit plan.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.010
It's a sad thing.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.870
But the fun thing.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.830
There's a woman by the
name of Orly Lobel who's

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.787
done a lot of research on
talent that moves around,

00:49:38.787 --> 00:49:40.620
non-compete clauses,
and that sort of stuff.

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.389
And she encapsulates this idea
that talent wants to be free.

00:49:43.389 --> 00:49:45.930
Not free in the sense that they
don't want to work for anyone

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:46.970
and they just want
to be freelancers.

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:48.960
But they want to know that
when they have an idea

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.710
they're free to pursue it.

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:51.240
If they need to move to
a different organization,

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.114
if they need to share
it with people outside,

00:49:53.114 --> 00:49:54.400
that they have freedom.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:59.060
So if you are talent and you
want to be free and you're not,

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.570
get free.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.630
Now if your an organization
and all your talent's leaving,

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:05.970
there's a lesson for you in
somebody else's book called

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:07.580
"Talent wants to be Free"
that will help you a lot.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.663
But first, of course, read
the one with the monkey

00:50:09.663 --> 00:50:10.340
on the cover.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.540
AUDIENCE: You made a
comparison between Kindergarten

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.520
and college classes.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.090
And I was wondering
if you've come

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.410
across any individuals
or any stories

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:22.540
about people who've
actually retained

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.300
the same level of
creativity they

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.230
had when they were
in kindergarten.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.297
DAVID BURKUS: So
I like to bridge

00:50:29.297 --> 00:50:31.130
the gap between what I
can empirically prove

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:32.770
and what I can turn
into a good story.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:34.500
And in this case I can't.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.470
But I can tell you that a lot
of people's stories or ideas

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.610
flow around.

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:42.070
This is, I think,
why we actually

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:45.490
associate certain disciplines
as creative and others as not.

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:49.714
So if you were that free spirit
that the traditional system is

00:50:49.714 --> 00:50:51.130
kind of crushing,
there are places

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:54.180
where you find solace
and sanctuary, the art

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.290
classroom if it still exists
in your public school, theater,

00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:58.790
music.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.624
There are just
certain disciplines

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.790
where that environment is
there and so you naturally

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:03.750
gravitate towards it.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:06.200
And because it supports
that you begin to practice.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.460
And practice really does,
well deliberate practice,

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.040
really does make perfect.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.310
So I think, one
specific story, no.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.120
But I think the reason
people gravitate

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.740
towards certain fields
sometimes is just that.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.490
They feel like they have this
desire to express themselves

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:23.250
and they find
sanctuary somewhere.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:27.460
As a story on a personal note
that sort of resonates with me.

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.870
I have two siblings.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:29.812
One is a musician.

00:51:29.812 --> 00:51:31.020
The other's in music theater.

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:31.930
And I'm a writer.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.530
And all three of us were sort
of attracted to that early on.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.550
All three of us did terribly
in the school systems

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:39.452
until we arrived at
that place of study

00:51:39.452 --> 00:51:41.410
where we could actually
do what we wanted to do

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.070
and then thrived.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.567
So it happens.

00:51:45.567 --> 00:51:46.650
AUDIENCE: The talk it out.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:50.200
I'm kind of curious about
the idea of the 2.6.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.890
I feel like the
inverse U of how if you

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:56.310
have too much kind of difference
or too much unity like those

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:58.140
could be kind of
limiting factors.

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:02.730
And I'm curious whether you
have any thoughts on how

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:07.000
either companies or things
should structure themselves

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.830
according to that.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:10.260
Because in the
political system you've

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.780
got political parties
switching in and out.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.160
There's elections so you
can get new people in,

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.730
old people out and
stuff like that.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:17.620
Do you feel like companies--

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.078
DAVID BURKUS: That'd
be ideal but I

00:52:19.078 --> 00:52:20.480
don't know that that happens.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.830
So what you have is
you have your party

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.288
that's in and then when they're
voted out they'll move over

00:52:24.288 --> 00:52:27.010
to this think tank and they
wait for another cycle.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.250
And they all come back in.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.530
So you don't get the 2.6.

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:31.360
I mean I would love
for that to happen.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.404
There is, interestingly
enough, from right here,

00:52:33.404 --> 00:52:34.570
it started in San Francisco.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:37.330
There's an awesome nonprofit
called Fuse Corps that actually

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:40.290
works to sort of
build 2.6 teams.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.540
What they essentially do
is they place fellows.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.637
They hate when I use this
analogy but it works.

00:52:44.637 --> 00:52:46.220
They're sort of like
Teach for America

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.960
but for city and
state governments.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.940
So they try and place mid-career
professionals and entrepreneurs

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.720
into city and state
governments in order

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.157
to bring those fresh ideas in.

00:52:54.157 --> 00:52:56.240
The other thing I think a
lot of industrial design

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.580
and consulting firms
have a structure

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.020
that allows them to do that.

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.506
Roger Martin from the Rotman
School up in Toronto actually

00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:04.880
had this great article a couple
months ago in the Harvard

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.540
Business Review around,
even economically there

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.301
may be a case for the
consultancy firm model,

00:53:10.301 --> 00:53:12.800
where people are always moving
around to different projects.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.080
Because when you have an
economic downturn, if you've

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.550
structured boxes and lines in
a traditional hierarchy then

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:19.508
you look and go, this
segment's not performing.

00:53:19.508 --> 00:53:20.680
We spit it off.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.100
But if you have a much more
fluid structure than you

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.849
can adapt quicker and possibly
not lay as many people off

00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:27.890
and then have to scramble
to find new people when

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:28.644
it comes back.

00:53:28.644 --> 00:53:29.560
That's where it sucks.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.143
So there's maybe
even an economic case

00:53:31.143 --> 00:53:33.912
to be made for that
little bit more fluid.

00:53:33.912 --> 00:53:36.849
We're really at the
beginning of figuring out

00:53:36.849 --> 00:53:39.140
what does this model look
like, because it doesn't look

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.800
like boxes and lines and
factory assembly lines

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.190
and that sort of stuff.

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:48.050
AUDIENCE: So some of the stuff
you talked about reminded me

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.910
of The Smart Stranger,
which I think

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:52.210
you kind of started
to allude to.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:56.454
But this idea that
someone who's smart--

00:53:56.454 --> 00:53:58.370
the mathematician that
you were talking about.

00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:59.360
DAVID BURKUS: Paul Erdos.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:53:59.730
AUDIENCE: Erdos.

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:00.420
OK.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.420
So he was--

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.503
DAVID BURKUS: Our only
mathematician already left.

00:54:03.503 --> 00:54:04.500
Shame.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.000
AUDIENCE: Like he was playing
the role of the smart stranger

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.050
where you're a smart
person and then

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.870
you jump into an environment
that you're not familiar with.

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:18.166
And that that actually sparks
innovation and creativity.

00:54:18.166 --> 00:54:20.960
Since it sounds like you're
also in business school

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.080
stuff probably?

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:26.840
So is anyone looking
at the opportunities

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:31.210
of formalizing a smart
stranger as like a role,

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:34.765
almost, in companies
to spark innovation?

00:54:37.757 --> 00:54:39.090
This is like kind of wild, but--

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:39.380
DAVID BURKUS: What?

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.650
AUDIENCE: Like 20% of the
time it's kind of like that.

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.530
DAVID BURKUS:
Similar in the idea

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:43.680
you play around with
something you're new at.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.670
I think you're talking
about a deliberate role.

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:47.920
Almost like you have a devil's
advocate for criticism.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.390
You have the smart
stranger for like-- I'm

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:51.980
really hesitant
because obviously this

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.730
is being recorded and
will be world wide

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.870
and I want to pretend like this
is our idea and trademark it.

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:56.995
And then we'll spin it off.

00:54:56.995 --> 00:54:58.620
But it's actually
a really good idea.

00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:59.350
AUDIENCE: We'll talk later.

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:00.558
DAVID BURKUS: Yeah, for sure.

00:55:00.558 --> 00:55:03.839
It's actually a really
good idea in a formal role.

00:55:03.839 --> 00:55:04.880
I don't know of anything.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.660
One of the things
I love again, this

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.230
comes out of Roger Martin
again and Michael Porter

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:15.240
and the consulting group
that they started years

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.390
ago in strategy.

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:17.847
One of the really
common questions

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:20.180
that doesn't get asked often
enough when you're building

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.790
a strategy, is what assumptions
have to be true for this

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:24.750
to work?

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.680
And really just
taking the deliberate,

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.970
did we remember to
ask that question.

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:30.510
Because even that's
like OK, let's

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:34.090
assume all of our assumptions
are wrong and then prove them.

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:35.485
Some of them may not be true.

00:55:35.485 --> 00:55:38.580
And so you can arrive at that
same sort of expertise thing.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.825
I think the other thing, the
thing that we especially-- I'm

00:55:41.825 --> 00:55:45.020
an American so I'm
terrible at-- is just

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.327
stop pretending to be
an expert in everything.

00:55:47.327 --> 00:55:48.660
I think it's really interesting.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.860
I walk in sometimes to
organizations or conferences.

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.350
And we do a prep call.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.220
And sometimes I've researched
them and other times I haven't.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.600
Mostly just ran out of time.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:02.100
And I used to like pretend
that I had researched them.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.037
Now I'm on Wikipedia
while I'm on the phone.

00:56:06.037 --> 00:56:07.870
But this amazing thing
happened when I said,

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.570
no, I really don't know
much about your company.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:11.910
Tell me about it.

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.410
And it's amazing because when
you sort of swallow your pride

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:16.034
that you don't know
everything, they'll

00:56:16.034 --> 00:56:18.450
tell you the stuff
that isn't necessarily

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.190
factual but the stuff you
actually need to know.

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.230
So this is an amazing thing that
can happen when you just go,

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:25.960
no I'm sorry.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:26.460
I tried.

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.350
I didn't have the time.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:29.151
Tell me about it.

00:56:29.151 --> 00:56:31.650
You don't even have to say,
tell me what's important to you.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.140
They just will.

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.110
So it's, yeah, smart
stranger thing.

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:38.270
I really need to go to a
trademark search on that.

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:39.605
We'll talk.

00:56:39.605 --> 00:56:41.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: But thank
you so much for your time

00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:43.510
and we've really
enjoyed hosting you.

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:45.360
DAVID BURKUS: Thank you.
