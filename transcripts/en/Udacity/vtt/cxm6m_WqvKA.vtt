Spencer, I gotta tell you, I'm impressed.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.441
You're getting very good at this. So, why

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:07.190
don't you go wild and continue, there

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.240
anything else you think we can improve here?

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.800
&gt;&gt; Well something was bothering

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.600
me, that what happens if there's more

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.110
than one book with the same title and somebody puts in a request?

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.360
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. That's a good point. So basically what you are telling me is

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.630
there's kind of a difference between an item and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.660
the title, so the title is kind of a more

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.940
general concept, in a sense. So if you can

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.830
have multiple copies of a given title, is that right?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have five copies of Tom Sawyer, and the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.810
persons, the patrons, really putting in a request for any Tom Sawyer.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.332
&gt;&gt; They don't want like copy number three of Tom Sawyer, right? They want,

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:50.530
they want to read Tom Sawyer. Okay and I can represent that. So, in which

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.230
I suggest we do that, and you can tell me whether it makes sense to you is by

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.650
introducing an additional class, which I call Title. And

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.614
that represents exactly the concept that you're mentioning. So

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:04.666
this is a title which represents some

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:09.180
specific content. That is not related to a specific

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.110
physical element. Like it can be rated to multiple,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.520
physical elements. So basically I'm going to create this title.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.100
And then I'm going to create a relationship between

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.500
the title and the item. And what

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.530
the relationship is telling me, the the association

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.512
between these two in this case. Is an association,

00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:30.320
that we call aggregation. So it's a special kind of association, that basically

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.450
indicates that an item of this type, so a title can

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.692
consist of a multiple elements of this type of multiple items.

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:42.710
So it's telling me that one title can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.700
consist of multiple items, and I'm going to indicate

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.560
it with this annotation, which is a this

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.200
diamond at the top of the association.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.570
&gt;&gt; And so we can move our request

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.510
line, up from loanable item to

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.010
title, because that's what they're really requesting.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.710
&gt;&gt; Definitely, definitely, and in fact,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.420
you know, that represents exactly the situation

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.350
that you are mentioning, at this point when the patron makes a request.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.240
It makes a request to a title and not to a loanable item. And then, and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.420
when the actual loan will take place,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420
then that will be connected to a specific item.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.090
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay that makes sense.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.388
&gt;&gt; Makes sense?

00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:20.779
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:21.214
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.
