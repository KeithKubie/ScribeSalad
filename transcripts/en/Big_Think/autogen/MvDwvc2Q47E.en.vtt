that deal with the consequences of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909
that deal with the consequences of
 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.599

how can you hold a robot responsible for
 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.790
how can you hold a robot responsible for
its behavior you really can actually and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800
its behavior you really can actually and
 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.950
its behavior you really can actually and
let me point out a couple of things the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960
let me point out a couple of things the
 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.650
let me point out a couple of things the
first is most people don't realize that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660
first is most people don't realize that

was charged with criminal violations
even though people in the corporation

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010
even though people in the corporation

you know I can't do that because my goal

with the corporation is much more
 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.320

logical than you might think
now another interesting historical

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
now another interesting historical
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.800
now another interesting historical
precedent is prior to the Civil War

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810
precedent is prior to the Civil War
 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.270
precedent is prior to the Civil War
there were a separate set of laws that

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280
there were a separate set of laws that
 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.580
there were a separate set of laws that
applied to slaves they were called the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590
applied to slaves they were called the
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.970
applied to slaves they were called the
slave codes and slaves were property but

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980
slave codes and slaves were property but
 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.710
slave codes and slaves were property but
interestingly enough the slave owners

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
interestingly enough the slave owners
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.690
interestingly enough the slave owners
were only held liable under certain

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700
were only held liable under certain
 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.400
were only held liable under certain
conditions for the actions of their

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
conditions for the actions of their
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.589
conditions for the actions of their
slaves the slaves themselves were

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599
slaves the slaves themselves were
 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.710
slaves the slaves themselves were
punished under if they committed crimes

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720
punished under if they committed crimes
 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.410
punished under if they committed crimes
and so we have a historical precedent

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420
and so we have a historical precedent
 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.009
and so we have a historical precedent
for the kinds of ways in which we can
