1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.350
So in college now you're athletic careers in order,
you're,
you're,

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:09.510
you're getting your schoolwork in.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.610
What was it that made you even consider being an MMA fighter?

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.970
Ben Ashker yet funky ban on Cuban and I didn't even consider he tricked her

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.900
cause I check you me all through,
cause I had teammates at data MMA,

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.390
they all wrestled when I was over.
They all of amateur MMA fights.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.310
Of course you should try it like your movement.

9
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:33.020
So you're so light on your feet and fast as your weight.
You can kill it bounced.

10
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.320
I got a metal plate in my leg,
bro.

11
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.720
I had tore my shoulder and I got some marriage.
I wouldn't be good.

12
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:40.050
I'd be laid up too much like I didn't like what'd you think?
This isn't,

13
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.960
this denied,
denied.
Denied.
My senior year,

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.600
fifth year senior Ben comes up,

15
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.300
you start working with me and Ben was like one of my main wrestling partners and

16
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:51.360
Kinda like you say with Lemon Chieko like you got somebody you go to punch and

17
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:53.220
he's not there because the same way on wrestling.

18
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.560
And I used to try to pick his brain and how do you do this?

19
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.620
Like I'd be dead right on a AA,
pick you up in the air.

20
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.440
I go to take you down and I land on my face and you're nowhere to be found.

21
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.440
You on my back or how does that happen?
That's why they call me the fuck man.

22
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.950
I'm the king.
Get a fuck the same hair.
Come in,
practice standards,
kick it off,

23
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.930
put his shoes on.
He just looked like a floppy guy.
Like,
Hey,

24
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:13.350
this guy is crazy thing about him.

25
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.750
He doesn't look physically in person going like this is,
this has been like this.

26
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.130
No,
I'm about to blow through this.
Do Hidden with Aa.
Gone every time.

27
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:21.810
High Crotch gone.
I took him down,

28
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:26.340
I think one time my college career clean take down and then it's just like what

29
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:29.970
the,
and after college I was like,
I want to do the Olympics Bro.

30
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.150
And you've been there.
I don't know any freestyle rules.
Oh,
we can work together,

31
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:37.530
whatever.
Him and my coach both for us.
So at that Olympic level working together.

32
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.630
And then one day sent me,
I was like,
oh,
I'm not making it here today,

33
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:43.620
but meet me here at this address and we will work,
blah blah,
blah.
Bring a year.

34
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.640
I get up there and Rufus sport,
but it's outside of a bank.
It's still like,

35
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.820
is there any for bank downstairs?
Yeah,
because I'm looking like we don't fuck is,

36
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.340
where am I going?
I texted like,
oh,
go to the side.
It's downstairs.

37
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.430
You're going shit,
sign roof for sport,
this and this,
and I walk downstairs like,

38
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:00.900
what is,
he must have mats in your song and I go in there and you got UFC,

39
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:05.250
they're doing a Anthony Pettis doing a jump off kick and making some photo for

40
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.960
the magazine or whatever and you got like Pascal crew s and Sergio Perez.

41
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.080
You got Ben Astron.
It was a few other Eric Koch,

42
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:15.190
other UFC guys and I'm looking like,
what is going on?

43
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:18.540
I always got hidden pass and when my practice and being around at the k,

44
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.430
oh hey cool,
I'm glad you could make this,
this and this.

45
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.400
Let's say no wrestling gym.
What is this?
He's like,
Oh yeah,

46
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.180
well I want to talk to you about that.
We're going to a new sport.
What?

47
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.820
What?
Yes,
like,
I mean,
I know,
I heard you say you didn't want to fight whatever,

48
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.550
bro.
I think you could be good.
I just want you to try.
If you don't,

49
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.700
if you don't like it after you try it,
we'll go back to wrestling,
blah blah blah,

50
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.250
this and this.
I'm like,
hi.

51
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.870
And I go to the front desk and the lady I met at the front desk,

52
00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:47.110
they introduced me.
It was my wife now didn't know that genesis in mind.

53
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.983
That's like what this,

54
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.840
so I get the gear that gave me some gloves and whatever and I was like,
you know,

55
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:54.910
I really don't want to do like the training I saw on the side and watch.

56
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:55.741
I hit the bag a little bit.

57
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:59.470
I'm just watching and at the time this is where my mind already set.

58
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.140
You got an opportunity,
you got to try it.
But I didn't try the day.

59
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.720
I remember driving home an hour and a half dry.
Hold your,

60
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.720
I've met myself like you pitch talking about that like you a bitch court,

61
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.510
you didn't do that.
You had opportunity.
I even take it.
You a bitch.

62
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.690
I can't believe you didn't do that.
So I get home until being like,

63
00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.580
I'm sorry I didn't try but I like to do it again like well it's good cause

64
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.470
tomorrow morning 9:00 AM we up there.

65
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.450
I get up early seven 35 and motorcycle up shoot all the way up to Milwaukee.

66
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.600
I get their roof and do group element.
Oh Cory,
nice to meet you.

67
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.700
I heard about she has a snitch.
Like I can't,
yes,

68
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.280
I didn't do it but I want to try it today.
I just was like,
well that's good.

69
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.740
I'm glad you came.
Like why is that like stay sparring day?

70
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.520
Like I had to borrow testing.
I did amateur boxing.

71
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.350
They call him.
I broke my leg.
I did like boxing in the gym for Rehab.
Come out.

72
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.690
Brother-In-Law was oppression of box at the time and I had two amateur fights

73
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.400
and uh,
so I had that and I came on my gloves,
everything but over ready,

74
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.500
title gloves falling apart and like all I got is my gloves,
my show.
It's like,

75
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.870
Oh man,
we've got gear would get you stuff.
Hey gear and Shin pads,
this is this.

76
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.550
They gave me two obviously combat corner Shin pads,

77
00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:04.060
almost like a youth and was like extra loss on one coach,

78
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:07.850
my knee and one covered like half machine.
Like there's old raggedy head gear.

79
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.050
You got a mouthpiece like yeah man,
it's all you need.
So we're going to spa.

80
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.010
So my first time I go with being so being,
you know,
taking it easy on me.
Boom,

81
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.270
boom.
He shoot on me.
I defended in MMA is different.
I can sprawl out hard.

82
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.750
I well there you go.
I'm going to put you with somebody else.
Of course,

83
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.870
Anthony Pettis,
he's too small like,

84
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.480
well you need to go and feel like they get kicked.
What bow?

85
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.220
I just kept kicking my leg.
Not Great.
Like what are you do?

86
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.360
Like I'm arrest as I take them down.
That's when I lie.
You do big family,

87
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.980
you're going to hurt him and he put me with a heavyweight.

88
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.340
So now we'll just take everything you did.

89
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:43.040
Use punched him being and you took him down and took nine.
Anthony do everything.

90
00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:46.660
We've just got your size and I fucking just hit her with a bunch of Jab Crosses,

91
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.940
blasts devil on a punch.

92
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:51.820
It's like just got dino ground but there's hidden like dog and it stand up and

93
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.040
do it again.
I did get as kept doing and doing it,

94
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:56.170
doing it and when I was over here like hey,
there you go.

95
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.240
Your first sponsor is not the way he said.
I hate to tell.

96
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:01.450
The court heard you kept saying you're not a fighter but you aren't MMA fighter

97
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.820
and I can tell you right now,
but working with a lot of guys,

98
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.480
you could be in the UFC and three fights.
Yeah,
right.
Whatever.

99
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.670
I'm feeling like I'm dead serious in three fights.

100
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:12.400
So what you got and your mentality from what I seen in wrestling,

101
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.660
if you put into this,
you can read in the UFC in three fights,
whatever,

102
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.040
but I liked that.

103
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.280
I like to train it and I kept coming back and I never received Jesus.

104
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.760
This was 2012 right after college.
That's not that long ago,
man.

105
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.880
Oh my [inaudible] to 2013 top level MMA fighter in one of the most talent rich

106
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.040
divisions in the light heavyweight division.

107
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.780
And you only been doing it for seven years.

108
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.750
I was in the UFC was seven months after my first fight,

109
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.800
seven months and I was at a top 10 within a year.
That's the thing.

110
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.020
So I'm learning.
I didn't have amateur career.

111
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.320
I had three fights on ultimate fighter one that top 10 year of all MMA training.

112
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.900
That's it.
That's what people keep talking this shit about.
I'm like,

113
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.420
they don't understand.
I ain't did this.
Like most of these guys,

114
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.280
I look at pictures of guys I've been training with.

115
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.130
I got guys at the gym now that's still amateurs.
They pose a throwback Thursday,

116
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.590
my senior year in college.
I have a throwback picture.

117
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:07.250
It'd be me in college in 2007 it'd be them on like the third or fourth MMA
fight.

118
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.410
It's like,
and these guys are still amateur and how old are you now?
I'm 29 dude,

119
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.640
you're still not even really in your prime.
You know I was like 31 32 back.

120
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.450
I said I'm coming.
I'm learning now.

121
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.080
You are learning now but that's crazy that you were in a top 10 a year in the

122
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.110
MMA training.
They'll just,
cause we always cite Francis in Ghana.

123
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.060
The Francis in Ghana is one of the craziest stories ever.

124
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.290
The guy goes from no MMA training at all to five years later fighting for the

125
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:34.070
title you know at like him,
but he's,

126
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.430
what you did is as impressive the fact that you hit top 10 with a year of MMA

127
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.200
training.
That's bananas,
man.
Even in the tough house,

128
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.510
I remember guys like you hear him in a kitchen with all talking about,

129
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.960
oh what's your background in business?

130
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.860
I went on a tough with four or five months experience,

131
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.830
had my three fights back to back to bed and I remember my coach was pushing it.

132
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.500
That third fight we got hit to certify.
Why are you pushing so hard?

133
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.900
And then when it was over and I was like,
oh hi.

134
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.000
That's why we had to get that last fight.
Ultimate fighter trials.

135
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:03.050
The next Tuesday in Indiana,
you're going the fuck outta here.
I gotta work.

136
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:06.460
This is,
I'm going over there and they called me Monday night like,
Yo,

137
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.900
you're doing like I'm at work.
I work night shift.
I don't get off til one.

138
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.610
And when he'd get off me,
me and my house like what are we going on in Indiana?

139
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.230
Like I'm not,
I'm going get to USC.
How I'm gonna do it.

140
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.170
I'm going to go to the hallway.
All right.
I see at my house,
hung up the phone,

141
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.020
I get off,
I'll go.
And I was like,
Bro,
what the fuck you talkin about?

142
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:23.120
He jumped into driving.
She's like getting like,
what are you talking about?

143
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.170
So you are saying you want,
if you get in,
you want to go the hard way.

144
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.940
Getting earned from doing the ultimate fight.
Yeah.

145
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:31.250
I wanted to like get enough fights and then somebody see me and be like,

146
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.350
oh here's you take a short notice fight or whatever.

147
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.450
That was a fantastic opportunity for exposure and exactly in my mind I just

148
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:42.530
started three,
four months.
I'm thinking like I'm just beating up cans.

149
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:46.160
I don't think I'm ready yet.
But they say like,
oh,
we see you man.
Like you,

150
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.350
you have the opportunity to beat these guys.

151
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:50.120
Like you'd beaten this guy and he's been training forever.

152
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.350
He's been pro has been dilatory.

153
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.110
Dustin Jacoby was my first barn partner when I went to Illinois.

154
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.430
He had been in the UFC Laurie now.
Yeah.

155
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.550
And that was one of my first and I was taking him down and ground and pound but

156
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.560
striking.
I didn't have it,
but it's usually take downs,
man,

157
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.670
you've taken everybody now you're doing good.
Use that.
And when I left,

158
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.880
when I went there and whatever,
my coach is like,
just go do what you do.

159
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.740
I have no doubt they're going to pick you.

160
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.470
But the reason they picked me wasn't the same.
You know,

161
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:17.870
they picked me thinking it was going to be easy fight for whoever,

162
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.410
but it's backfired on me because my work ethic,
they didn't know me.

163
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.860
You know I was cracking jokes like I can be anybody you haven't,
it is laughing.

164
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.010
I'm going,
they laughing at my jokes,
come to find out,
they told me at the end,

165
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.920
one guy told me like,
you know when we picture we didn't think you could win.

166
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.500
I go after somebody like we picked you because we thought she was going to lose

167
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:36.040
it,
Kelly and this and get him an easy fight in and now look,

168
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.290
it kind of backfired.
And it was like,
cause they didn't know who I was.

169
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.250
They didn't know her as a person.

170
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.400
And I name Drop Matt Hughes and I think that was the only reason why I got
there.

171
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.760
Like I trained with Matt Hughes here and there,
Blah Blah.
You Know Maddie?
Aw Man,

172
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.710
he's our guy.
Oh,
can you make it to Vegas next week?

173
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:51.860
I think I can make it yesterday.
If he would have told me like go pack your bags,

174
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:56.190
you're going,
wow,
that was it.
But you,
the thing is,
even though

175
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.210
<v 1>you were a year in,</v>

176
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.960
you are so many years into wrestling and I think to this day that wrestling is

177
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.990
the most important skill in MMA because you get to dictate where the fight takes

178
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:06.410
place.
The superior wrestler gets a dis,

179
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.880
every fight starts standing up and you have to know how to strike.

180
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.330
But a superior wrestler guests to dictate where the fights take place.

181
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.240
And you see that with guys like Khabib,

182
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.450
he see that with so many superior grapplers when they get ahold of a guy,

183
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.350
it's their dominance is one of the most important aspects of fighting.

184
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.030
So you did have all that

185
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.110
<v 0>[inaudible] that's,
I had the strike,
the basic striking wrestling.
Like I said,</v>

186
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:33.240
when I came to meet Mark Henry and Ricardo Meda like bass,

187
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.120
it took me until two years into your chat with him in two years.

188
00:09:37.121 --> 00:09:41.570
I was a year and like three months.
And I guess that's why I didn't have it.

189
00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:44.100
And mark tell people all the time like when you hear him say it,
I,

190
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.180
I'm telling people all the time,
you guys want to see like,

191
00:09:46.181 --> 00:09:50.560
oh I'm working with having core high court is a purifier of what I,

192
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.810
what I'm coaching because he came here with nothing.

193
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.950
But you get guys that come in,
I'm like Lance Palmer now even fight himself,

194
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.290
he's wanting to Pfl you got all these guys have been fighting 10 12 years before

195
00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:01.870
they meet mark.
So it's kind of like they just tuning up.

196
00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:05.410
Sorry thing when you've got a guy like me to has nothing.
The Gym I was at,

197
00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:07.600
we literally like all that roof sport for a little bit.

198
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.340
But I got to college coaching job and had to leave.

199
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.830
So I met a group of guys do Mark Fiori at the time,

200
00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:16.450
but he ended up leaving to go to overseas and it was probably six of us and we

201
00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:18.280
had to find a guy who owned the warehouse.

202
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.190
Like all you can put mats in here and just in a corner.
You guys need to train.

203
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.790
We didn't have Jujitsu practice.
Whenever has striking practice,
no tie practice.

204
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.910
We really showed up ground and pound.
It would make gloves.

205
00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:31.580
We Punch each other in the face for learning.
I get out sparring,
no bridge,

206
00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:33.880
jazz and spawn.
I mean,
you've got injuries.
We don't want to hear it.

207
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.580
Just beat the shit out of each other until it's over.
There was,

208
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.210
it was the horrible one at a time.
No heat.

209
00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:44.170
We had a little curious here about this big on the corner mat and we for we in

210
00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:48.860
Illinois.
Oh Geez.
The mid Central Illinois.
It's freezing negative twin.

211
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.000
We in their fucking dudes brake and hit the hand,
hit the back,

212
00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.580
freeze and break the hand.
We don't have any insurance.

213
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.240
US beating the shit out of each other,
but we got the opportunity for one of us,

214
00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.920
it was three two oh five hours,

215
00:10:59.921 --> 00:11:02.020
but I was the only one that they was gonna let to go show the ultimate fighter.

216
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.080
I had the least amount of fights with.

217
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.120
You're the only one I can actually work and make us look good on their get

218
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.660
<v 1>a fighter.
You meet Mark Henry,
you want to win and,
and then you go from there.</v>

219
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.540
You Go and move to New Jersey.

220
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.590
<v 0>I went home,
I met Ali on the show.
You know,
Ali was there every day.</v>

221
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.310
He even said like,
Bro,
you're in,
it's got like how you get arrested.
Enzo came on,

222
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:26.250
he said like,
you're wrestling this key.
That's when everybody let me know.
Mark,

223
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.390
first thing you say is your wrestling.

224
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.420
They made it known like wrestling is going to run this and uh,

225
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.600
and the valleys there,
I think he's like,
oh,
I'll work with you.

226
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.500
And the union had assignments,
a manager,
but I help you.

227
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.370
I help lead you in the right way.
What unique,

228
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.810
cause I didn't have anybody to direct me.
I knew nothing.

229
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.730
Been asking him the only thing I had,
but he was in Wisconsin,
you know,
I'm about,

230
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.020
I hear on my own and Holly,
I remember her saying like,
if you want to win,

231
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.620
it's showing to be the best you can,
brother,

232
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:49.200
you need to go to Jersey and mark and I'm and already texting me.

233
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.150
You're more than welcome to come out and train whenever you want.

234
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.270
By the time I had a girl who had a kid and my family and the kosher with my

235
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:58.300
dream job,
still my dream job and I love that.
You know,

236
00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.650
I didn't want to leave that for anything.

237
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.640
What were you coaching your college wrestling?
Got By the junior college level.

238
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.270
And I remember,
uh,
that was the only made 220 bucks a week.

239
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:09.910
But I worked other jobs to make my dream a reality.

240
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.480
That's why I wanted to do and fight.
And um,
how do you like,

241
00:12:13.481 --> 00:12:16.210
if you want to be the best,
you want to win to show the Best I've you got man,

242
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:19.570
you need to go to Jersey.
Like I know you got guys there,

243
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.300
but even my guys told me after the show you need to leave cause we can't do

244
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:24.940
anything for you.
But I didn't want to,
I was so grounded today.

245
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:28.930
I didn't want to leave that.
That's what I knew.
And uh,
well he say,
Bro,

246
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.300
you got to go.
But I can never live in Jersey is too fast paced.

247
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:34.660
I'm a country boy.
I like outdoors and this hunting and stuff like that.

248
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.180
Like you need to get the Jersey brother if you want to be the best,

249
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:40.030
if you don't want to be the best,
stay where you are.
I remember telling my mom,

250
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:43.300
like I said,
I need to go to Jersey.
I'm mom said when I was,
uh,
in high school,

251
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.520
my senior year,
you get the opportunity ever to leave.
I want you to go far away.

252
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.090
Did you think about going anywhere else?
Like go on Rufus sport permanently or,

253
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:54.730
and that was a thought?
Yeah.
Thought,
but he didn't have the rest have been,

254
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.660
but that was about it.
You know,

255
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:58.390
I'm a wrestling base and I fell in love with the way Frankie and I'm trying,

256
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.200
I love that.
I was looking for something like that mark for,
you already had that,

257
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:06.370
but when he left,
had nowhere else to go and I was thinking,
and my mom said,

258
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:08.970
if that's what the best is,
you need to go be the best.
You know?

259
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.840
My brother was like,
Yo,
let's go.
