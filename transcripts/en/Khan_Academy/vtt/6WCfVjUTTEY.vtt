00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.820
So far, we've been assuming that
the discount rate is the

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.880
same thing, no matter
how long of a period

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.590
we're talking about.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.670
But we know if you go to the
bank and you say, hey, bank, I

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.580
want to essentially invest in
a one-year CD, they'll say,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.720
oh, OK, one-year CD
will give you 2%.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.850
And you're like, well, what
if we give you the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.420
money for two years?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.610
So you can keep our money,
locked in for even longer.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.910
They'll say, oh, then we'll
give you a little bit more

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.520
interest, because we have
more flexibility.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.230
For two years, we don't have
to worry about paying you.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.510
So instead of giving you 2%,
we'll give you 7%, because we

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.800
get to keep your money
for two years.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.170
And maybe if you say, well,
you know, I actually don't

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.820
even need my money for 10 years,
so let me give you the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.510
money for 10 years.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.170
They'll say oh, 10 years, if
we get to keep your money,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.830
we'll give you 12%.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.420
So in general-- and this tends
to be the case, although it's

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.660
not always the case-- the longer
that you defer your

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700
money, or the longer you lock
up the money, the higher an

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.990
interest rate you get.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.220
So the same thing is true when
you're doing a discount rate.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.500
Oftentimes you want to discount
a payment two years

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.410
out by a higher value than
something that's

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.860
only one year out.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.920
So how do you do that?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.230
So let's say the risk-free rate,
if you were to go out

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:18.450
and get a government bond-- the
one-year rate, let's say

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.010
that they're only
giving you 1%.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.910
But let's say that the
two-year rate,

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.550
they'll give you 5%.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.680
So what does that mean?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.720
Well, let's take the example.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.770
So that means you could take
that $100 and essentially lend

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130
it to the federal government,
and in a year they'll

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.850
give you 1% on it.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.350
So that these are
annual rates.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.750
So 1%, 1.01 times 100, that's
just $101, right?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.880
Fair enough.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.920
Now your other option is,
you could lock it in.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.750
You could lend it to the federal
government for two

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.380
years and not see your money.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.490
And they say, oh, then we're
going to give you 5% a year.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.280
So then you're going
to go 5% a year.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.990
So how much do you end
up with in two years?

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.410
Well, remember, this
is an annual rate.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.560
These are always quoted
in annual rates.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.350
So if you're getting 5% a year,
that's going to be equal

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.040
to-- let's do it on
the calculator.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.140
That's going to be 100-- after
one year you're going to get

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.460
1.05, and after two years you're
going to get 1.05.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.050
Or you can view that as 100
times 1.05 squared.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.010
So you'd have $110.25.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.220
So you already see, not even
doing any present value, this

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.260
is actually-- you can almost
view this as a future value

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.300
calculation.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.380
If you take a future value,
you already know that this

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.310
option is better than this
option, when you have these

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.630
varying interest rates.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.280
But anyway, the whole topic of
this is to talk about present

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.680
value, so let's do that.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.530
So in this circumstance,
what is the present

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.970
value of the $110?

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.550
Well, actually, what is the
present value of the $100?

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.330
Well, we always know that.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.260
That's easy.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.750
That is $100.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.240
Present value of $100
today is $100.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.500
What is the present
value of the $110?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.870
So we take $110, and we're
going to use the two-year

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.110
rate, and discount twice.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.210
And that makes sense, because
essentially you're deferring

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.560
your money for two years.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.430
You're not going to
get anything,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.210
even a year from now.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.150
So you're deferring your
money for two years.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.530
So you divide it by 1-- so it's
a 5% rate, 1.05 squared.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.630
And then that is equal to--
I think that was our first

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.320
problem, right?

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.040
So I'll just do it again.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.770
110 divided by 1.05 squared.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.940
That's equal to $99.77, right?

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.370
That was our first problem.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.410
And now this one
is interesting.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.840
The $20 you get today-- and
this is a side note.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.820
It's very important when you're
doing this, when they

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.120
talk about year one, or year
zero, just make sure-- is that

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.400
today, is that a
year from now?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.720
Because if it's a year from now,
you'd have to discount it

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.360
by the one-year interest rate.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.120
If it's today, you don't
discount it.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.740
So anyway, I clarified that.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.510
I was a little ambiguous about
that in the last two videos,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.230
but I clarified it.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.890
The $20 is now.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.450
So the present value of
something given you today, is

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.240
the value of it.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.080
So it's $20 plus $50.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.205
Now $50, what do we use?

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:15.640
Do we use the one-year rate
or the two-year rate?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.160
Well of course, we use the
one-year rate, because you're

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.800
not deferring the pleasure of
that $50 for two years.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.760
You're actually getting
it in one year.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.580
So plus $50 divided by
the one-year rate.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.830
Divided by 1.01.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.450
Plus $35 divided by the two-year
rate-- but this is an

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.310
annual rate, so you have to
discount it twice-- divided by

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.510
1.05 squared.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.720
Let's get the TI-85 out.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:05:01.960
So you get 20 plus 50 divided
by 1.01, plus 35 divided by

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:15.430
1.05 squared, is equal
to $101.25.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.090
So notice, the actual payment
streams I did not change in

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.330
any of the three scenarios.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.500
And let me just draw a line
between them, because I got a

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.740
little bit messy.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.480
So that was scenario one.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.730
This is scenario two.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.190
And this is scenario three.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.040
But in scenario one, because we
used a 5% discount rate for

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.050
all-- you could say, I don't
want to use fancy words-- but

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.410
for all durations out we used
a 5% discount rate.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.700
We saw that choice number
one was the best.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.840
But then if the discount rate
were to change-- if we were to

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.760
change our assumption.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.910
If we had a 2% rate, for
whatever reason, we could lend

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.160
money to the federal government
in the form of

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.305
buying bonds from them-- we
could lend the federal

00:05:58.305 --> 00:06:03.480
government two years over
any time period at 2%.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.830
Then all of a sudden, choice
two became the best option.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.060
And then finally, if we had this
kind of-- and this is the

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.640
most realistic scenario, and
even though the math is fairly

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.270
simple, we're actually doing
something fairly

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.040
sophisticated here.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.960
When I had a different discount
rate for my one year

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.150
out cash flows and my two year
out cash flows, and it was

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.140
these exact numbers.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.930
I had to play with the numbers
to get the right result.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:36.520
Then all of a sudden choice
three was the best option.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.460
I'll leave it to you-- I want
you to think about why this

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.030
was better for choice three than
it was for choice two.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.030
And if you really understand
that, then I think you are

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.980
starting to have a
lot of intuition

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.790
about present values.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.400
And frankly, what we're
learning here is a

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.440
discounted cash flow.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.420
What is a discounted
cash flow?

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.370
I'm giving you a stream
of cash flows.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.660
$20 now, $50 a year from
now, $35 in two years.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.500
And you are essentially
discounting them back to get

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.220
today's present value.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.770
So when someone says, you know,
I can use Excel to do a

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.530
discounted cash flow, that's
all they're doing.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.160
They're making some assumption
about the discount rates.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.780
And they're just using this
fairly straightforward

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.720
mathematics to get the
present value of

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.980
those future cash flows.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.940
But it's a very powerful
technique.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.950
Because if you were to take--
if you're good at Excel, and

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.690
you were to say, oh,
I have a business.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.790
And based on my assumptions, in
year one, right now, this

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.060
business gives me $20.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.490
The next year it's going
to give $50.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.290
The year after that it's $35.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.990
And this risk-free is
the big assumption.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.800
But if it was risk-free, you
could discount it like that.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.800
You'd say, if these are the
interest rates, this business

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.690
is worth $101.25.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.936
That's what I'm willing
to pay for it.

00:07:47.936 --> 00:07:48.600
Or, I'm neutral.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.820
If I could get it for $90,
that's a good deal for me.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.610
That's all a discounted
cash flow is.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.980
But the big learning from this
is how dependent the present

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:04.090
value of future payments are
on your discount rate

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:04.820
assumption.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.800
The discount rate assumption
is everything in finance.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.210
And this is where finance really
diverges from a lot of

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.330
other fields, especially
the sciences.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.740
There really is no
correct answer.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.430
It's all assumption driven.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.930
All of these discounted cash
flows, and all these models,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.340
they're really just to
help you understand

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.600
the dynamics of things.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.090
And frankly-- and this happens
a lot in the real world of

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.130
finance-- if you ever become
an analyst at an investment

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.580
bank, you'll probably
do this yourself.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.500
But you can almost justify any
present value, by picking the

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.630
right discount rate.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.620
And actually the whole topic of,
how do you decide on the

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.370
right discount rate?

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.080
Because we assumed risk-free.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.890
Everything is risk-free.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.450
You're guaranteed
these payments.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.810
But we know in the real world,
if you're investing in

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.020
pets.com and they tell you
that they're going to pay

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.650
these cash flows to you,
that's not risk-free.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.560
There's some risk implicit
in that.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.700
So actually, most of finance,
and most of portfolio theory,

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.700
and modern finance, is
based on figuring out

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.970
that discount rate.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.760
And that is the crux of
everything, because as we see,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.070
that completely changes which of
these options is the best.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.970
But anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.510
What you have already is
a very powerful tool.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.100
If you can think of a discount
rate, you can make a very

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.150
rational comparison between
three, or ten, or whatever

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.940
different types of payments.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.920
And this is actually
really useful.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.720
You don't realize how
many things in the

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.040
world are like this.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:38.260
These college payment schemes
where you pay some company $25

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.130
a year for 20 years, and then in
year 21 they're willing to

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.510
pay for your college tuition, or
your kids' college tuition.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.650
You could figure out with that
really is worth, how much

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.300
money are they making off
of you, by taking a

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.460
discounted cash flow.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.780
And of course if you're
paying out, these

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.750
become negative numbers.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.950
And when they pay you, it
becomes a positive number.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.250
Anyway.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.950
Maybe I'll do that in a couple
of videos, because I think

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.090
that's a fairly useful thing
to be able to analyze.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.080
See you in the next video.
