and I think this raises some really

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:21.930
and I think this raises some really
 

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.840
and I think this raises some really
really really important questions for

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:23.850
really really important questions for
 

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.260
really really important questions for

we go forward about what this public

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260
we go forward about what this public
 

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.350
we go forward about what this public
sphere might be and what the Free Press

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360
sphere might be and what the Free Press
 

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.050

and how how the how the functions of

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:36.060
and how how the how the functions of
 

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.970
and how how the how the functions of
journalism fit into that because we're

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:37.980
journalism fit into that because we're
 

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.640
journalism fit into that because we're
not going to be able to clarify

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:40.650
not going to be able to clarify
 

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.880
not going to be able to clarify
journalism as just a function done by

journalism as just a function done by

certain organizations bits of it will be

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320
certain organizations bits of it will be
 

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.260
certain organizations bits of it will be
done in ways that we haven't properly

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:48.270
done in ways that we haven't properly
 

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.680
done in ways that we haven't properly
understood yet and WikiLeaks has really

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:51.690
understood yet and WikiLeaks has really
 

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.350
understood yet and WikiLeaks has really
sort of Illustrated how it might be done

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360
sort of Illustrated how it might be done
 

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.390
sort of Illustrated how it might be done
and so I think that in some ways it's a

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400
and so I think that in some ways it's a
 

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.090
and so I think that in some ways it's a
great time to be having this debate

00:19:59.090 --> 00:19:59.100
great time to be having this debate
 

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.590
great time to be having this debate
because we've conceptually thought about

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600
because we've conceptually thought about
 

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.540
because we've conceptually thought about
it before but we haven't seen what

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:03.550
it before but we haven't seen what
 

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.520
it before but we haven't seen what
actually might happen and we haven't

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:05.530
actually might happen and we haven't
 

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.050
actually might happen and we haven't
seen the pressure points and where

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:07.060
seen the pressure points and where
 

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.990
seen the pressure points and where
things break in relation to to freedom

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000

things break in relation to to freedom
of speech so I think I don't think it's

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.190
of speech so I think I don't think it's
 

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.530
of speech so I think I don't think it's
overstating it so this is a really

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:13.540
overstating it so this is a really
 

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.960
overstating it so this is a really
pivotal moment for journalism and the

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:15.970
pivotal moment for journalism and the
 

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.490
pivotal moment for journalism and the
way that journalists and journalistic

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:17.500
way that journalists and journalistic
 

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.780
way that journalists and journalistic
organizations will have to think about

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:18.790
organizations will have to think about
 

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.820
organizations will have to think about
organizing themselves and have to think

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:20.830
organizing themselves and have to think
 

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.480
organizing themselves and have to think
about how they engage with regulation

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:23.490
about how they engage with regulation
 

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.440
about how they engage with regulation

sapphire used this story it was much

00:47:12.539 --> 00:47:12.549
sapphire used this story it was much
 

00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:14.900
sapphire used this story it was much
funnier when he told it

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:14.910
funnier when he told it
 

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.749
funnier when he told it
sapphire used this story to make a point

00:47:17.749 --> 00:47:17.759
sapphire used this story to make a point
 

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:21.839

that that Lee made and his his opening

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:21.849
that that Lee made and his his opening
 

00:47:21.849 --> 00:47:23.880
that that Lee made and his his opening
remarks that's a very important point I

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:23.890
remarks that's a very important point I
 

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.690
remarks that's a very important point I
think and that is about the tendency

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700
think and that is about the tendency
 

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:32.730
think and that is about the tendency
toward a government system like like the

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:32.740
toward a government system like like the
 

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.190
toward a government system like like the
American like the American system toward

American like the American system toward
 

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.890

over classification and he would say

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:37.900
over classification and he would say
 

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.049
over classification and he would say
when he told the story it's very easy to

00:47:40.049 --> 00:47:40.059
when he told the story it's very easy to
 

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:43.109
when he told the story it's very easy to
stamp something top-secret it's very

00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119
stamp something top-secret it's very
 

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:46.499
stamp something top-secret it's very
hard once it's stamped to unstamped now

00:47:46.499 --> 00:47:46.509
hard once it's stamped to unstamped now
 

00:47:46.509 --> 00:47:48.329
hard once it's stamped to unstamped now
it happens and as gary points out there

00:47:48.329 --> 00:47:48.339
it happens and as gary points out there
 

00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:50.069
it happens and as gary points out there
are lots of things that are declassified

00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079
are lots of things that are declassified
 

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:51.509
are lots of things that are declassified
and there are ways of declassifying

00:47:51.509 --> 00:47:51.519
and there are ways of declassifying
 

00:47:51.519 --> 00:47:53.849
and there are ways of declassifying
things and sooner or later almost

00:47:53.849 --> 00:47:53.859
things and sooner or later almost
 

00:47:53.859 --> 00:48:00.359
things and sooner or later almost
everything will come out but I think the

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:00.369
everything will come out but I think the
 

00:48:00.369 --> 00:48:03.720

so far up until this very moment this
 

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:06.950
so far up until this very moment this
very hour I think the WikiLeaks episode

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960
very hour I think the WikiLeaks episode
 

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:11.430
very hour I think the WikiLeaks episode
has been in a large sense a huge missed

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440
has been in a large sense a huge missed
 

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.490
has been in a large sense a huge missed
opportunity to think at a

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:14.500
opportunity to think at a
 

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.510
opportunity to think at a
slightly broader level about that

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520
slightly broader level about that
 

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.860
slightly broader level about that
problem and about that issue about the

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:19.870
problem and about that issue about the
 

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:21.750
problem and about that issue about the
the sort of level and amount and extent

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760
the sort of level and amount and extent
 

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.720
the sort of level and amount and extent
of classification and the culture of

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:24.730
of classification and the culture of
 

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.860
of classification and the culture of
secrecy that that surrounds a lot of

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:28.870
secrecy that that surrounds a lot of
 

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.540
secrecy that that surrounds a lot of
what the government does and this has to

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:30.550
what the government does and this has to
 

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.380
what the government does and this has to
do not just with national security

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:34.390
do not just with national security
 

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:38.370
do not just with national security
issues that's sort of the area of the

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:38.380
issues that's sort of the area of the
 

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.680
issues that's sort of the area of the
government's activity where the need for

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:40.690
government's activity where the need for
 

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.160
government's activity where the need for
secrecy is the most obvious and

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.170
secrecy is the most obvious and
 

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.230
secrecy is the most obvious and
intuitive but it's also true it's true

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240
intuitive but it's also true it's true
 

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.290

everywhere in the government in the

areas of government documents that I
 

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:52.350

tend to look at or not at all about

bigger questions about secrecy and

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:05.100
dump of information that he's given us
is pretty conclusive evidence that the

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:05.110
is pretty conclusive evidence that the
 

01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:06.770
is pretty conclusive evidence that the
government do other things besides

01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780
government do other things besides
 

01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:09.450

conspiracies and I think it disproves

01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:09.460
conspiracies and I think it disproves
 

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:10.440
conspiracies and I think it disproves
this point actually

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:10.450
this point actually
 

01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:12.510
this point actually
but in favor of uncovering conspiracies

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520
but in favor of uncovering conspiracies

by law in favor I just briefly on the
balance between secrecy and openness I

01:22:18.630 --> 01:22:18.640
balance between secrecy and openness I
 

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.300
balance between secrecy and openness I
mean in a university environment I think

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:21.310
mean in a university environment I think
 

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:23.790
mean in a university environment I think
you have to be as Rob eloquently said in

01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800
you have to be as Rob eloquently said in
 

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.220
you have to be as Rob eloquently said in
favor of openness but I I do want to

01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:26.230
favor of openness but I I do want to
 

01:22:26.230 --> 01:22:27.900
favor of openness but I I do want to
defend the government's right to hold

in trying to become so transparent you

01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679
in trying to become so transparent you
 

01:22:57.679 --> 01:22:59.860

you actually put cataracts in your own

three groups in openness but I think

01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:01.940
three groups in openness but I think

three groups in openness but I think
there that that comes for very different

that obviously that's a concern it's
 

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:20.890
that obviously that's a concern it's
something that that we as researchers

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:20.900
something that that we as researchers
 

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.959
something that that we as researchers
always need to be worried about and it's

01:24:22.959 --> 01:24:22.969
always need to be worried about and it's
 

01:24:22.969 --> 01:24:25.479
always need to be worried about and it's
something that we as research scholars

something that we as research scholars
 

01:24:25.489 --> 01:24:27.610
something that we as research scholars
and as universities actually have a

universities and the government and
 

01:24:49.489 --> 01:24:51.600
universities and the government and
other organizations have come up with

protocols for dealing with those things
 

01:24:56.929 --> 01:24:59.080
protocols for dealing with those things
think about the United States census

01:24:59.080 --> 01:24:59.090
think about the United States census
 

01:24:59.090 --> 01:25:01.930
think about the United States census
every year every 10 years we asked every

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:01.940
every year every 10 years we asked every
 

01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:03.770
every year every 10 years we asked every
single person who lives in the United

01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780

to give us information we the government

01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840
to give us information we the government
 

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.459
to give us information we the government
right and there it's so we have

01:25:10.459 --> 01:25:10.469
right and there it's so we have
 

01:25:10.469 --> 01:25:12.649
right and there it's so we have
information on 300 million people none
