00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.070
- [Presenter] Let's talk
about primary elections,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.060
which are often known as primaries.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.700
One way to think about them is that

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.610
they're just preliminary elections

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.290
used to get down to a
fewer number of candidates.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.190
A very simple example would be

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.940
let's say there's a congressional
seat in your district,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.920
and there's three folks who
are interested in that position

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.560
who associate themselves
with the Democrats.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.920
And let's say there's also
three folks in your district

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.130
who are interested in
running for that position

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.870
who associate themselves
with the Republicans.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.740
There are some situations
where you can have

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.820
just a big preliminary election

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.310
where they all run against each other.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.940
We'll talk about that in a second.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.340
But, usually you have a situation

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.900
where they try to think about, well,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.050
let's just pick one to
represent the Democrats,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.630
and let's just pick one to
represent the Republicans.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.760
And so that's where the
primary election would happen.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.250
So you would have a Democratic primary

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.300
where these folks would
run against each other,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.660
and whoever gets the most
votes would then go on

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.970
to represent the Democratic
Party in that election.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.770
So let's say that person wins,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.170
then they will go on into
the general election.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.460
Likewise, these three folks
would run against each other

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.170
in the Republican primary,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.850
and whoever gets the most votes,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.330
let's say it's that
person right over there,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.930
they would go to the general election

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.430
to go against likely the
Democrat right over here.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.840
So this is the person who
would go against the Democrat.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.480
And then they are going to
compete in the general election

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.280
against each other, head to head,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.170
and then whoever gets that would
get the congressional seat.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.670
Now even in this type of primary,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.980
you could call this a partisan primary,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.600
there's an interesting question.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.150
Who votes in this
Democratic Party primary?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.770
Who votes in that?

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.647
And, who votes in the
Republican Party primary?

00:01:57.647 --> 00:02:00.030
And there's actually two systems for this,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.310
or two general buckets,
and there's some nuances

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.350
from region to region.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.700
But one way is that only
registered Democrats

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.350
could vote in the Democratic primary,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.570
pick who represents their
party in the general,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.650
and only registered Republicans

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.090
can vote in the Republican primary.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.750
That situation where only registered folks

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.100
can vote in their respective primaries,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.640
that is called a closed primary.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.890
It's called closed because it's not open

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.210
to just anyone who wants
to vote in the primary.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.810
Only the people who have already

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.190
registered in that party can vote.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.040
Now you can imagine the opposite of that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.040
is the open primary, so open primary,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660
where even though these
are partisan primaries,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.610
you are trying to figure out

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.400
who's going to represent the Democrats,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.780
and who's going to
represent the Republicans,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.960
you can allow people who are either

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.220
not affiliated with a party

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.400
or even people who are
affiliated with the other party

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.840
to vote in your primary.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.370
So, for example, in
this Democratic primary,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.660
there could be, for some reason,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.290
folks who feel passionate
about this candidate

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.190
who are actually registered Republicans

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.180
but who they wanna vote in this primary.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.680
Or you could have people
who are unaffiliated

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.270
who would vote in this primary

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.100
if we are dealing with an open primary.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.830
Now one interesting question is,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.430
is how could the dynamics change

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.413
if we're dealing with a open
versus a closed primary?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.270
Well, political scientists
like to think a lot about this,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.010
and even states like to think about this,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.460
in terms of what is appropriate?

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.040
What is most representative?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.570
What gives the people of that state

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.730
the fairest voice in their elections?

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.660
Now people who like closed
primaries might say, well look,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.970
we're trying to figure out who represents

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.820
the Democratic Party; it
should only be Democrats.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.850
We're trying to figure out who represents

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.960
the Republican Party; it
should only be Republicans.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.150
Now criticism of closed
primaries might be,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.330
well, if you limit who gets
to vote in the primary,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.390
then these candidates are only
going to cater to the base.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.170
They're only going to
cater to the interests

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.270
of people in their
party, and in particular,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.330
they might cater to people who are

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.520
at the extremes of their party.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.900
For example, let's say we
have a situation like this.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.290
Let's say that this is the
population right over here,

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.200
and people at the right end,
these are conservatives.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.113
Conservatives.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.253
Conservative.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.890
And these folks right
over here are liberal.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.650
And if you were to look at
the population as a whole,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.010
let's say the distribution
in the population.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.360
Let's say it looks something like this.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.460
You have some people here
who are quite liberal,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.820
and then you have actually
the bulk of the people

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.010
who are some place in between,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.550
and then you have another bump of folks

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.520
who are actually quite conservative.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.140
So you would guess that, hey, look,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.190
a view that's someplace in
between, maybe a moderate view,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.210
would actually maybe be most
representative of the people.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.410
But if you have closed
primaries, what might happen?

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.700
Well, the Democratic primary,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.680
the people who would be eligible to vote,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.828
would be these people right over here.

00:04:59.828 --> 00:05:01.220
It would be these people, the people

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.690
who have registered as Democrats.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.990
And in the Republican
primary, well, if it's closed,

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.870
only the registered
Republicans would vote,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.860
maybe these people right over here.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.870
And these people in the middle,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.140
these would be the
unaffiliated-with-a-party people.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.330
And so, if you have
different candidates here,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.900
let's say that this is candidate one,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.470
where they're here on the spectrum.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.990
This is candidate two, which
is here on the spectrum,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.570
and candidate three is
here on the spectrum.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.960
You could imagine that
for this population,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.410
they're all going to say things
that speak to this group.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.710
And in particular, they might actually,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.520
the person who wins, might
actually be very successful

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.270
of getting the people at the
extreme left right over here.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.640
And so that person maybe is a person

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.010
who goes off to the general election.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.310
Likewise, the same
thing might be happening

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.110
on the Republican side.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.290
You have the different candidates.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.090
Maybe their personal views
put 'em right over here.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.140
And it's this person who
is furthest to the right

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.630
who's really able to appeal
to the folks right over here

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.600
who ends up winning and
represents the Republican Party.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.070
Well then what happens
in the general election?

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.290
The entire population
has to pick between folks

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.540
that actually are more
indicative of either extreme.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.690
That maybe the closed primary system,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.580
it wouldn't have been
so good for a candidate

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.950
who is reasonably moderate
on the Democratic side.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.250
Maybe someone is there,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.550
or a candidate who is right over here.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.670
Or maybe there's a candidate

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.840
whose views are right in the middle.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.970
First of all, if they
want to represent a party,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.220
they would have to moot
pick one of these parties.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.160
And then to have a shot, they
would have to represent views

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.180
that would be to the left or to the right

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.170
of where they truly are,
and maybe they wouldn't have

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.860
as good of a shot as the people

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.810
who actually are quite liberal

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.540
or the folks who are actually
are quite conservative.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.900
So that's a criticism
of the closed primary.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.720
An open primary might make
this a little bit better,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.560
because you have these
registered Democrats here.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.650
But folks from here might decide, hey,

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.010
I wanna go vote there as well.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.550
So they might moderate things.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.040
Or folks from here might say, hey,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.260
I wanna go vote here as well.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.840
Now critics of an open primary would say,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.040
well those aren't the people who

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.020
really are registered in that party.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.530
And you could also have
a phenomenon of rating,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.770
where people maybe on the Republican side

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.440
could say, look, you know what?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.800
I know who's gonna win here.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.120
The Republican primary
doesn't need my vote.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.290
I'm gonna go and try to pick

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.660
the weakest candidate on the other side

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.230
so that in the general election,

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.820
my candidate has the best shot.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.510
Now third type of primary is known

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.630
as a blanket primary,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.040
often a nonpartisan blanket primary.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.270
In a nonpartisan blanket primary,

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.610
instead of going through
this partisan process,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.630
all the candidates here would go

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.380
into one preliminary election.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.250
And in that preliminary election,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.980
the top two candidates would then

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.543
go on to the general election.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.710
So two candidates are going to move on

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.040
in a blanket primary, a
nonpartisan blanket primary,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.610
and what's interesting there
is you can actually get

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.350
two candidates from the same party going.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.240
Proponents of a blanket primary say, hey,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.500
this is the fairest of it all.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.090
Instead of making things partisan,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.470
just let everyone run
against everyone else,

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.430
and the top two will then
get to the general election.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.840
Now you'll see all three of
these in the United States

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.830
at congressional elections
or even statewide elections.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.590
But if we're thinking about
presidential elections,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.740
we're thinking mainly about these two.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.450
And when we're talking
about presidential election,

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.440
these are part of primary season

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.860
where it's thinking
about how many delegates

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.330
candidates would get during
the national convention

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.900
where they actually pick their candidate.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.260
I'll leave you there.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.720
It's an interesting way to think

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.590
about the different ways of voting,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.226
especially voting in a preliminary way

00:08:54.226 --> 00:08:56.500
to get down to a fewer
number of candidates.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.943
I'll let you think about
which one you prefer.
