00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.940
Here's an interesting
problem involving perimeter

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.890
from the 2000 American
Invitational Mathematics Exam.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.830
So it says the diagram
shows a rectangle that

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.390
has been dissected into
nine overlapping squares.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.798
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:17.400
nine overlapping squares.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.380
Given that the width and
the height of the rectangle

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.180
are positive integers with
greatest common divisor 1-- so

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.180
they're talking about
the width and the height

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.665
of the rectangle.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:28.039
And the reason why they're
saying greatest common divisor

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.280
1 is they're saying that they
don't have a common divisor

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.100
that you can divide them both by
to get a more simplified ratio.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.480
And to think about
that is, we might

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.080
be faced with two choices,
one where maybe it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.540
this side over here is-- let me
draw it like this-- 5 and 15.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.720
But over here, our greatest
common divisor isn't 1.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.950
They're both divisible
by 5 over here.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.450
So what you'd want
to do is say, no.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.880
Instead of 5 and 15,
they need to be 1 and 3.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.990
Now you have the
same ratio of sides,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.160
but now their greatest
common divisor is 1.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.440
You kind of have it in the
simplified form or the most

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.170
simplified form if you divide
both this height and this width

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.910
by 5.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.020
So that's why they're saying
greatest common divisor 1.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.070
And then they say, find the
perimeter of the rectangle.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.861
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.360
And I encourage you to pause
it and try to do it on your own

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.910
before I bumble my way
through this problem.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.687
So let's start in the beginning.

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.270
Let's start at this square right
over here, the center square.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.500
And they did tell us
that they're all squares.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.180
So let's say that that square
right over here has a length

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.980
x and a height x.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.200
It's an x by x square.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.420
So let me write it.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.580
So this is an x,
and that is an x.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.250
So this is an x by x
square right over there.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.370
And then you have this
square right over here.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.520
And we don't know
its measurements.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.670
So let's say that this square
right over here is y by y.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.110
So it has y width, and
it also has y height.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.009
Now, what is this
square over here?

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.620
Well, this is an x
plus y by an x plus

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.730
y square, because the width
of these two squares combined

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.260
made the width of
this larger square.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.384
So what I'm going
to do is-- actually,

00:02:19.384 --> 00:02:21.050
this might be an
easier way to write it.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.633
Since these are all
squares, I'm going

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:26.320
to write the dimension of
that square inside the square.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.580
So this is going to
be an x by x square.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.470
Kind of a
non-conventional notation,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.790
but it'll help us keep
things a little bit neat.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.737
This is going to
be a y by y square.

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.070
So I'm not saying the area is y.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.230
I'm saying it's y by y.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.300
This over here is going
to be an x plus y times--

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.350
an x plus y is going to
be each of its dimensions.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.500
So it's going to be x plus
y height and x plus y width.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.270
Then this one over here-- well,
if this dimension is x plus y

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.080
and this dimension
right over here

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.455
is x, then this whole side or
any of the sides of the square

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:05.790
are going to be the sum of that.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.353
So x plus x plus y is 2x plus y.

00:03:13.087 --> 00:03:14.670
You can imagine that
I'm just labeling

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.530
the left side of each
of these squares.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.210
The left side of this
square has length y.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.450
Left side of this one, x.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.050
This one has x plus y.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.740
And then this is 2x plus y.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.120
And then we can go
do this one up here.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.600
Well, if this distance
right over here is 2x plus y

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.200
and this distance right
over here is x plus y,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.300
you add them together to
get the entire dimension

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.110
of one side of the square.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.285
So it's going to be 3x plus 2y.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.850
I've just added the 2x
plus the x and the y

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.720
plus the y to get 3x plus 2y
is the length of one dimension

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.080
or one side of this square.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.406
And they're all the same.

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:56.780
Now let's go to
this next square.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.900
Well, if this length is
3x plus 2y and this length

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.530
is 2x plus y, then this
entire length right over here

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.140
is going to be 5x plus 3y.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.590
5x plus 3y is going to be that
entire length right over there.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.370
And we can also go to
this side right over here

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.790
where we have this length--
let me do that same color.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.660
This length is 3x plus 2y.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.200
This is x plus y.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.250
And this is y.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.280
So if you add 3x plus
2y plus x plus y plus y,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.800
you get 4x plus-- what
is that-- 4y, right?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.240
2y, 3y, 4y.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.860
And then we can express
this character's dimensions

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.760
in terms of x and y because
this is going to be 5x plus 3y.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.720
Then you're going
to have 2x plus y.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.160
And then you're going to have x.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.326
So you add the x's together.

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:55.810
5x plus 2x is 7x, plus x is 8x.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.930
And then you add the
y's together, 3y plus y,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.470
and then you don't
have a y there.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.430
So that's going to be plus 4y.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.670
That's the dimensions
of this square.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.420
And then finally, we have
this square right over here.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.030
Its dimensions are going to
be the y plus the 4x plus 4y.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.510
So that's 4x plus 5y.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.890
And then if we think
about the dimensions

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.620
of this actual
rectangle over here,

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.130
if we think about its
height right over there,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.010
that's going to be 5x
plus 3y plus 8x plus 4y.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.410
So 5 plus 8 is 13.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.870
So it's 13x plus 3 plus 4 is 7y.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.887
So that's its height.

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:53.470
But we can also think
about its height

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.844
by going on the
other side of it.

00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:57.082
And maybe this will give
us some useful constraints

00:05:57.082 --> 00:05:58.540
because this is
going to have to be

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.610
the same length
as this over here.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.680
And so if we add 4x
plus 4x, we get 8x.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.660
And then if we add 4y
plus 5y, we get 9y.

00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:13.380
So these are going to have
to be equal to each other,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.260
so that's an
interesting constraint.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:24.022
So we have 13x plus 7y is going
to have to equal 8x plus 9y.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.310
And we can simplify this.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.130
If you subtract 8x from
both sides, you get 5x.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.990
And if you subtract
7y from both sides,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.510
you get 5x is equal to 2y.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.010
Or you could say x
is equal to 2/5 y.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.760
In order for these to
show up as integers,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.820
we have to pick integers here.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.236
But let's see if we have any
other interesting constraints

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:57.630
if we look at the bottom
and the top of this,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.260
if this gives us any
more information.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.750
So if we add 5x plus 3y plus
3x plus 2y plus 4x plus 4y,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.580
this top dimension-- 5
plus 3 is 8 plus 4 is 12.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.085
You get 12x.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.880
And then you get
3y plus 2y plus 4y.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.330
So that's 5 plus 4.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.480
That's 9y.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480
Plus 9y.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.760
That's this top dimension.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.460
And if you go down here,
you have 8 plus 4 is 12x.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.610
Let me do that same color.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.179
And then you have 4
plus 5 is 9y, plus 9y.

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:38.720
So these actually ended up to
be the same in terms of x and ,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.636
so they're not giving
us any more information,

00:07:40.636 --> 00:07:41.700
no more constraints.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.240
Obviously, 12x plus 9y is going
to be equal to 12x plus 9y.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.500
So our only constraint
on this problem

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.470
is what we got by setting
this left-hand side

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.610
to this right-hand side, is that
x needs to be equal to 2/5 y.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.150
So let's just pick
some numbers so

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.749
that we get nice
integers for x and y

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:01.290
and then we figure
out the perimeter.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.300
We want to make sure
that the dimensions don't

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.850
have any common divisors.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:14.290
So if we pick y to be 5, so
let's pick y to be equal to 5,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.150
then looking at this
constraint, what is x?

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.040
Well, then x is 2.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.350
It's going to be 2/5 times 5.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.800
So then x is equal to 2.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.350
So let's see what we get for
the dimensions of this rectangle

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.960
then.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.610
So the height of
this rectangle is

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:33.789
going to be 13 times 2 is
26, plus 7 times 5 is 35.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.970
So 26 plus 35 gets us what.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.460
That gets us to 61.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.652
This is equal to 61.

00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:42.159
Did I do that right?

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.120
You see the 55 plus 6 is 61.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.070
And then when you
look at its width,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.220
you have 12x, which
is 24, plus 9y.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.490
y Is 5, so plus 45.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.120
24 plus 45 is what?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.990
That is 69.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.817
And 61 and 69 do not share any
common divisors other than 1.

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:08.900
So it looks like we're
done, or we're almost done.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.566
We know the dimensions
of the rectangle.

00:09:10.566 --> 00:09:13.740
It is a 61 by 69 rectangle.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.580
And if you want its
actual perimeter,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.930
you just add them all up.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.910
So the perimeter
here is going to be--

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.380
we could have a drum roll now.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.160
The perimeter is
going to be 61 plus 69

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:32.810
plus 61 plus 69, which is equal
to-- well, 61 plus 69 is 130.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.400
That's another 130 right there.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.580
130 plus 130 is 260.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.330
So it actually wasn't
too bad of a problem

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.350
if we just started at the middle
and just built up from there,

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.480
built up the dimensions in terms
of the dimensions of these two

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.080
smallest squares.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.410
And then we were able
to find the perimeter.
