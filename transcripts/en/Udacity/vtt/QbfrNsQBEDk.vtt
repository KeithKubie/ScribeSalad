00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, power is work over the change in time. How much work is done? Well, look at the rock.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, the force we exert has to balance (mg), 2 kg&lt;i&gt;10 is 20 N and the distance is 15 m.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And since this is parallel to this displacement or this Î”x, we can just multiply them.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That means, if the work is equal to 20 times 15.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We know the time is equal to 30 secs and the calculated power, we just do work divided

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
by the change in time, 300/30, gives me a power of 10 watts.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Not too bad. Now, let's solve our problem.
