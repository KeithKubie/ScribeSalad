I'm going to fail my math test. I'm never
going to get those essays done on time. I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.690
know I'm going to do poorly in my game this weekend. My family is not proud of me.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.529
I don't think anyone is going to come to my
event. I always feel like someone's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.320
watching me.
I can't face the people in my club. I'm

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.789
not smart enough to be here. I look
horrible. It feels like I'm underwater

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.710
drowning. Do I even have any real friends?
My parents won't listen to me.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.829
No one wants to listen to me. There's no
one to turn to. You are not alone. You are

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.000
not alone. You are not alone. Your
experience is worth sharing. Your

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.119
experience is worth sharing. Your
experience is worth sharing
