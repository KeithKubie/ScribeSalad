00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.160
There is something that we
should add to our number line.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.430
On the right side,
we can write infinity.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.490
And on the left,
we can write negative infinity.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.270
These indicate that the number line
goes on forever in the positive and

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.400
in the negative direction.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040
Now that we know so much about number
lines, choose which of the following

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.880
statements are true, negative numbers
are always on the left of zero,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.480
positive numbers are always on the right
of zero, every number line will always

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.510
have the same scale, zero should
always be marked on a number line.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.740
Select all that apply.
