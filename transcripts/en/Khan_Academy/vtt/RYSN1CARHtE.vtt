00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:02.724
- [Instructor] Let's say that
I have a random variable X

00:00:02.724 --> 00:00:06.891
which is equal to the number
of dogs that I see in a day.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.606
And random variable Y is
equal to the number of cats

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:14.273
that I see in a day.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.593
Let's say I also know what
the mean of each of these

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:20.849
random variables are, the expected value.

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.258
So the expected value of X
which I could also denote

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.754
as the mean of our random
variable X let's say I expect

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:32.921
to see three dogs a day
and similarly for the cats,

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:38.879
the expected value of Y is
equal to I could also denote

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.046
that as the mean of Y is going
to be equal to and this is

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.857
just for the sake of (mumbles)
let's say I expect to see

00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:47.201
four cats a day.

00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:51.649
And pretty much we define how
you take the mean of a random

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.785
variable or the expected
value for a random variable.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.171
What we're going to think
about now is what would be

00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:01.338
the expected value of X plus
Y or other way of saying

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.646
that the mean of the sum of
these two random variables.

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:11.058
Well it turns out, and I'm
not proving it just yet,

00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:15.180
that the mean of the sum of
random variables is equal to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.099
the sum of the means.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:20.972
So this is going to be equal
to the mean of random variable

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:24.055
X plus the mean of random variable Y.

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:29.180
And so in this particular case,
if I were to say well what's

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.297
the expected number of dogs
and cats that I would see

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:34.119
in a given day.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.439
Well I would add these two
means, it would be three plus

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.979
four it would be equal to seven,
so in this particular case

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.146
it is equal to three plus
four which is equal to seven.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:51.012
And similarly if I were to ask
you the difference if I were

00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:55.179
to say how many more cats in
a given day would I expect

00:01:56.376 --> 00:02:01.062
to see than dogs, so the
expected value of Y minus X.

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:03.364
What would that be?

00:02:03.364 --> 00:02:05.961
Well intuitively you might
say well hey if we can add

00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:06.997
random...

00:02:06.997 --> 00:02:09.367
If the expected value of the
sum is the sum of the expected

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:12.049
values, then the expected
value or the mean of

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.485
the difference will be the
differences of the means

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:16.322
and that is absolutely true.

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:20.453
So this is the same thing as
the mean of Y minus X which is

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:24.620
equal to the mean of Y is going
to be equal to the mean of Y

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:32.401
minus the mean of X, minus the mean of X.

00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:37.065
And in this particular case,
it would be equal to four

00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:40.482
minus three, minus three is equal to one.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.397
So another way of thinking about
this intuitively is I would

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:51.564
expect to see on a given
day one more cat than dog.

00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:54.995
The example that I just
used this is discrete random

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:58.965
variables, on a given day I
wouldn't see 2.2 dogs or pi

00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:02.320
dogs, the expected value itself
does not have to be a whole

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.348
number 'cause you could of
course average it over many days.

00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:09.515
But this same idea that the
mean of a sum is the same thing

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.256
as a sum of means and the
mean of a difference of random

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:18.117
variables is the same as
the difference of the means.

00:03:18.117 --> 00:03:20.872
In a future video I'll do a proof of this.
