00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.630
Religion is sometimes thought of as the sworn
enemy of science, but can we actually use

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.270
science to better understand religion?

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.500
Now I’m not trying to get into a religious
debate here, so put your Twitter fingers away, alright?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.540
Using neuroscience, we can dive into how religion
is recognized by the brain.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.940
But first, let’s define a few things: Religion
is a set of beliefs and those beliefs are

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.940
correlated with activation of different parts
of our brains.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.820
That brings us to theory of mind.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.680
Theory of mind is our ability to interpret
one's own and other people's emotional and

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.520
mental states — including 
our desires and beliefs.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.439
Which means, religion and theory of mind may
be connected by people’s ability to imagine

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.129
a reality beyond one's own immediate sensory experience.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.219
If that’s true, then the same parts of the
brain that activate during theory of mind

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.440
tests will also activate when thinking about
G-O-D.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.269
And that’s just what scientists have found.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.620
When researchers asked people about theory
of mind tasks or to think about religion,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.890
the same regions of the brain lit up when
put under an fMRI, and neurotheologists –– the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.780
folks who study the intersection of religion
and neuroscience –– are interested in

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.350
why those parts light up.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.170
According to fMRI data, the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex, the anterior cingulate gyrus, the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.469
nucleus accumbens, and the parietal lobe are
all affected when subjects are prompted about

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:05.469
religion.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.329
In a study where 15 Christians and 15 “non-believers”
were asked about the existence of the big

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.009
G, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lit
up in all participants.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.060
This region of the brain is specifically responsible
for reward and perception of self-relevance.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.119
Remember “rewards” because we’ll come
back to that.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.880
Another region that lit up was the anterior cingulate gyrus.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.950
This part of the brain is thought to modulate
conflict, errors, and violations of our expectations.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.172
This suggests there was a degree of internal
conflict when subjects were asked to think

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:31.560
about a higher power.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.359
Even non-believers had this area light up,
because whether they chose Yahweh or the highway,

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.100
they were still experiencing some type of
uncertainty.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.679
In 2016, another study found that when Mormon
participants were in the midst of an intense

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.200
religious experience, it increased their heart
rates and activated parts of their brains

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.960
linked to rewards...the same way sex and drugs
do.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.160
Please don’t excommunicate me.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.490
This is science, I swear.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.369
The state is actually called “religious
euphoria” or “religious ecstasy.”

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.439
The nucleus accumbens, specifically, lit up
like a Christmas Tree ... which is another

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.509
reward center just like the the ventromedial
pre (oh my God this is so much to say I’m

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.860
just gonna say VMPFC, which is almost worse).

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.420
A 2010 study found that during religious activity,
there was a decrease in activity in the parietal

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.030
lobe, which processes physical sensory stimuli.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.280
Meaning, when people think about God, they’re
potentially experiencing a feeling of being

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.510
somewhat detached from their physical body.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.819
Does this mean those of us who practice a
religion are succumbing to a higher power?

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.819
Letting the Force flow through us, perhaps?

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.319
More research definitely needed.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.140
(If I could be a Jedi, I absolutely wouldn’t
be here talking to y’all.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.710
I say that as a friend.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.209
Moving things in my house.)

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.379
Science and religion seem to be like Azealia
Banks and staying out of drama but rather

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.040
than have them constantly at odds, perhaps
look at religion as a thing that developed

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.379
as part of human social cognition and behavior
over our evolutionary history.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.140
The development of our prefrontal cortex over
generations allows us to have that abstract,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.780
existential, and/or religious thought.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.170
And that’s an important part of what makes
us ‘human’-- as our brains were advancing

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.790
physically, religion and other belief systems
came about to help us connect and understand

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.870
each other.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.720
One common theme across religion is prosociality,
basically “love thy neighbor;” we relate

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.520
to one another through what we believe.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.331
And even if your beliefs are different from
your neighbors’, just remember ‘Theory

00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.200
of Mind’ — our brains have the capacity
to understand and interpret their thoughts

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.760
and perspectives, so just be good to each
other is all!

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.599
(Oh, and find out if midichlorians are real
and if they’re found in the parietal lobe

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.829
‘cause I’m really trying to use the Force
to clean my apartment.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:25.829
Laundry.

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:26.829
Clean.)

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.349
Yo, did someone say pray…ing mantis?

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.079
I’m pretty someone in here said praying
mantis.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.189

mantises, check out this video right here
