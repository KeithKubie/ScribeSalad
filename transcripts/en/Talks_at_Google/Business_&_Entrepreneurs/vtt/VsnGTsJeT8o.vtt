00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:07.000
JOSH GRISDALE: Thank you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.833
My name is-- again--

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.440
Josh Grisdale, and I
run Accessible Japan.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.650
And it's a website that shares
the accessibility features

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.410
of living in Japan with people
who are interested in visiting

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.970
that have a disability.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.780
I didn't grow up in
high Roppongi hills,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.230
but instead, when I looked out
my window, this is what I saw.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.510
And this is the view
from my bedroom.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.800
I live in a small,
small town outside

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.400
of Toronto called Oxbridge.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.640
And it was me, my sisters, my
parents, and about 20 sheep.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.450
So that's what I spend
most of my time looking at.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.580
Now, I have what's
called cerebral palsy.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.900
And it's a very
fancy way of saying

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.690
that I have brain damage.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.590
There's two ways to
describe brain damage.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.120
And after your brain
has finished developing

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.370
and you maybe have an accident
or something like that,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.150
then that would be a regular
type of brain damage.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.608
Cerebral palsy happens when
your brain is still developing,

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:03.210
so when you're very young.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.190
And because of that,
as you develop,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.160
your body will
develop differently.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.536
And it can have a wide variety.

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:11.910
For example, some
people can just

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.840
have a little bit of trouble
moving their arms around.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.430
And other people can be
completely-- have to stay

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.466
in bed all the time.

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.590
I'm somewhat in the middle.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.730
I'm classified as severe.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.750
But for me, the way it affects
me is my arms and my legs.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.050
So they're physically healthy,
but the signals from my brain

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.565
don't properly get conveyed
to move the muscles

00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:31.190
the way I want.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.380
And because it happened when I
was young, when I developed--

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.250
for example--

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.930
my hands, the muscles at the
bottom were always tight.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.051
And so as I grew bigger,
because it was tight,

00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:42.300
my hands started to bend down.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.216
So when you look at
pictures when I was a kid,

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:45.600
my hands were much
more straight.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.790
And so that's probably one
of the main differences

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.910
between regular brain
damage and cerebral palsy.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.440
So what's that mean
for my daily life?

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.871
Well, I have to have somebody
that's called a helper,

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.120
and maybe in English, it
would be more commonly called

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.203
a personal care assistant.

00:02:02.203 --> 00:02:03.820
So today, I'm here
with Hyashi San,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.160
so I'm very thankful for
his assistance every day

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.490
of my life.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.050
So what happens is people with
disabilities can get evaluated

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.670
by the city they're living in.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.160
And they get a certain
number of hours

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.950
that they can use
in their daily life.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.330
And then, you contract
with different companies

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.670
in your local area
and make schedules

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.784
for your daily routine.

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:29.200
So my helpers help me from the
first thing in the morning.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.150
So the first person I see in
the morning and last person

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.530
I see at night is my helper.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.465
And not so romantic, but--

00:02:34.465 --> 00:02:36.690
[LAUGHING]

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.650
But yeah, so they help
me get up in the morning

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.350
and have a shower, get dressed,
et cetera, get ready for work.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.920
And then after work, they help
me maybe with some shopping

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.457
or with cooking or
cleaning around the house.

00:02:48.457 --> 00:02:50.290
And then at night, they
help me get into bed

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.580
and do it all
again the next day.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.450
For when I go out, my daily
life requires a lot of planning,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.420
planning ahead.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.495
Not something I can just
jump on a train and go

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:01.650
meet somebody somewhere.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.540
I need to think, for
example, if that night I

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.370
have a helper scheduled,
I have to be back

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.500
before the helper
comes, or else I'll have

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.600
to pay the cancellation
fee, or I may not

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.964
be able to get into bed.

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:13.380
When I think about
transportation,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.560
I always have to
leave extra time.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.350
Any transfer usually takes
about 20 minutes longer

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.030
than it says on Google Maps.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.564
So I have to take those
things into account.

00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:25.230
When I'm going out
with friends as well,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.970
I need to think
about restaurants.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.280
It can be a very big challenge
to find a place to eat.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.490
It's a very simple
task for most people.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.500
But for me, because of
my electric wheelchair,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.930
it's very difficult to
get into many restaurants,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.950
particularly in Japan where
they tend to be very small.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.240
And I love Japan, but
I don't like genkan,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.210
because it's a step
that keeps me out.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.720
So it can be discouraging
at times trying to go out.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.059
Maybe you want to eat ramen,
and so you're out with friends,

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.100
you want to go get ramen.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.050
You find a lot of
delicious looking places,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.734
but you can't get
into any of them.

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:01.650
And then you have to go
to a family restaurant

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.608
or something like that.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:05.290
And so planning ahead
is very important

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.860
so you can figure out
what is available for you.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.830
So with all those
extra requirements,

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.740
why would I come to Japan?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.760
Well, it was talked
about earlier.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.890
I took a class in
Japanese in high school,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.260
and my Japanese teacher,
he really loved Japan.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.610
And that was infectious.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.650
And so I thought, oh,
I want to try going.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.992
And my parents, they'd
always encouraged

00:04:25.992 --> 00:04:26.950
me to follow my dreams.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.197
They always said that even
though you have a disability,

00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:32.530
you can do what other people
can do to a certain degree,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.810
or as same as them.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.140
It may just take a bit more
time or do things a little bit

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.650
differently.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.930
But you should always
follow your dreams.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.750
Now, they say they regret that,
because I've moved to Japan now

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.530
and never go home.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.454
But by the first
time I came, there

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.620
was really little to no
information on accessibility

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.030
in Japan.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.620
Now, Google was
around at that point.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.520
But if there's to find, then
your search results are zero.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.950
So through a lot of phone calls
and very, very vague books

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.210
and stuff, I decided
to take the risk,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.110
and I came to Japan with my
dad for a couple of weeks

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.970
back in the year 2000.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.675
And I was really surprised to
find how accessible Japan was.

00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:16.120
It was different than my
expectations, I think.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.724
And I realized that, hey,
this is a place I could live.

00:05:18.724 --> 00:05:20.140
And so after
finishing university,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.220
I decided I wanted to
come and move to Japan.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.200
When I did that, there
was a real requirement

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.580
for a lot of logistics.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.112
As I said, I need helpers.

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:31.070
In Canada, the government
provides the helpers,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.745
and in Japan as
well, the government

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:33.620
provides the helpers.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.520
But in the interim, I
needed to bring somebody

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.264
with me to take care of me until
I could get into the system.

00:05:39.264 --> 00:05:41.680
So I had to come with someone
for about six months until I

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.090
was able to get
fully in, as well

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.460
as finding a place to live.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.660
It can be very difficult
to find an apartment that's

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.540
accessible to wheelchair users.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.960
So, again, a lot of planning
and overcoming logistics.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.580
But I got here, and I've
been here for 10 years now.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.720
And as mentioned, I became a
Japanese citizen last year.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.940
And so I'm actually no
longer a Canadian citizen,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.000
because I had to give
up my citizenship.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.650
But here I am to stay for good,
whether you like it or not.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.000
[CHUCKLING]

00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:12.720
The company I work at right
now, it's called Azali Group.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.960
And one of their core
principles is giving back

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.420
to society and your
local community.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.800
And I feel the same way.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.190
And so I wanted to
use the experiences

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.300
I had as a person
with a disability that

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.110
has come from another
country, and there's probably

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.350
very few people like that
in Japan at the moment.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.250
So I thought I should use
what I have to give back.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.916
So that brought me to the
need for a lot of people face.

00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:39.290
And I think it's
well-illustrated

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.910
with those stairs here.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.400
Of course, it started
personal, when I just

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.290
wanted to go out with
friends or if I wanted

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.650
to go on vacation in
Japan, just the challenge

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.530
of finding the
right information.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.757
Because you don't want to
go on a vacation and then

00:06:53.757 --> 00:06:55.590
find out that you can't
get into your hotel,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.110
because that would
be very traumatic.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.390
So in doing a lot of research,
I was able to read Japanese now.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.250
So I was looking at
things in Japanese.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.702
I realized there still wasn't
much information in English

00:07:07.702 --> 00:07:08.910
for people with disabilities.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.510
And just as an
example here, you're

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.350
of course going to go to tourist
sites when you're coming here.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.584
And if you look at
this website, you

00:07:20.584 --> 00:07:22.750
look at the information
that's available in English,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.870
it has very basic things
like the regular hours,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.110
days closed-- which is
very useful information

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.279
for just your average visitor.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.070
But you don't know
anything about if you're

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.144
in a wheelchair,
what's available.

00:07:33.144 --> 00:07:34.810
If you go all the way
out there, are you

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.310
going to be able to
actually enjoy the place?

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.449
But if you look on
the Japanese site,

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:40.740
they have a lot of information.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.820
For example, how far can
you go up to the castle, are

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.440
there wheelchairs
available for rent,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.075
are there wheelchair toilets
available, where are they.

00:07:48.075 --> 00:07:49.450
So all that
information is there,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.530
but it's available
only in Japanese.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.630
So for most people,
they're not going

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.140
to necessarily go and look
and translate the website,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.140
because they figure, oh,
if it's not in English,

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.386
then there's nothing there.

00:08:02.386 --> 00:08:04.760
So there's a real difference
between English and Japanese

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.380
versions of places.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.930
As well for your
hotels, this website,

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.790
they have a universal twin.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.530
And sort of another side
note is that the phrasing

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.132
in Japan and in North
America, or Europe,

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:19.590
or wherever, it is
quite different.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.410
So a universal twin-- if
you said that to someone--

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.368
they'd have no idea what
you're talking about--

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:24.290
[LAUGHING]

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.230
--or a barrier free,
no way you would

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.804
know what that means in most
English speaking countries.

00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:31.470
Most people would
search for accessible.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.080
So even if it was written
in as barrier free,

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.350
that's not likely going
to click for somebody who

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.845
doesn't know the terminology.

00:08:38.845 --> 00:08:40.220
And then again,
on the same site,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.260
if you look at the
English page, the rooms

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.064
then have them list the
universal twin being available.

00:08:45.064 --> 00:08:46.730
Now, there's probably
a practical reason

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.000
to this, and that they
can't use the booking

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.580
system to book accessible
rooms for the most part,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.760
because they want to ensure that
it's people who actually have

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.290
disabilities that are using it.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.665
So generally, you need to have
some sort of communication

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.280
with the hotel to
book your room.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.960
And so maybe the
hotel made a decision

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.840
that don't have
enough English staff

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.880
to be able to handle
those requests.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.797
Or they might have
come to the idea

00:09:10.797 --> 00:09:13.380
that nobody in a wheelchair is
going to be coming and visiting

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.990
anyway, so there's no point
in translating this webpage as

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.360
well.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.100
So I realize that there's
a lot of challenges

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.060
that people who want to come
just for a vacation have.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.350
So that led me to the journey
of starting Accessible Japan.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.850
I like this picture,
my mom took it.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.933
I didn't know she took it.

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:33.320
And I wish she had a
better phone, though,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.040
for better pictures.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.420
So my mission statement
for Accessible Japan

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.490
is to provide as much
information as possible

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.370
on accessibility in Japan so
travelers with disabilities

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.750
can make informed decisions
based on their needs,

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.827
so they can enjoy
Japan to its fullest.

00:09:48.827 --> 00:09:50.910
So the end result is I
want people to enjoy Japan.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.840
I love Japan, that's
why I've moved here,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.850
and that's why I want
to stay here forever.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.315
And I want people to
enjoy Japan as well.

00:09:58.315 --> 00:09:59.940
But a lot of people
with disabilities--

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.740
when they're looking
for places to go--

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.850
if there's not the
information there,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.740
they don't want necessarily
spend all the money

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.448
to come over here if
they don't know what

00:10:06.448 --> 00:10:08.770
they're going to come into.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.230
So I try to get as much
information as possible.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.790
And there are so many different
types of disabilities.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.380
I can't say this
place is accessible,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.921
or this place is not accessible,
because that's not something

00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:20.269
I can decide for everybody.

00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:22.560
So what I do is I try to
provide as much information as

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.080
possible, and then
they can make decisions

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.230
based on their own needs, and
whether they go to those places

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.030
or not.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.340
So Accessible Japan has
been constantly pivoting

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.160
and updating and evolving.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.100
I'd like to take credit for all
of the ideas, but a lot of them

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.660
come from just interacting with
people who have contacted me.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.200
For example, I have a page
on bringing your guide

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.250
dog to Japan.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.020
That's not something
I've ever considered.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.394
But somebody asked
me a question,

00:10:50.394 --> 00:10:53.070
well, what's the system like for
bringing a guide dog to Japan?

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.210
And because of that idea, that
part of the webpage was born.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.980
So it's constantly
been changing.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.716
At first, it was just
basic information

00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:03.340
on how to get around,
maybe on a train,

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.770
or what it's like to
try to find a hotel,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.300
or just sort of very general
ideas, as well as a blog.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.180
And they use the blog to
introduce different parts

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.880
of Japan to people.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.040
For example, how to
find a restaurant

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.720
if you have a wheelchair, or
even parts of Japanese culture.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.660
So there's anime
there, A Silent Voice.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.836
And the character from
that story, she's deaf.

00:11:32.836 --> 00:11:34.210
So she has trouble
communicating.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.610
And so that's sort of part
of the story in general

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.830
about human communication.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.329
So somebody wrote
a review for that.

00:11:39.329 --> 00:11:42.000
So I put that on there as well.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.810
And then, of course, I have
a YouTube channel as well.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.630
I use YouTube differently than
a lot of people use, in that I

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.520
look at people's
reviews of places

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.530
and don't really listen
to what they're saying.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.196
But I'm constantly
looking at the ground

00:11:53.196 --> 00:11:56.674
to see if there's steps or
if there's any barriers.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.590
So because of that, I
realized, oh, I probably

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.350
should have some videos as well.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.400
Because it speaks much more than
a few pictures or my comments.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.500
So I try to provide as much
information in the videos

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.000
as well.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.740
And again, going
back to the hotels,

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.170
I've created a searchable
database of hotels

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.430
with accessible rooms.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.550
If you go to places like
Rakuten or other travel sites,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.950
you have a little checkbox in
the extra information where

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.359
you can check off is
accessible or not.

00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:26.900
But usually, that just says that
there is an accessible room.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.480
It's still up to you to go
and research everything.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.110
So I try to correlate all the
information I could get and put

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.890
it into the database.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.120
So I got that either
through what information

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.720
is available on the websites,
or contacting the hotels

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.820
with surveys and asking,
as well as getting people

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.020
to put their own reviews on.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.800
And a lot of the
things include toilets.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.300
This will come up
a couple of times,

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.339
so I hope you're
used to toilets.

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:55.880
It's something
everybody needs to do.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.640
And it's something
that's very important

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.580
if you're going to be spending
the money to stay at a place.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.392
And in places like Europe
or in North America,

00:13:03.392 --> 00:13:04.975
there are very strict
rules about what

00:13:04.975 --> 00:13:06.730
an accessible room is like.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.677
They have maybe what
angles the walls are at,

00:13:10.677 --> 00:13:12.760
how you can approach the
toilet, how much space is

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.160
between the beds, et cetera.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.150
And it's all very
well-dictated, so you can--

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.650
in general, with assurance--

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.445
rent a room, and you know
you're going to be OK.

00:13:21.445 --> 00:13:24.320
Where in Japan, it tends to
be more general guidelines

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.580
of what's accessible.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.340
So you can find two
hotels with a quote

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.860
unquote, "accessible rooms."

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.767
And one will have maybe some
handlebars next to the toilet.

00:13:32.767 --> 00:13:33.350
And that's it.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.474
And that's the only difference
from a regular room.

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:37.960
And other places will have
these huge sprawling rooms

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.240
with a toilet that's
covered in white towels

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.400
and looks like a hospital
with all these equipment

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.080
that you've never seen before.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.050
So it can be quite a variety.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:50.290
So I try to show that on the
reviews of the hotels as well.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.020
Bathrooms-- of course, the
showers are difficult at times,

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.850
because people can't necessarily
get into the bathtub.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.690
A lot of places in North America
will have a roll-in shower

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.140
so you can drive your wheelchair
right into the shower area.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.610
But a lot of places in Japan--

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.040
very, very few have those.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.740
So I had a little
life hack is that you

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.840
can see on the ground
there-- there's

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.725
actually a drain on the floor.

00:14:12.725 --> 00:14:14.350
So as long as you
don't tell the staff,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.067
you can put the chair next to
the bath tub and shower there.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.400
As well as just information
on what the rooms look like.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.860
So not all of them have
that kind of information,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.286
but as much as I can get.

00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:27.160
As well, of course,
people want to see things

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.460
when they come to Japan.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.170
So I write reviews
of attractions.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.170
Because I live in Tokyo,
most of the attractions

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.740
tend to be in Tokyo area.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.720
But I have some others as well.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.730
So they have general information
like a regular Japan guide

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.105
or whatever, would have some
background information-- how

00:14:41.105 --> 00:14:43.700
to get there, what the
hours are, et cetera.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.890
But I go into other
details as well.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.160
For example, if they say
they have an elevator,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.190
I try to try it out
and see what it's like.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.700
So sure, on the website it
says there's an elevator,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.700
but I wouldn't be able
to use this one by myself

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.200
because there's not enough
room to turn around or push

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.140
the buttons.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.590
But again, that doesn't mean
that you can't go there,

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.290
just you should know
that in advance.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.690
As well as maybe
for the gardens,

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:09.440
the routes that are available
for accessible travel.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.620
Like this is Rikugien, I think.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:17.249
And it has quite extensive
coverage of the grounds.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.040
But some places, they
only have maybe about

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.629
a quarter of the place
is actually accessible.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.170
So if you're going
to be going there,

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.650
you might not want to
intentionally go to that area.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.900
And just little things
that may occur along

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.510
your path, such as these steps.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.510
And, of course, toilets.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.240
It is only one more mention
of toilets, so bear with me.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.360
So yeah, when you're
going out, it's

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.670
an essential thing that most
people don't think about.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.440
But if you're going
to be traveling around

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.690
and you need to use a
toilet in the pinch,

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.700
you want to know that
something's available.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.190
So this helps people go
out and just sort of rest

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.790
assured that there
is something there.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.810
And I don't need to
worry about it too much.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.070
Next things I added, a general
glossary and phrasebook

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.860
for Japanese to English.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.660
And again, that was
started because someone

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.910
asked me some questions--
how do you say this or this?

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:07.870
So I translated,
and I thought, oh, I

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.040
should put a page on that.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.810
And actually, Lonely
Planet contacted me,

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.560
and they're going to
use this as the basis

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.440
for their accessible
travel guides.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.420
And tourists.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.970
I'm not a person
who likes tours.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.580
Normally, I like to
go out on my own path.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.580
But a number of people
were interested in tours.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.163
And so I was able to work with
a couple of different companies

00:16:27.163 --> 00:16:30.850
to consult on accessible
tours in Japan.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.680
This company is called
Inside Japan Tours.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.780
And they sort of offer
a complete package,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.196
but there's a
couple of other ones

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:38.390
I work with that
have just day tours.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.050
And so yeah, it
gives them a chance

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.560
to experience what it's like
to go around and give a tour.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.120
So we went to a couple of
different tourist locations

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.620
in Tokyo.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.060
We rode the train together.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.960
Because it's one
thing just to sort

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.215
of read something on
the website, and this

00:16:51.215 --> 00:16:53.890
is how it works, as opposed
to actually experience it.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.360
And within a couple of months
of actually having this tour,

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.920
they had their first
disabled guest.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.220
And so they're able to give
that person a tour around Japan

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.730
because of the consulting.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.849
And I'm writing in Accessible
Japan wheelchair number one,

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.040
but this is number two
here on the screen.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.470
A lot of people actually
request wheelchairs

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.319
or other medical
equipment in pinches.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.569
For most people, they take
their wheelchair with them.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:20.680
But there's been
times where I've

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.349
been contacted that somebody--
maybe they broke their leg two

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:24.760
weeks before their vacation.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.560
I need to rent a wheelchair.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.497
Or I'm going with my grandmother
and she can't walk very far.

00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:31.330
Do you know a place I
can rent a wheelchair?

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.280
I don't want to buy one
just for coming to Japan.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.494
So I tend to work
with rental companies

00:17:38.494 --> 00:17:39.660
for providing most of those.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.380
So I subcontracted them.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.900
But yeah, if I'm in a
pinch, this one can fold up.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.312
And it's in a bag, and I
can send it by takkyubin

00:17:47.312 --> 00:17:49.270
to anywhere in the country
within a day or two.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.190
And then, of course, people
want to take something with them

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.160
sometimes to carry
all their information.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.647
And even if they have
a phone with them,

00:17:59.647 --> 00:18:01.480
they don't want to use
the data or something

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.770
to search on the website.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.310
So I made the Accessible
Japan travel guide for Tokyo.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:11.380
And it's available right now,
if you want to buy it on iTunes.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.040
And look at that,
it's got five stars.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.990
And recently, I started
a forum for the website.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.170
A lot of the interactions with
guests or with different people

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.410
have been very
important questions

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.922
that if you're just doing
email, it's sort of one-on-one.

00:18:28.922 --> 00:18:30.880
And only people that are
involved in that email

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.201
can see the information.

00:18:32.201 --> 00:18:33.700
But a lot of the
questions, I think,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.500
could be very helpful
to other people as well.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.930
So in a forum kind of
base, then it's searchable.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.250
People can find it when
they're looking for things.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.780
As well, if there's
something I want

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.300
to put some information on
that doesn't necessarily

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.510
require a full page, just
having a little bit of way

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.710
to add quick information
has been a big help.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.270
And I've been growing steadily.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.360
Compared to last
year, it's pretty much

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.610
doubled in access
just in the last year.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.110
So that is very exciting,
except the more exciting thing

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.320
is communication with people
who are using the website.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.924
And recently, I was contacted
by someone who said,

00:19:10.924 --> 00:19:12.340
your site has
really encouraged me

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.851
to take my daughter to Japan.

00:19:13.851 --> 00:19:15.850
She has cerebral palsy
and cannot walk very long

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:16.790
distances.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.850
So she needs a wheelchair
to usually get around.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.830
We're planning a
trip for next year.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.670
And so when I talked
with this person,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.100
his daughter loves anime.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.200
So her dream is to go to
Akihabara and Nakano Broadway.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.680
And so he was asking
about Nakano Broadway.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.830
And actually, I'm not an anime
fan, so I never heard of it.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.260
But I took the opportunity
to add that to the website.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.764
So I went and did
a review of it.

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.430
But that was a real
encouragement to me,

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.800
because that's the whole
purpose of this website

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.620
is to encourage people to
come to Japan and enjoy it.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.520
And to have someone actually
say that because of this, I

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.330
had the courage to
bring my daughter here.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.440
So Accessible and Google have
a very strong relationship.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.416
I think the first thing
is our shared goals.

00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:06.540
And Google's, of course,
is to organize the world's

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.998
information and
make it universally

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:09.250
accessible and useful.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.550
And I think that's a very common
goal that we have as well.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.590
I'm sort of maybe a
microcosm of that,

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:20.435
in that I'm using very
niche information that not

00:20:20.435 --> 00:20:22.310
a lot of people use,
but put it in one place,

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.143
and make it accessible
and useful to people.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.400
In my day-to-day use,
of course, Google search

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.774
is probably the biggest
thing I use in a two way

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:34.690
kind of communication.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.440
So people find Accessible
Japan through Google search.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.680
Because of the nature of the
website being preparation

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.300
for traveling somewhere,
it tends that people only

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.860
use it until they go to Japan.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.776
And then after that,
they don't really return.

00:20:49.776 --> 00:20:51.850
So the majority of my
visitors are new visitors.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.440
So through Google
Search, they're

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.010
able to find the website,

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.790
And then, for myself, because
I can't go to every place

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.690
that I need to go to or just
to answer random questions that

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.770
come up, I'm constantly
Googling things.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.515
So I'm very, very, very
grateful for your work.

00:21:06.515 --> 00:21:08.890
And you can definitely put me
at the top of the rankings,

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.510
if you want--

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.010
hint, hint.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.440
Google Analytics is something
else I use quite frequently.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.604
And I'm actually
slightly addicted to it.

00:21:17.604 --> 00:21:18.520
I have it on my phone.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.840
I'm quietly checking how
many visitors I get today.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.684
But more importantly
it helps me to focus.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.100
Through looking
at the statistics,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.376
I can see, OK, well this area of
the website isn't very popular.

00:21:30.376 --> 00:21:31.750
People aren't
using it very much.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.810
But this area is
getting a lot of hits.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.685
So people have definitely
interest in this area.

00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:39.310
Because I have a
limited amount of time

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.770
that I can focus on this.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.080
So I can put my effort
into places where

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.130
people can benefit the most.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.580
Google Maps, of course,
is essential for the hotel

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.210
searches, as well as for me
for looking up information

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.160
and routes for people.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.360
And, of course,
servers aren't free.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.210
So Google Adsense helps
offset some of the costs

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.210
for running the website.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.724
So I'm very thankful for that.

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.140
And then, just
sort of in closing,

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.590
I just wanted to have some
general disability and Google

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.300
working together, and
the essentials of that.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.740
So I think it's important to
have a wide variety of input

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.519
on products.

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:22.310
So whether it's either
customers, or people

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.851
who are working for
the company, they

00:22:23.851 --> 00:22:25.260
can have input to those things.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.230
And you can find some
unexpected things.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:30.560
You've heard probably many times
about somebody invented some

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.620
product that they thought was
going to go off and sell really

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.090
well, but it doesn't.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.761
But then, they had some
unexpected use case for it.

00:22:37.761 --> 00:22:39.260
And that ended up
turning into being

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.080
some huge, different,
world-changing idea.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.710
So I encourage you to look
for unexpected use cases.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.080
And a lot of people with
disabilities have them.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.470
For example, Street View.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.190
Most people maybe
would use it for when

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.740
they're driving to look
for, OK, I can turn here.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.520
This is the landmark
I'm looking for.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.120
Or probably the most amount of
people use Google and say, hey,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.230
look, there's my house.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.188
They get excited when
they see their car parked

00:23:03.188 --> 00:23:05.540
in front or something, or
their dog or something.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.870
For me, I use it all the time
to do quick accessibility spot

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.650
checks.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.630
So if somebody asks
me a quick question,

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.640
I can go in, look at
it on Street View,

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.340
and I can give a rough idea
of what kind of barriers

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.449
they might face, if there's
steps or something like that.

00:23:19.449 --> 00:23:20.990
I use it on my own
life as well, when

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.120
I'm looking for maybe like
a restaurant or something.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.245
If there's no information
available on the website,

00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:27.952
I can go to Street View
and I can see, oh, oh,

00:23:27.952 --> 00:23:28.910
that's in the basement.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:29.785
I can't get in there.

00:23:29.785 --> 00:23:31.130
Or oh, it's on the first floor.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.320
I can get in no problem and not
need to worry about it anymore.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.400
Remote desktop, as
I mentioned before,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.060
I have my helpers help me.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.910
And when I get into bed, I'm not
necessarily ready to sleep yet,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.660
and I still have some
things I want to do.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.020
But because of the
schedules, it's firm.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.140
I can use Google Chrome
remote desktop for my phone

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.950
to keep working on my computer.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.130
So that's an unexpected
thing, I think, probably

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.155
for most people.

00:23:55.155 --> 00:23:56.530
And I think a big
thing coming up

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.870
is Google Home and
the smart speaker,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.552
and IoT devices in general.

00:24:00.552 --> 00:24:03.010
I think it's going to be a very
big game-changer for people

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:03.997
with disabilities.

00:24:03.997 --> 00:24:05.580
Most of the commercials--
except-- are

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.687
about families getting up
in the morning and saying,

00:24:08.687 --> 00:24:09.520
hey, turn on the TV.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.490
And everybody gets
excited about that.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.020
But I think more
important is that somebody

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.720
who can't move and can't use
their arms and legs very well

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.410
can use that.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.780
And they can live a
more fulfilling life

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:24.250
without as much need for
other people to help them out.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.020
I've dropped the remote control
on on my TV at times when

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.270
there's been no helper around.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.470
And I can't pick it up.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:33.740
And thanks to my Chromecast, I
can watch something else on TV

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.900
without having to
worry about that.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.610
So look for those
unexpected use cases.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.960
And since I have your
undivided attention,

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.920
I brought a dream list with
me for some Google products,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.680
and mostly Maps, I think--
because that has the biggest

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.140
impact for a lot of people's
lives, or at least for mine,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.700
anyways.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.350
Accessible exits.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.500
Right now, I think
on Maps, it will

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.860
show you where the exits are
for train stations and subways,

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.040
but not necessarily which
one has the elevator at it.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.990
And I spend numerous minutes
of my day trying to find

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.600
which place has an actual exit.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.190
And that doesn't
come up sometimes.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.560
And if it had that,
that could really

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.050
make things a lot easier
and smooth for transfers,

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.480
or just going out and about.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.980
As well as toilets.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.840
This is the last
time, I promise.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.960
There was an app that I used
to use called Check A Toilet.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.320
It's a Japanese sort of
crowdsourced application.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.170
And so people would
use the Maps API,

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.420
and they'd put
pins down for where

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.930
there were accessible toilets.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:42.540
And they could share pictures
and information on them.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.640
But because nobody's
really been updating it,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.930
it's been depreciated.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.580
So you can't actually
use it anymore.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.400
So if it could be included
into Google Maps somehow,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.730
where the nearest toilets are.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.290
Because that could help
a lot of people, I think.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.760
That was the last
toilet thing, I promise.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.520
Inaccessible route
option as well.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.150
Right now, you can choose
things like minimize transfers

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.160
or minimize walking distance.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.410
If there is an option
for accessible route,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.080
a number of times, if you
choose the walking path and you

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.580
come to a busy
street, it'll go over

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.860
the bridge to cross the street.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.990
And that's the path that
you're usually shown.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.730
But, of course, that
doesn't work for me.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:20.960
So sometimes, I'm
following the map,

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.970
and all of a sudden, uh-oh.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.011
There's a bunch of steps.

00:26:23.011 --> 00:26:24.540
I can't get over
to the other side.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.390
So having some sort
of accessible route

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.960
would be fantastic.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.350
Accessible hotel rooms,
whether they have them or not.

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.810
When you search in Maps,
you choose a hotel.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.940
And on the left hand
side, it will show you,

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.590
for example, what
the price range is

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.190
or the website, the
phone number, et cetera.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.430
And lately, thank you
very much for adding

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.420
accessible stations on for the
train stations, I noticed that.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.640
If you have the same thing
for accessible hotels,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.635
so if it had just
an extra line that

00:26:53.635 --> 00:26:55.980
said accessible room
available, yes or no,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.614
that could definitely help a lot
of people searching for hotels.

00:26:59.614 --> 00:27:01.030
And indoor mapping,
of course, I'm

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.738
sure that's something
Google's working on

00:27:02.738 --> 00:27:07.044
and could help for finding your
way around finding elevators

00:27:07.044 --> 00:27:07.960
instead of the stairs.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.450
Because a lot of those
elevators are buried way deep

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.180
into different areas.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.960
And maybe possibly bug
bounties for accessibility.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.850
I'm not sure if you
know, but in Japan, there

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.900
are a lot of places
called workshops.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.700
So for people with
different disabilities

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.620
that can't get regular
jobs, maybe they

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.780
work in these special
workshops where they'll maybe

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.290
sort bottle caps or
they'll put chopsticks

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.539
into the holders, et cetera.

00:27:33.539 --> 00:27:35.080
And it's sort of a
way to have people

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.760
with intellectual
disabilities have a job.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.090
If they could maybe
team up with Google,

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.800
it could be a good
CSR opportunity

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.560
to maybe go and check
the information that's

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.100
been added to the
local guides about

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.730
whether a place is
accessible or not.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.701
And finally, it's remember that
accessibility benefits many.

00:27:55.701 --> 00:27:57.450
Everybody maybe thinks
that, oh, well it's

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:58.980
for a certain group of people.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.230
But if we all live long
enough, everybody's

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.250
going to become
disabled in some way--

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.510
whether it's your eyesight gets
poorer, or your knees go out

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.270
and you can't walk as far.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.830
So I think is should be thought
of not as special money used

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.930
on this group, but as opposed
to investment in your future.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.190
And that's why accessibility
is very important.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.700
Today, I was on the way and
I transferred at Morista.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.800
And in front of me
in the elevator,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.240
there's an elderly couple.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.420
And there's a couple of
mothers with baby strollers.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.280
And there's people
with injuries.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.050
And those people
are all using things

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.508
that were quote
unquote, "designed"

00:28:35.508 --> 00:28:36.760
for people with disabilities.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.120
So it's important to
remember that accessibility

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.950
is for everyone.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.440
It's also for the person
delivering packaging.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.740
They also appreciate the
slopes and the elevators.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.092
And then finally, a
real dream request

00:28:50.092 --> 00:28:51.800
is I know that you
guys are trying to get

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.091
as much information on mapping.

00:28:53.091 --> 00:28:55.760
So if you need another
Google car, let me know.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.840
You can strap it on the
back of my wheelchair.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.929
And I will gladly go
wherever you want me to.

00:28:59.929 --> 00:29:01.220
All right, thank you very much.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.170
[APPLAUSE]
