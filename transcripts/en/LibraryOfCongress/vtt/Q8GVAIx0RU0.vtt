00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.860
&gt;&gt; It's a pleasure to introduce
the presenters this evening.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.580
Dan Rothstein is Co-Director of
The Right Question Institute.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.160
He is Co-Author with Luz
Santana of Make Just One Change,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.550
Teach Students to Ask Their
Own Questions, the book,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.620
which first introduced the
Question Formulation Technique.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.250 position:63%
Dan's work focuses on honoring and
supporting the work of 200,000 educators

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.540 position:70%
who are driving a movement in urban, suburban
and rural communities to help students learn

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.950 position:58%
to ask better questions and take
more ownership of their own learning.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.630 position:58%
Dan has a Doctorate from Harvard, The
Harvard Graduate School of Education.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.280 position:59%
And Andrew P. Minigan is The Right
Question Institute's Education Project

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.420
and Research Coordinator.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.900 position:70%
He leads the search on Templeton Foundation
Funded Million Classrooms Campaign which aims

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.830 position:66%
to nurture student curiosity and cultivate
critical thinking skills through the use

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.650 position:56%
of the Question Formulation
Technique in one million classrooms.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.440
Andrew has an Education Masters in
Human Development and Psychology

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.450 position:72%
from The Harvard Graduate School of Education.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.060 position:64%
Welcome Dan and Andrew, and take it away.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.000 position:64%
&gt;&gt; I would just like to thank the Library
of Congress for this great opportunity.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.430
And we have Twitter and please
feel free to follow us.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.910 position:59%
We offer many resources and materials
on our website, www.RightQuestion.org.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.460 position:56%
And this helps support the work of
the educators who are using the QFT.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.290 position:70%
We'd also like to thank the search on
Templeton Foundation and the Hummingbird Fund

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.040
for the support of the Million
Classrooms Campaign.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.820 position:69%
And again, I'd like to thank the Library of
Congress for inviting us to do this webinar.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.180 position:69%
And I'd like to now introduce Dan who will
be sharing how this work began and the start

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.860 position:61%
of the work in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.830
&gt;&gt; Great to be here.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.490 position:61%
Tonight we'll have a, a chance to look
at addressing the fundamental challenge

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.380
in education that students
are not asking questions,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190
a chance to experience the
Question Formulation Technique,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.760
see examples of classroom
use and students questions.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.810 position:64%
We'll have a chance to identify the value
of teaching students to ask questions,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430 position:56%
and reflect on different ways to use
the Question Formulation Technique.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.030
Our work began more than 20
years ago when Luz Santana and I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.490
and several other people were
working in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.830 position:64%
And we learned from parents, that we were
working on dropout prevention program.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.040 position:72%
And our role was to try to engage more parents
to participate in their children's education.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.980 position:73%
And the parents told us, we don't go to the
schools because we don't even know what to ask.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.450 position:63%
So we thought we had a solution to that.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.100 position:66%
We could come up with a list of questions.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.150 position:63%
But what they actually named was a more
fundamental problem, is that the ability

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.750 position:61%
to ask one's own questions, to know how
to organize your thinking around things

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.960 position:63%
that you're not familiar with, that you
don't know, is really the key challenge.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.350 position:67%
So what we really needed to do was relaying
to look at how do we teach that skill.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.960 position:73%
So we began our work, working with parents, and
ASCD recently published a book on our strategy

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.290 position:63%
for working with parents to get them
more involved as partners with educators

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.490
and in children's education, we
also began to work in healthcare

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.470 position:67%
and we saw a National Institute's of Health
Study that showed a doubling and tripling

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.280 position:66%
of patient activation engagement when they
used the Question Formulation Technique.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.920
We, it began to be noticed by
people in the private sector,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.430
in Warren Berger's book,
A More Beautiful Question.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.490
He featured the strategy as
a way to promote innovation.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.010 position:70%
And we also began to use the strategy with
border engagement efforts for people to begin

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.150 position:64%
to learn to ask questions about
decisions and elections that affect them.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.100 position:69%
So we began to then hear from other people
who were also acknowledging the significance

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.040
of the importance of learning
to ask your own questions.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.580 position:70%
And Stuart Firestein, a professor at Columbia
University wrote a beautiful book called

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.440
Ignorance How it Drives Science.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.160 position:59%
And he said that his graduate students
come in, they see a 1400 page textbook

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.490 position:75%
and they think that's all that there is to know.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.970
But actually, he said, that
simply is what we know.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.940
What we don't know is much greater.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.760
So our students really need to
learn how to think in questions.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.270
How to manage ignorance.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.320 position:70%
College presidents were asked by New York
Times, what should students learn in college?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.540
Leon Botstein said, of Bard
College, of Bard College said,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.230 position:61%
the primary skills should be analytical
skills of interpretation inquiry.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.760 position:70%
In other words, know how to frame a question.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.120 position:73%
Nancy Cantor, at the time the Chancellor of the
University of Illinois said, the best we can do

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.560
for students is to have them
ask the right questions.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.390 position:61%
What do college students say about what
they learned in school, in college?

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.570
Barely a quarter of them say
that they really learned,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.690
that they were taught how
to ask their own questions.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.950 position:73%
The problem clearly begins long before college.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.210 position:70%
So take a moment and look at this slide here.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.320 position:64%
You see a generally upward slope of basic
skill attainment and reading and writing.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.230
There's still a lot of work
to keep it moving further up,

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.620 position:58%
but you see a generally upward slope.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.060
Now look at this next slide.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.530 position:63%
That yellow line is the line of asking
questions, and you see a general decline

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.200 position:75%
from the age of four, just about when students
are entering school, and it declines all the way

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.310
down to maybe a quarter of
students actively asking questions

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.370 position:56%
by the time they finish high school.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.420
So our work, and the work
that we can do together is

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.820 position:63%
on changing the direction of that slope.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.020
And we're not alone.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.430 position:61%
There are more than 200,000 educators
around the world now using the strategy

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.840 position:59%
of the Question Formulation Technique
that we will explore in-depth tonight,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.690 position:66%
and they're doing that without any mandate
or requirement because it solves a problem

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.420
that they see in front of them
every day, and that's the problem

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.400 position:58%
that we're going to work on together.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.040
So what happens when students
learn to ask their own questions?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.720 position:70%
Well John Hedy's research shows that
self-questioning is a metacognitive strategy,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.370
improves students rate of
learning by nearly 50%.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.930
This is a very significant gain

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.870
and very significant indication
of how important the skill is.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.910 position:69%
Students questions then serve as a catalyst
for their curiosity, for greater engagement,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.450 position:58%
for more ownership of their learning,
and it leads to deeper learning.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.360
And what do students say?

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.930 position:56%
Students talk about, just when you
think you know all you need to know,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.610 position:58%
you ask another question and discover
how much more there is to learn.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.970 position:61%
That's what a sixth grade student said
in California, that sense of discovery.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.620 position:56%
Now here's another student who's in
a, a high school in Boston who said,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.790 position:58%
when you ask the question you feel
like it's your job to get the answer.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.740
So imagine that.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.960
Imagine you have your students in
front of you, and they're excited

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.590 position:67%
because they've discovered another question
they, they discover how much more there is

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.200 position:66%
to learn, exactly what Professor Firestein
at Columbia University had mentioned.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.710 position:66%
And then you have a student who says, he
feels like it's his job to get the answer.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.370 position:69%
Think about what that would mean if, if your
students were feeling that all the time.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.600 position:63%
Students, in this process of the, using
the Question Formulation Technique learn

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.110
to produce their own questions,
learn to improve their questions,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.700 position:70%
strategize on how to use their questions,
and learn to reflect on what they've learned.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.820
So now we're going to take a
moment to have a quick exercise

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.430 position:59%
in the Question Formulation Technique.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.740
It's your turn.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.470
So we're going to start with basic
rules for producing questions.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.540
And look at these our rules.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.870 position:58%
Ask as many questions as you can, do
not stop to answer, judge or discuss,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:54.810 position:69%
write down every question exactly as stated,
and change any statements into questions.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.230 position:59%
Those are four rules we often ask
people to spend a little time thinking

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.390
about what might be difficult
about following these rules.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.480 position:59%
People have a good discussion and they
think about what might be difficult,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.410 position:69%
but they're all set to, to follow the rules.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:11.850
And then we ask, okay which rule
are you going to violate first.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.140 position:59%
And people kind of laugh and they get,
then they realize that they're going

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.740
to have trouble not stopping to
answer, judge or discuss them.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.730
And so they kind of are aware that
these can be difficult to follow.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.450 position:64%
But for the purpose of our exercise we're
going to ask you to do the best you can

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.730 position:63%
on your own to be following these rules.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.610
So here's your focus.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.310
Some students are not asking
good historical questions.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.150
What are your questions about that?

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.850 position:67%
As you're, as you're sitting there
thinking, ask as many questions as you can.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.120 position:72%
Don't edit yourself, just get them down there.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.300 position:69%
I have to tell you this is a very painful
thing for me to ever have to cut anybody off

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.970 position:66%
from asking questions, but I got to do it,
we've got a time, we've got a time limit.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.030
So we're going to move on.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.910 position:69%
I want you to get through the whole process.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.460
There's a lot more coming,
a lot of good things coming.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.130 position:63%
Okay. So now let's take a moment and
look at closed and open ended questions.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.220 position:66%
Close ended questions can be answered with
a yes or a no, or the one word answer.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.330
And open ended questions
require more explanation.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.010
What I'd like you to do is to think
about the questions that you asked,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:32.220 position:59%
and identify some close ended ones and
some close ended, and open ended ones.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.750
So let's move on to the next step.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.500 position:73%
Think for a moment about close ended questions.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.510
What are some advantages
of close ended questions?

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.390
Now let's think for a moment
about close ended questions

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.170
and what are some disadvantages
to close ended questions?

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.250 position:67%
So we're going to move on to the next step.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.510
Let's look at open ended questions.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.460
What are some advantages
to open ended questions?

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.040
And what are some disadvantages
to open ended questions?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.770
Okay so we're going to move on
to the next step because there's,

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.630 position:58%
there's more to share, more to learn.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.430 position:67%
So let's take a moment and take one of your
close ended questions, take any of the ones

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.170 position:64%
that you've seen, a close ended question,
change it into an open ended question.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:23.030 position:59%
And take one open ended question and
change it into a close ended question.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.550
Okay. So let's move on now to
the next step in the process.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.090 position:63%
We produce questions following, using
four rules to produce lots of questions.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.260
Then you began to look more
closely at your questions and look

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.610 position:61%
at closed and open and open and closed.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.450
And you practiced changing
from one kind to the other.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.460 position:69%
And now let's move on to the next step here.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:53.280 position:70%
Let's take a look at questions that you have,
and choose two questions that strike you

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.250 position:56%
as that you consider most important.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.420
And while prioritizing and
thinking about those two questions,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.480
think about the original
question focus that I gave you,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.160
some students are not asking
good historical questions.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.980
So let's see if we can get
questions in a question form,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.260 position:73%
two questions that you consider most important.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.520
Okay. There's a lot going on here.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.420
Again, I can't tell you how
much pain this brings me to have

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.620
to cut off this great thinking,
but we're going to continue

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.620 position:75%
to do thinking together but on to the next step.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.650 position:61%
So let me take you to the next step
after you've prioritized the questions.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.260
I want you to think for a moment
about why you chose those questions

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.490 position:73%
as your priority questions, and to think about,

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.060
in this case you don't have the
entire sequence in front of you.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.360 position:70%
But think about you know you may have a sense
of when, in the original list of questions,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.010 position:58%
did that priority question come from.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.160
Was it the beginning, was it
the middle, towards the end?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.040
Just if you have some sense of
that, why don't you share that.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.870 position:64%
Why did you choose the priority questions
that you chose, and where did they come

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.560 position:56%
from in that, in your original list?

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:17.210 position:67%
Okay. So there's a lot of, of analysis here
and reflection on where did they come from,

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.810 position:72%
and explained the rationale for choosing them.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:25.140 position:69%
And getting a sense of where they came
from, from the original work with questions.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.950
So let's move on to the next step.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.370 position:56%
We're going to move into reflection.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:34.390 position:72%
And what I'd like you to do now is to stop
for a moment, and think about in this exercise

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.850 position:64%
in which produced questions, you worked
on changing and improving your questions,

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.440 position:69%
and you prioritized your questions and you
thought about why you choose those questions

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:51.100 position:56%
and where they came from, what did
you learn, and how did you learn it.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:57.940 position:69%
So what we're going to do now is we're going
to take a quick peak inside the black box.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.080 position:70%
The Question Formulation Technique had
several components so let's take a quick look

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.760
at what actually happens when
you go through that process.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:15.410 position:64%
So the real contribution of the Question
Formulation Technique to student learning

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:21.540 position:61%
and to pedagogy is that there are three
thinking abilities with one process.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:28.000 position:70%
And you start with the rules for producing
questions that allow students to do something

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.410
that very often is one of the
most difficult things for them

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.470 position:59%
to do, and that is divergent thinking.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.490 position:70%
They may come up with one idea, one question,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.580
and then shrug their shoulder
and say that's all I got.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:45.450
But the rules create space and
allow for students to begin

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.200 position:70%
to push themselves to produce more questions.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.090 position:61%
That divergent taking a step is really
critical for helping them begin to open

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.780
up different pathways of thinking.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.010 position:61%
But it doesn't stop there, because when
the students start to move into looking

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:06.840 position:69%
at their open and close ended questions and
how to change them, they very often discover

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.910 position:58%
that the way you ask a question can
yield different kinds of information.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.880
Now that's a huge discovery.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.380
So they're beginning to become
more sophisticated thinkers.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.260
They're understand, more
sophisticated question askers.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.290
But it doesn't stop there.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:28.460 position:72%
Then they go on to prioritize their questions,
and in prioritizing very often they discover,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.300 position:70%
they discover that they can't answer question
number two, the second question that came up,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.700 position:69%
until they've answered question number nine.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.810
And then they realize that
they have never before

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.010 position:67%
in their lives come up with nine questions.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.730
And actually having done
that work led to a question

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.500 position:59%
that they understood was very
important that they needed to address.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.040
So this is another major discovery.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.810
But it doesn't stop at convergent
thinking either.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.340 position:72%
There's another thinking ability that is going

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.270 position:69%
on when they're using a question formulation
technique and that's metacognition.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.440 position:58%
Because from the very outset we would
start off by asking students to think

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.970
about what might be difficult
in following the rules.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.060 position:67%
And the discussion that you would hear from
that is always very interesting as they,

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:17.510 position:70%
as they realize that there are different
pieces of that or asking them to act in a way

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.280 position:61%
that they're not necessarily accustomed
doing, which is hearing a question

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.340 position:63%
and asking another question, rather than
stopping to answer it or discuss it.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.780 position:70%
So that metacognition starts at the very
beginning, it continues when they're thinking

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:35.300 position:64%
about open and closed, advantages and
disadvantages of both kinds of questions.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.580 position:59%
That's a new way of thinking about it.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.480
It continues when they're
asked to explain the rationale

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.060 position:70%
for why they choose their priority questions.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.360 position:70%
And of course it concludes with a
reflection where students get to do something

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:54.330 position:70%
that they rarely have an opportunity to do,
which is to name what they learned by working

00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:00.110 position:64%
with their own questions, and to think
about how they learned what they learned.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:05.590
So this is a really amazing
process that allows students

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:11.400 position:70%
to become very sophisticated question askers
and thinkers, in a very short period of time.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.050 position:72%
So what we have seen is example after example.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.770 position:67%
It's been so inspiring and exciting and
even from last year's webinar we had people

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:25.600 position:64%
who participated in, in this webinar last
year, who went off and did great things

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.290 position:63%
with the Question Formulation Technique.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.340
And this was the source for, for
them going off and doing that.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.000 position:66%
And we have continued to learn from the
great work that's begin done in the field.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.940
So we're going to share with
you now some classroom examples

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:43.790
so that you can see what teachers
and students are doing with this.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:49.990 position:61%
The first one is an example of, from
Joshua Beers eighth grade history class

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.160
in Lempster, New Hampshire.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.550 position:61%
And the topic was American Imperialism.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.910 position:72%
And he used the Question Formulation Technique

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.170
for a very special purpose,
for summative assessment.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:05.010 position:69%
His question focus that he presented to his
class, and the class was already experienced

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.890 position:67%
in using the Question Formulation Technique
so they already were very skilled at it.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.560 position:59%
And they had already done a whole unit

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.270
on American Imperialism at
the end of the 20th Century.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:19.200
So his question focus was simply
questions that should be asked

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.710
about American Imperialism at
the turn of the 20th Century.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.200
And let's look at some of
their priority questions.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.290 position:63%
Number two, why did the Hawaiian Natives

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.110
in Queen Liliuokalani not want
the United States to annex Hawaii?

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.620 position:72%
Very specific fact related to the end of 20th,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.710
at the end of the 19th Century
American Imperialism.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:47.910 position:63%
Look at, look at number ten, how did
the Spanish American War affect America?

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.870
Very, an interesting question
that about a specific event.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.870 position:61%
But then looking at what its impact is.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.760 position:72%
And then look at the question that's listed
there, number 12, which actually was connected

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.560 position:64%
to the original question number six, and
was one that they changed in the process.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.200
So it didn't even exist on their
original list of questions.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.960 position:67%
And it was, why did Alfred Thayer Mahan
have the stance that he did on Imperialism?

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.930 position:56%
So they are looking at basically
the, one of the intellectual leaders

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.020 position:61%
in the, around the idea of Imperialism.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:26.960
And they were able to, to look at,
at his work and say, this is a,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.770 position:69%
a question that somebody who's knowledgeable

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.530
about American Imperialism
should be able to answer.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.920
So there is a lot of work done
just with their questions.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.640 position:69%
Now let's take a quick look at the, an
example from his classroom that's an excerpt

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:49.110 position:73%
from a video that's on our website, and is also
in an article that we wrote that Andrew and,

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.910
and Luz wrote for Educational
Leadership last year.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:59.200 position:64%
We're going to take a look at a classroom
example from Maureen Bennett, Lexington,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.580
Massachusetts, third grade history
unit on the Mayflower compact.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.580 position:70%
And it's an introduction to unit on Pilgrims.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.550
So here's her question focus.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.120
Maureen presented them with
the Mayflower compact.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.790 position:56%
They were looking at it individually
on their iPads.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.360 position:56%
And they spent some time reading it.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.910 position:67%
And then they got to work asking questions.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:32.240 position:67%
And they asked some very specific questions
about words that were in the compact.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.620
Then look at question number five.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.910
Did the Indians sign it?

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:42.280 position:59%
So that was their first question that,
that they changed from closed to open.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.820 position:61%
To they changed it from did the Indians
sign it to how many Indians sign it.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.220
Then look at the next question
that that provoked.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.800
Did the Pilgrims sign it?

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.910 position:56%
They decided to change that as well.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.740
Who signed it?

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.000 position:72%
And then they asked this question very
specific to the compact and who is Lord James,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.070 position:59%
and they changed that as well, was
Lord James asking what is furtherance.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:13.140 position:72%
So, so they really did an, an interesting
prioritization here, and they got to questions

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:22.560 position:72%
that were very significant and related to
issues of, of autonomy and, and participation,

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.840 position:67%
and collective agreement, and thinking
about who might agree, who might not agree,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.000 position:64%
who might sign it, who might not sign it.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.680 position:64%
So there was a lot of very
sophisticated thinking that was going on,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.530 position:61%
by looking at this very difficult text.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.970
I should tell you what Maureen
said, is that what she said is

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:46.320 position:64%
after they asked those questions at the
beginning of the unit, she was struck how

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:52.140 position:67%
that year the students kept on discovering,
as they moved further ahead in this,

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.280
is oh this relates to the question
I asked about this, this is,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.150 position:67%
relates to the priority question we had
about who signed it and who didn't sign it.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:09.000 position:58%
So they kept on revealing new layers
of meaning in their study of Pilgrims

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.130 position:58%
and the Pilgrims entry into the area.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:20.610 position:58%
And the whole history of the exchange
by having done that work originally

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.090 position:63%
with the Question Formulation Technique.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.830
So let's look at this eighth
grade, sixth grade history example

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.430
where Megan Harvel was introducing
a unit on the Civil War.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.860 position:64%
And she was about to give them a reading,
but before she gave them a reading

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:40.760 position:73%
that they would start learning about the topic,
this is the question focus that she used.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.280
All right.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:47.610 position:58%
So what, what are sixth graders going
to ask when they look at this photo?

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.040
Why are they fighting?

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.370
Are they fighting?

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.340
Where were they?

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.520
What started the fight?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.320
Who are they?

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.600
Were they signing anything?

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.180
Who else was there?

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.430
Why are you hitting him?

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.900 position:56%
It's a great middle school question.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.190
Why didn't they call 911?

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:08.150
And then right after that they
asked, was this related to slavery?

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.870
And they went all the way through,
including getting to number 15,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.000
which is another middle school
question, who hit who first?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.500 position:66%
But then the questions, number 17, who
died, and number 18, why are they smiling?

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.900 position:58%
And that why are they smiling is very
significant because it shows a level

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.780 position:66%
of attention to a primary source that is
really significant, because it's something

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.340 position:67%
that probably many of us might have missed.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.570 position:56%
But what does it mean that those men
in the background there are smiling?

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.300
And they asked that question.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.170
They got to that question,
at question number 18.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:50.020 position:73%
So it shows you the level of attention that,
that and the ability to analyze primary sources

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.020 position:59%
that students are able to do, if given
the opportunity to ask questions.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.930 position:64%
Now Andrew's going to share with you an
example from a high school history class.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:22:59.730
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.790 position:73%
So this is another example from Kelly Grotrian,

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.230
an 11th grade US history teacher
from East Brunswick, New Jersey.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.890 position:66%
Students were beginning to learn about the
end of World War II, and she used the QFT

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.160 position:66%
so students were actually generating their
own questions ahead of the discussion.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.070
And the discussion was going
to be centered around the,

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:24.340 position:59%
the question whether the US was
justified in dropping the Atomic Bomb.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.560
And students were also going
to use the same questions

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.350 position:73%
for a homework assignment via Google classroom.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:36.920 position:67%
And so here was the question focus that
Kelly presented to her 11th grade students.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.710
And here are some of the
questions that they asked.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.310 position:61%
Students began by asking, what is this?

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.210 position:67%
And then the second question, who did this?

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.080
Students quickly moved into
inquiring about the impact

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.120 position:69%
of the event depicted in the primary source.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.970
How did this affect people?

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:58.330 position:73%
And question four, what were the environmental
and economic implications of dropping the bomb?

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.840 position:69%
In question six, you can see a student makes
a very interesting and nuanced observation

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.660 position:69%
of something in the lower right hand corner.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.070 position:64%
Is that a plane wing in the bottom right?

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.500 position:67%
This prompts the next student question,
did the people in that plane drop the bomb?

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.210 position:63%
And question eight, an ethical question,

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.090
did the people dropping the
bomb know what they were doing?

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.410 position:59%
And question ten, a student asks, who
was responsible for dropping the bomb?

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.750 position:56%
Then to question 11, a question
about cause, what led to this event?

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:31.430 position:72%
And question 12, a question about a fact, what
happened as a result of dropping this bomb?

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.120 position:64%
Students questions about cause and effect
including effects like that mentioned

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.760 position:75%
in question 17, where a student asks, how many
lives were lost as a result, simulated this type

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.670
of student thinking that Kelly was
trying to get from the students.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.480 position:59%
And it led direct, directly to where
she was planning for the lesson to go,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.220 position:72%
to have them start thinking about whether the
US was justified in dropping the atomic bombs.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:00.690 position:69%
Now that you've seen some of, some examples
from Maureen Bennett in an elementary class,

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:05.570 position:69%
Megan Harvel from a middle school class,
and Kelly Grotrian from a high school class,

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:09.370
I'd like to invite all of you to
share how can the QFT be helpful

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.460 position:70%
when using primary sources in your classroom.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.580 position:66%
So if you all want to take a minute and
share now that you've seen those examples,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.290
how you can use the QFT for
teaching primary sources.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.130 position:70%
And so we've learned a lot about how teachers
are using the Question Formulation Technique

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:29.280 position:70%
in their classroom, and in our article which
Dan mentioned earlier, Making Questions Flow,

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.320
we discuss how it can be used
to stimulate student interest

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.550 position:69%
and engagement at the beginning of a lesson.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.600
Just as Megan Harvel did
with the [inaudible] example.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.460 position:59%
It can be used to impart knowledge and
help start, students start thinking

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.920 position:58%
about the information of a heavy text
of a, of a historical test, text,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.710
such as the Mayflower compact
in Maureen Bennett's example.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.880 position:72%
Educators have begun to use students questions

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.010
to be better understand what
students know or do not know.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:02.180 position:75%
And teachers and librarians and educators all
have also used the QFT as a summit of assessment

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.370
to kick off a research project or
paper, or in Joshua Beers' example,

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:12.240 position:72%
actually using the students questions as a
part of a final exam on a unit on Imperialism.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.250
&gt;&gt; This is Dan again.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:18.220 position:58%
I'd like to thank you Andrew for that
really good example and analysis.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:24.710 position:66%
I, I'd like to share with you some of what
we are learning from teachers in the field

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.940
and their use of the Question
Formulation Technique.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:34.020 position:64%
And they have looked at what happens when
they teach the three thinking abilities.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.870 position:56%
And see that, that becomes something

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.820
that they had not necessarily
been aware before they wanted

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.090 position:59%
to deliberately teach those abilities,
but as they see students develop them

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.780
through using the Question
Formulation Technique,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:51.900 position:70%
they've come to understand how significant
it is for students to acquire those abilities

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.490
and they begin to deliberately
foster opportunities for them

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.770 position:58%
to practice those thinking abilities.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:02.490 position:66%
So those teaching of the three thinking
abilities actually now becomes a pedagogy.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:09.200 position:66%
It becomes a distinct, deliberate way to
help your students develop intellectually.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.710 position:72%
Now when students are using the three thinking
abilities something else is happening.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.030
It's actually a theory of learning.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:22.110
Because if you think about it, if
you observe students in classroom

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.540 position:66%
and you see them doing divergent thinking,
you see them do convergent thinking,

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.250 position:58%
and you see them doing metacognitive
thinking, each one of which has been,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:36.510 position:58%
has been a great challenge to promote
in many different environments.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.950 position:61%
And you see them easily move through
those thinking abilities, develop them,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:46.750 position:69%
become more expert at using them, you really
begin to see this becomes an explanation

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.670 position:58%
of how students are learning by
using these three thinking abilities.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.810 position:66%
So let's, I'm just going to share with you
starting off some final words that we have

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.410 position:64%
about putting students minds into motion.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.800
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that Dan.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.520 position:58%
So the name of the session, Questions
are the Engines of Intellect,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.680 position:75%
How to Simulate Student Curiosity and Questions.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.750 position:58%
It's actually derived from a quote by
famed historian David Hackett Fisher.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.910 position:59%
And he said, questions are the engines
of intellect, the cerebral machines

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.300
which convert energy to motion, and
curiosity to controlled inquiry.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:25.370 position:70%
And now in the year 2015, what do students
who learn how to ask their own questions say?

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:30.490 position:73%
Well an eighth grade student from Austin,
Texas, in James Bursar's history class reported

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:35.290
that the QFT helps me by getting me
to think about questions on my own.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:41.000 position:63%
Also it gets my mind in motion, to think
about the questions other people make.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you Andrew.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.840
That's, that's quite a quote there.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.280 position:61%
And to think about how it connects to
David Hackett Ficker's, Fisher's quote,

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.210 position:63%
and the title of this whole webinar, The
Engine, the Questions are the Engines

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:56.710
of the Intellect is really
quite, quite remarkable.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:02.660 position:72%
So let's think for a moment about, in this age
of Google where you know students have access

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:11.990 position:73%
to quick answers, and they, in some ways, think
that getting information is relatively easy

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:16.830 position:63%
because they can simply Google it, let's
look about, let's look at that idea

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.830 position:61%
of the role of technology and learning.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:27.330 position:66%
Clive Thompson, a really clever technology
journalist has written a great book called

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:31.780 position:59%
Smarter Than You Think, How Technology
is Changing Our Minds for the Better.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:37.880 position:63%
And he talked about how, since students,
everybody has such access to information

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.330 position:64%
and in the age of Google there's so much,

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:45.310
so many resources available for
quickly finding information.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:51.610 position:70%
He said, well how should you respond when you
get powerful new tools for finding answers?

00:29:51.610 --> 00:30:00.040
And he concludes his entire book by
saying, think of harder questions.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.960 position:73%
So let's look at the skill of asking questions.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.470 position:75%
The importance of the skill of asking
questions is certainly for moving from ignorance

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.430 position:70%
to knowledge, for arriving at better answers,
for increasing engagement and ownership.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.050
But it's for more as well.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:21.400 position:70%
You can demonstrate inquiry in the classroom,
and you can generate a little more joy

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.730 position:67%
for teachers in a very demanding profession
as their students discover the joy

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.290
of asking questions and setting
a learning agenda.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:36.430 position:64%
And then there's another reason, which is
certainly relevant to the convener and,

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:42.790
of this entire conference and our
webinar, the Library of Congress.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.080
It's connected to democracy.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.060 position:75%
And if you look at this picture, and at the
center of this picture you can see Septima Clark

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.860
who is a teacher in the Charleston,
South Carolina School system.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:03.440 position:59%
And after 18 years, in 1955, she was
fired for being a member of the NAACP.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.660 position:67%
So Septima and her cousin Bernice Robinson,
who's standing behind her, a beautician,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:16.030 position:72%
set up what they called Citizenship Schools
to teach basic literacy to adults in the area.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:21.000
And Septima Clark did it not just
because she wanted to make sure

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000 position:67%
that they could prevent themselves from
being, from being cheated out of wages and,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.170 position:56%
and she wanted to be sure they could
help themselves in various ways,

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.580
but she also saw it as part
of the larger project.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.860 position:67%
She saw it for, in connection to democracy.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:43.310
She said, we need to be taught
to study rather than to believe,

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:48.590 position:64%
to inquire rather than to affirm, affirm.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:55.250 position:56%
So what Septima Clark managed to do
is capture in a sense the real power

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.160 position:70%
of teaching students ask their own questions.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.340
You're building citizens of the
future, you're creating students

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.210 position:70%
who can become self-directed learners and who
will discover new things just as that student

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:12.420 position:63%
in California said, just when you think
you've asked everything you need to ask,

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.890
you discover a new question to ask,
and it opens up whole new worlds.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.300 position:75%
And those are the questions that are awaiting us

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.570
when students learn how to
ask their own questions.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:29.010 position:70%
And I, I'd like you to, to, to know that we
have pushed you quickly through this process.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:33.730 position:64%
We are very grateful to the Library of
Congress and teaching the primary sources

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:38.110 position:63%
for this opportunity to share the
Question Formulation Technique with you.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.480 position:61%
It was meant to give you a taste of it,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.080
and a glimpse of how it can
be used with primary sources.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.260
And it's great to see Mary
Johnson on this, on the webinar,

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.530
because she really helped
get the whole ball rolling

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.010
in introducing the Question
Formulation Technique

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.780
through the entire great network
of teaching the primary sources.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.970
So there are more resources on
our website at RightQuestion.org.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.500
There are more videos.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.030
You can watch the full video
that you say the trailer from.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:10.710 position:56%
And there are videos of different
age levels, different subject areas.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:15.720 position:58%
And we also invite you to help us
promote the idea of students learning

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.780 position:59%
to ask their own questions, of helping
build the democracy with citizens

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:26.060 position:63%
who are asking questions, and to be
part of the million classrooms campaign.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:32.930 position:66%
&gt;&gt; I want to thank Dan and Andrew for a
wonderful presentation and very inspiring,

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.910
and thanks to everybody who
attended the session.
