00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.099
Clouds of gases joined

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.029
Gravity will start to fill that boy hydrogen to fuse

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.299
Making helium which then exudes

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.250
G:o

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.929
Pushing outwards against the force of gravity

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.589
For years

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.129
And shining brightly up here in space

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.609
What will I become a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.149
Red war is the common. Why will I be huge?

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.239
Fusing elements with magnitude

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490
Blowing

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.069
Billions of years and my fires still burning for change

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.349
Until my fuel source is all

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.709
A star is born from the last

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.770
In the stars

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.759
Starglo in the star

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.830
In the stars

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
Shine with the star

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.550
Oh

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.610
With the star

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.239
Thank you guys so much for watching if you're wondering where that beautiful voice came from

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.489
It's this gal que le Thank You Mitchell and thank you for making me into a cartoon

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.429
Finally my dreams came true. If you want to download the song the link is below and we'll leave links for kailia

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.549
You can check out as well to hear more of her beautiful voice. Otherwise, we'll see you next Thursday for another science video. Peace
