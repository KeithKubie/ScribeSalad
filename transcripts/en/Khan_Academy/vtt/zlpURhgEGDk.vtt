00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
We've spent some time talking about hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons are interesting

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.840
--especially  if you want to combust things,
if you want some fuel.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.980
But now we're going to make things a little more interesting by adding things

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.650
to the hydrocarbons and the things we're
gonna add we call functional groups...

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.130
functional groups. And my goal in this
video is to give you an overview of the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.060
major functional groups that you might
see attached to carbon backbones that

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.560
make the molecules interesting biologically.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.200
Now the first one I will focus on is an -OH group

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.360
So you have an -OH attached to
a carbon backbone over here.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.510
It doesn't have to be attached to a
carbon backbone but the -OH right over

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.719
here this is called a hydroxyl group
...hydroxyl... group and when it is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.280
attached to a carbon backbone like this
one is then it turns the entire molecule

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.550
into an alcohol...alcohol.  This is an
alcohol and this one in particular, if

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.270
you want the name, we have two carbons
all along its longest chain and it is an

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.190
alcohol so we use a prefix eth- for the two
carbons, so let me write that down. We're

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.080
gonna use the prefix eth- because we have
two carbons here and we're gonna say

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.320
"eth"-anol, ethanol, which you might more
commonly know as rubbing, as rubbing

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.909
alcohol. Now what are the properties here?
Well you have an oxygen which is very

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.040
electronegative bonded to a hydrogen and
to a carbon but the oxygen is a lot more

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.369
electronegative than the hydrogen, so
you're going to have a partially

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.140
negative charge at this end away from
the hydrogen, a partial positive charge

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.680
at the hydrogen end and, to a lesser
degree, at the carbon end too, but hydrogen

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.670
is even less electronegative
than even carbon.  And so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.220
this one, so a hydroxyl group, they are
polar, they are polar, and because they're

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.460
polar you can dissolve them into 
water.  They are hydrophilic they can form

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.360
hydrogen bonds so you can dissolve this.
Now a similar a similar functional group

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.170
or one that has somewhat similar
properties is right over here and you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.649
might say wait why is this one similar, I
have sulfur here instead of

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.009
oxygen.  But if you look at the periodic
table you will see that sulfur and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.540
oxygen both have six valence electrons,
they both would love nothing more than

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.660
to grab or pretend to grab
two other electrons and this is why they

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.680
tend to form two covalent
bonds.  And so this group right over here,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.670
which is called a sulfhydryl group.  This
is a sulfhydryl group.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.530
It's kind of similar to a hydroxyl
group with the one difference, with the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.050
one difference, that sulfur is
electronegative but it is less

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.050
electronegative than oxygen so you're
still gonna have a partially negative

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.640
charge and a partially positive charge
but it's going to be less polar so it's

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.200
not quite as polar as if you had a
hydroxyl group.  Now when you have this

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.519
sulfhydryl group it's attached to say a
carbon chain, and when I use this

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.380
R right over here, when I have this R,
this is just shorthand for carbon and a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.890
bunch of other stuff.  I could have, if I
wanted to generalize an alcohol right

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.090
over here I could have written R and
then I could have written the hydroxyl

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.140
group O and then bond that to
an H so over here this shorthand R would

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.640
have been the shorthand for all of, the R
would have been the shorthand for all of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.290
this business, all of this business, right
over here.  And so that's what we're doing

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.740
over there.  I'm not saying that this R is
exactly this.  It means it's some, you know,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.850
carbon backbone and carbons,
hydrogens, and maybe other stuff,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.450
maybe even some other functional groups,
but we're just focused on the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.690
sulfhydryl right over here.  And so if you see
something like this you'd say, okay yeah

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.109
this is still gonna be polar but not
quite as polar as if I were dealing with

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.420
a hydroxyl group.  Now over here we have a
more complex molecule but this is a

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.410
molecule that you run into probably on a
daily basis.  This is the sugar fructose.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.299
This is the sugar fructose and
this is when it is not in a ring.  If you

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.750
were to throw this into, if you were
throw this into water it'll readily form

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.769
a ring but when it's not in a ring form you
can recognize already the hydroxyl

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.700
groups.  You have a hydroxyl group on this
carbon.  You have a hydroxyl group on this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.500
carbon.  Hydroxyl group on this carbon.  You
have a hydroxyl group on that carbon, you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.350
have a hydroxyl group on this carbon and
then, on this carbon, it's double

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.550
bonded to an oxygen.  We call this a
carbonyl group.  So this is a, this is a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.170
carbonyl...carbonyl group and this is

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.330
actually how you would tell a sugar is
like it look especially when it's in a

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.950
straight chain, all my carbons
have one hydroxyl on them except

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.900
for this one, it has a carbonyl group.  And
one of the takeaways for a carbonyl

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.260
group, we've already talked about oxygen
being very electronegative, even more

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.250
electronegative than carbon, it's double
bonds, it's going to hog the electrons on

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.940
the oxygen end so you're gonna have a
partial, you're gonna have a partially

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.860
negative charge, partially negative
charge over here, partially positive

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.080
charge over here, and so this one is
also going to be polar, and in fact the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.230
entire molecule is very polar because it
has all these hydroxyl groups on it as

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.850
well, but this is also going to give it
polarity here and, because this carbon

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.650
has a slightly positive charge, it is
susceptible to nucleophilic attack.  And

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.740
when you take organic chemistry you'll
see that things that want to,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.670
want to share, that have a
predisposition to share their

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.540
electrons in a bond, might want to come
and form a bond with this carbon.  And

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.960
maybe one of these electron pairs
go back to this, go back to this oxygen

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.560
and maybe bond with something else.  But
we'll talk about that in the future when

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.830
we study some organic chemistry
mechanisms.  The important thing here is

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.240
just recognize, okay I got some hydroxyl
groups, hey I got a carbonyl group right

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.720
over here as well.  Now this molecule, this
is an amino acid.  And you will see amino

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.760
acids a lot when you study biology and
this has actually a couple of

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.990
interesting groups on it.  The first group
of note is this stuff that I am

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.280
circling in orange because you have a
carbon that is, you could say it's part

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.160
of a carbonyl group, but it is also, it is
also bound to a hydroxyl group.  It is

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.940
also bound to a hydroxyl group right
over there.  And when you have this

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.660
configuration where you have a carbon
bond double bonded to an oxygen and then

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:26.690
single bonded to a hydroxyl group we
call this a carboxyl group.  This is a

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:34.860
carboxyl group and one
of the takeaways from this is that it is

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.360
acidic because this can readily give up
the hydrogen proton.  This oxygen, we

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.400
already know oxygen likes to hog electrons,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.120
it can take up both of these electrons
and become negative.  And actually there's

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.479
actually resonance here because those
electrons get shared throughout the

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.110
group and actually even potentially even
beyond the group but especially inside

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.720
of the group then leaving the
hydrogen proton.  So this can readily

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.680
donate a hydrogen, this can readily
donate a hydrogen proton so this is

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.980
generally viewed as acidic.  Now
this amino acid over here,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.360
it also, and this is where this name comes
from.  Actually the acid comes from this

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.940
carboxyl group, that's the acidic part,
and then you have an amino group,

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:27.120
you have an amino group right over
here because it's involving nitrogen.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.530
This is the amino group.  This is what
gives the amino part of the name "amino acid",

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.140
Amino acid.  And this is actually
generally basic because nitrogen could,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.580
it has a lone pair, it has a, it has a
lone pair of electrons right over here

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.860
and so it could use that lone pair to
pick up, to form a bond with

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.449
a hydrogen ion, to pick up a hydrogen ion.
So under the right circumstances it can

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:56.280
form a bond with a hydrogen ion, which we
know a positive ion which would just be

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.680
a proton, and so it would have a positive
charge.  And so since it can sop up

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.210
hydrogen ions we can view this as,
the amino group, as being basic.  But this

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.240
right over here is leucine.  It's an amino
acid.  Super important for muscle growth.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.030
But there you can appreciate, you have
essentially a hydrocarbon chain but it

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.870
has a carboxyl group at this end and an
amino group right over here.  And another

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.199
thing that you'll sometimes people talk
about is even hydrocarbon groups.  For

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:25.620
example if you consider the main chain
of this, and we could consider it either

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.630
using this carbon or this carbon, but if
we consider this to be the main chain of

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.589
carbons, if we consider that to be the
main chain of carbons, then we would

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:39.539
consider this right over here to be a
methyl group. Rremember the prefix "meth"

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:44.610
refers to one carbon.  So it's one carbon
bonded to a bunch of hydrogens, to three hydrogens

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.720
here, and so we would call this a methyl
group.  And in general if you have a

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.459
hydrocarbon bonded to other hydrocarbon
groups these things are are hydrophobic

00:08:53.459 --> 00:08:56.630
so these things, there's nothing
polar about them and so they're not

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.899
going to want to, at least
these parts of the molecules, are

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.550
not going to naturally dissolve inside of
water.  Now the last group we're going to

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.560
focus on and you're going to see a lot
of these.  And especially in biology

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.760
you're going to see it as part of ATP.
You're going to see it as the backbone of

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:17.870
DNA and that's phosphate groups.  And this
right over here, this right over here, is

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:24.889
the phosphate group.  I've drawn it bonded
to a bunch of kind of a group over here

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:27.680
who knows what it is, a bunch of carbons,
a bunch of other things.  And then

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.460
I've bonded it to two hydrogens but it
doesn't always have to be bound to

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.620
hydrogens.  But when it is bound to
hydrogens like this it's considered to be

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.970
pro-, it's protonated, and so it can
actually take up, it can actually hog

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.510
these electrons and dump these
hydrogens, and dump these hydrogens

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:47.480
into a solution.  So a phosphate group is
considered to be acidic, it is considered

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.260
as, well especially when it is protonated
like this, it is considered to be acidic

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.740
because it can donate protons.  So this is
just an overview of a lot of the

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.649
functional groups you will see
throughout biology and a lot of big

00:09:57.649 --> 00:10:00.589
hairy complex molecules.  When you
actually break it down you say, okay

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:03.320
there's a hydrocarbon chain there.  Oh I
see a sugar there.  I see a bunch of

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.910
hydroxyls and I have a carbonyl group.  Oh
I see an amine group, I see... or amino

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.240
group.  I see a carboxyl group
you can think about is this going to be

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.180
acidic, is it going to be polar, or do
different parts of the molecules have

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.320
different functions
