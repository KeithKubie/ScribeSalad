00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.520
Hi and welcome to Udacity's machine
learning engineer nanodegree program.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.410
My name is David Joyner.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.790
I'm a course developer with Udacity,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.890
as well as an instructor
over at Georgia Tech.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.300
And I'm thrilled to bring you this
program because machine learning is

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.070
really at the core of many innovations
going on in lots of different areas.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.175
Finance, education, healthcare.

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:19.247
These are all industries that are being
revolutionized every day by what

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:21.040
machine learning can do.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.930
And in this nanodegree program, you're
going to develop your own understanding

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.670
of what machine learning can do for
these areas as well.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.350
Over the course of this program
you're going to be covering the major

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.790
schools of thought in machine learning.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.030
You're going to be using the same tools,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.730
the same methods, the same
algorithms that experts are using

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.200
everyday to uncover new information
about different industries.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.272
By the end of this program, you'll have
developed a portfolio that demonstrates

00:00:41.272 --> 00:00:43.469
what you can do,
the kinds of problems you can address,.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.081
Including some problems
we've picked out for you,

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:47.720
as well as some problems you'll
get to pick out for yourself.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.210
I'm excited to get started,
and I hope you are too.
