00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.780
They say crime doesn�t pay, but Hollywood
gives us other ideas.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.710
Film history is full of movies showcasing
the extravagant and enviable lifestyles of

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.220
mobsters, conmen, and other criminals.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.220
Even though we know the fall from grace is
around the corner, it would be hard to pass

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.220
up a chance to work for Jordan Belfort�s
stock firm, for example.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.770
Here are Screen Rant�s five criminals we
want to live like.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.579
Henry Hill � Goodfellas

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.040
This film sports a killer opening sequence
that instantly sells viewers on why Henry

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.030
Hill always wanted to be a gangster.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.450
A glamorous life featuring tons of money,
the family nature of the New York mob, and

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.760
the utmost respect from peers (among other
luxuries) - there�s no better way to be.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.510
It�s true that the uglier side of the mob
world comes to light in the movie�s second

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.220
half, but we�d happily take FBI choppers
and witness protection if it meant getting

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.360
to live large with a feeling of invulnerability
for even a brief period of time.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.440
We don�t want to go through our whole lives
like a schnook.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.760
Danny Ocean � Ocean�s Eleven

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.630
Danny gets to live out fantasies we all have
- like getting a group of friends together

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.670
to rob casinos.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.280
Yes, he visits jail often, but a share of
that jackpot is a nice thing to have, and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.530
makes those 3 to 6 month vacations bearable.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.310
In addition to being cool, intelligent, and
sophisticated, Danny also has a heart of gold.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.600
All he wants is his wife back.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.060
He�s not power hungry or corrupt.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.500
He even takes the fall for his whole team
so they can reap the benefits of a job well

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500
done.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.400
That level of selflessness is something we
should all strive for � criminal or not.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.530
Frank Abagnale, Jr. � Catch Me if You Can

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.450
Few would volunteer for the amount of emotional
trauma young Frank endured after his parents�

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.900
divorce, but it�s easy to argue he lived
a good life anyway.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.290
Impersonating a pilot, doctor, and a lawyer,
he used his forgery skills to make millions

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.229
for himself before he turned 21.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.659
He�s partying with beautiful women while
we�re sending out college applications.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.061
While he was imprisoned, his downfall wasn�t
that bad either.

00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:04.290
He served the majority of his sentence working
as a �free� man in the FBI�s bank fraud

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.810
department, and went on to design checks for
Fortune 500 companies, earning a large sum

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.039
of legal money annually.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.490
No matter which way you look at it, his life
is hugely beneficial.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.209
Marsellus Wallace � Pulp Fiction

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.709
Quentin Tarantino�s opus doesn�t showoff
too much of Mr. Wallace�s life, but there�s

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.349
enough to suggest he has it good.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.890
He rules Los Angeles with an iron fist, having
power to take away �LA privileges� from

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.219
whomever he pleases.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.349
Wallace commands the respect and fear of anyone
he crosses paths with, as even the laid back

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:42.049
Vincent Vega is petrified of what he�s capable
of.

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.329
That unfortunate pawnshop incident is nothing
to sneer at, but with no traditional �downfall�

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.169
depicted, and connections to the ultimate
�Get out of Jail Free� card in Winston

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.879
Wolf, Wallace could still be looking over
the City of Angels without a care in the world

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.879
today.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.930
Not a bad way to live life at all.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.909
Tony Montana � Scarface

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.959
Arriving to the U.S. with nothing, Tony Montana
works his way up to becoming a premiere kingpin,

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:14.409
fulfilling a twisted version of the American
dream and reaching the top of the world.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.409
Pushing it to the limit, he lives a life of
fame and fortune by raking in copious amounts

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.559
of cash, residing in a mansion, and even marrying
the girl of his dreams.

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:23.980
We certainly wouldn�t pass that up.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.260
Tony�s life ended up crumbling under paranoia
and mountains of cocaine (plus, a deadly firefight

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.730
at the bitter end), making his tale a cautionary
one.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.389
But it would still be a blast to know what
it was like to live like him.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.840
He did own a pet tiger, after all.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.459
Those are our picks for movie criminals we
want to live like.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.700
Are there any we missed?

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.860
