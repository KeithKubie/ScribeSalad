[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.950
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Hello.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.000
Good morning.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.750
Thank you guys so
much for coming.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
9:00 AM start-- a
bit after 9:00 AM.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.280
And I see some faces
repeat from yesterday.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.070
So thank you so much
for coming back.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.800
We hope you enjoyed
the experience

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.890
that you guys came
and made happen.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.330
We've got an amazing lineup of
speakers again for you today,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.960
but we're going to kick off
with a really short video which

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.720
really explains the culture
and the ethos with which we're

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.436
running Solve for X.

00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:37.810
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:47.020
-The actual moonshot is
wonderful, inspirational,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.160
poetic, beautiful, involved
great technical challenges,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.450
genuine heroism.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.890
It brought the world together.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.070
But think about the
Polynesian Islander

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.130
in the dugout canoe
deciding one day

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.690
they were going to go that way.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.530
No one had ever been
that way before.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.239
No one eve knew if there was
anything that way before.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.430
It was amazing, and
it changed the world.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.600
-People can set their minds to
magical, seemingly impossible

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.430
ideas and then through
science and technology

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.280
bring them to reality.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.810
And that then sets
other people on fire

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.170
that other things
that look impossible

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.910
might be accomplishable.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.060
-Many years ago the great
British Explorer George

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.620
Mallory, who was to die on Mt.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.890
Everest, was asked, why
did he want to find it.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.040
He said, because it is there.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.790
Everyone else in the world
is working on that next 10%.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.980
If you can be the one that
delivers that 10 times

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.960
improvement, you have a chance
to really change things.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.490
-If you want cars to run at
50 miles per gallon, fine,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.445
you can retool your
car a little bit.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:56.680
But if I tell you it has
to run on a gallon of gas

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.114
for 500 miles, you
have to start over.

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:01.780
-You need a lot of
courage in this work,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.196
and you need a lot
of persistence.

00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:05.810
Even if you don't really
100% believe it's possible--

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.430
like, you might think,
this might be possible.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.729
Have the courage to try.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.604
That's how the greatest
things have happened.

00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:13.770
-You don't spend your
time being bothered

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.380
that you can't teleport from
here to Japan because there's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.390
a part of you that
thinks it's impossible.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.900
Moonshot thinking is choosing
to be bothered by that.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.050
-We choose to go to
the moon in this decade

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.730
and do the other things,
not because they are easy,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.460
but because they are hard.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.720
-Humanity's progress
has been a series

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.500
of amazing audacious things
from the very small and personal

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.640
up to the great big
and grand, and we

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.869
are a species of moonshots.

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.035
And to me, that's, like,
the really amazing, poetic,

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:43.240
and inspirational thing.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.570
-When you find your
passion, you're unstoppable.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.137
You can make amazing
things happen.

00:02:47.137 --> 00:02:48.720
It's been true through
all of history.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.660
-When Kennedy said that we
would put a man on the moon,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.540
it's about the
fact that he said,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.310
we don't know how
to do this yet,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.980
and we're going to do it anyway.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.170
And that sends shills
up everybody's spine.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.938
Because if that happens,
what couldn't we do?

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.638
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yay.

00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:17.871
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.370
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
Thanks for coming.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.260
Solve for X is really about a
community of amazing moonshot

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.620
pioneers and all of
us who help them.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.751
And sometimes we
think about people--

00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.250
you know, the
incredible things that

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.416
have happened that get
into the history books,

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:33.790
when the people were in the
middle of starting that stuff

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.331
and trying to do that stuff, a
lot of people didn't help them

00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:39.770
or didn't believe in them or
sort of questioned their ideas.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.190
So Solve for X is a place
where we want to hear and give

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.480
a stage to people who have
incredible proposals that

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.660
could make a major impact
on our world in some way

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.502
and then help them.

00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:52.210
And so it's a really
interactive session,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.585
and we're going
to go through it.

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:56.520
So first off, there's this
idea of tech moonshots.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.190
And we think of
them as three parts,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.860
and we ask our speakers to
kind of cover all three.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.570
The first one is,
what's the huge problem

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.736
that you're trying to solve?

00:04:03.736 --> 00:04:05.500
Or the big opportunity?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.680
And give us some
details about that.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.236
The second part is, what's the
breakthrough technology that

00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:12.860
might sound to us
like science fiction,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.710
but you could show us
a little bit about it

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.899
and explain how you're
going to apply that-- how

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.880
we're going to use
that in this new way.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.360
And what's the radical solution?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.360
Meaning, what kind of
product or service or method

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.630
could you use to
actually scale this?

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.392
So just as an example, of some
of our colleagues at Google X

00:04:29.392 --> 00:04:30.600
work on the self-driving car.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.110
And that's one where, if
you were pitching this,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.010
you would say, OK,
literally billions of people

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.930
are wasting hours in
traffic in their lives.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.050
And we have huge safety
concerns, and even more

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.040
now with texting and driving
and the security of driving.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.180
And the third is
even fuel efficiency.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.930
And so kind of a
problem worth solving.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.200
The breakthrough technology
is today the level of mapping

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.280
and real-time sensors
and robotics, et cetera,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.460
are kind of on the edge where
could a car actually drive

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.600
itself in the current system?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.060
Not special rails
not-- so that's

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.268
sort of the radical solution.

00:05:08.268 --> 00:05:09.260
Can we get it on there?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.440
And many of their early
contests and stuff

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.051
showed that was possible.

00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:13.800
That was the demo.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.149
And so now that team's trying
to do it as well as others.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.940
So that's sort of how
you would pitch that.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.760
So we've got three
incredible teams

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.317
that are going to talk
about their ideas.

00:05:24.317 --> 00:05:25.900
And so we're going
to go through that.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.536
Do you want to
talk about method?

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:27.942
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:05:27.942 --> 00:05:28.442
Absolutely.

00:05:28.442 --> 00:05:32.090
So what you'll hear is a series
of three 10-minute proposals.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.085
The first proposal
has a fantastic demo

00:05:34.085 --> 00:05:35.710
that we're really
excited about so that

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.876
will go a little bit longer.

00:05:36.876 --> 00:05:38.634
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: fly around.

00:05:38.634 --> 00:05:40.550
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: And
then we're going to do--

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.430
and the most important
part of Solve for X--

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.760
is the interactive
brainstorming sessions

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.670
that we do following
these talks.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.950
So it's a chance for all of
you to really think about

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.420
if you were to join this
team, if you were to suddenly

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.610
be a part of pushing this
forward, thinking 2/3 yes--

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.000
it's a concept we borrowed
from improv-- what ideas, what

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.810
resources, what connections
might you be able to think

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.280
of that can help accelerate
the progress on this project?

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.340
And then spend a 1/3 of the
time thinking about, yes,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.070
but-- what are the
questions that you still

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.130
have in your mind?

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.840
What are some of the
critiques that maybe we

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.706
haven't discussed or talked
about in enough detail.

00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:20.580
And then we're going to
get each of the teams

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.500
to quickly come up after
this 25-minute session

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.965
of brainstorming and report
out to the moonshot pioneers

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:29.690
and everyone else in the
room some of the findings

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:35.034
that you guys have
discussed in these groups.

00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:36.450
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
you might think,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.274
I'm not going to
know about that.

00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:39.690
But you'll find
that at your table

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.570
there's going to be some people
who know a lot and people who

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.540
know nothing about
what was just said,

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.469
and both people will
have fabulous ideas

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:47.260
for these pioneers.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.310
And it really helps them.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.960
So without further
ado we'll get started.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.485
Our next speaker has
come a very long way.

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:58.734
Like, 30 something hours flying,
yesterday landing from Ethiopia

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:00.900
with lots of struggling
with the US State Department

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.430
to get his visa.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.010
So Michael, come on up.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.000
One of the biggest
challenges we have

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.820
is that all the kids on
the edge, 50 million kids,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.386
have no access to any kind
of learning because there's

00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:15.760
no schools, there's
now teachers,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.540
and people around
them didn't get access

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.070
to learning so they have
no literacy and numeracy.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.590
And we kind of wait
for the governments

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.090
to solve this problem and
build schools and do that,

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.910
and it's just too slow.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.230
There's also about
500 million kids

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.180
who have kind of bad school
where their teachers just

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.780
don't show up or
check each other in

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.900
or the teachers were
never trained properly.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.840
And so there's
several people who've

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.260
been working for years
on things like the OLPC

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.960
$100 laptop and those projects.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.780
And some of those
most amazing people

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.090
who have been working on
them have been in the field

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.370
and have the best information
about what's working

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.640
and what's not working.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.360
And so Michael is
part of the teams that

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.270
have worked on the $100 laptop
projects now into the reading

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.950
project, and he's going
to talk a little bit

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.966
about those learnings and
some of their insights

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:05.340
and what they
think we should get

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.490
done with hyperlocal solutions.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.560
I think, as you guys start,
you're going to play a video?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.720
MICHAEL GIRMA: Morning, guys.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.120
My name is Michael Girma.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.990
I've been working on education
for the last eight years,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:29.070
and my two and a half years of
experience in the last years

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.860
is really quite impressive.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.990
When I started work on this
globe literacy reading research

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.409
program, original idea
by Nicholas Negroponte

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.120
and with MIT Media Lab.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.580
So let me take you
to a small video.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.136
And we'll go through
my presentation.

00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:52.622
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:29.300 --> 00:10:14.538
you

00:10:14.538 --> 00:10:16.020
MICHAEL GIRMA: Yeah.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.270
So he's also one of
my colleagues working

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.470
on the global literacy program.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.500
So to start my
presentation, there

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.430
are around 250 million
kids all over the world

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.880
who don't have access to school.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:37.420
And around 793 million adults
who cannot read and write,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.875
and 60% of them are women.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.410
So let's see why the
kids don't go to school

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.990
or can't go to school.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.620
So there are quite
a few reasons why

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.910
they are not going to school.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.130
So the first reason is
the average distance

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.050
from their school
to their village

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.680
is at least two
and a half hours.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.230
So for a three or four-year-old
kid to go to school

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.760
and come back to a really rough
situation is almost impossible.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.940
The other thing
is that people who

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.170
are living in these
rural areas are

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.090
have a lot of
socio-economic problems

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.840
so they don't send
their kids to school,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.680
but instead they want the kids
to help them in housework,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.340
in collecting wood for
cooking and for fire,

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.440
and fetching water from
the rivers, which is always

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.360
a long distance to
go and come back,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.880
and also the boys are usually
going with the cattle.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.800
So not only those reasons,
but also the urban settlement

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.180
and the geographical
structure makes

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.370
it's really hard to provide
a health station, a school,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:01.350
and other necessarily
things for the community.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.600
And apart from that, one
of the major problems

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.940
is also the environmental
and health issues.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:21.290
So with all these ideas in
mind, in February, 2012,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:28.360
for the first time we
tried to deploy or drop off

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.830
the tablets in those
two villages, Wenchi and

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.720
[? Welcheti. ?]

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.190
So our first
experience was having

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.780
the idea of kids who
don't to have access

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.270
to school can read and
write by using technology,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.860
without any instruction,
and without any teacher.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.270
So there are a bunch
of apps on the tablet

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.960
and we just gave them
out and started to watch.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.930
Within four minutes, a kid
by the name of [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.150
turned on the tablet
for the first time.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.320
And he was really
quite impressed,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.790
and he showed the other
kids how he did it,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.130
and it took less time
than the first time.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.406
So the kids always
shared their experiences.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.170
After a week, we just went back
and saw how they were doing,

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:25.190
and we were fascinated by
the performance of the kids.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.610
It is really hard to believe
that those kids in a week--

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.620
or in the first four
weeks-- did this kind

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.090
of amazing performance.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.480
So we were quite impressed and
started to do the research.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.120
And one of the
interesting things

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.320
is that we selected the
ages between four to ten

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.920
because we wanted to
focus on that age group.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.520
But those kids who
were below that age

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.050
and also above the
age of ten, they

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.830
were influenced by the others.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.070
So they started to sing a song,
like ABC, in the community

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.220
and playing games which
were on the tablet

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.210
and doing some really
fancy stuff together

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.215
with the other kids.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.510
So they are supporting
their families

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.140
so the families are not
complaining about the kids

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.030
because this is a new thing
and they are more comfortable.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.350
So after five months,
this kid, [INAUDIBLE],

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.920
who claimed himself a lion,
he unlocked the tablet

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.510
for the first time, and
we really quite impressed

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.870
because we blocked
the camera apps

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:37.460
because we don't want to
affect the community privacy

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.830
and the data is going to be
too big if kids take a picture.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.710
So we blocked the camera apps.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.620
But he found out
how to unlock it.

00:14:51.692 --> 00:14:52.650
So this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:02.120
The interesting part is that
maybe he just did it simply

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.080
randomly.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.190
But that's not true, because
after a week all of the 41 kids

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.190
knew how to unlock it.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.420
So this is how it spreads.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.350
It's quite amazing.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.930
When you give them something
which is relevant for them,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:21.220
it spreads quite quickly.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.110
And the other interesting part
is they charge it once in a day

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.220
so they just use it
wherever they go.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.790
But they saved the battery
and in the evening,

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.520
they tried to study
with their parents.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.980
And also used the tablet's
power as a source of light

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.282
in their house because they
don't have electricity.

00:15:43.282 --> 00:15:45.240
So they work in the
evening with their parents.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.310
So the kids' confidence.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.930
We just saw them on the first
day that we give it to them.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.030
They are really quite shy.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:04.610
But after some time, they
are really confident.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.085
Especially when you're
asking them some questions,

00:16:07.085 --> 00:16:10.960
they are confidential to answer.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.780
Because they are already solving
any problems by themselves

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.680
rather than looking to others.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.960
So they are really confident.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.060
So after a year with one of
the scientists from Tufts

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.580
University, we tried to
measure the kids to see

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.760
if they are really reading,
writing, and if they learned.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.740
The results are
quite impressive.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.610
At that time, they
are at the level

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.540
of a kindergarten student.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.590
They can read some words,
they can write some words,

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.580
and it's promising
that they're going

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.890
to do something in the future.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:58.300
These were some
of the equations.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.150
Most of the applications
are not designed

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.850
in the context of
the local community.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.160
Rather, we just brought it
straight from the shelf.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.550
So octopus, donkey,
and ice cream.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.800
So they don't know
octopus and ice cream

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.480
so they have got some visual
problems when they see this.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.349
But when they see donkey,
they are really quite fast

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.960
and understand it well.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.370
So for this problem we're
trying to develop some apps

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.269
based on local context.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.140
So the other issue is
some of the parents--

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.612
a few of the parents-- were
not happy with the kids.

00:17:38.612 --> 00:17:40.320
They don't believe
that they are studying

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.710
because it's a new thing.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.260
So this is also
a little problem.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:53.400
So looking at all these
experiences and the kids'

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.260
efforts to study,
we just say, like,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.110
OK, this is the time
to do something.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.870
We can do something.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.580
So with my friend
Marcos we tried

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.030
to sit down and think
about what to do.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.340
And we just found out
this global literacy hub,

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.870
it's a network or hub,
which works on literacy.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.980
So we tried to connect
all African hubs

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.910
to work on literacy, especially
to design and develop

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.380
local content.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.375
So local problems
with local solutions.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.450
So our approach is a
bottom-up approach.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:31.390
Providing local solutions
for local problems.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.155
So the kids have
skills so that they

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.820
are the ones who are going
to solve their own problems

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.830
after five years, ten years.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.725
They don't expect someone
to solve their own problems.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.460
So we're planning to design
not only a tablet, but also

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.540
some hardware which can
be helpful for the kids

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.134
in order to achieve
reading and writing skills.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:07.435
Maybe one last thing, ethics,
skills, and critical thinking

00:19:07.435 --> 00:19:10.530
are the basic things
which we are focused on.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.920
So we're trying to
teach them those things

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.450
and see them changing the world.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.777
Thank you very much.

00:19:17.777 --> 00:19:21.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:25.930
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Thank you.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:33.420
So a quick question before
Scott comes up, Michael,

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.482
so we see this as such amazing
moonshot to take all the stuff.

00:19:36.482 --> 00:19:37.940
It's almost like
the future's here,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.200
it's not evenly distributed.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.060
And so these are
Android tablets.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.950
We have them here, now
the kids have them.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.470
But what we really
loved was your insight

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.197
to have local people
versus octopuses--

00:19:50.197 --> 00:19:51.780
they can learn about
octopuses later--

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.524
but local people who have much
for context working with them

00:19:54.524 --> 00:19:55.940
and having people
like themselves.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.940
Is there any question,
as people brainstorm,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.660
that you would love them to
help you with in addition

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.490
to anything-- any imaginative
things-- they think of

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:09.270
or critical things they
think to be worried about it?

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.790
MICHAEL GIRMA: Well, I really
don't have much to say,

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.000
but we have the solution.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.370
Our solution is in our hands.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.130
But thinking in the
right way is the only way

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.730
to solve those problems.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:25.260
So especially local
solutions in a local context.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.210
As I told you in the
beginning of my presentation,

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.800
there are economic
problems, there

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.430
are environmental problems,
there are health problems

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.434
so if they are focused on
those kinds of social issues,

00:20:37.434 --> 00:20:39.100
they are the ones who
are going to solve

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.880
those issues in the future.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.370
So that's our main
target and focus.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.960
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: OK, great.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.550
All right.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.020
So next up.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.650
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.470
So I actually heard octopus
in Ethiopian culture

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.790
was supposed to represent demons
or witches so maybe that's

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.610
not the best thing
to be showing kids.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.730
Next up we have
Scott Klemer who is

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.850
from the University of
California San Diego.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.840
And to continue the
theme with education,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.930
Scott is going to be
talking to us about how

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.440
moocs and online education can
really change the way that we

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.150
think about how we
structure our curriculum

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.785
and structure our learning.

00:21:20.785 --> 00:21:21.910
SCOTT KLEMER: Good morning.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.120
It's great to be here.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.350
I had an amazing middle school
math teacher, Mr. Frasier,

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.380
and he told us that
learning is teaching

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.400
and that the first person
that you teach is yourself

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.520
and the second person that
you teach is your friend.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.250
And one goal of
this Google X series

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.620
is to foster order of
magnitude, even multiple order

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.070
of magnitude, changes.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.950
And so I wanted to
enlist your help

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.440
today in thinking
with me about how

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.920
we can scale Mr.
Frasier's insight.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.480
And in particular,
I'd like to focus

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.180
on doing this to
learn creative skills.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.220
An increasing number of
jobs are knowledge sector

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.050
creatively intensive jobs.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.590
And this is also a lot
of what we do outside

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.560
of work and in
our lives as well.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.490
And there's a huge amount of
enthusiasm for this right now.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.520
It was amazing this morning
to see the line snaked

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.550
around the block to
be able to get in.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.550
I'm not I used to that a
conferences that I go to.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.270
And there's a whole lot of
people who don't have access

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:28.350
to the creative and technical
content that's available today.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.410
And we want lots of people
to have these skills.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.180
Lots of people
want these skills.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.500
How can we address
this need at scale?

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.180
Before becoming a cognitive
and computer scientist,

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.050
I was originally
trained as a designer.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.290
And here you see a
couple of design studios.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.960
The traditional design
fields rely strongly

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.750
on this studio
model of education.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.050
It was founded in 1819 when the
l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.040
got going.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.640
And it's flourished
and really grown

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.150
over the last two
centuries I think because

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:59.880
of the benefits
of peer learning.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.330
The ability to see what
your friends are working on,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.620
to be energized by a critique.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.730
But this doesn't scale.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.890
This is the most high-touch
teaching approach

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.290
you can imagine.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.604
So how would we do
something at scale online?

00:23:13.604 --> 00:23:15.020
I think that, in
a lot of ways, we

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.170
can turn this problem
into a solution.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.280
My colleague, Jim
Holland, famously

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.770
observed that the most exciting
opportunities for online media

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.390
are when you get to go
beyond being there as opposed

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.322
to just making a poor
facsimile of the real world.

00:23:30.322 --> 00:23:31.780
Do something that's
different, that

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.760
leverages the power
of computation.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.510
So what we've been doing
in my research group

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.840
is we've been
exploring ways that we

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.360
can use the scale of
massive online classes

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.720
to be able to foster new
kinds of peer interactions.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.790
And I'm going to share, briefly,
a couple examples of this

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.590
with you today.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.060
A couple of years ago, in
collaboration with Coursera,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.870
we started to put my
design class online.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.142
And we were thinking
about, well,

00:24:01.142 --> 00:24:03.100
how would we have the
project work be something

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.560
that was available
for all the students?

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.730
And my colleague,
Ed Hutchins, gave me

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.250
the courage to use
peer assessment

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.600
and see if we could scale that
up to a planet scale class.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.600
He'd been using it for a
couple hundred students

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.490
really remarkably.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.860
And so Ed gave us the
courage to build this out.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.220
And it worked remarkably well.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.150
The way that it works is that
we have students first practice

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.560
assessing their peers.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.959
This is a new technique
and a new skill for them.

00:24:31.959 --> 00:24:33.750
By the way, it's also
a really useful skill

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.920
to have in addition to
having the outcome of being

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.430
able to grade assignments.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.100
So after we train you up
on assessing your peers,

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.070
you'll go out and get five
randomly assigned assignments,

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.910
one of which we know
the score for so

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.615
that we can check
a ground truth.

00:24:47.615 --> 00:24:48.990
And at the end of
it all, we have

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.260
you self-assess your
own work as well,

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.490
which it's valuable to learn
to become your own critic.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.780
And what we found is that
this works really well.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.610
More than 90% of the students
in a pass-fail class,

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.160
like a lot of these
online classes,

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.120
get the certificate
that they deserve.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.930
Peers are a little
bit lenient so there

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.140
are a couple of people who
sneak in and get a certificate

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.840
even though maybe they
didn't do all of the work.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.710
There are, however,
corner cases.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.710
And one reason that I'm
excited to be here today

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:24.190
is that I think things at scale,
the corner cases scale, too.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:29.030
And I wanted to think a little
bit about what we can do there.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.570
And this has been used in more
than 100 other online classes.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.320
In general it works really well.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.780
And what we found is that it
doesn't work automatically.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.738
You can find blog posts
where people are really

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:44.100
frustrated by having a wingnut
grade their hard wrought work.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.230
And what we've seen is that
there are some strategies that

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.580
are important for being able
to do peer assessment well.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.120
And so we've worked
a lot on being

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.620
able to teach the
teachers and being

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.400
able to bake these
into software.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.780
One of the things that's
really fun is getting a score

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.620
is nice and all, but
it's valuable to be

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.072
able to get some more
personalized feedback.

00:26:04.072 --> 00:26:06.030
And for many of you out
there who are teachers,

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.240
you know that
students always crave

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.800
more personalized feedback.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.950
This is true even at
the massive scale.

00:26:14.309 --> 00:26:16.850
What we did is we realized that
a lot of the feedback that we

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.500
were seeing is in
variations on a theme.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.960
So we packaged up
these fortune cookies

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.600
which codify common
bits of feedback

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.520
and then students can customize
those to give them to peers.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.180
A worry about these
massive online classes,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.250
you may have tens or even
hundreds of thousands

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.110
of students who are
taking these classes

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.900
and yet maybe we're
all alone together.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.560
Maybe it's just 100,000
people around the world

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.430
staring at a laptop and
having no engagement.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.080
And, again, what makes
design so exciting

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.650
is that you have
that opportunity be

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.770
in the studio with others.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.650
The community is really
the most important part,

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:57.380
and so what we did is we came
up with this system called

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.070
Talk About, which leverages
Google Hangouts to be

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:05.310
able to offer many, many,
many small group discussions

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.720
in massive classes.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.650
We first rolled this out in
Scott Plous' Social Psychology

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:10.440
class.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.710
And students described
the experience

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.280
of being able to talk with peers
as, wow, it's like a mini UN.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.120
We had an Australian, a
Dubai, and Afghan, a Romanian,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.570
an Indian and my
self, a Pakistani.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.410
And what we see is that not
only do students feel really

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.940
energized after participating
in these discussions--

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.580
and they're really cool to be
able to sit-in on-- students

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.460
who participate in a
randomly controlled trial

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.160
in a high-diversity
discussion condition

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.310
actually performed better
subsequently in the class

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.440
than those that were in a
low-diversity condition.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.380
So I think, especially for
domains like social psychology,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.510
seeing diverse perspectives can
be a really powerful learning

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.050
motivator.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.800
One reason that people
are often surprised when

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.560
I talk about being able
to scale peer learning

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.290
is that there's an
intrinsic paradox.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.100
You're asking novices
to do something

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.945
that definitionally
only experts can do.

00:28:02.945 --> 00:28:05.195
The reason that you're the
teacher and not the student

00:28:05.195 --> 00:28:08.030
is that you have the
ability to do the grading

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.000
and create the content.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.480
And when we flip this and have
more peer-focused efforts,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.810
I think that the
key to making it

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.360
work is creating micro-experts.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.390
And this is similar
in spirit to the work

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.070
that, for example, the
Folding@home protein folding

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.920
folks have done where
you can train people up

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.140
in a narrow domain and build
useful skills as long as you

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.440
design that experience
very carefully.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.530
And so recently
we've been exploring

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.050
moving from a score-based
approach, which actually

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.170
requires a fair
amount of expertise,

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.420
to a more attribute or
label-based approach.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.780
So what are the attributes
of this assignment

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.780
that you see here?

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.380
And that works a lot better.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.300
And it discourages
laziness as well,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.960
which is important in reducing
those outlier wingnuts.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.460
Another thing that we can do
is, although machine learning

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.940
is not at the point--
yet, at least-- where

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.620
we can automatically grade
creative assignments,

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.890
it can help a lot.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.950
And so we've
explored-- because we

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:13.240
have this large corpus
of training data,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.020
we worked with Richard
[INAUDIBLE] and colleagues

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.620
to be able to have an NLP-based
system be one of the peer

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.845
graders or something
that helps do triage

00:29:22.845 --> 00:29:24.640
on student submissions.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.090
And we found that by adding the
structure combining students

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.430
doing the label-based
grading and then verify it,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.500
we can add a machine
in to be able to reduce

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.090
the overall workload
and at the same time

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.460
give people higher
quality feedback.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.420
So the moonshot that I'm
sharing with you today

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.080
is I think that we can use
strategies like this-- so far

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.040
we've just scratched
the surface--

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.240
to be able to in situ
build practical theory

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.920
with large-scale real
world experiments.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.810
And part of what enables this
to be both possible and powerful

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.490
is that with online
education one thing

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.480
that I think hasn't
been noticed enough

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.590
is that you're baking a lot
of pedagogy into software.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.080
And this makes it much
easier to transform

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.070
learning to other classes.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.570
If we come up with something
really good in one class,

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.720
by virtue of being in
software, it automatically

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.104
moves to the other one.

00:30:19.104 --> 00:30:20.520
And when I talk
about theory here,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.960
I'm really inspired by the
worker of Kurt Lewin who

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.860
was a social psychologist
of the last century who

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.900
said that "the best way
to understand something

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.260
is to try and change it."

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.360
And so to generalize
this strategy,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.270
to x-ify this strategy, what
we want to be able to do

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.830
is now that we have,
with the power of lots

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.230
of connected devices,
the ability to run

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.550
actual real controlled
experiments, the kind of thing

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.700
that we used to only be
able to do in the lab.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.860
We can do that in
the real world now.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.170
We can do those
experiments toward goals

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:53.910
that people really care about.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.950
And we can use that
to bubble up theory--

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.700
and this is the step that I
think industry doesn't always

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.510
need to do immediately,
so it often

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.240
gets left on the
cutting room floor.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.850
We can bubble that up
in a way that's reusable

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:08.340
that can help other
people as well.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.640
So what we can offer
here and this is we

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.870
have some open-source
platforms that this URL here

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.160
that have analytics and course
materials and constructor

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.730
resources as well.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.130
And your mission, if
you choose to accept it,

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.570
is to think with me today
about how we might scale more

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.870
personalized
mastery-oriented learning

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:32.130
experiences to this
new global community.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.140
I want to thank
the ton of people

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.450
who did all of this work.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.970
You can read more about it on
my website or Twitter feed.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.630
And I hope that some of you
will join the many students who

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.460
are going to take the next
around of the HCI class

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.080
starting on June 30.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.060
Thank you very much.
