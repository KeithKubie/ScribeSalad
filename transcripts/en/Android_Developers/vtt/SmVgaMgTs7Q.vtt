00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.190
It has been 7 years since we founded Rayark back in 2011

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.720
and we have released 7 games so far

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.300
Some of them are immensely popular among gamers

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.800
like “CYTUS”, “DEEMO” and “VOEZ”

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.680
All three of which have reached the top spot on Google Play

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.150
in over 100 countries and regions

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.968
Other games, like casual games “Mandora”

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:25.640
and action-RPG game “Implosion”

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.080
were also big successes

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.090
Almost every Rayark game has been ranked as No. 1

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.840
in the Google Play Store top charts at some point

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.830
I think the process of creating a game is

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.200
sort of analogous to playing a game

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.610
Your heart wants it to be artistic and intuitive

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.070
but your brain says you need in-depth business analysis

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.540
to create a good game

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.050
Launching a successful game to the market for me

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.720
means you are able to make money whilst

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.160
also being able to satisfy your desire for creativity at the same time

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.710
Tools are very important to game development

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.860
In fact, good tools can significantly improve

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.530
the communication efficiency

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.830
In the early days when Cytus II just hit the market

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.000
it had a crash rate of 8%

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.240
We then used the Android vitals dashboard in the Play Console

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.010
to monitor app performance so we could find out about

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.120
any problems for particular versions or devices

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.580
This data helped us identify and fix the issues quickly

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.192
resulting in a reduction of 0.12% to the crash rate

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:20.420
and great improvement to the stability of Cytus II

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.840
The Google Play Console has a very nice feature

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.310
called staged rollout

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.870
With internal tests, our internal QAs can play and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.140
test the latest version every day

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.780
Closed test and open test allow us to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270
run pre-release versions of our app

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.640
with targeted users all over the world

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.900
We can read feedback from users speaking different languages

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.010
directly in Play Console and all feedback is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.450
automatically translated to the language that our developers use

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.040
Furthermore, Play Console actually sorts and filters the feedback

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.780
by many different dimensions

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.460
for example, we can select a cluster to get more details

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.360
about a specific issue like app crashes or design problems

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.340
This helps us increase our productivity considerably

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.080
The Play Console also offers a tool called A/B test

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.280
With this feature, we can A/B test changes

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.460
to our store listing or icons

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.450
and find out which version has a better conversion rate

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.450
It has helped us increase the conversion rate of the downloadby 10%

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.390
which is 4.8% higher than other similar games

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.160
We think this feature is particularly useful to game developers

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.140
We see Rayark as more than a game company

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.770
but as a content provider

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.480
Technology is evolving with time

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.240
so are the game platforms

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.120
But still, something stays and dwells at the bottom of gamers’ hearts

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.200
That is the emotions people experience

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.800
when creating or playing a good game

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.720
What I mean here is that to create wonderful moments

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.016
that people can cherish deeply

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:51.300
Intellectual Property is the focus of what Rayark does today

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.530
and will always be committed to in the future
