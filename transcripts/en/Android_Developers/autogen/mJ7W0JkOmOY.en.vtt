into instant messaging so what we did

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
into instant messaging so what we did
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.660
into instant messaging so what we did
was we took a look at rather than take a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
was we took a look at rather than take a
 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.600
was we took a look at rather than take a
look at existing apps like group me and

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610

week's app clinic we wanted to think of

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849
week's app clinic we wanted to think of
 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.960
week's app clinic we wanted to think of
what would a hypothetical awesome IM

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970
what would a hypothetical awesome IM
 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.270
what would a hypothetical awesome IM
client or messaging client look like and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280
client or messaging client look like and
 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.190
client or messaging client look like and
so we came up with a few screen mocks

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200
so we came up with a few screen mocks
 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.699
so we came up with a few screen mocks
for what that could look like we didn't

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709
for what that could look like we didn't
 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.900
for what that could look like we didn't
give it a name or anything so it's just

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910
give it a name or anything so it's just
 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.180
give it a name or anything so it's just
called hypothetical messaging app and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190
called hypothetical messaging app and
 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.680
called hypothetical messaging app and
you can see here this is kind of one of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
you can see here this is kind of one of
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.590
you can see here this is kind of one of
the the key I guess hero screens for the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600
the the key I guess hero screens for the
 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.539
the the key I guess hero screens for the
app it's basically the conversation view

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549
app it's basically the conversation view
 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.309
app it's basically the conversation view
in this view your you know you're

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319
in this view your you know you're
 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.509
in this view your you know you're
communicating with a bunch of different

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519
communicating with a bunch of different
 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.650
communicating with a bunch of different
people in this case you're Luke

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660
people in this case you're Luke
 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.320
people in this case you're Luke
Skywalker talking to all your friends

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330
Skywalker talking to all your friends
 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.090
Skywalker talking to all your friends
and the point here is that we didn't

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100
and the point here is that we didn't
 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.979
and the point here is that we didn't
want to really emphasize all the chrome

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989
want to really emphasize all the chrome
 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.020
want to really emphasize all the chrome
around instant messaging like all the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030
around instant messaging like all the
 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.970
around instant messaging like all the
action bar stuff and the action buttons

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980
action bar stuff and the action buttons
 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.860
action bar stuff and the action buttons
that we talked about usually you really

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870
that we talked about usually you really
 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.390
that we talked about usually you really
want to focus on how you present the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400
want to focus on how you present the
 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.180
want to focus on how you present the
content so here you can notice that

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190
content so here you can notice that
 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.729
content so here you can notice that
there's three different types of content

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739
there's three different types of content
 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.319

live what if you could do that with
video so I did a quick mock-up let's

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630
video so I did a quick mock-up let's
 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.990
video so I did a quick mock-up let's
just skip this one did a quick mock-up

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000
just skip this one did a quick mock-up
 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.909
just skip this one did a quick mock-up
of what that could look like so you

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919
of what that could look like so you
 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.520
of what that could look like so you
press like stream I guess you press the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530

from your camera it immediately changes
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.710
from your camera it immediately changes
the composed box into a basically a

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720
the composed box into a basically a
 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.440

recorder you kind of just see you got to
 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.960
recorder you kind of just see you got to
just see this kind of live token in the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970
just see this kind of live token in the
 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.060
just see this kind of live token in the
stream and then maybe as people are

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070
stream and then maybe as people are
 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.490
stream and then maybe as people are
saying stuff as they're responding to

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500
saying stuff as they're responding to
 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.560

your video they can kind of you know
 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.839
your video they can kind of you know
type and type in type in oil maybe stick

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849
type and type in type in oil maybe stick
 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.659

window that wasn't mocked up of course

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680
window that wasn't mocked up of course
 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.469
window that wasn't mocked up of course
so just to be clear the videos actually

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479
so just to be clear the videos actually
 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.330
so just to be clear the videos actually
playing in line in the conversation that

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340
playing in line in the conversation that
 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.920
playing in line in the conversation that
right and would there be like a full

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930
right and would there be like a full
 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.050
right and would there be like a full
screen mode as well yeah yeah so I mean

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060
screen mode as well yeah yeah so I mean
 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.969
screen mode as well yeah yeah so I mean
like we didn't mock this up but I think

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979
like we didn't mock this up but I think
 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.469
like we didn't mock this up but I think
if we had some more time we totally do

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479
if we had some more time we totally do
 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.629
if we had some more time we totally do
this but the idea would be like you're

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639
this but the idea would be like you're
 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.790
this but the idea would be like you're
streaming video it's not like a you know

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800
streaming video it's not like a you know
 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.379

just a token that's playable kind of

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750
just a token that's playable kind of
 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.750
just a token that's playable kind of
like a YouTube video or or whatever

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760
like a YouTube video or or whatever
 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.390
like a YouTube video or or whatever
that's attached but in line you know in

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400
that's attached but in line you know in
 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.710
that's attached but in line you know in
the stream if you're if somebody's

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720
the stream if you're if somebody's
 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.899

so this is something that I just haven't

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100
so this is something that I just haven't
 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.380
so this is something that I just haven't
seen other ABS do and I think that it's

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390
seen other ABS do and I think that it's
 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.150
seen other ABS do and I think that it's
something that like think about ways to

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160
something that like think about ways to
 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.970
something that like think about ways to
compose rich content not only view rich

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980
compose rich content not only view rich
 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.850
compose rich content not only view rich
content but compose it right and so

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860
content but compose it right and so
 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.400
content but compose it right and so
another one of these another one of

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410
another one of these another one of
 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.830
another one of these another one of
these screenshots or mocks you have this

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840
these screenshots or mocks you have this
 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.330
these screenshots or mocks you have this
kind of composition window that can

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340
kind of composition window that can
 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.940
kind of composition window that can
accept tokens so let's say you paste the

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950
accept tokens so let's say you paste the
 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.010
accept tokens so let's say you paste the
URL you know what if you just paste the

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020
URL you know what if you just paste the
 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.140
URL you know what if you just paste the
token indicating that this is a URL

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150
token indicating that this is a URL
 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.600
token indicating that this is a URL
object and you know maybe a place is

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610
object and you know maybe a place is
 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.870
object and you know maybe a place is
also kind of a place to intercept so

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880
also kind of a place to intercept so
 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.620
also kind of a place to intercept so
this is just something that I think

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630
this is just something that I think
 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.690
this is just something that I think
folks should think about yeah I think

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700
folks should think about yeah I think
 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.670
folks should think about yeah I think
it's cool to with the images as well

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680
it's cool to with the images as well
 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.460
it's cool to with the images as well
that you can scroll those in line yeah

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470
that you can scroll those in line yeah
 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.820
that you can scroll those in line yeah
so I mean if you have if you have where

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830
so I mean if you have if you have where
 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.770
so I mean if you have if you have where
is it let's go back here right if you

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780
is it let's go back here right if you
 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.680
is it let's go back here right if you
have a set of like six or seven images

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690
have a set of like six or seven images
 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.150
have a set of like six or seven images
that you've attached then you should

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160
that you've attached then you should
 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.740
that you've attached then you should
probably support the share intent right

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750
probably support the share intent right
 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.050
probably support the share intent right

detail view where you know on the left

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:20.970
detail view where you know on the left
 

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:21.900
detail view where you know on the left
you have

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:21.910
you have
 

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.370
you have
a master list of all your conversations

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:23.380
a master list of all your conversations
 

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.200
a master list of all your conversations
and then on the right you have your

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.210
and then on the right you have your
 

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.700
and then on the right you have your
conversation view now the important

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:29.710
conversation view now the important
 

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:30.780
conversation view now the important
thing to note here and this is kind of

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:30.790
thing to note here and this is kind of
 

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.670
thing to note here and this is kind of
where the interesting part of tablets

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680
where the interesting part of tablets
 

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.529
where the interesting part of tablets
comes in is there's a lot of ways to

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:34.539
comes in is there's a lot of ways to
 

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.380
comes in is there's a lot of ways to
optimize for a tablet you know on the

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:37.390
optimize for a tablet you know on the
 

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.409
optimize for a tablet you know on the
Left obviously we're combining screens

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419
Left obviously we're combining screens
 

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.430
Left obviously we're combining screens
but on the right you'll notice that the

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440
but on the right you'll notice that the
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.200
but on the right you'll notice that the
presentation of the conversation itself

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.210
presentation of the conversation itself
 

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.420
presentation of the conversation itself
is slightly different we've we've

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:45.430
is slightly different we've we've
 

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.280
is slightly different we've we've
increased the padding the spacing the

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.290
increased the padding the spacing the
 

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.700
increased the padding the spacing the
margins to kind of let the let the core

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:50.710
margins to kind of let the let the core
 

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.580
margins to kind of let the let the core
content float freely within your bounds

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:53.590
content float freely within your bounds
 

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.650
content float freely within your bounds
so it's not kind of compressed into one

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:55.660
so it's not kind of compressed into one
 

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.810
so it's not kind of compressed into one
of the corners and edges so like the

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:57.820
of the corners and edges so like the
 

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.880
of the corners and edges so like the
spacing between you know the

00:08:59.880 --> 00:08:59.890
spacing between you know the
 

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.980
spacing between you know the
conversation and the avatar is increased

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:01.990
conversation and the avatar is increased
 

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.560
conversation and the avatar is increased
between the avatar and the kind of the

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:04.570
between the avatar and the kind of the
 

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.320
between the avatar and the kind of the
side of the screen and then everything

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.330
side of the screen and then everything
 

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.120
side of the screen and then everything
is just bigger like these images are no

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.130
is just bigger like these images are no
 

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.250
is just bigger like these images are no
longer a one to one aspect ratio they're

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:11.260
longer a one to one aspect ratio they're
 

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.830
longer a one to one aspect ratio they're
kind of slightly wider to again account

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:13.840
kind of slightly wider to again account
 

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.570
kind of slightly wider to again account
for the extra with you have on its

for the extra with you have on its
 

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.640
for the extra with you have on its
screen and then there's just like

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.650
screen and then there's just like
 

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.090
screen and then there's just like
everything is larger right so this this

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.100
everything is larger right so this this
 

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.250

thumbnails more space to breathe so

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240
thumbnails more space to breathe so
 

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.090
thumbnails more space to breathe so
that's kind of just one example of how

then you know you don't need to have

00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919
then you know you don't need to have
 

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:10.070
then you know you don't need to have
that taking up a lot of space throughout

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080
that taking up a lot of space throughout
 

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.510
that taking up a lot of space throughout
every level of the hierarchy so I love

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520
every level of the hierarchy so I love
 

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.409

the way there's going to put the

00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419
the way there's going to put the
 

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.900

collapse representation on their kind of

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:14.910
collapse representation on their kind of
 

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.120
collapse representation on their kind of
child screens which allows you to use

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.130
child screens which allows you to use
 

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.060
child screens which allows you to use
the title more space more effectively

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.070
the title more space more effectively
 

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.960
the title more space more effectively
which i think is a really nice detail

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:20.970
which i think is a really nice detail
 

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.710
which i think is a really nice detail
they don't very well there yeah

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720
they don't very well there yeah
 

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.210
they don't very well there yeah
definitely definitely and this is

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220
definitely definitely and this is
 

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.919
definitely definitely and this is
something that the i/o app does so I

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:27.929
something that the i/o app does so I
 

00:20:27.929 --> 00:20:29.960
something that the i/o app does so I
mean if you want to see how it's done in

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:29.970
mean if you want to see how it's done in
 

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.669
mean if you want to see how it's done in
terms of implementation I just take a

00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679
terms of implementation I just take a
 

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:33.110
terms of implementation I just take a
look at the google i/o app which is open

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120
look at the google i/o app which is open
 

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.150
look at the google i/o app which is open
source and it does this showing a logo

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160
source and it does this showing a logo
 

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.340
source and it does this showing a logo
on your home screen and then just an

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:37.350
on your home screen and then just an
 

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.220
on your home screen and then just an
icon which is again customizable doesn't

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:40.230
icon which is again customizable doesn't
 

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.380

have to be your launcher icon just an
 

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.120
have to be your launcher icon just an

next app is speed test Adam even talked

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260
next app is speed test Adam even talked
 

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.140
next app is speed test Adam even talked
about pizza yeah speed test for those of

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.150
about pizza yeah speed test for those of
 

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.760
about pizza yeah speed test for those of
you haven't used this app it's it's a

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:52.770
you haven't used this app it's it's a
 

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.740
you haven't used this app it's it's a
pretty simple app at least at least on

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:54.750
pretty simple app at least at least on
 

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.820
pretty simple app at least at least on
the Android side I'm sure there's a

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:55.830
the Android side I'm sure there's a
 

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.990
the Android side I'm sure there's a
bunch of infrastructure on the server

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000
bunch of infrastructure on the server
 

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.390
bunch of infrastructure on the server
side but it's used just for measuring

00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400
side but it's used just for measuring
 

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.730
side but it's used just for measuring
the speed of the connection that you

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740
the speed of the connection that you
 

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.770
the speed of the connection that you
have so it could be measuring Wi-Fi

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780
have so it could be measuring Wi-Fi
 

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.390
have so it could be measuring Wi-Fi
connection could be measuring 3g 4g

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400
connection could be measuring 3g 4g
 

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.890
connection could be measuring 3g 4g
whatever connection that you have to the

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900
whatever connection that you have to the
 

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.710
whatever connection that you have to the
server so it really does just two things

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720
server so it really does just two things
 

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.779
server so it really does just two things
it measures your speed

00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:11.789
it measures your speed
 

00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:14.119
it measures your speed
does a speed test and it stores your

00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:14.129
does a speed test and it stores your
 

00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:15.799
does a speed test and it stores your
historical test so you can see you know

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:15.809
historical test so you can see you know
 

00:21:15.809 --> 00:21:18.320
historical test so you can see you know
where you were which speeds you got it's

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:18.330
where you were which speeds you got it's
 

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.180
where you were which speeds you got it's
actually fairly popular you know people

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:27.690
shot of the original app here um I know
 

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.299

this might almost get the award for

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:29.309
this might almost get the award for
 

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:32.419
this might almost get the award for
stark contrast as well the interesting

00:21:32.419 --> 00:21:32.429
stark contrast as well the interesting
 

00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:34.279
stark contrast as well the interesting
thing about the current app is that it

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:34.289
thing about the current app is that it
 

00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:36.349
thing about the current app is that it
actually locks itself to particular

00:21:36.349 --> 00:21:36.359
actually locks itself to particular
 

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:38.899
actually locks itself to particular
dimensions I'm not even sure how they

00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:38.909
dimensions I'm not even sure how they
 

00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:39.950
dimensions I'm not even sure how they
did I think they would have had to go

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960
did I think they would have had to go
 

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.659
did I think they would have had to go
out of their way specifically to do that

00:21:41.659 --> 00:21:41.669
out of their way specifically to do that
 

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:45.049
out of their way specifically to do that
so even on my Nexus 4 it shows in a

00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059
so even on my Nexus 4 it shows in a
 

00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:47.029
so even on my Nexus 4 it shows in a
small cropped window with black space

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039
small cropped window with black space
 

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.529
small cropped window with black space
around it which is really peculiar it's

00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539
around it which is really peculiar it's
 

00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:50.330
around it which is really peculiar it's
almost like frame not even letter but

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340
almost like frame not even letter but
 

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.609
almost like frame not even letter but
yeah it's framed in like black pixels

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:52.619
yeah it's framed in like black pixels
 

00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:54.440
yeah it's framed in like black pixels
yeah definitely and if you learn it up

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:54.450
yeah definitely and if you learn it up
 

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.759
yeah definitely and if you learn it up
on a tablet it does the same thing it's

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:55.769
on a tablet it does the same thing it's
 

00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:57.979
on a tablet it does the same thing it's
just this tiny little window in the

00:21:57.979 --> 00:21:57.989
just this tiny little window in the
 

00:21:57.989 --> 00:22:00.560
just this tiny little window in the
middle of the screen so I like this just

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:00.570
middle of the screen so I like this just
 

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.930
middle of the screen so I like this just
because it really simplifies the the

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940
because it really simplifies the the
 

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.089
because it really simplifies the the
look and feel it brings the content out

00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:05.099
look and feel it brings the content out
 

00:22:05.099 --> 00:22:07.609
look and feel it brings the content out
and and it sticks to sort of the you

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:07.619
and and it sticks to sort of the you
 

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:09.080
and and it sticks to sort of the you
know the roots of what the app is trying

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:09.090
know the roots of what the app is trying
 

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.719
know the roots of what the app is trying
to do here measure the speed and show

00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:11.729
to do here measure the speed and show
 

00:22:11.729 --> 00:22:15.080
to do here measure the speed and show
your historical entries um it also has

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.090
your historical entries um it also has
 

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.940
your historical entries um it also has
elements of the new clock app I think to

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:16.950
elements of the new clock app I think to
 

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.249
elements of the new clock app I think to
it and new stopwatch app that ship with

00:22:19.249 --> 00:22:19.259
it and new stopwatch app that ship with
 

00:22:19.259 --> 00:22:21.109
it and new stopwatch app that ship with
Android 4.2 which i think is a good

00:22:21.109 --> 00:22:21.119
Android 4.2 which i think is a good
 

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:23.599
Android 4.2 which i think is a good

thing yeah are you going here so I mean
 

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:25.159
thing yeah are you going here so I mean
not not much else to come in here other

00:22:25.159 --> 00:22:25.169
not not much else to come in here other
 

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:26.599
not not much else to come in here other
than I think it looks really nice the

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:26.609
than I think it looks really nice the
 

00:22:26.609 --> 00:22:29.089
than I think it looks really nice the
whole thing is great and it really

00:22:29.089 --> 00:22:29.099
whole thing is great and it really
 

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:30.710
whole thing is great and it really
sticks to a sort of sort of main

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720
sticks to a sort of sort of main
 

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.119
sticks to a sort of sort of main
navigation that we would recommend for

00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:32.129
navigation that we would recommend for
 

00:22:32.129 --> 00:22:34.249
navigation that we would recommend for
an app like this menu about an action

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:34.259
an app like this menu about an action
 

00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:36.889
an app like this menu about an action
bar tabs and then and then to content

bar tabs and then and then to content
 

00:22:36.899 --> 00:22:39.349

pains on the tablet UI I think the other

00:22:39.349 --> 00:22:39.359
pains on the tablet UI I think the other
 

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.639
pains on the tablet UI I think the other
thing I just want to point out for the

00:22:40.639 --> 00:22:40.649
thing I just want to point out for the
 

00:22:40.649 --> 00:22:42.739
thing I just want to point out for the
tablet UI is look how much you can do

00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:42.749
tablet UI is look how much you can do
 

00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:44.869
tablet UI is look how much you can do
just changing metrics just changing

00:22:44.869 --> 00:22:44.879
just changing metrics just changing
 

00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:47.089
just changing metrics just changing
dimensions the only difference and I'm

00:22:47.089 --> 00:22:47.099
dimensions the only difference and I'm
 

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.769
dimensions the only difference and I'm
guessing that the assets are probably

00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:48.779
guessing that the assets are probably
 

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:49.940
guessing that the assets are probably
the same they're probably not even using

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:49.950
the same they're probably not even using
 

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:51.320
the same they're probably not even using
any assets there's probably some custom

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:51.330
any assets there's probably some custom
 

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.919
any assets there's probably some custom
drawing if you implement this but the

00:22:54.919 --> 00:22:54.929
drawing if you implement this but the
 

00:22:54.929 --> 00:22:56.779
drawing if you implement this but the
font sizes are slightly larger the

00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:56.789
font sizes are slightly larger the
 

00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:58.339
font sizes are slightly larger the
spacing between elements is slightly

00:22:58.339 --> 00:22:58.349
spacing between elements is slightly
 

00:22:58.349 --> 00:23:00.619
spacing between elements is slightly
larger the size of that circle is

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:00.629
larger the size of that circle is
 

00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:02.479
larger the size of that circle is
obviously larger but then just like it's

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:02.489
obviously larger but then just like it's
 

00:23:02.489 --> 00:23:04.789
obviously larger but then just like it's
really just about spacing font size and

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799
really just about spacing font size and
 

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:07.039
really just about spacing font size and
in just dimensions and metrics and

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:07.049
in just dimensions and metrics and
 

00:23:07.049 --> 00:23:08.119
in just dimensions and metrics and
obviously having if you're showing

00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:08.129
obviously having if you're showing
 

00:23:08.129 --> 00:23:10.609
obviously having if you're showing
images you know showing those images at

00:23:10.609 --> 00:23:10.619
images you know showing those images at
 

00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:12.409
images you know showing those images at
full resolution but it's really shows

00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419
full resolution but it's really shows
 

00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:14.299
full resolution but it's really shows
that shows the power of what you can do

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:14.309
that shows the power of what you can do
 

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:17.089
that shows the power of what you can do
with just dimensions so for developers

00:23:17.089 --> 00:23:17.099
with just dimensions so for developers
 

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:18.289
with just dimensions so for developers
out there if you just extract your

00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299
out there if you just extract your
 

00:23:18.299 --> 00:23:19.999
out there if you just extract your
dimensions in two dimension resources

00:23:19.999 --> 00:23:20.009
dimensions in two dimension resources
 

00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:22.070

you don't even have to create a tablet

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080
you don't even have to create a tablet
 

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.370
you don't even have to create a tablet
specific layout in a lot of case

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:23.380
specific layout in a lot of case
 

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.780
specific layout in a lot of case
you just change the dimensions for

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:24.790
you just change the dimensions for
 

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:29.430
you just change the dimensions for
tablets yep good job Glen Barker so yeah

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440
tablets yep good job Glen Barker so yeah
 

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.840
tablets yep good job Glen Barker so yeah
I guess the takeaway for the designers

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:30.850
I guess the takeaway for the designers
 

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.070
I guess the takeaway for the designers
for that is he I don't be scared about

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080
for that is he I don't be scared about
 

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.840
for that is he I don't be scared about
you know having signed it looks similar

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:33.850
you know having signed it looks similar
 

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.550
you know having signed it looks similar
but then you call out different

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:35.560
but then you call out different
 

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.380
but then you call out different
switching points at which you say the

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.390
switching points at which you say the
 

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.640
switching points at which you say the
texts I should be larger because that's

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:38.650
texts I should be larger because that's
 

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.380
texts I should be larger because that's
really easy for developers to do yeah

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.390
really easy for developers to do yeah
 

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.390
really easy for developers to do yeah
exactly and maybe like we should

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400
exactly and maybe like we should
 

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.980
exactly and maybe like we should
probably do it a future episode and how

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:43.990
probably do it a future episode and how
 

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.420
probably do it a future episode and how
to like best annotate that in your

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:45.430
to like best annotate that in your
 

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.280
to like best annotate that in your
mock-ups that's definitely something

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:47.290
mock-ups that's definitely something
 

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.350
mock-ups that's definitely something
that like it requires some logic like if

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360
that like it requires some logic like if
 

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.560
that like it requires some logic like if
this then that maybe we should talk

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:52.570
this then that maybe we should talk
 

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.120
this then that maybe we should talk
about that a little more but anyway

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.130
about that a little more but anyway
 

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.800
about that a little more but anyway
let's move on to the next step since

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:55.810
let's move on to the next step since
 

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.970
let's move on to the next step since
we're running a little long time IMDb

00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980
we're running a little long time IMDb
 

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.760

about this redesign in particular was

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.700
about this redesign in particular was
 

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.820

they didn't just not just but in only

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:08.830
they didn't just not just but in only
 

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.160
they didn't just not just but in only
apply hollow look and feel to it they

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.170
apply hollow look and feel to it they
 

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.950
apply hollow look and feel to it they
also took a stab at and looking at the

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960
also took a stab at and looking at the
 

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.570
also took a stab at and looking at the
information architecture so I say they

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:15.580
information architecture so I say they
 

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.820
information architecture so I say they

and he's kind of really rearranged the

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:29.620
and he's kind of really rearranged the
 

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.800
and he's kind of really rearranged the
hierarchy of the information to make

you can't see this here in one of his
 

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.950
you can't see this here in one of his
markups he basically hid all the trivia

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960
markups he basically hid all the trivia
 

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.960
markups he basically hid all the trivia
information like the birth date and so

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:54.970
information like the birth date and so
 

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.940

expandable item here at the top and
 

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.590
expandable item here at the top and
that's kind of it's it's it's nice right

get at and then when you touch on one of

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.050
get at and then when you touch on one of
 

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.230

these movie titles it kind of gives you

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240
these movie titles it kind of gives you
 

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.480

a very quick pop up I've probably use

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:30.490
a very quick pop up I've probably use
 

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.610
a very quick pop up I've probably use
something besides a pop up but it shows

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:32.620
something besides a pop up but it shows
 

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.110
something besides a pop up but it shows
you're very quick pop up showing you the

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120
you're very quick pop up showing you the
 

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.940
you're very quick pop up showing you the
immediately important things like the

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:35.950
immediately important things like the
 

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:36.860
immediately important things like the
rating and then

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:36.870
rating and then
 

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.799
rating and then
I think the metascore so like obviously

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:39.809
I think the metascore so like obviously
 

00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:42.380
I think the metascore so like obviously
you want to see if if movies are good

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:42.390
you want to see if if movies are good

you want to see if if movies are good
you know on the go you're deciding

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100
you know on the go you're deciding
 

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.580
you know on the go you're deciding
between something so you know making

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:46.590
between something so you know making
 

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.850
between something so you know making
that rating number or star meter or

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860
that rating number or star meter or
 

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.620
that rating number or star meter or
whatever really prominent is probably

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:51.630
whatever really prominent is probably
 

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.630
whatever really prominent is probably
pretty important yeah generally dialogue

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640
pretty important yeah generally dialogue
 

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.400
pretty important yeah generally dialogue
not the answer but I would like to see
