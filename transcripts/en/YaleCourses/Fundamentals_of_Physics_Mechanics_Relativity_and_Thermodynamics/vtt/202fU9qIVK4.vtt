WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.500
So what did we do the last time?
Yeah,

2
00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:09.250
that's what we were talking about.
We are trying to describe

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.350
an event as seen by two observers.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.070
One will be called s and here's the x axis [inaudible] that is call s prime is

5
00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:27.310
frame is sliding to the right at velocity.
You

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.700
therefore are at a certain time.
Let me say s is me and this Brian Miss you.

7
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:34.750
When you pass me,

8
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.680
I'm sitting at the audit and the my coordinates x equal to zero.

9
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.440
You are at the origin of your moving coordinates.

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Explained equals zero and when we crossed each other that time we said a zero in

11
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.900
know would own clocks.
We synchronize them

12
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.430
so that the event x equals zero x prime equals t equal to zero also had caught

13
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:04.531
in it explained me equals zero d prime equals zero when you and I crossed,

14
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.490
we pushed our stopwatches,

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.260
we synchronized our clocks about origins go coincided and that's when it began.

16
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.970
So after some time you are here.

17
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.020
This is your frame and this is my frame.
If something happens here,

18
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.490
something could be anything.
Event is,

19
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.470
I hope you understand what an event is.
That's not a relativist Ignatian.

20
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.700
That's the very old notion.
Something happens to someplace five track.

21
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.560
It goes off.

22
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.040
I asked you when did it happen and where did it happen and you will given the

23
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:42.380
coordinates.
Everything that happens is an event.

24
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.340
You saw Elvis.
I say,
where did you see Elvis?
At the supermarket.
Okay,

25
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.990
when did you see Elvis?

26
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.190
I would also ask you what you were smoking because this third question,

27
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.060
that's not a third.
That's not an extra coordinate,

28
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.660
but in this case I would have left.
Well,

29
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.810
I should tell you beyond all the laughter,
that's the cts issue.

30
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.700
Why is that not a coordinate?

31
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.120
Why not ask more and more questions and call them all coordinates.

32
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.900
The reason the other things are not coordinates is very important.

33
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.650
Why is time now suddenly a coordinate?

34
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.830
Whereas you could have always asked a hundred years ago when there's something

35
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:26.831
happen and the reason is that you will see in the new relativistic physics x and

36
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:32.510
t according to one person get mixed up into x,

37
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:34.700
Raymond v Prime of the other person.

38
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.220
The fact that space and time coordinates can be combined to give the new space

39
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.850
and time coordinates is why it's called a coordinator.

40
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:48.560
I'll say more about it later.
No.
By the way,

41
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:50.630
I posted some notes on this topic.

42
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.750
For those of you who want to have a second pass at it,

43
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.250
I also don't know how much the textbook covers this topic because I spend a lot

44
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:02.260
of time on this topic,
not in proportion to what's in the book,

45
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.380
so you can look at those notes which I posted today before all the Einstein

46
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.210
stuff.
If something occurred here,

47
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.350
you would say it's at a distance.
Explain from your origin.

48
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.620
I will say it's at a distance extra.
My origin,

49
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.250
this difference between our audience would be ut.

50
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.910
Therefore before Einstein,

51
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.540
I would say x prime is x minus ut

52
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.820
and you would say

53
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.360
x should be what you think is a coordinate plus Uti.

54
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.570
<v 0>This is just going back and forth from you to me and you can already notice that</v>

56
00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:46.250
to go back and forth from you.
To me.

57
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.940
We just change the sign of the velocity cause I'm going to the right.

58
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.350
Then you are going to the left.
That's why the formulas of sign of university,

59
00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.280
what is the big change after that Enstein first is I admit the possibility that

60
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:06.530
maybe you will think the time elapsed since we synchronize our clocks is not

61
00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:09.350
necessarily the same.
I leave that option.
Oakland,

62
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.570
the t and t prime are not the same.

63
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.190
Second thing I do is I already explained to you that the velocity of light

64
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:19.730
coming out the same for different people.

65
00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:22.760
It's very counterintuitive because if you're going to the right,

66
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:27.050
I expect you to get a smaller speed and you to get the same answer so we know

67
00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:30.350
that it's because we don't agree anymore on clocks and meters,

68
00:04:30.351 --> 00:04:34.730
six being the same,
so in particular you will say,

69
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.590
I don't buy your prediction that I expect to get the answer to be x minus ut.

70
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.570
I'm going to put a fudge factor.

71
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.630
Gamma with depends on the velocity between you and me because your lengths are

72
00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:49.520
not my legs and likewise,

73
00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:53.360
I will tell you I don't agree with your expectation that I should get

74
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:57.620
explainable as ut prime.
I don't believe your lengths are really my lengths,

75
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.480
but I'm going to put the same fudge factor,
Gamma
disability,

76
00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:03.314
interesting result.

77
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.720
If I think your meter sticks are short so that I want to blow up the answer with

78
00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:09.554
some amount.

79
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.860
You're allowed to say the same about me because one of the big paradox is and

80
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:17.240
real activity that we can accuse each other of using meter sticks which are

81
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:20.510
short,
and we'll go into a little bit about how that's even possible,

82
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.890
but the postulates tell us that if my efforts fact that is gamma,

83
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.390
your should also be the same gamma.
So gamma is what we don't know.

84
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.600
I showed you a trick to find gamma.
I said,
let's imagine that this event here,

85
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.100
which could have been a firecracker,
is triggered by a light pulse.

86
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.110
That resentment when you and I met here,

87
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.670
the light poles goes racing and sets off an explosion here.

88
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.390
That's the event we're talking about.
That's not a generic event.

89
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:55.391
It's a particular event in which x has to be c Times d because that's the for

90
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.850
the light poles.
According to me,

91
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.210
light goes to the velocity of c and the event has got the same velocity

92
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.200
according to you.
This event here

93
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.260
should be connected by light poles.

94
00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:17.430
That foot x over t is c and x prime over t prime is the same seat.

95
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.660
Then I said dig this street questions multiply the lefthand side,

96
00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:22.860
but the left hand side,
right hand,

97
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.210
the right hand side put in these numbers and extract gamma.

98
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.780
And I will not repeat that part.
And gamma was this.

99
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.513
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.090
<v 0>Once you've got this,
you can take this gamma and pull it back here.</v>

101
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.400
Let's see what we get cause I'm going to put what we get here into this board.

102
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.030
Uh,
you guys got all of that.
Okay,

103
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:51.720
so I'm going to put it back here because this is just bagged on from last

104
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.583
lecture.

105
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.510
What we have then is x prime is x minus ut,

106
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.890
delighted by this
famous square root.

107
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.030
And if you go and solve for t prime in the other equation,

108
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.560
it's a simple algebraic manipulations.
I don't want to waste my time doing that.

109
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.950
You will find tip frame is equal to t minus UX overseas square divided by the

110
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:23.020
same squared root.

111
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.310
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

112
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.120
<v 0>these are priceless.
This is really all I've relatively,</v>

113
00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:34.620
all the funny stuff you hear about equals mc squared,
funny clogs,

114
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.410
the twin paradox.
Everything comes from these equations

115
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.900
and you people should be very pleased that within what,

116
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.050
six weeks of starting physics 200 you have all the things you need to understand

117
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:51.350
these equations to understand where they came from.

118
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.510
That's also the remarkable thing about relativity.

119
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:59.170
Lot of the modern things in physics required a lot of mathematics.
In fact,

120
00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:03.640
if you want to take a beam and you want to load it with weight and you want to

121
00:08:03.641 --> 00:08:06.910
see the stresses and strains the map in while that is thousand times more

122
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:11.080
difficult than this one,
and yet the mathematics of relativity is very,

123
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:13.270
very simple and accessible to all of you.

124
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.230
And that is nothing that I know that you don't know as far as how to get these

125
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:18.700
equations.
This is what you do.

126
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.310
Everything follows from taking these equations and analyzing them,

127
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.800
extracting the consequences.

128
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:30.220
And that's really more an issue of coverage than just intelligence.

129
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:31.900
Because once you've got these equations,

130
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.220
you will have to take them wherever they,

131
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.740
you'll have to follow them where they take you.

132
00:08:35.741 --> 00:08:36.820
And that's what we're going to do.

133
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.630
The rest of the whole remaining lectures are all about getting information from

134
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:45.160
this equation.
Now,
some of you are not used to writing equations.

135
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:48.010
I have noticed,
uh,
when you see something like this,

136
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.060
it's not clear what is being stated.
Let me to my new one more time.

137
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.400
You as a fixed number that's spirit elective to mind.

138
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.500
I see something happening.

139
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.420
I give it a pat of numbers x t you give the same event,

140
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.680
another pair of numbers explain p prime and this is how they relate.

141
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.950
So I gave you an analogy but let me repeat the analogy you feel now talking with

142
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:18.900
the x y plane rather than the XD plane.
That dart is not an event.

143
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.940
that.is a coordinate of a point.

144
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.360
Maybe where something is city I give to it.

145
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.220
Pair of numbers x and y

146
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.200
no you have a different coordinate system rotated relative to mine by some angle

147
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:34.434
data.

148
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.780
But that same court,
same location,

149
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:45.060
you measure x prime up to here and t prime from there a lot.
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.020
X Prime and wipe frame automation along your access.

151
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.113
<v 1>Okay.</v>

152
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.900
<v 0>And the formula there is x Prime Xcor sine theta,</v>

153
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.070
uh,
less white signed data

154
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.530
and wipe prime minus x sine data.

155
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.840
This white core science data

156
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.660
data is the analog of the velocity.
Then you take the zero.

157
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.120
You and I agree completely.
Ted is not zero.

158
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.820
Your access is it rotated relative to mine.

159
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:25.400
And the same point has two different numbers.
X,
Y for me.

160
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.360
Explain why pipe for you and the relation between them is this.

161
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:33.290
So you plug in my x and y you can get your experiment wipe right.

162
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.670
Let me give a concrete example.

163
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.990
Let's take that Eiko to fire over four or 45 degrees.

164
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.980
Then as you know,
at 45 sine and cosine,

165
00:10:44.981 --> 00:10:49.270
and they're all the same one over route too.
So in that case,

166
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.190
x prime is x over two to less.

167
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.200
Why overruled two and white frame is minus x over route two plus y over route

168
00:11:01.571 --> 00:11:02.404
two.

169
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.580
That's a special case when theater is 45 degrees.

170
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.820
So for every angle costs in st Mildred used to usual simple numbers happen to be

171
00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:18.970
a square root of two here.

172
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.720
Then it tells you my x and y are related to your experiment way prime in this

173
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:27.170
manner.
And you can test it.
For example,
take a product,
uh,

174
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.870
take a point with coordinates one,
one
x.
Why is one one,

175
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.710
if x,
y is one one and my access is it related to yours before,

176
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:41.080
if I degree one,
one lies right there.

177
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.770
So what I expect is your wife Prime.

178
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.090
There is no white frame and the quart in there should be entirely expert.

179
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.480
If I put in one one and you find if I put x equals y equal,

180
00:11:56.481 --> 00:12:00.880
the one wipe prime becomes zero.
And how about x prime?

181
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.940
It becomes one plus one over route to that means,
uh,

182
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.480
route two over route to just square root of two.

183
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.100
And a squad would have to of course would be the lengthy measured this way

184
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:20.101
because the length of the vector is square root of two and the vectors entirely

185
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:21.190
along the x direction.

186
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:26.000
So the length you will get for this coordinator will be rude to so come back to

187
00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:29.230
these equations.
They are the same thing.
If you want,

188
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.260
I can write an x prime s x divided by this number minus you divided by this

189
00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:37.640
number Times d.

190
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.290
So you can think of one over this number here as the analog of cost data and you

191
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:46.000
over this number as the analog of side.

192
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.300
So it just that,
uh,
instead of costume saying all being upstairs,

193
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:55.780
some of the numbers are down,
some of the numbers set up.
But for a given you,

194
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.710
these are all some numbers constant depending on you and x prime.

195
00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.580
It's a linear combination of x and t and t prime is some of the linear

196
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:04.490
combination of accent,

197
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.060
but I should warn you that it is not an ordinary rotation.

198
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.180
In other words,
you cannot treat this as a co signer that as a sign,

199
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.950
they're not school centered sign of anything because if they were this square

200
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.710
was that square should add up to one and they won't.
So don't even try that.

201
00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:27.270
This is not an ordinary day rotation,

202
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.510
but it is still what you can call a linear transformation.

203
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.690
Your transformation means the new numbers are related to the first power.

204
00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:39.690
So the old numbers,
they are linear.
They don't involve t squared and x squared,

205
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.460
okay,
so that is the content of the load.
In San summation,

206
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.140
everybody should understand what they do.
Better way of going back and forth.

207
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.710
Now you can go backwards.
You can say,
well,

208
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.040
how do I write x in terms of x prime and t prime?

209
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.720
There are two options open to you.
One is a decent simultaneous equations.

210
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.060
You got to find a way to solve for x and T in terms of experiment d prime and

211
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:14.061
all these funny functions involving you treat them all as constants and juggle

212
00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:14.830
them around,

213
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.960
multiply by this divided by that what you shouldn't do that because you know

214
00:14:18.961 --> 00:14:19.980
what the answer should be.

215
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.260
The answer should be the same as what I got with the velocity reversed.

216
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.610
So x will be x prime plus you tip frame or the square root.

217
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.870
If I write the way too,

218
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.290
it means I don't feel like putting what's in it at the same old thing.

219
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.490
So they got tired of writing.

220
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:40.491
That deep prime will be t plus Ux overseas squares divided by square root.

221
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.070
So once you'd be able to go back and forth,

222
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.590
just like in this formula if you like,
I gave it to you as example,

223
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:53.060
long back as a homework problem,

224
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:58.040
you can write a new formula that says x is equal to x prime cost sine theta

225
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.330
minus y signed data and y prime is equal to something.

226
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.650
I mean why you circled something,

227
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:06.680
something and the way to get that as either solve the equations.

228
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.700
I realized that if I go from me to you by a data,

229
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.760
I go from you to me by minus state and all you have to do is change,
signed,

230
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.290
dated,
minus sainted and leave the coastline there alone.

231
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.440
Similarly here you change the sign of the velocity.

232
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:23.570
You to get the river's transformations.

233
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.140
<v 0>Okay.
So that does the Lorentz transformation.</v>

235
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.590
Not we're going to start milking the tram,
salvation,

236
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.250
everything is going to be applying it to understand various things.

237
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.070
The first step in getting the mileage out of the Lord.
In Sam's summation,

238
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.200
you stick a pair of events.

239
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.780
I urge you whenever you get a problem in relativity to think in terms of events

240
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.530
and quite often think in terms of pair up events to events.

241
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.840
So event one is uh,

242
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.820
let me give concrete events and most of the leftovers,

243
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.540
the examples involve some degree of violence.
And so this one in walls had gun.

244
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.190
So I would take this gun.
So I'm not going to point in any of you guys.

245
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.190
I fired the gun.
That's event one.

246
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.520
Then gun a bullet hits a wall.
That's even too,

247
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.830
you can take to events connected by a bullet leaving me and hitting the wall,

248
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.180
or you can take to events not connected to anything.
Okay.

249
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.660
We can take two unrelated events but doesn't matter.
We go,

250
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.610
we're going to call them event one event two,

251
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.040
so even one we'll have coordinates x one t one right and according to you,

252
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.560
excellent prime t one pri.
So right,

253
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:46.561
the load and transformation that first relates x one prime is x one Wayne is

254
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.860
[inaudible] t one over the square root.

255
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:53.440
Then right here,

256
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.980
p one prime is t one minus u x one four c squared divided by the square root.

257
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.110
Similarly,
take the second event and write the law for that matter.

258
00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:09.990
It's the same thing with the new numbers in it,

259
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.910
sort of p to prime the teeth two minus u x to overseas square divided by square

260
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:21.004
root.

261
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.200
Now take the difference of two minus one.

262
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.040
You can take one minus two but it's very common to define.

263
00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:35.041
The difference would be two minus one and call it Delta x two prime delta x two

264
00:17:36.061 --> 00:17:41.061
prime is identical to the delta x prime is extra prime minus x one prime.

265
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.370
All the deltas will be defined to be second minus the first.

266
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.960
I'm telling you to take x one frame subtracted from x two prime on the left hand

267
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:57.231
side and call it Delta of exploring Deltav explain is the difference in the

268
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:00.810
spatial coordinate to the two events according to you,

269
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.790
if you come to the right hand side,

270
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.280
now this is something you guys should be able to do in your head.

271
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.890
I want to subtract that from that.

272
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.420
They shared the same denominator so that,
let me put the denominator there.

273
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.773
<v 1>Yes.</v>

274
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.360
<v 0>In the numerator you you'll get x two minus x one which in my convention I would</v>

275
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:24.360
call it Delta x and the other one will be you delta t.

276
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:33.340
What this tells you is that differences in coordinates also obey the same load

277
00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:36.890
and transformation.
Instead of seeing the coordinator.

278
00:18:36.891 --> 00:18:41.750
If an event was XD and you could explain t prime from the Lord and Sam
summation.

279
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.670
If you take a pair of events and they are separated in space by Delta x and in

280
00:18:46.671 --> 00:18:50.390
time by Delta t according to me,
the separation according to you,

281
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.960
your delta x primes and Delta t frames are given by similar formulas as the

282
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.190
Deloitte and stamps summation for the delta of the way.

283
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.560
This just came from taking the difference of three questions applied to the two

284
00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:09.490
separate events.

285
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.950
All right.
You can also do this backwards if you like.

286
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.760
If you want the differences that I get in terms of yours and yours in terms of

287
00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:25.480
mine,
you have to reverse the sign of you so I won't do that again.

288
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.060
<v 1>Yup.
Yeah,</v>

289
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.420
yeah.
Here.
Yeah.
Yeah.

290
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:38.933
<v 0>Uh,</v>

291
00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:44.010
this was the formula for x in terms of x prime and deep pride and t prime in

292
00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:46.630
terms of t and X.
Oh,

293
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.310
<v 1>here.
You don't want that</v>

294
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.290
primes on the bottom.

295
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.510
<v 0>Okay.
I got to give some numbers.
This is a,
this is B.
This is c.</v>

296
00:20:05.511 --> 00:20:07.200
What is the problem?
One of you,

297
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.510
the right of seat.
Oh,
oh,
yes,
yes,
yes,
of course.
Yes.

298
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.670
Thank you.
Okay.
Now public apologies forthcoming.
You want me to do this?

299
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.790
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Okay.

300
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.530
Do not hesitate to do this.
Okay.
In fact,
when I said,

301
00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.860
uh,
I don't know any more than you do about this,

302
00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:40.810
it looks like I know less than you do about it.

303
00:20:40.811 --> 00:20:44.110
So the fact that I know this doesn't mean I'm going to get it right.

304
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.670
So all of you screwed up in the midterm member.
That is hope for you.

305
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.300
Maybe you want to do ELA students,
but you can become a professor here.
Okay?

306
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.850
It's all right for us to get things wrong.
That's correct.
Very good.

307
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.460
Okay,
so if you're following me that well,
I'm very happy and out and all.

308
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:05.500
You must be following what I'm saying here.

309
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.050
So now let us
everything.
No,

310
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:13.090
I keep telling you I'm building it up in a big way,

311
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:16.080
but everything really is going to come from this version of the Lord and his

312
00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:19.090
transformation for differences.
Look,

313
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.900
suppose you are smart enough like Einstein and he did use these equations for

314
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:26.320
gamma.
What do you do next?
You know,
you write them down.

315
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.630
You can publish them and say,
according to me,

316
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:33.370
this is the rule for transformation,
but you cannot stop.
No.
You have to say,

317
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:36.940
what are the implications of my equations?

318
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:41.530
Because these equations are dramatic variations of Newtonian laws.

319
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.360
For example,

320
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.800
let's just do one thing to events are separated but 10 meters according to me,

321
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.800
they'll tax prime.
You've dealt acts as 10 meters at Delta X.

322
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.610
Prime is not 10 meters is 10 minus something divided by something,

323
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.880
so that distance between two events is changing.

324
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.550
That's not supposed to happen just because you get into a train,
right?

325
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.920
If I hold my hands and said I caught a fish that big,

326
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.740
that distance should be same for me and the trainer.

327
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.160
If you look at me bragging in the train from outside the train,

328
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.870
you should find the same distance.
We're saying it's not true.
Likewise,

329
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:23.510
if I say to events took place and I came to Yale on a certain day,

330
00:22:23.511 --> 00:22:27.400
I got a degree four years later,
that's supposed to be true for anybody,

331
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.140
but that's also not true.

332
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.130
If Delta t is for years does x is whatever you like.

333
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.850
Maybe you never left new haven,
so delta x zero that's four years,

334
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:39.580
that's not four years.
These are all drastic

335
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.420
consequences and being going to explore the consequences.

336
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:48.421
The first thing I'm going to do is to make sure that the velocity

337
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:53.020
transformations from one frame to another,
obey the requirements we set on it.

338
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.470
So he had what I'm going to do event one,
I fired the gun.
Okay,

339
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.320
let me just call it event one.

340
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.050
I fired the gun even to a bullet hits the wall.

341
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.370
So the separation between these two events is the delta x for me and the time it

342
00:23:19.371 --> 00:23:20.720
took.
The bullet is Delta t.

343
00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.460
You can also see the bullet from your train and you think the distance between

344
00:23:25.461 --> 00:23:29.270
me and the wall or something at the time between the fighting and hitting a wall

345
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:32.690
or something else than what would developed.
What's the velocity of the bullet?

346
00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:33.770
According to you and me?

347
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:35.683
<v 1>V</v>

348
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.220
<v 0>It's velocity of bullets</v>

349
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.143
<v 1>for me</v>

350
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.680
<v 0>would be Delta x</v>

351
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.630
<v 1>over Delta T.
Okay.
No,</v>

352
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.560
I should be a little more careful with my rotation.

353
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.800
Usually Delta said use for infor decimal numbers,

354
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.950
especially when you're going to define the velocity.

355
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.560
Velocity is the limit of these guys going to zero?

356
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.450
What's the property of learning Samsung [inaudible] that at this level,

357
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.720
when I say differences in time,
differences in space,

358
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.850
they had not necessarily small.

359
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.400
Nowhere was a assuming that the difference in x was smaller.

360
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:20.090
Difference in needs more.
They could be even separated by five light years.

361
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.910
You can still use them.
So at this stage,

362
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.860
don't think delta x has to be infinite decimal.

363
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.760
It is simply a shorthand for difference.
If I had that all the time in the world,

364
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:33.030
I would write everything is x two minus x one but I'm using delta as a short

365
00:24:33.031 --> 00:24:35.780
hand,
but when I'm going to find the velocity of a bullet,

366
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.010
which could even be the instantaneous velocity,
then he had,

367
00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:42.650
I do want to take the limit in which they go to zero.

368
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.390
Third becomes ds Dxdt.
So from now on,

369
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:50.300
for this purpose off velocity calculation,

370
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.890
you should take them to be infinitesimal decimal and approaching zero but not in

371
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:55.430
general.

372
00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:00.230
These equations are valid for Orbitz or big introvert us in time and space.

373
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.760
Now W let,
it'd be the velocity for you.

374
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.440
<v 0>That is ims and urs prime.</v>

375
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.570
W is delta x prime or Delta t prime with suitable limits.

376
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:16.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.760
<v 0>Well from this transformation lost,
you can get the,</v>

378
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:25.510
because here is delta x frame and hit his Delta p prime led me divide this

379
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:33.100
by this on the lefthand side to get w

380
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.730
when I write delta x prime over Delta t prime,

381
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.400
you guys take the limits of everything going to zero.

382
00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.630
I don't feel like writing that isn't,
in fact it's true even without the limit,

383
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.200
but let's apply it in the end to instantaneous velocity.

384
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.980
Then what happens in the right hand side here is what delta x prime is equal to

385
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.000
you.
Can you do this in your head?

386
00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.480
If this delta x minus you Delta t denominated cancels between dividing this by

387
00:26:05.341 --> 00:26:07.170
this it looks like,

388
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.410
<v 1>okay,
yeah,</v>

389
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.130
<v 0>I just divided this guy by this guy because that's we need to divide the</v>

390
00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:21.040
lefthand side,
but the left hand side you have to do by the right hand side,

391
00:26:21.041 --> 00:26:21.880
by the right hand side.

392
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.330
Now you should have an idea of what I'm planning to do.
What do we do next?

393
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.640
Do this expression here?

394
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.713
Yes.

395
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.670
A limit of what if it just take the limit of Delta t going to zero.

396
00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:44.580
You just going to get zero.
That's the limit you want to take.

397
00:26:44.581 --> 00:26:48.510
You got to bring the philosophies into the picture.
Yes.
Pardon me.

398
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.300
No for any value of you.
Yes.

399
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.130
What you want to do now is to divide the top and bottom of this by Delta t

400
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.390
because you got the velocity of the bullet.
Uh,
according to you,

401
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.050
I want to get the velocity,
the bullet according to me into the picture.

402
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.780
That is Delta x over Delta T.
Well,
this is not a typical derivative in calculus.

403
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:14.880
Okay?
You got to divide everything by Delta t,

404
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.720
then you will get delta x over Delta t there minus you divided by one minus.

405
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.920
You will see square time,
Delta x over Delta t.

406
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.580
This is true even for finite differences.
Now take the limit.

407
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:35.270
Then this becomes the last year of the bullet minus you there by one minus you

408
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.010
be overseas square.

409
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.690
So you got to drop box it on this guy.
This is another great formula.

410
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.640
So I hope you know why I divided by Delta t I wanted to find the velocity,

411
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.840
the bullet according to you and according to me for you.

412
00:27:58.841 --> 00:28:00.910
I took the distance over time.
Well,

413
00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:04.420
I've got all these distances and times and the top and bottom side divided by

414
00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:06.430
the time.
So everything turns into a velocity.

415
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.090
So this is the velocity of the bullet according to me.

416
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.920
If they're going to the right at a speed,
you in the good old days,

417
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.890
what did they expect?
You've got to understand that they,

418
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.660
my expectation the old days would be the minus you,
right?

419
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.050
Well let's going at speed.
V You're going at speed you to the right.

420
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.950
So you will see a diminished speed by an amount equal your speed,

421
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.270
but now it's the twist or something in the bottom.

422
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.710
The stuff in the bottom is a number less than one because one minus something,

423
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.160
they're going to jack up velocity.
Therefore,

424
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.540
the velocity you will actually measure somewhat bigger than what I expected in

425
00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:47.374
the old days.

426
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.810
If you ever want to get back to the good old days in any the calculation,

427
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:57.040
you should let the velocity of light gold,
infinity.
Of course it's not infinity.

428
00:28:57.041 --> 00:29:01.390
What you really mean is you oversee and v oversee are negligible.

429
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.510
That means my velocity,
the bullet velocity,

430
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.580
they're all small competitive velocity of light.

431
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.960
If we get back the answer from the whole base,
this the answer from the new days,

432
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.370
no,
let's find the beauty of this result.

433
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.830
Let's get the diverse result.

434
00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:26.790
Let us solve for the velocity I get in terms of velocity you get,

435
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.910
again,
I think you realize you can do the Algebra,

436
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.910
but you guys should know that to go from me back to you,

437
00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.940
I should simply reverse the sign of of a relative velocity.

438
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.100
<v 1>Okay?
Yeah.
This</v>

439
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.090
<v 0>is the backwards was up.</v>

440
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.240
Now the way you are in a train and you fired a bullet towards the front of the

441
00:29:47.241 --> 00:29:48.074
train,

442
00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.760
what speed do I attribute to the bullet from the ground?
Well,

443
00:29:52.761 --> 00:29:56.420
I had the bullet speed to the train speed.
That's what the numerator is.

444
00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.370
The nominated says the answer is somewhat less than that by this number.
Yes.

445
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.010
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

446
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.140
thank you very much.
Yeah,

447
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.020
<v 0>I mean what?
That's absolutely correct.
What I really need to do.</v>

448
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.890
It's quite correct.
It's not simply the change you to minus you what the chain,

449
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:28.200
the velocities that you were seeing and put them in the place of velocities that

450
00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:29.034
I was seeing.

451
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.390
<v 2>That's correct.
This is what you want to get.</v>

452
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.290
<v 0>Now let's look at the strength of this result.</v>

453
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:40.930
If someone tells you according to relativity,

454
00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.820
nothing can go faster than the speed of light.

455
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.890
You can try to beat the system as follows.
You can come to me and say,

456
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.360
can there be a gun?

457
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:53.200
Who's bullets go at three fourth the velocity of light and I would say yes,

458
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:54.711
and you went to how board?

459
00:30:54.711 --> 00:30:57.970
A train that goes at three for the velocity of light and out to that seems to be

460
00:30:57.971 --> 00:31:00.100
allowed.
Then you can say,
well,

461
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.260
let me get into the strain at day four,

462
00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:05.830
the velocity of light and fire a bullet at three 40 velocity.

463
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.480
Then from the ground,

464
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.440
it should appear to be going at 1.5 times over the last year of life.
Well,

465
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:14.380
that's the naive expectation,
but if you do it now,

466
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:19.710
let's put w equals three four C and you equally three four see the all answer

467
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:21.994
this disaster.

468
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:27.090
It says 1.5 c but the correct answer is that plus three four square.

469
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.740
So what is this guy?
Uh,
this is

470
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.420
1.5 c divided by one plus nine over 16

471
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.980
that's a good one to play everything by 16 on the top you'd get 24 the bottom,

472
00:31:54.981 --> 00:31:59.000
you'll get 25 see,
you see,
you can

473
00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.510
jack up the velocity as seen by the ground,

474
00:32:02.511 --> 00:32:06.020
but it'll never be 1.5 it'll still be less than the velocity of light.

475
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:10.983
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

476
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.710
<v 0>And the last thing you want to check out,</v>

477
00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:17.060
this velocity addition formula is wipe you started the whole thing.

478
00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:22.670
In other words,
suppose you suppose I see a pulse of light.
Let's go back now.

479
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.120
This formula w is the minus you over one minus UV overseas square.

480
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:33.500
Rather than applying it to a bullet or whatnot.

481
00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:38.030
Let's apply to the light pulse itself.
So I saw light posts.

482
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:42.950
So I say the object I saw,

483
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.510
which is what lead stands for,

484
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.600
had the value c and this is the pretty Einstein expectation.

485
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:55.250
W should be c minus you because the pulse will appear to travel slower to person

486
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.440
will being in the same direction as the pulse.

487
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.920
But our new formula says it is really that times u times see overseas squared.

488
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:07.660
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

489
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.680
<v 0>So that canceled one part of c,</v>

490
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.720
multiply the top and bottom by sea and you will find it a c.

491
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.940
So the last year late will always come out to be the same.

492
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.790
That was built into the formulas,
but it's a good thing to test.

493
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.463
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

494
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:29.140
<v 0>So what you find is Bella,
it don't add in a simple way.
If they did,</v>

495
00:33:29.141 --> 00:33:29.974
you are in trouble.

496
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.490
You cannot get an upper limit if they added in the simple way because you can

497
00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:34.780
put a rocket in spade,

498
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:37.600
another rocket inside and on the rocket and add up all the speeds.

499
00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.140
And even though each one is less than,
see the Jordan could be whatever you like,

500
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.940
but they don't add that way.

501
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.920
They add this way so that the answer this either bigger than what you think.

502
00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:50.860
If we end you are opposite,
are smarter than what you think.

503
00:33:50.861 --> 00:33:55.000
If the velocities in the top out of the same size,
no matter what you do,

504
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.100
the answer will always be less than C.
Okay?

505
00:33:59.101 --> 00:34:02.640
So that just the first conclusion from this

506
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.070
second conclusion.
Second conclusion,

507
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.080
which is again very staggering,
is that simultaneity is a relative concept.

508
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:20.070
In other words,
if two events,
I could at the same time for me,

509
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:25.410
they don't get at the same time for you,
that's very surprising.
But example,

510
00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.540
if you have twins,
barn,

511
00:34:27.541 --> 00:34:32.220
one in new Saudi prince cannot be born in New York and Los Angeles.

512
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.270
So I got two kids of different,
uh,

513
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.880
motherhood just happened to be born at the same time.
And I say at time,

514
00:34:41.881 --> 00:34:45.380
we're not talking about trivial three hour time difference between Los Angeles,

515
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.210
New York.
That's an artificial thing.
In the Einstein world,

516
00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:52.290
you imagine we all have clocks that read the same time.
So by that measure,

517
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.240
the kid two kids are born at the same time.

518
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.410
But if you watch that from a moving train and moving rocket,

519
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.600
you will disagree on that.
You will in fact say Vietnam simultaneous.

520
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.780
How does that come?
Where does come from going to this formula?

521
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:12.260
Delta t prime is Delta t minus you delta x overseas square divided by this

522
00:35:15.391 --> 00:35:16.224
number.

523
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:21.350
And all I'm telling you is even though Delta t zero t prime is not zero

524
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.800
either,
shock simultaneity is not absolute.

525
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.720
We think we used to think it's absolutely,
in other words,
do events.

526
00:35:33.721 --> 00:35:36.030
I could hang in Los Angeles and New York,

527
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.580
there can be arranged to be simultaneous for me living on the planet,
let's say.

528
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:44.910
But if you go in a rocket,
I expect you to agree they were simultaneous.

529
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.870
I mean how can it be different to things that are happening right now at

530
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.260
different places?
It's got to be right now for you,
but it's not.

531
00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:55.250
It just comes from that formula.
Once again,

532
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.040
if the velocity of light is made much bigger than everything in the problem,

533
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.450
simply to set it to infinity,
you will find out that the prime,

534
00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:07.451
a Delta t that goes back to Galilee and time,

535
00:36:07.691 --> 00:36:09.380
so the old pre Einstein Times.

536
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.990
That's why in relativity space and time form a new space,

537
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:20.991
time and time is called the fourth component because if c goes to infinity,

538
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:25.060
Delta Primus always dealt at t and t prime is always do that.

539
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.060
Coordinate never mixes with anything else,

540
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.530
doesn't deserve to be called a coordinate betters.
The X and y coordinates,

541
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.760
they mixed into each other.
When you do rotations in after the Einstein,

542
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.900
the space and time coordinates mixed with each other to give you a new space and

543
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:42.510
time coordinates under Lorentz transformations,

544
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.000
which means when seen in a moving frame

545
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:51.860
that's white time is no elevated to another dimension because it transforms very

546
00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:55.410
much the way.
Excellent.
Why did the details of the transformation are different.

547
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.980
You have science of course and replaced by you and you over the square root,

548
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:03.750
but it's still mathematically the way components of factors will transform.

549
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.040
Okay,
so simultaneity is relative.
So you have to ask yourself,

550
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.660
how did that happen?

551
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.210
So here is the famous example that was given in all the books.

552
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.140
Maybe it was given by Einstein,
I'm not sure.
So he hit us a train.

553
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.890
Let's say the train is at rest and you're standing in the middle and you want to

554
00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:30.890
arrange for two events to be simultaneous.
Oh by the way,

555
00:37:30.891 --> 00:37:32.030
that is one cat.

556
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.220
You have the two events occurred at the same time and the same place.

557
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.340
Bell tax is zero,
Delta t is zero.

558
00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.090
Then the transformation will tell you Dell Pax prime is zero and Delta p prime

559
00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:46.924
is zero

560
00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.570
because two events occurring at the same time at the same place means for

561
00:37:52.571 --> 00:37:55.450
example,
my two hands came and [inaudible] the two hands,

562
00:37:55.451 --> 00:37:58.450
but at the same time at the same place.
If someone said,

563
00:37:58.451 --> 00:38:00.310
well Dave or not at the same place at the same time,

564
00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:04.120
it means I did not play our two cars collide.

565
00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.020
So if two things occurred at the same time,
at the same place,

566
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.520
something happened that the mapped in space time,

567
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.130
you cannot find another observer who says they did not meet in spacetime I,

568
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.000
they'll say the two cars did not collide.

569
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.530
Soda activity even after relativity,

570
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:25.270
the strewed that two events at the same time and same place occurred at the same

571
00:38:25.271 --> 00:38:26.620
time and same place for all people.

572
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.600
Same time alone is not enough in the same place alone is not enough.

573
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.280
You see that if two cars came

574
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.610
<v 2>and they collided,
they were at the same time,
at the same place,
the cards,</v>

575
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.850
but at the same time here and there,
that's no accident if they,

576
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.850
but at the same place,

577
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:49.030
because this car went and two minutes later that Carter went to the same place,

578
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:53.030
nothing happens,
right?
That's what you say,
this board guy,

579
00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:54.790
he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

580
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.510
You don't have to say this guy was at the wrong place.
What does that mean?

581
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:01.230
You can go to the battle of Gettysburg site and stand.
No,

582
00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:05.140
nothing happens to you because at the same place,
but it's the wrong time.
Okay?

583
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:09.250
We all realized simply same time,
it's a congruence in space time.

584
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.780
And even after Einstein,
you cannot say something did not happen.
Good.

585
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.910
We're gonna leave that the politician,
these didn't happen.
This didn't happen.

586
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.380
And the equations have the property,

587
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:24.640
but I'm considering events separated in space,
but at the same time,

588
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.900
so you got on the train.

589
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.800
You're job is to make two things happen at the same time.
And here's what you do.

590
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:35.500
You send a beam of light,
the splits into,
uh,
you know,
he has a blown,

591
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:39.790
I picked a beam of light comes and splits like that and goes to the back in

592
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:40.540
front of the train.

593
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.170
You are in the middle of the train and you know that events will be simultaneous

594
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:45.004
for you.

595
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:51.400
The pulse travels on either side and hits the two things.

596
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.910
The two end sets off to explosions and you have done the best you can have

597
00:39:54.911 --> 00:39:57.330
simultaneous events.
Okay?

598
00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:02.790
<v 0>Okay.
Now I see you from the ground.
All this happening and the moving train,</v>

599
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.920
you have every right to say you're not moving,

600
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.220
but to me relative to me are moving.
That's the fact.

601
00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.440
And I look at how well you did with this.

602
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.270
<v 2>Okay,</v>

603
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.000
<v 0>so you sent out this to light pulses.
Then what happened?</v>

604
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.570
This wall of the train is moving away from the light post.
This wallet,
the train,

605
00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:24.880
the rear end is rushing to meet the light bulbs.
Oh,

606
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.550
the velocity of light is the same for everybody.
So yeah,

607
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.420
I can think in terms of what happens if one wall is rushing to meet the light

608
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:33.790
poles in one wall is running away from the light poles.

609
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:38.260
I know very clearly the firecracker in the back of the train will go off first

610
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.240
end of the front of the train would go off later.

611
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.510
That means that don't that the will not be zero.
In fact,

612
00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:50.600
you can see Delta t will be negative because the event with the greater,

613
00:40:50.601 --> 00:40:52.240
the x coordinate occurs later.

614
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.280
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

615
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.700
<v 0>and that's also an ugly men to the formula of Delta t zero Deltek's Brian will</v>

616
00:40:58.701 --> 00:41:03.040
be some negative numbers.
No.

617
00:41:03.041 --> 00:41:04.540
Why did we bring in the light poles?

618
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.860
We bring in the light poles because we can tell that they would simply will not

619
00:41:08.861 --> 00:41:11.380
be simultaneous because about the light.
We know this.

620
00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.970
It's velocity is same for everybody.

621
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.040
That's the way all arguments in relativity involved doing things with light

622
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:21.820
pulses are communicating with the light posts because we know what light does.

623
00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.330
It travels at one in the same velocity for all people at the postulate.

624
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:31.410
Therefore we know you couldn't have done any better in making them simultaneous

625
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.500
and I simply disagree with you.

626
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.390
I'd say they just did not happen at the same time and there's no question of who

627
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:41.270
is right operationally for me,

628
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.530
those two events were separated in time by some are more and for you they were

629
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:50.510
not.
That's a great new idea that things did not happen at the same time for all

630
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:54.260
people and really sturdy tells you that they didn't and tells you about how much

631
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:57.530
they will differ.
Okay.

632
00:41:57.531 --> 00:42:00.830
Then I take the next sort of price here.

633
00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.440
Next surprise has to do with clocks.

634
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.430
The claim is that clocks will not run at the same rate.
Okay.

635
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.520
When we bought the clocks,
we compared them,
we got them from the same shop,

636
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.920
they would completely in sync and you put one in your train and you got into

637
00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:21.921
your train and the claim is that I will find that your clocks are running slow.

638
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.670
Let me show that to you again.
You can want to do anything.

639
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:30.380
Relativity at least learned this one thing.

640
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:35.390
Go back to the Lord and Sam summation and think in terms of events than it just

641
00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:38.150
going to come out of the wash.
If you try something original on your own,

642
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.330
you people do all kinds of stuff.
I've seen you going into cyclical,

643
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:45.710
circular arguments from which you cannot even come out to somebody rescues you.

644
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.870
So don't do that.
So I'm looking at a clock.
You've got to ask yourself,

645
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.710
how do I turn this issue of time into a pair of events?

646
00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.130
I have my clock.
So it goes tick tock,
tick tock.
I take to events.

647
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.980
Even the one clock says stick

648
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.390
and even to clock says stock.

649
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.950
I tell you why I have taken talk because I wanted to have two distinct kind of

650
00:43:12.951 --> 00:43:14.420
events.
We can talk about them.

651
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.460
So this event is a clock that I am carrying with me.

652
00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.130
Clock is with me.

653
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.900
So let me put the clock at the center of my coordinate system or the origin.

654
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:29.390
It doesn't matter where it is.
Let me put it on the origin.

655
00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:34.770
The space time coordinate is x equals zero t equals zero is the first tick of

656
00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:36.434
the clock.

657
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.310
How about the next tick,
the next stick.

658
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.910
This is x and t coordinates the talk of the clock.

659
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:52.220
Let me call [inaudible] is the time of the clock,
the time period.

660
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.030
How many seconds elapsed between the tick and the Tock?

661
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.720
Main question is what is the location of the second take out the talk.

662
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.260
Where does that happen?
Yes,

663
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.490
it doesn't move it to the Spec to me and I'm talking about the clock that I'm

664
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:14.000
holding in my hand.
So if the first event took place at x equals zero,

665
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.370
second one also takes place at x equals zero.

666
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.180
You understand I'm holding the clock.
I would travel forward in time.

667
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.900
It's Taos zero seconds later,
but the clock has not gone anywhere.

668
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:26.480
So the two events,
the two takings of the clock,
uh,

669
00:44:26.481 --> 00:44:29.810
separated in space by zero and in time by [inaudible],

670
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.710
that means delta x is equal to zero.
Delta t is equal to zero.

671
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.210
What do you get according to you?

672
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.350
The time difference between the two ticks is Delta t,

673
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:46.770
which is zero minus you,
et Cetera.

674
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:49.410
At times zero divided by this factor.

675
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.410
That means the time difference between the two ticks would be bigger if that was

676
00:44:56.411 --> 00:45:00.930
zero was one second.
If you divide one by one minus use squared overseas square,

677
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.530
you're going to find out it is less is more.

678
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.460
For example,
if this factor in the denominator,
this 0.5

679
00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:15.980
then Delta t will be two times.zero.
In other words,

680
00:45:15.981 --> 00:45:19.220
when your clock has taken one second to go from one topic to the next,

681
00:45:19.221 --> 00:45:22.490
I will say according to me the real time elapses two seconds.

682
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.430
It can be 10 seconds.
That can be a hundred seconds.

683
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:28.910
You can make Delta t as big as you like letting you approach.
See,

684
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.970
<v 3>yeah,</v>

685
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.360
<v 0>yes.
Thank you.</v>

686
00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:43.361
I'm having this problem today with the Prime v Prime is how zero over this.

687
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.700
If you put [inaudible] one second question there guys,

688
00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.290
<v 3>I wanted to
zero.</v>

689
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.350
<v 0>No,
you did not go to zero.
You is not zero.</v>

690
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.550
You delta x overseas squared is the Dell tax that went to zero.

691
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.360
Go to the Lord and his transformation.
Uh,

692
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.990
Delta t prime is Delta t minus you delta x Overseas Square.

693
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:19.360
Delta x is zero because that's why.
That's where I'm telling the equation.

694
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:24.050
The clock is addressed with respect.
To me that means that too.

695
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:26.953
<v 3>Rolling.</v>

696
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.040
<v 0>No,
no.
Let in this example,</v>

697
00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:34.440
let the unprimed observer be the one holding the clock.
Then Delta x is zero.

698
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.140
Delta t is whatever the time of the clock is one second.

699
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:41.670
Delta p prime is seen by anybody else going at a speed you relative to me.

700
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:47.120
You can also do it backwards by taking the clock in the hands of the s prime got

701
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.060
to do a little more work.

702
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:52.050
It's a lot easier to here because I get to pump into the equation to facts and

703
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:57.051
one shot that the time between the two takes is one second and it's addressed

704
00:46:57.331 --> 00:47:00.960
with respect to me,
which is why the delta x vanished between the two ticks.

705
00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.750
If I want to use your equations,

706
00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.380
Delta x Prime won't be zero because a clock has moved and you got to do.

707
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:11.550
You can do it I think shown in my notes how to do that,
but it's unnecessary.

708
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:15.600
This is the main result.
Now here is a paradox.

709
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.250
You can go back to the backwards equations.
Uh,

710
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:25.740
let's do this informally.
Okay,
let's not write it again.
It will look like this,

711
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.470
right?
We know that.
Let's take a clock.

712
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:32.440
You are catty with ticks off one seconds.

713
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.580
So between the tick and the next tick the time differences,
one second,

714
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.390
space differences.
Zero.
I'd find Delta t is one over this way.

715
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.900
So I will say your clock is slow and you'll say my clock is slow.

716
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.400
How was that possible?
How can it be?

717
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.190
That'd be accused each other of having yes,

718
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.840
<v 1>because the person who trained</v>

719
00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.810
the other observers,

720
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:01.310
<v 0>well you're absolutely right.</v>

721
00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:03.590
The predictions are in agreement with that principle.

722
00:48:03.591 --> 00:48:05.030
But I asked you to think about

723
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.990
<v 3>the conflict you have.
Yes.</v>

724
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.080
It's a visual perspective and that uh,

725
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.090
true people who are far away from each other,
you each other as people.

726
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:19.720
So that's very good when they are close up and that doesn't bring into it.

727
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.370
<v 0>No,
that is correct.
He is.
Let me repeat what he said.</v>

728
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.530
You said if there are two people,
David,
that right next to each other,

729
00:48:25.531 --> 00:48:29.270
it'd be at the same height and they move apart and each person looks at the

730
00:48:29.271 --> 00:48:33.200
other person and finds the person diminished in size because of the distance and

731
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:37.640
each person can tell the other person you look small from where I am.
In fact,

732
00:48:37.641 --> 00:48:40.130
even more paradoxical is how in this world too,

733
00:48:40.131 --> 00:48:44.270
people can simultaneously look down on each other.
You figured that out,
right?

734
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.350
There are two people who simultaneously have a higher opinion of themselves or

735
00:48:48.351 --> 00:48:52.160
the other person and are the same thing.
They look down on each other.

736
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.710
I have not found it to how many space diminished.

737
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:56.660
I should embrace these people to make that possible.

738
00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:00.770
But this is certainly correct that spatial resolution,
lets give the impression.

739
00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.280
So here's the answer that is usually given to explain this to you.

740
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:10.520
If I take a real clock like this,
watch here and ask you why does it look slow?

741
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.160
Do you,
when I'm moving relative to you,

742
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.690
it's difficult because it's guardian or electronics and stuff and I still don't

743
00:49:17.691 --> 00:49:20.780
know how to set the clock.
On My VCR,
I'm not going to figure that out.

744
00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:23.480
So for all of us guys who are challenged,

745
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:27.560
that is a clock that's particularly simple and the clock works like this.

746
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.160
It has got two mirrors.
Okay.

747
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.530
And it light pulse,
yes,

748
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.790
goes up and down between the mirrors and every time it goes at a,

749
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:42.990
it's a round trip.
It sets off some detected and it goes click.

750
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.410
Now this is very important dimension that this is my x coordinate and that's the

751
00:49:49.411 --> 00:49:50.244
white coordinate.

752
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:54.990
And I did not show you here that a logical arguments and why if you and I had

753
00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:58.400
moving along x,
I would y coordinates if they agree in the beginning,

754
00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:59.310
continue to agree.

755
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.990
That's because if you say something is two meters tall and they pass each other,

756
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:09.040
you cannot have a disagreement on the fact that heights of the same Radisson,

757
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.910
the linear dimension is room for discussion in the transfers dimension.
That is.

758
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.251
So anyway,

759
00:50:14.251 --> 00:50:18.930
I have this block that goes up and down light bulb goes up and down it goes.

760
00:50:18.931 --> 00:50:19.680
A certain distance.

761
00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:24.680
L in the vertical direction and to l oversee is the time period of my clock.

762
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.030
That's the time for a round.

763
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:33.710
You look at my clock and what do you think is happening?
Remember?

764
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:35.900
Do you have moving to the right related to me.

765
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:40.340
So according to my clock is moving to the left and it looks like this.

766
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.360
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

767
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.480
<v 0>light beam is going on a zigzag path according to you.
You agree?</v>

768
00:50:48.481 --> 00:50:53.100
That's very clear for me.
The balance is going up and down for you.

769
00:50:53.101 --> 00:50:56.250
It's going on the high part in news.
You can,

770
00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.970
you can imagine how with the high part and use use square and csquared are going

771
00:50:59.971 --> 00:51:01.830
to come from drawing the sides of the triangle.

772
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.350
That's why the time will come out longer.

773
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.710
The way it be like this clock,

774
00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.380
because we know everything about the operation of the clock.

775
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:15.950
We know that this path is longer than the straight up and down pat because the

776
00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:19.770
transfers coordinators known to us,

777
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:23.760
but the more we know the velocity of late is the same in all frames of
reference.

778
00:51:23.761 --> 00:51:26.790
So light going on a longer path is simply going to take longer.

779
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:32.550
So I know you're Clark would slow down.
Now here's the beauty.

780
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.290
The beauty is that if you have a clock that's going up and down,

781
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:40.470
straight up and down,
when I see it is going to look like this.

782
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:48.820
So it's as simple as saying that if you had these two clocks and I think is

783
00:51:48.821 --> 00:51:49.654
going up and down,

784
00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.780
you would think it's a zigzag this way and I look at your clock.

785
00:51:52.781 --> 00:51:56.350
It is exactly the other way.
It's perfectly okay for me to say to you,

786
00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.340
your light pulse is going on.
Hypebot yes,

787
00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.180
mine is going up and down and why you can say that to me.

788
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.793
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

789
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:08.720
<v 0>So at least this light plot explains to you why clocks will appear to be slow.</v>

790
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.760
Now the question you can ask us,

791
00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:15.390
what if I have some either pluck with the gears and wheels and teeth and
whatnot?

792
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.390
How does that slow down?
The onset is,

793
00:52:18.391 --> 00:52:21.600
we don't know exactly how they explained that clock,

794
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:26.900
but I know that if you carry a light clock and another clock made up,

795
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.020
we,
you know,
we listened gears,
they should run at the same rate.

796
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.940
They should run at the same rate because if they ran a different rates,

797
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.120
one slow down in one,
didn't they?
Comparing the two clocks,

798
00:52:39.121 --> 00:52:44.121
you can determine your velocity and that we know is impossible by the postulate

799
00:52:44.671 --> 00:52:48.340
that you cannot detect uniform velocity that float.

800
00:52:48.341 --> 00:52:49.710
If the light clock does something,

801
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:52.620
all clocks must do the same thing regardless of the mechanism

802
00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.750
at that includes biological clocks.
So if you have a clock,

803
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:04.860
which is just yourself,
I look at you,
you know what,

804
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:08.040
a 15 or 20 years,
I notice some changes.
If they can tolerate,

805
00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:11.690
then your hair turns white,
your teeth fall off.
That's a clock.

806
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:16.640
And that clock could also slow down because I don't care how your life systems

807
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:19.040
work,
but you are a clock and you got to slow down.

808
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.780
That's why you can make predictions about what will happen to living systems

809
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:28.620
even though that's not our business.
So in particularly if you take a clock,

810
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:32.430
which is made up of mechanical parts and human being and they're traveling at

811
00:53:32.431 --> 00:53:33.264
high speeds,

812
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:37.620
the aging of the human being should slow down just like the clock sticking with

813
00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.630
slaughter without knowing the reasons for it.

814
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:44.520
So this leads to a very famous paradox called the twin paradox.

815
00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:50.520
The twin paradox say is that you got two guys,
twins.

816
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.780
Now this is this actually a valid example wanted at the same time,
same place,

817
00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.260
and then one goes on a trip at some speed you and goes around and comes back.

818
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:05.820
So I think the person has been gone for 20 years.
My twin,

819
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:08.730
so let's say he was 20 when he left,

820
00:54:08.731 --> 00:54:10.770
so I expected him to be 40 when he gets back.

821
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.940
But he'll come back younger because as a clock he has slowed down.

822
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:21.100
So what I think is 20 years,
this could be uh,

823
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.280
my time is 20 years,

824
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.400
but his time could be 10 because this factor downstairs is 0.5.

825
00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:29.460
So you can come back to being younger than me.

826
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.070
<v 3>Yes,
isn't it?
Isn't,
it isn't.</v>

827
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:38.120
The paradox of rise in general is the time dilation is a bit not different

828
00:54:39.361 --> 00:54:40.194
philosophy.

829
00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.820
<v 0>Uh,
but we got to be careful to his point hat is it something to do the</v>

830
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:44.920
acceleration,
but the real question is this.

831
00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:48.700
So if I am on the ground and I sent my twin on the trip and we meet

832
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:54.000
now the clocks are being compared as long as the zigzag is going this way and

833
00:54:54.001 --> 00:54:56.130
that Zack is going that way.
You can say what you like,

834
00:54:56.131 --> 00:55:00.840
but what are the clocks I brought head to head done compared can they both be

835
00:55:00.841 --> 00:55:04.110
slower than the other?
We know that's impossible.
So instead of clocks,

836
00:55:04.111 --> 00:55:08.700
we use human beings and dramatize a paradox and see who will be younger.

837
00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:10.650
Me Are the twin who went on the rocket.

838
00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:18.880
Well that can only one answer that question and yet the water,
the twin says,

839
00:55:18.881 --> 00:55:20.860
well I have no reason to believe that I moved.

840
00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.320
You're the one who went on the trip the opposite way,

841
00:55:23.321 --> 00:55:24.520
so you've got to be younger than me.

842
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.620
<v 3>Yes.
I guess the kids at the twin,
those that because he felt wildly effective,</v>

843
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.070
the acceleration that necessarily had to bring him back to the circle,

844
00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:36.430
you can just travel on going straight line and uh,

845
00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.000
not accelerate and then meet the twin backward.

846
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.910
<v 0>Very good.
Okay.
I couldn't have said it better.
Let me repeat it.
The point is,</v>

847
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.370
as long as you've got oppositely moving clocks,

848
00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.260
they can believe what they want of each other.

849
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.980
But if you want the clock to be subject to a comparison,

850
00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:53.620
then it can never,

851
00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:57.310
you can never compare objects that are constantly moving at opposite velocities.

852
00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:03.010
So somebody has got to turn it on and come back.
So in the case of the twin,

853
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:07.320
he and I about addressed the twin guard into the rocket,
the setup,

854
00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.900
the velocity difference between him and me.
So in the early stages,

855
00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:14.920
he is the 100 going acceleration and not me.
Likewise,

856
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.840
the twin went somewhere and stopped and turned around and came back the twin to

857
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:22.120
suffering the deceleration.
So that our two periods,

858
00:56:22.121 --> 00:56:26.080
at least during the voyage when the twin has no right to claim that he is not

859
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:28.570
moving that I act.
That's why,

860
00:56:28.571 --> 00:56:33.571
but you don't have the same status vet as for me the whole time Newton's laws

861
00:56:34.201 --> 00:56:36.130
and the loss of in that she ever operative for me.

862
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.560
Let us put him on the rocket duding tick off.

863
00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:41.440
Things started flying off and doing landing.
Things started flying off.

864
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.500
He cannot possibly claim he has the same status as me.

865
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:46.540
That's the way that problem,

866
00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:50.770
that relationship is not symmetrical and one person can say I did not move

867
00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:54.850
because I was always initial other it will say have to concede that he moved.

868
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.553
Yes

869
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.210
<v 3>first
and then the other one.</v>

870
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:04.570
<v 0>Yeah.
Then if you do it,
if you give them symmetrical accelerations,</v>

871
00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:06.280
what leave like this and both come back.

872
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:08.950
Then both we'd like to be on the age but they will disagree with the person on

873
00:57:08.951 --> 00:57:12.640
the ground support.
That's the triplets.
You got tripped lesson to.

874
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.040
Kids are sent out that way.
Third one stays back.

875
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.710
The third one that stays back will be older than the others.

876
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.110
So this is not science fiction at all.

877
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.160
If you want to be alive for the year 3000 you can do it.

878
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.390
Just have to get into a rocket at sufficient velocity,

879
00:57:28.391 --> 00:57:32.980
close to the speed of light so that this is 3000 years.
Okay.

880
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:37.270
And you figured out how long you got to live,
maybe another 50 years.
Do the math,

881
00:57:37.271 --> 00:57:40.600
you find the speed getting the rocket and go and come back.

882
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.920
Now this experiment's done all the time with microscopic particles.

883
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:47.410
You know they are accelerated in Fermi lab for example,

884
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.830
they go around on the ring and just by virtue of their motion,

885
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:51.880
they live a very long time.

886
00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:55.600
So particles that are supposed to have a short lifetime,

887
00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:00.720
which you calculate in their own rest frame live much longer because they are

888
00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:01.883
moving.

889
00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:04.930
And one way to keep them moving is to put them on an accelerated ring and they

890
00:58:04.931 --> 00:58:07.420
live for a very long time.
Yes,

891
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:10.750
<v 3>well the guy on the rocket,
the rocket itself,</v>

892
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:17.230
<v 0>no,
no rocket guy will think rocket will think I am 50 years older.</v>

893
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.510
If you went on the rocket,
it's 50 years for you.

894
00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.820
For people on the grounders 3000 years.

895
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:25.490
<v 3>You're still figures on the rocket.</v>

896
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:30.010
<v 0>Yeah,
but if you don't want to age at all,
you cannot change it.
You want what,</v>

897
00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:34.030
five years?
Okay.
We just fixed the number.

898
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.880
You want the age only 0.5 years.

899
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.580
That's another number you'll never run out of numbers.

900
00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:44.140
You can let you approach seat as much as you like and you can live as long as

901
00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:46.300
you want and come back whenever you want.

902
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.970
Other issues like going backwards in time,

903
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:53.830
I'll come back to that later that are problems with that.
We'll come to that,

904
00:58:53.831 --> 00:58:58.831
but you can stop time as far as we know and we see it all the time and wants to

905
00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:02.080
produce in the upper atmosphere.
Uh,

906
00:59:02.081 --> 00:59:05.740
their lifetime is something 10 to the minus six seconds or whatever.

907
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.660
Even if the travel,
the speed of light,

908
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.660
c times that time is not long enough to cross the atmosphere,

909
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:13.330
but they make it here.
How did they make it?

910
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.110
They make it because their lifetime is computed in their frame of reference.

911
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.420
They still think delivered only their lifetime,

912
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:23.000
but I think they lived a much longer.
That's how they made it to the earth,

913
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.420
but how about from that point of view?

914
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.510
They only lived a short time and how did they go to a hundred kilometers?

915
00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:32.510
That's the next thing I'm going to tell you.
According to them,

916
00:59:32.511 --> 00:59:36.760
the atmosphere is not a hundred kilometers but maybe eight kilometers long and

917
00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:39.860
that's the last point which has to do with the length contraction.

918
00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:46.340
So length contraction says,
oh by the way,
it's the thing to remember about time.

919
00:59:46.341 --> 00:59:51.341
Dilatation is every clock runs the fastest in his own restaurant.

920
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.780
In any other frame of reference in which the clock has any velocity,

921
00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:00.800
it will appear to be slower than the advertised time period of the client.

922
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:04.370
Good.
Last thing I want to do is linked contraction.

923
01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:06.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

924
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:11.650
<v 0>Length contraction says if you have a meter stick and you and I bought them from</v>

925
01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:15.620
the same store,
once you're in this plane on this rocket,

926
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:20.780
I will claim your meter sticks that actually shorter than a meter.
In fact,

927
01:00:20.781 --> 01:00:23.450
the shortening factor is this.

928
01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:30.430
This is a driving factor.
In fact,

929
01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:32.950
we are back in the derivation of the load and Samsung summation,

930
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.480
the fudge factory calculated.

931
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.590
Taking your links into my links is precisely connected with this factor.

932
01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:40.720
If you say the leg,
the something,

933
01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.360
I will tell you that the length is actually less than that

934
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:49.300
because your meter sticks or short.
But let me prove that to you.

935
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.870
So let's take a rod that's moving

936
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:56.870
is moving at a speed.
You,

937
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:59.800
you're carrying the rock and I want to find this length.

938
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:05.560
What should I do?
That's the question.
Okay,
so rod is moving at speed.

939
01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:07.500
You and I want to find this link.

940
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:09.803
<v 1>So</v>

941
01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:17.250
<v 0>delta x prime is delta x minus you Delta t over the square root.</v>

942
01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.190
I'm gonna make a pan of events to find the length of the rod event.
One.

943
01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:28.630
Remember this rod is zooming past me even at one is when this president of the

944
01:01:28.631 --> 01:01:33.160
rod hits a certain marking on the meter,
on my graduated x axis,

945
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:36.100
and even to this from the back end of the train hits my audition.

946
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.720
And the distance between those two is the length of the rod provided one

947
01:01:43.721 --> 01:01:46.960
condition.
How do you find the length of a moving rod?

948
01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:51.040
You find this end and that end at the same time.

949
01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.430
Otherwise you will screw up,
right?

950
01:01:54.431 --> 01:01:58.330
If you find this and now go on lunch break and come back with the artists over

951
01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:01.840
there and say that's the rear end of the rod and you get that to be the leg

952
01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.790
that's not up.
You find the length of a moving optic.

953
01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.410
You find the length by measuring the coordinates of the two ends at the same

954
01:02:08.411 --> 01:02:09.244
time.

955
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.320
Consequently at the same time means Delta t must be zero.

956
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:17.920
Delta l is the delta.
X is the length according to you

957
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:24.030
according to the person going with the rod and the two events since they take

958
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:28.170
place at the two ends of the rod are separated by the length of the rod because

959
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:31.790
there are,
according to you is not going anywhere.
I suppose you have a Rod.

960
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.450
It's not moving it a little to you.

961
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.060
Something happens at one and something happens at the other end.

962
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.630
What's the spacial distance between them?
It's the length of the rock.

963
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.410
That's the meaning of the length of the Rod.
Therefore,
if you cross multiply,

964
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.560
you get this result,
Ellis l zero times.

965
01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:51.290
So the real length.

966
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:56.220
So rod will appear longest in his restaurant and to anybody else who lapierre

967
01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.073
shorter

968
01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:04.440
blocks up we had fastest and the best frame rods up here longest and the right,

969
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.740
but anybody to whom rod is moving that art appears shorts.

970
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.970
So here's another paradox then.

971
01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.423
<v 1>Uh,</v>

972
01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.120
<v 0>I make a hole in my x axis.</v>

973
01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.380
I make the whole to be half a meter long.

974
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:30.100
This is half a meter.
You and I bought a meter stick.

975
01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.480
They are moving at a velocity where this number has become half

976
01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:40.540
you oversee is one over route two,
two squared overseas squares that what?
Look,

977
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.580
it's whatever it takes to make this factor half.

978
01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:47.550
So I expect you admitted stick to have front to half this length.

979
01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:52.390
So I make a hole on the table,
half a meter long.
The rod goes by.

980
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:56.920
I think it will fall into the hole.
That's my expectation.

981
01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:00.610
You come and say my meters big is a meter stick.

982
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:04.000
The whole that you've done that you think has happened meters long,

983
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:05.240
actually quarter meter law.

984
01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.910
So there is no way this my meter stick is going through that hole in the table

985
01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.040
because it's four times as long as a hole in the table.

986
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:16.570
You understand that normally you make a meter stick,

987
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.480
you put it on top of the hole at the same length,
it'll fall down.

988
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.820
But if it's a moving meter stick,

989
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:25.980
which is contracted according to me from one meter to half a meter,

990
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:29.740
half a meter hole is enough but it to fall.
But from your vantage point,

991
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.520
my half a meter hole looks like a quarter of a meter hole you're made to stick,

992
01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:37.360
still look like a meter.
The question is when this experiment occurs,

993
01:04:37.361 --> 01:04:41.620
will it fall or not?
Okay.
In diesel,
all paradoxes,

994
01:04:41.621 --> 01:04:44.200
if you invented the theory,
you gotta defend these paradoxes.

995
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:47.410
You cannot get to answers to one question.
That's the logical issue.

996
01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.800
So the answer to these problems is if you know one point of view in Whitford is

997
01:04:54.801 --> 01:04:56.630
correct,
that's the right answer.

998
01:04:56.750 --> 01:05:00.560
Then the other person has to figure out what happened.
So from my point of view,

999
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.790
if I made a half a meter hole and your rod is struggling to have the length it's

1000
01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:06.320
going to fall so it will fall.

1001
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.120
The question is how does the other person reconcile himself to the fact that he

1002
01:05:11.121 --> 01:05:12.380
had an aquatic.
That person,

1003
01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:16.580
the whole is a quarter meter long in the rod is one meter long.

1004
01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.220
Well I should put it the fall.
You've got to give it a little tilt.
Okay,

1005
01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:24.130
so that it can actually fall in.
I give it a little tilt here.

1006
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.030
How can this object fall into that and

1007
01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:29.520
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1008
01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.720
<v 0>The way other person explains it is you said first this and went in here.</v>

1009
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.390
Other than we're sticking way out.

1010
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:41.400
Then sometime later the second end went in here and that's how I got to the
hole.

1011
01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.860
Namely the two ends did not go at the same time

1012
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.370
that way it's certainly possible for a two meters.

1013
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.160
One meter stick to go through a quarter percent.
The middle hole in the table,

1014
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.980
I mean give the rod or a little tilt so it can fall into the hall.

1015
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:59.170
The tip enters first.
The tail is way outside.
Then after awhile the tale goes in.

1016
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:00.221
In that manner,

1017
01:06:00.221 --> 01:06:04.870
the rod goes in so they can reconcile this how to docs by saying,

1018
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.270
uh,
the two ends did not go at the same time.

1019
01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:15.000
Also,
if you ask the other person who thinks something is two meters long and the

1020
01:06:15.001 --> 01:06:18.180
other person think it is half a meter long,
how did they reconcile it?

1021
01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.120
I say I measured the to enter the same time,

1022
01:06:21.121 --> 01:06:24.270
but you will tell me you did not measure the ends of my meters thick.

1023
01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:27.240
At the same time you measured one end and you goofed off.

1024
01:06:27.241 --> 01:06:28.740
Then he came back and measured the second end.

1025
01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.870
By the time the rod had slipped to the right,

1026
01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:34.890
you mentioned that then and you goofed off.
You wait until it came there.

1027
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.570
Then you mentioned the other day,
that's why you got half instead of one

1028
01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:42.750
and nobody's right or wrong.

1029
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.630
I did measure the tumor and simultaneously according to me,

1030
01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:50.140
but you don't have to agree they were simultaneous.
So it's by it.

1031
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:55.280
By going soft on what simultaneity means that you're able to reconcile this with

1032
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:59.970
the Newtonian day simultaneity is absolute linked with absolute in relativity.

1033
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:04.260
Simultaneity is relative and length is also related because the operational way

1034
01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:07.980
to find the length of a body will not satisfy all observers.

1035
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.970
If I find the length of your moving meter stick,
the two ends at the same time,

1036
01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.430
you will say,
I didn't measure them at the same time.

1037
01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:16.980
And the formula is relatively,
I love that.
That's,

1038
01:07:16.981 --> 01:07:21.981
so we live with the fact that we accused to that of having relatively short

1039
01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.500
meter sticks.
I blame you on your measurement,

1040
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:30.400
but that blame is not as genuine blame because you can dig a hole equals the

1041
01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:32.000
reduced length and things a little fall in.

1042
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:35.970
So you have every right to say things have shrunk and I will say I didn't
shrink.

1043
01:07:35.971 --> 01:07:38.590
I fell in because my notes went in first and then a little later.

1044
01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:42.870
The tailwind that are various paradoxes.
I'll just leave you with one.

1045
01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.280
You have a garage,
your parents build your garage 12 meters long.

1046
01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:51.560
You bought a car 14 minutes long.
Can you park it right?

1047
01:07:51.561 --> 01:07:54.440
If you've got a sufficiently high velocities.
So the 14 gets shunted,

1048
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:58.470
12 there'll be a brief instant in which both ends of your car are inside the

1049
01:07:58.471 --> 01:08:02.460
garage.
Okay?
Of course you will have to smash through the back end of the garage,

1050
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.590
but you will maintain,
yes,
I smashed in that,

1051
01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:08.610
but my car was in the garage for some time and the parent will say,
no,

1052
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.270
the front end went smashed.
The rear,
the back hadn't even come in.

1053
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:16.680
Little later the back came.
So everyone will agree.
You broke the garage.

1054
01:08:16.681 --> 01:08:19.830
He brought the car and the lengths were contracted relative to each other.

1055
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:22.140
And the phenomenon is that according to you,

1056
01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:25.080
that was a time the whole car is in the garage.
And according to the parents,

1057
01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:25.900
it was not.
