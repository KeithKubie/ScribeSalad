00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Rank the following four scatter plots by their correlation coefficient.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One should have the lowest coefficient.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Four should have the highest.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Note that you're ranking by the coefficient itself, not the absolute value, so sign does matter.
