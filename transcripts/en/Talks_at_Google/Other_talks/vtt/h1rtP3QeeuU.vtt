up, everybody?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.300
How y'all doing?

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.400
You sound beautiful, guys.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.108

TYLER PERRY: What's up, Ken?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.905
KEN WALKER: What's
going on, man?

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.230
What's going on?

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.310
So we're going to just
jump right into it.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.977
TYLER PERRY: OK.

00:00:41.977 --> 00:00:44.100
KEN WALKER: Why Madea, right?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.450
I think everybody wants to know.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.533
I know when I seen it, I
was a little heartbroken.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.795
My momma called me crying.

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:50.170
I told her I was
going, you know?

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.740
We were going to come down to
Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.300
and we were going to have
to have a conversation.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.755
TYLER PERRY: About her dying?

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:56.760
KEN WALKER: About her--

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.210
TYLER PERRY: Leaving?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.590
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Leaving, yeah.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.800
TYLER PERRY: She's not
dying, she's not dying.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.780
KEN WALKER: Well, she's
dying in our hearts.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.080
TYLER PERRY: No,
she's not dying,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.585
she's going to live
on in your heart.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:04.345
KEN WALKER: See, Tyler--

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:06.803
TYLER PERRY: (AS MADEA) She
going to be in your heart, man.

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:08.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.680
KEN WALKER: We just
want to know why?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350
What made you decide
to let her rest?

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.078
TYLER PERRY: Cause--
how old are you?

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:14.870
KEN WALKER: I'm 24.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.296
TYLER PERRY: See--

00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:17.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.838
When I was 24, man, she
was going to live forever.

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:20.880
I'm turning 50 this year.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.084
And I'm like, oh, it's time
for her to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:23.880
[CHEERING]

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.730
I don't want to be this old
broad's age playing her,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.188
so it's just it's just time.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.230
And it's been a good run.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.250
It's been a franchise that's
done a multibillion dollar

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.500
franchise, been really
good for the company, been

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.530
really good for myself.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.420
And it's just time.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.513
I want to do other things.

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:38.430
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Great.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.790
So at any point, did you have
second thoughts of like, not

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.372
killing her?

00:01:42.372 --> 00:01:44.830
TYLER PERRY: No, I won't kill
her, because they'll kill me.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.720
I have second
thoughts all the time.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.012
Because we're on tour right
now with the farewell tour.

00:01:48.012 --> 00:01:52.637
And we're 34 shows
in of 140-some shows.

00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:53.470
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Wow.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.380
TYLER PERRY: And these 34
shows have all been sold out.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.310
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Wow.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.140
TYLER PERRY: And I had second
thoughts the Saturday night

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.400
10,000 people showed up at
the Dolby theater in LA,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.275
and in the audience
is Jay-Z and Beyonce.

00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:05.150
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: What?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.540
TYLER PERRY: So I sure
have second thoughts

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.740
when Queen Bey's sitting
out there, going--

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.710
KEN WALKER: I can imagine.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.690
TYLER PERRY: Wait,
she came to see Madea?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.520
Madea was like, (AS MADEA)
yes, she did, thank you.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.110
Yeah.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.280
KEN WALKER: Sheesh.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.540
So for everybody that
knows, Tyler Perry

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.990
is an extremely hard worker,
extremely hard worker.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.500
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Yes, definitely.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.670
KEN WALKER: "A Madea
Family Funeral"

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.660
was shot two years ago?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.410
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.723
KEN WALKER: It
comes out March 1st.

00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:25.890
I see the look on your face.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.635
I'm about as
surprised as you are.

00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:28.490
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: I'm surprised.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.710
KEN WALKER: So we want to give
a little in look or out look

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.940
into your creative process.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.710
Because we had a chance
to be on set with you--

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.860
TYLER PERRY: That's right.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.530
KEN WALKER: --for "'Boo 2!"

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.120
TYLER PERRY: That's right.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.690
KEN WALKER: And you
work extremely fast.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.880
TYLER PERRY: We're very fast.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.700
KEN WALKER: You're
a very nice person,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.230
but you work extremely fast--

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.340
TYLER PERRY: Thank you
for saying I'm nice.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.650
KEN WALKER: --and you
tell people to move.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.080
TYLER PERRY: Cause you know I--

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.760
Look, I'm going to tell
y'all, when I put that costume

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.470
on and I'm trying to
direct, I'm not nice.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.360
So thank you for saying that.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.620
KEN WALKER: Absolutely.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.110
TYLER PERRY: I'm not nice.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.040
I'm like, get that damn camera
in the right place, shit,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.332
so I can go take this shit off.

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:50.925
Yes.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:51.530
Excuse me.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.040
KEN WALKER: We just want to
know where that comes from?

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.450
TYLER PERRY: Excuse
me, excuse me.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.150
The hard work?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.817
KEN WALKER: Like what
is that creative--

00:02:54.817 --> 00:02:57.070
not even just the hard work,
but the timely manner--

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.295
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: The dedication.

00:02:57.295 --> 00:02:59.212
KEN WALKER: The dedication
to shoot this movie

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.790
in a record-breaking
amount of days.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.610
TYLER PERRY: But the reason it
sat in the can for two years

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.342
is because we did--

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:07.550
we had just finished "Boo 2!"

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.290
And I didn't want to go "Boo!,"
"Boo 2!," "Madea Funeral."

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.200
So I put "Acrimony" in the
middle and "Nobody's Fool,"

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.617
and now I was ready
to release it.

00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:17.720
But the speed of it is-- you
ever look at somebody working

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.220
and you go, this
doesn't make sense?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.560
Like a lot of times,
I've seen other people

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.560
shoot movies, and how much
time it takes, the downtime.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.640
I've seen a guy--

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.905
I was on set for this one
movie-- it wasn't my movie.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:29.780
And I got there-- they
called me in like 6:00

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.590
in the morning to
come and shoot.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.943
By noon, I still
hadn't shot anything.

00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:37.610
By like 3:00, I'm
sitting in the trailer

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.450
like, OK, what the
hell's going on here?

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.120
So I go out, and the
director comes to set.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.330
And he goes, I don't like
it, change all the lights.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.413
After I have been sitting
there for like 12 hours.

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:48.075
That wasn't a good day for him.

00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:49.950
Because I'm thinking,
why didn't the director

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.630
show up early that morning,
get it set, get what he needed,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.630
make sure it was right and
not waste everybody's time?

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.010
I'm all about efficiency.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.010
And I'm all about--

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.490
I have a great team,
so we all move quickly.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.560
We have a shorthand
so it doesn't--

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.420
Like "The Have
and Have Nots," we

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.940
shoot an episode
and a half in a day.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.520
If that were like, let's
say, "Scandal" or "Empire,"

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.330
it takes them a week and
a half or 7 to 10 days

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.710
to shoot one episode.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.839
I just gotta--

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.039
I like to move.

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.830
And as long as the actors can
keep up, it's a great thing.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.330
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: I
think that's dope.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.990
TYLER PERRY: And y'all kept up.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.650
Y'all kept up.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.035
KEN WALKER: Luckily, luckily.

00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:27.410
TYLER PERRY: I
was talking to him

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.060
about these holes in his jeans.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.610
I said, it's a bold man
that's going to wear holes

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.902
in his jeans in the wintertime.

00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:35.570
Because my knees would be
completely white, just ashy.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.180
KEN WALKER: I guess
I'm a lucky one.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.480
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.875
KEN WALKER: I'm a lucky one.

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:41.208
TYLER PERRY: Or you got some
good lotion, is what it is.

00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:41.813
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:41.813 --> 00:04:42.730
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Ashes.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.660
KEN WALKER: So I want to ask--

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.940
Madea came out so long ago.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.310
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.435
KEN WALKER: At what point--

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:49.370
I guess, long ago
that you decided

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.350
Madea is going to be
Madea, but not only that,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.190
I'm going to play Madea?

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.690
TYLER PERRY: Two
things happened.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.720
I just did this op-ed piece
for the "New York Times"

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.370
where I talked about-- they
were asking me questions about,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.460
how did this start?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.960
And it hit me, my mother used
to take me to the projects

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.480
with her to play
cards on the weekends.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.870
And all these women would
sit around playing cards.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.310
Now these weren't your Sunday
morning proper bridge ladies

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.940
playing bridge.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.490
These were cussing,
spitting, smoking, talking

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.950
trash, strong black women.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.558
And they would sit around
me making all of these jokes

00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:19.100
and laughing.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.380
But the minute they start
talking about relationships,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.030
the whole room would get quiet.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.963
So I remembered as a
kid when my mother would

00:05:24.963 --> 00:05:26.630
be going through
things, I would imitate

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.550
those women to make her laugh.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.020
So here I am all these years
later being able to do this.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.270
I didn't know that that was
like a master class for me

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.360
as a little boy to
be able to do this.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.600
But where she started
was in that moment.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.650
But I had a show in
2000 at the theater

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.740
in Chicago, the 79th and
[INAUDIBLE],, the Regal Theater.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.883
And this particular actress
that I had been promoting

00:05:51.883 --> 00:05:52.800
was going to be there.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.133
She had a hit song on the radio.

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:55.250
She was huge at the time.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.150
She didn't show up.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.567
So Madea was only supposed to
be on stage for five minutes

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.260
after I seen Eddie
Murphy do the Klumps.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.330
I was doing two different
characters in the play.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.060
But when she didn't show up,
I had to say all of her lines

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.763
and Madea's lines, and
the audience went crazy.

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:08.930
And that's where it started.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.043
You were two.

00:06:10.043 --> 00:06:11.210
But that's where it started.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.360
That's where it started.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.680
KEN WALKER: Wow.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.108
DE'ARRA TAYLOR:
That was the case.

00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:15.540
Wow.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.488
So my question is for
the "Madea Funeral,"

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:20.780
was your whole thought behind
this movie and coming out

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.960
with this movie and it being the
last movie that Madea would be

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.810
in, was it like a trick to
get people to think like, hey,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:27.830
she's going to be dead?

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.840
Because we saw the
movie yesterday.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.550
But before we
watched the movie, we

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.660
thought like, she
was going to die,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.230
and duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.530
TYLER PERRY: Yeah,
I can't kill her.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.670
No, that would be like
killing a family member.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.220
Like it's a family
member to so many people,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.595
so no, I didn't
want to kill her.

00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:42.080
But I didn't know the funeral
was going to be the last one.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.618
I just made a decision
after all of this

00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:46.160
and doing the final
tour, I was like,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.930
this is a good time
to put it to bed.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.675
Because part of the franchise
and everything-- what

00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:52.300
I was trying to do
is get to the studio

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.510
down in Atlanta, which is--
if you haven't seen it,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.110
it's 330 acres, 12 soundstages.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.300
"Black Panther" reshoots
were done there.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.950
"The First Man" was shot there.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.370
"Rampage" was shot there.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.660
"Walking Dead" was shot there.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.660
So all these things
are shot at the studio.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.270
But that was the goal.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.523
So all these franchises,
everything that I was doing,

00:07:10.523 --> 00:07:11.690
I was working toward a goal.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.840
275,000 cars came through
the gates since I've opened.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.955
Working toward a goal.

00:07:15.955 --> 00:07:17.580
So now that the goal
has been achieved,

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.870
now I feel like
I've met that level,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.868
now I'm free to just
do what I want to do.

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:23.362
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Oh yes.

00:07:23.362 --> 00:07:24.856
KEN WALKER: Whew!

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:25.360
Whew!

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.880
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: That's good.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.820
Clap it up.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.530
TYLER PERRY: Meet the goal.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.113
Meet the goal.

00:07:28.113 --> 00:07:29.950
KEN WALKER: So we
notice that you

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.635
start incorporating
influencers into your movies

00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:33.260
and your films.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.175
TYLER PERRY: Like YouTube, yeah.

00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:34.620
KEN WALKER: Yeah.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.820
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Yes.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.700
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.850
KEN WALKER: Like us.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.400
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.330
TYLER PERRY: Please,
come on, you kidding me?

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.205
KEN WALKER: At what
point did you decide hey,

00:07:39.205 --> 00:07:41.350
these influencers
are funny, and you

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.300
decided not to go with
the traditional actor?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.612
So what has been like the
best and the worst part

00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:46.945
of making that kind of decision?

00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:48.487
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Or
like what was your

00:07:48.487 --> 00:07:51.390
and your team's decision to put
influencers in your content?

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.320
TYLER PERRY: I just--

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.063
people are used to-- the way
you got things in the past

00:07:56.063 --> 00:07:58.480
were just you had to go to
audition, and be in the casting

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.880
directory.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.470
You had to figure it out.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.040
Now it's like you go on the
internet and you see somebody,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.220
and you're like, whoa,
this person funny.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.345
I need to know this person.

00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:05.957
Like BlameItOnKway
Kwaylon Rogers?

00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:06.790
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Yes.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.900
TYLER PERRY: He's on
tour with me right now.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.520
That dude is stupid funny.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.800
You guys, I was just like--

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.710
I gotta-- because I do
realize, getting closer to 50,

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.850
you start to age out.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.620
The character starts to age out.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.710
So you have to spice
it up, you know?

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.710
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: I agree.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.060
TYLER PERRY: And you guys are
a whole 'nother generation

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.393
and doing something differently.

00:08:23.393 --> 00:08:24.763
So I wanted to give you a shot.

00:08:24.763 --> 00:08:27.430
Because maybe somebody would see
something I'm doing and realize

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.590
they can do it too but do
it better on another level.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.410
DE'ARRA TAYLOR:
Yes, yes, I agree.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:30.790
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.770
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: So has it
been proven beneficial having

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.460
influencers in your films?

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.090
TYLER PERRY: Oh no,
it's been great.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.350
Yeah, yeah,
especially-- well, it

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.159
was started with the "Boo!"
films, but absolutely.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.742
Yeah, it's definitely
been beneficial.

00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:41.953
Yeah, y'all people
buy tickets too.

00:08:41.953 --> 00:08:42.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.460
Yeah, Yeah.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.025
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: They do.

00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:44.590
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.040
KEN WALKER: They buy tickets.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.940
DE'ARRA TAYLOR:
They are consumers.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.710
KEN WALKER: Has it
been tough working

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.640
with someone who's not just--

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.570
TYLER PERRY: When
y'all getting married?

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.830
I'm sorry, that was
left field, sorry.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.270
DE'ARRA TAYLOR:
Ooh, I don't know.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.770
TYLER PERRY: OK.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.720
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Ask him.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.680
TYLER PERRY: OK, got it.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.790
KEN WALKER: All
right, I feel like--

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:57.250
TYLER PERRY: He just wanted to
crawl up in this casket just

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:57.370
then.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.900
He just wanted to get up there--
dude, don't do that to me.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.050
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Next!

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.106
TYLER PERRY: No, go
ahead, dude, sorry.

00:09:01.106 --> 00:09:01.320
I'm sorry.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.100
KEN WALKER: It's
time for me to go.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.115
TYLER PERRY: I'm sorry.

00:09:03.115 --> 00:09:04.904
KEN WALKER: So normally--

00:09:04.904 --> 00:09:07.797
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.130
TYLER PERRY: Man down, man down.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.430
KEN WALKER: Man down.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.630
TYLER PERRY: Man down, man down.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.990
KEN WALKER: Whew!

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.720
All right.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.340
We're good.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:12.830
TYLER PERRY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.830
KEN WALKER: So as an
influencer, normally,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.050
when we talk to the casting
directors, a lot of them

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.462
feel as though influencers
don't have the experience

00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:20.545
like a traditional actor--

00:09:20.545 --> 00:09:21.730
TYLER PERRY: That's true.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.180
KEN WALKER: --a person
who's practiced and whatnot.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.590
TYLER PERRY: That's true.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.830
KEN WALKER: So
how do you face, I

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.750
guess, working
with an influencer

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.460
and you're like,
hold on, this guy--

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.627
you can just very much tell
that this person doesn't

00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:31.570
have the practice
or the necessities--

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.220
TYLER PERRY: Well,
exactly right.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.390
But what it is for
me is like, there

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.770
are a lot of people that
I've worked with that

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.640
are first-timers, so
not just influencers,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.090
but it's the first time
that they auditioned, did

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.250
a great job, or they were like,
you know, I really want to act,

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.610
can I?

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.730
And I'll give them a shot.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.127
So my studio and
what I've done, it's

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.210
always been a training
ground for a lot of people.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.420
So I don't mind that.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.045
I don't mind being
in a situation where

00:09:51.045 --> 00:09:53.710
I can instruct and train, as
long as the right disciplines

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:54.340
are there.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.180
If you're open to learning
and not just thinking,

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.512
OK, this is just what it is, I'm
going to just do this my way.

00:10:01.512 --> 00:10:03.220
If you're not open to
learning, then it's

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.920
going to be a problem.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.503
But everybody that I've worked
with has been open to learning,

00:10:06.503 --> 00:10:07.502
so yeah.

00:10:07.502 --> 00:10:08.710
Don't let them tell you that.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.970
KEN WALKER: Yeah.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.990
TYLER PERRY: You tell them
you've been in a movie,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.840
you know what to do.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.110
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Oh
yeah, definitely.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.510
KEN WALKER: Right.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:12.720
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.470
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: When people
ask who are you, I'm like,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.880
I'm an actor.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.710
TYLER PERRY: That's right.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.030
Own it.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.530
Own it.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.210
That's right.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.120
KEN WALKER: So we want to talk
a little bit about your work

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.490
ethic.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.900
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.760
KEN WALKER: Because not
only are you on tour,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.041
you're doing like the whole
press thing for "Madea Family

00:10:24.041 --> 00:10:24.180
Funeral."

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.305
TYLER PERRY: It's so funny.

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:28.390
I'm going to tell
him, when I walked in,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.990
I didn't even recognize him.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:37.120
I left the Oscars Sunday
and went to the parties,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.210
got on the plane, landed here.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.550
Had to get dressed to
go to the premiere.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.252
And had a few hours
of sleep last night.

00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:46.460
And I'm trying to figure
out my name right about now,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.630
but yeah, yeah.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.280
But it's worth it, it's fun.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.322
KEN WALKER: It was hilarious
We were in the back,

00:10:50.322 --> 00:10:53.690
and the guy asked him, where
was the last city you were in?

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.430
He didn't know.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.480
Somebody else answered for him.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:55.980
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.500
KEN WALKER: He go,
oh, you were in LA.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.100
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.560
KEN WALKER: Yeah, LA.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.852
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, and I'm
not crazy, I'm not slipping.

00:10:59.852 --> 00:11:01.900
It's just being on tour.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.400
And listen, I'm on
stage some nights

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.580
and they have to give
me a note saying,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.350
OK, this is where you are.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.490
Because it's like city
to city, place to place,

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.420
and these arenas and theaters,
they all start to look alike.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.350
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Always
working, that's good.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.250
TYLER PERRY: Well, work ethic.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.850
You were asking
about work ethic.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.130
KEN WALKER: Absolutely.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.047
Definitely want to know
where that comes from.

00:11:16.047 --> 00:11:17.680
Because as an influencer
or a YouTuber,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.140
we see a lot of people reach
a certain level of success

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.580
and kind of go stagnant,
becoming consistent,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.870
stop working as hard as they did
trying to reach a certain goal.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.140
But you, it just seems like
with "Madea Family Funeral,"

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.020
the tour, you just seem to
keep moving and keep moving.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.895
TYLER PERRY: Those people
aren't hungry, man.

00:11:33.895 --> 00:11:36.467
And when you're hungry, you
keep grinding, keep grinding,

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:37.050
keep grinding.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.590
And it went from me wanting
to do well enough to take care

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.240
of my mother to then realizing
that all of these people

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.490
are depending on me,
to realizing that,

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.150
wait, now you've got an
opportunity to lift and share

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.400
and show other people the way.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.100
So I've always got a motivation.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.350
As long as something's in
front of me, I'll work hard.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.730
But when you have
a four-year-old,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.772
he'll slow all that down.

00:11:55.772 --> 00:11:57.560
He'll be like,
hey, I'm over here,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.477
I need some attention, so yeah.

00:12:00.477 --> 00:12:03.060
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: So I'm going to
go back to about the character

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.560
Madea.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.990
And I know that you also play
other characters like Joe.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.790
So I want to ask like,
is he going away?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.930
TYLER PERRY: No.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.360
No, nobody's asked that.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.460
I think Joe and Heathrow--

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.820
see Brian is such
a square, right?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.400
So Joe and Heathrow--

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.615
Heathrow's in a wheelchair,
he speaks with--

00:12:22.615 --> 00:12:23.740
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Little mic?

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.150
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.275
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: He's funny.

00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:27.890
TYLER PERRY: And he
says he was a war hero,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.170
and he lost his legs and
lungs from being in war.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.577
All lies, he bought all
his medals at Walmart.

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:37.410
But they're going to
take him on a road trip

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.030
to Vegas, kind of
like "The Hangover."

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.822
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Oh!

00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:41.940
TYLER PERRY: And get him
in trouble, so we'll see.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.700
We'll see.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.267
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: OK, then.

00:12:44.267 --> 00:12:46.350
KEN WALKER: Wow, I guess
that pretty much answered

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.100
my next question.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.690
I just kind of
figured what were you

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.220
planning to do next
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.120
a particular character.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.537
I guess Heathrow's
going to Vegas.

00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:53.420
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.577
And Madea's not gone.

00:12:54.577 --> 00:12:56.160
Here's what I'm going
to do with that.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.940
I'm thinking of going
back to the '70s

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.040
and telling the story
of a young Madea

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.900
and a young Joe
and a young Brian,

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.570
but with a real actress
playing the role,

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.270
and real other people
playing all the other roles

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:09.990
in those ages.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.925
So kind of like a Foxy
Brown kind of thing,

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.050
so that should be exciting.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.330
KEN WALKER: So Madea
will resurface?

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.006
TYLER PERRY: Yes,
with another person.

00:13:16.006 --> 00:13:17.970
KEN WALKER: Another
actor, a younger Madea.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.030
TYLER PERRY:
Younger Madea, yeah.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.270
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: So one of you
guys could-- got it, noted.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.620
KEN WALKER: But you're still
going to play Joe, Heathrow?

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.870
TYLER PERRY: No, no, no,
those are all other actors,

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.500
younger people.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.180
They're like in their 20s.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.580
As good-looking as I am, I
can't play in my 20s anymore.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:29.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.360
KEN WALKER: You do look good.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.860
TYLER PERRY: I cannot
play in my 20s anymore.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.630
People don't believe it.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.270
KEN WALKER: Wow.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:33.480
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.405
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Wow, that's
still going to be dope.

00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:35.860
I'm excited to see that.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.690
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, it's going
to be fun, it's going to be fun.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.648
KEN WALKER: So I guess
one of my final question

00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:42.060
is how do you want
Madea to be remembered?

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.990
I guess with this being her last
film, a lot of funny jokes--

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.050
I know Madea very well,
a lot of crazy things

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.880
she said, a lot of
inspirational things

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.287
she said in a very
messed up way.

00:13:53.287 --> 00:13:55.120
But a lot of things
have been inspirational.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.495
So how do you just
want her to be

00:13:56.495 --> 00:13:57.975
remembered on a larger scale?

00:13:57.975 --> 00:14:00.600
TYLER PERRY: When you do when I
look back at the body of work--

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.975
when I look at all of it, I
realized the first few movies

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.460
when I was talking about
abuse and getting over things

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.830
and bad marriages, I was
actually subconsciously talking

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.737
to my mother in my writing,
and I didn't get it

00:14:10.737 --> 00:14:11.820
until I looked back on it.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.320
But what I want her
to be remembered

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.010
as is this grandmother that made
you laugh, have a good time.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.760
Forget about the
man in the dress,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.803
but just somebody who spoke
wisdoms, made people feel good,

00:14:21.803 --> 00:14:24.220
and made things lighter in
their life a little bit better.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.380
So that's my hope in it.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.948
That's my hope in it, for sure.

00:14:26.948 --> 00:14:27.990
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: OK, cool.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.573
And my last question was-- well,
you kind of already answered,

00:14:30.573 --> 00:14:33.720
but like what is next for you?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.905
TYLER PERRY: After this nap?

00:14:34.905 --> 00:14:35.780
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.273
KEN WALKER: After the nap.

00:14:37.273 --> 00:14:38.337
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:39.920
Again, right now,
it's about legacies.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.563
It's about what am
I leaving behind?

00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:42.480
It's about the studio.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.560
It's about my son.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.570
It's about what is the legacy?

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.553
And how wide can I
hold this door open?

00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:50.970
Because I'm looking at what's
happening in Hollywood right

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.553
now, and everybody's
like, oh, my god,

00:14:52.553 --> 00:14:54.450
diversity is so
amazing and great.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.430
It's like, Tyler, do you
think it's wonderful?

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.800
But the truth is I
was doing diversity

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.030
before diversity was cool.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.322
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Right, I agree.

00:15:01.322 --> 00:15:04.590
TYLER PERRY: I was hiring
people like Idris Elba and Viola

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.510
Davis, and Sofia Vergara, and
Kerry Washington, Taraji P.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.010
Henson.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.480
These people couldn't get work.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.440
So now to look at
what's happening here--

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.200
I don't want people
to forget that there

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.500
was a fight from
many, many years

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.978
to get to where we are now.

00:15:17.978 --> 00:15:19.270
We still have a long way to go.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.970
But I'm seeing the nucleus
of a brilliant time, where

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.220
all stories are being
able to be told.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.740
And the beauty of that is, I
realized that my criticism is

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.730
a lot less.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.480
Because everybody gets a chance
to tell their stories now.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.890
When you're the
only black person

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.010
out there telling
your stories, you've

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.635
got black people
going what the hell?

00:15:39.635 --> 00:15:41.760
That's not me, that doesn't
represent black people.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.802
But it represents the
black people I know, right?

00:15:43.802 --> 00:15:46.680
So now to see Issa
Rae and Donald Glover

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.130
and Ryan Coogler
and all these people

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.107
get to tell their stories,
I'm just in heaven.

00:15:52.107 --> 00:15:54.690
So I just want to keep holding
the door open as wide as I can.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:55.607
DE'ARRA TAYLOR: Great.

00:15:55.607 --> 00:15:56.370
KEN WALKER: Nice.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.470
So we're going to open
it up to the audience.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.270
You guys have any
questions about Madea,

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.670
"Madea's Family
Funeral," anything

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.570
of the matter, anything.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.277
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:16:05.277 --> 00:16:05.985
TYLER PERRY: Hey.

00:16:05.985 --> 00:16:07.460
AUDIENCE: Hey,
Tyler, LaToya Drake.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.170
I work here at Google.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.080
I grew up in Georgia, so
shout out to the state.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.820
It's really encouraging
to see everything

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.740
that you've done
with the studio, all

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.010
the economic prosperity
you've brought to the state.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.350
After the
gubernatorial election,

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.810
there was talk of Hollywood
pulling its dollars

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.820
as a reaction to
Brian Kemp winning.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.578
Wondering what
crossed your mind,

00:16:27.578 --> 00:16:29.120
if that was something
you considered,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.060
or how you felt you needed
to react to that move

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.365
to take our dollars away?

00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:34.160
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.840
Well, listen, I'm
glad people didn't,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.810
because it's so important
for so many people that

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:39.560
are working there.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.310
And I've fought so hard to have
the tax credit and everything

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.810
else.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.317
And I hate when politics
starts to dictate

00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:46.400
what happens in the state.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.230
Because there are so
many good people there.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.938
There's so many people
who have never had

00:16:49.938 --> 00:16:52.380
an opportunity in the business.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.760
The great thing about
what is happening now

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.857
as I'm watching
Stacey in her fight,

00:16:57.857 --> 00:16:59.690
and what recently
happened in North Carolina

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.570
with a new election-- as long
as Stacey keeps up her fight,

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:03.358
I'm on her side.

00:17:03.358 --> 00:17:05.150
I'm right there in her
corner so that there

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.740
can be a fair and balanced
moment in all of this,

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.240
for sure.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.641
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:17:13.972 --> 00:17:15.930
TYLER PERRY: I think you
have to go to the mic.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.684
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:18.684 --> 00:17:20.520
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.359
Thank you for coming.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.602
You wear a lot of hats.

00:17:23.602 --> 00:17:25.560
You're the director, and
writer, and producer--

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.359
TYLER PERRY: And
a couple of wigs.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.339
AUDIENCE: And a
couple wigs, yeah.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.380
Is there anything
maybe inside or outside

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.880
of show business
that you want to do

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.963
that you haven't done yet?

00:17:33.963 --> 00:17:35.797
TYLER PERRY: No, the
great thing about it is

00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:37.140
I've been fortunate enough to--

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.920
because if I wasn't in the
business, I'd be an architect.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.687
I love designing.

00:17:39.687 --> 00:17:42.270
So I've been fortunate enough
to be able to design the studio,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.310
design my house, design
different places.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.410
That's what I would
be doing, so it's

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.330
awesome to be in
a position where

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.910
one thing can afford you to do
everything else you want to do.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.980
And also, this was a really,
really, really big dream

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.710
of mine, but I'm not
sure that I'm ever

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.250
going to get a chance to do
it because I'm older now.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.484
But I want to win a gold medal
in the Olympics as a gymnast.

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:06.798
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:06.798 --> 00:18:07.840
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.160
AUDIENCE: You're this close.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.035
TYLER PERRY: Kidding.

00:18:10.035 --> 00:18:13.245
Yeah, this close, this
close, this close.

00:18:13.245 --> 00:18:14.870
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tyler,
thanks for coming.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.470
TYLER PERRY: Oh,
it's my pleasure.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.270
AUDIENCE: So looking
at your career,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.610
one of the most
amazing things about it

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.720
is really, the way that you've
tapped into your imagination

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.570
to unlock all these
different possibilities.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.260
And it's a powerful thing
that I think not enough people

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.850
spend time doing.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.620
And so thinking
about your career,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.040
just as an actor, and
then stage, and then film,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.020
and then for most
actors, the big step

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.370
is going behind the camera.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.690
And you're like, screw that, I'm
going to get a studio, and then

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.400
partner with Marvel and
all these other companies.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.090
And so for me, I'm just
curious about your process

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:55.170
for unlocking your imagination
and then perceiving things,

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.918
or trying to achieve things
that would seem monumental.

00:18:57.918 --> 00:18:59.460
TYLER PERRY: Here's
the thing for me.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.510
I was praying one
day, and I said,

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.760
God, I don't want to leave
this planet until I've done

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.390
everything I'm supposed to do.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.720
And this level of the
studio-- the one I

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.830
had before this was about
30 acres, six soundstages.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.820
I was comfortable, man.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.530
I was so happy there.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.280
Everything's good.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.113
I was shooting all "The
Have and Have Nots."

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.580
I'm like, yes, this is it!

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.800
But then I got that nudge
that it's time to grow,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.700
it's time to move.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.010
And you've got to be careful
when you get comfortable

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.880
in a situation.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.880
Because things will start to
fall apart if you don't move.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.740
This is what I found
just in my prayer life,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.870
that I'm getting hits to
move, if I don't, things

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.230
start to fall apart.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.900
So I move into this new studio.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.310
I didn't want to.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.620
But now looking back at
it three years into it,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.180
now I go OK, this was beyond me.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.017
It's bigger than me.

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.600
So you have to understand that
when you get the opportunities,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.000
they're not just for you.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.620
Sometimes what's
happening for you

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.607
is for the next person,
and the next person,

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:52.440
and the next person.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.080
And your example can
change their lives.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.420
So holding that in
the front of my mind

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.332
has been so important every
time I get ready to go.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.040
Because I've gotten
to a place in my life

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.470
like-- look, turning 50, I
just want to go sit on a beach

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.595
and smoke some weed, right?

00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:06.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.840
But now-- it's truth, truth.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.420
But you're too young
to do that, son.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.530
But the truth is
making sure that I'm

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.690
being faithful and
loyal to everything

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:19.690
that I'm supposed to do.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.690
Because a lot of times, your
visions are tied into the next

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.290
person's.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:23.832
So I hope that
answers your question.

00:20:23.832 --> 00:20:25.477
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:25.477 --> 00:20:27.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for being with us.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.600
TYLER PERRY: Oh,
it's my pleasure.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.680
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.650
You mentioned the
speed of your work

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.750
and how fast you
get things done.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.770
Did that affect the
quality of the production

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.570
in any department?

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.180
Second question is--

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.750
I'm a YouTube musician.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.420
And we've seen you before
work with YouTube influencers.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.440
And I've been humbled getting
noticed by the great Quincy

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.410
Jones and Sia.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.860
Do you have any plans
in the future working

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.390
with YouTube musicians as well?

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.110
TYLER PERRY: Working with--

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.780
I'm sorry, what's the last part?

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.580
AUDIENCE: YouTube musicians.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.390
TYLER PERRY: Oh wow.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.682
AUDIENCE: Not just influencers.

00:20:58.682 --> 00:21:00.360
TYLER PERRY: That
would be incredible.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.030
Dude, let me answer the
first part of your question.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.860
You look at it, you tell me.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.415
I look at my movie that compare
it to other movies like that,

00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:10.000
right?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.560
And I think,
nothing's suffering.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.720
There's no quality is suffering.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.770
They look beautiful.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.812
The sound is beautiful,
the lighting's beautiful.

00:21:16.812 --> 00:21:19.510
It's compared to everything
else in that space.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.135
Now if I was making
"Schindler's List,"

00:21:21.135 --> 00:21:22.718
then we'd have to
have a conversation.

00:21:22.718 --> 00:21:23.358
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.358 --> 00:21:24.900
Because I can't do
that in five days.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.400
There's a process there.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.350
And if I was working with
a cinematographer who

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.510
wanted the sun to
fall just perfectly

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.790
over her beautiful
hair and lashes,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.850
and we have to shoot
this scene on Thursday

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.570
at 4:36 in the evening,
not a second later,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.410
then it would be
a different thing.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.390
This is Madea, you
know what I mean?

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.810
So I take it for what it is.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.570
But no, I wrote a piece
that I wanted to play.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.150
I wrote it in 1995.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.660
It's called "A
Jazz Man's Blues."

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.810
It's about a jazz singer and
a Holocaust survivor, big band

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.860
music.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.720
And I wanted to play the role,
but I've aged out of it now.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.837
So I have to hire somebody
else to play the role.

00:22:01.837 --> 00:22:03.670
But as I'm thinking
about big band and jazz,

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.233
I'll start looking
at YouTube musicians.

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:10.400
That'll be really good to
think about, so thank you.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.233
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:13.525
TYLER PERRY: Thank you.

00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:15.356
AUDIENCE: I'm too
short for this.

00:22:15.356 --> 00:22:16.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:16.940
Hi.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.210
TYLER PERRY: Hi.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.543
AUDIENCE: My name's Shayla Byrd.

00:22:18.543 --> 00:22:22.550
I am actually the only full time
black writer here at Google New

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.460
York.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.250
And so I took this job because
I'm really into writing.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.920
But as I've been
working here, there's

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.512
so many things like logistical
things, and meeting,

00:22:30.512 --> 00:22:32.720
and strategy, and all these
other things that kind of

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.580
come along with it.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.312
So I look to you as
someone who created

00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:36.770
this amazing
character, who created

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.480
this cultural phenomenon.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.212
And I'm wondering how do
you structure your life

00:22:42.212 --> 00:22:43.920
or make sure that you
are able to hold on

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.680
to the creative things that
you enjoy while also running

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.300
your business?

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.050
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:51.680
AUDIENCE: How do you
hold on to things--

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.430
TYLER PERRY: You have
to nurture the both.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.390
Like for me, you
make space for them.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.080
Like when I write, I have
to go to a certain place,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.600
then let the writer speak,
let the writer feel free,

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.740
let the writer do
what he wants to do.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.850
That's the one who
wants to smoke weed.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.410
My business guy
doesn't smoke weed.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.350
But the writer-- that
guy-- let him be.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.540
So you compartmentalize.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.780
Like for me, my brain has--

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.290
I want all sides of it to work.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.760
So this moment, I'm
going to just write.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.310
I'm going to take this time,
and I'm just going to write.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.360
That's all I'm going to do.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.310
Then when I'm directing,
I just want to direct.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.685
And when I'm
running the business

00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:26.910
or signing monthly checks,
that's where my focus is.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.810
So what I would
suggest is that you

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.980
make sure that the writer
has its space, its time,

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.730
and to protect her so that she
can be as creative as she wants

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.600
to be however she wants to be.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.900
And allow her that [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.795
Like this is time for
this specifically, period.

00:23:44.795 --> 00:23:46.670
And then let the business
side of it be that.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:47.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.250
TYLER PERRY: Make sense?

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:48.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it does.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:48.860
TYLER PERRY: OK, OK.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.228
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:50.228 --> 00:23:51.463
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tyler.

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:52.130
TYLER PERRY: Hi.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.000
AUDIENCE: I'm [INAUDIBLE],,
I work here at Google.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.010
Thank you so much for coming.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.090
TYLER PERRY: Oh,
it's my pleasure.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.960
Everybody work at Google?

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.923
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, that's
awesome, that's awesome.

00:23:59.923 --> 00:24:02.705
AUDIENCE: I recently saw
"Boo!" with 20 of my cousins.

00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:05.205
I just told them that I met
you, so they're all going crazy.

00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:06.140
TYLER PERRY: That's awesome.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.820
AUDIENCE: Latin
audiences love you.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.780
My question is for
people that are looking

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:16.340
to get into the space of
content production, what

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.350
would be the simplest
piece of advice

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.920
that you would give to someone
wanting to get into the space,

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.220
thinking about all of the areas
that are disrupting the space,

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.420
right?

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.240
You have technology, you
have YouTube creators.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.328
You have so many
Hollywood actors

00:24:31.328 --> 00:24:32.870
that are already in
the space, and so

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.028
many production companies.

00:24:34.028 --> 00:24:35.570
What would be the
one piece of advice

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:36.530
that you would give to someone?

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:37.760
TYLER PERRY: Tell me what
space you're talking about.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.260
Entertainment?

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.230
AUDIENCE: So creating--

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.660
TYLER PERRY: Show business?

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.327
AUDIENCE: --making a
movie, for example.

00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:43.763
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, listen,
with technology today,

00:24:43.763 --> 00:24:45.680
you can take an iPhone
and make a great movie.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.810
So I think everything
is so open now,

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.910
it's such a great time for
creators, or content creators,

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:53.900
for artists.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.290
Whatever your uniqueness is,
if you have a story that you

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.660
think is so special--

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.320
listen, my first
play, I put every dime

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.570
I had into it to make it work.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.190
And I think now with
all of these platforms

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.440
that you can place
them on, you're

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.602
exposing your talent to
millions and millions of people.

00:25:09.602 --> 00:25:11.060
And I think that's
the best way in.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.550
That's the best way in,
to invest in yourself,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.350
show something different,
something unique,

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.580
and make people go,
wow, what is that?

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.320
End up with 7 1/2 million
followers just looking at what

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.960
you're doing from day to day.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.860
So that's the way in.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.127
It's a whole new world now.

00:25:25.127 --> 00:25:25.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.127
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, for sure.

00:25:27.127 --> 00:25:27.920
Thank you.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.300
Tell all 20 cousins I said hi.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.008
AUDIENCE: I will.

00:25:30.008 --> 00:25:30.716
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:30.716 --> 00:25:32.720
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Omar,
I'm a high schooler

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.540
and I'm a YouTuber.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.410
So I was just wondering if
you had any piece of advice

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.720
that you wish you knew when
you were in high school,

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.263
trying to become a filmmaker
and trying to become an actor?

00:25:41.263 --> 00:25:43.430
TYLER PERRY: You know what
I wish I would have done?

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:44.722
I wish I'd have took more time.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.870
OK, I know you're in school,
I shouldn't say this to you.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.450
But the algebra you're probably
not going use very much,

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.075
unless you're--

00:25:54.075 --> 00:25:54.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.952
But I wish that I had
done better in school

00:25:57.952 --> 00:25:58.910
and went on to college.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.790
Because I've paid for
a Harvard education

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.220
50 times in all the
mistakes that I've made.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.930
So I didn't realize
that everything

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.940
that I was learning
in high school

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.810
would have been
so important now.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.970
So what I would say to
you is the education

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:13.970
is going to be key, man.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.350
Go on to college to get every
bit of knowledge you can

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.100
so that you don't end
up like me, spending

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.517
that kind of money, two, three,
four, five times on things

00:26:21.517 --> 00:26:23.630
that you could have
learned by going to school

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.290
for a few semesters, you know?

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.290
And because you're
here, which me tells me

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.380
you're pretty smart, so
I would hold onto that.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.440
Just stay in school, get as
much knowledge as you can,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.720
so when you go on out there
to do whatever you're doing,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.687
that bit of education will
help take you a long way.

00:26:40.687 --> 00:26:41.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.087
TYLER PERRY: I know it sounds
cliche, but true, so true.

00:26:44.087 --> 00:26:44.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.100
TYLER PERRY: But
the algebra ain't

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.892
going to help you much
unless you're just--

00:26:47.892 --> 00:26:48.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:48.425 --> 00:26:50.300
AUDIENCE: Hey, Tyler,
Jose, nice to meet you.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.258
TYLER PERRY: Hey, Jose.

00:26:51.258 --> 00:26:53.230
AUDIENCE: You talked a
little bit about legacy.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.590
And you've had the privilege
of seeing your success get you

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.142
to a platform where
now you can think back

00:27:00.142 --> 00:27:01.100
and think about legacy.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.940
So my question is
kind of multi-fold.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.610
But when you look
back and you think

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:08.300
about your mentors and each
stage that you were in,

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.950
were the mentors the same?

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.608
Did they change at all?

00:27:11.608 --> 00:27:13.400
And when you think
about where you are now,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.260
who are your
mentors, and who are

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.910
you pouring into as a mentor?

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.360
TYLER PERRY: Wow.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.920
Mentors, that's
a great question.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.428
My mentors-- all
of a sudden, I feel

00:27:22.428 --> 00:27:23.720
like I'm running for president.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.928
Yeah, that was a great
question from Jose, thank you.

00:27:25.928 --> 00:27:27.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.420
I want to talk to all the
men and women of America.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.080
But my mentors
coming up were Oprah,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.490
and people like her and Maya
Angelou-- just the wisdoms,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.950
I loved wisdoms--

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.690
and Nelson Mandela.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.310
And getting a chance
to meet those people

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.960
and see them, and hear them
talk about how I inspired them,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.250
it was really mind-blowing
for me, right?

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.310
So Maya's passed on,
and Nelson's passed on.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.460
Oprah's still here,
and thank God.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.060
Wait, did something happen
and y'all ain't tell me?

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:01.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:01.940
No, no, she's fine.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.273
No, she's fine, I just talked
to her a little while ago.

00:28:04.273 --> 00:28:05.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.350
Now she's still a mentor.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.935
TD Jakes is a mentor.

00:28:10.935 --> 00:28:12.560
Spiritual growth is
so important to me,

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.300
so all of these people
who have wisdoms--

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.860
just bring me wisdoms.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.200
And what I'm trying to do
at this point in my life

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.732
is be more open to other
people, just to be open enough

00:28:23.732 --> 00:28:25.940
to understand that there
are so many other people who

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.810
have something to bring.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.268
And everybody
teaches you something

00:28:28.268 --> 00:28:30.110
in this life, everybody.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.763
Everybody.

00:28:30.763 --> 00:28:32.180
Everybody you come
in contact with

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.953
can teach you something one way
or another, good or bad, right,

00:28:34.953 --> 00:28:35.870
wrong, or indifferent.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.070
I don't believe that
anybody shows up

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.987
in your life that is not
supposed to be there.

00:28:38.987 --> 00:28:41.780
Either it's to press to
make you stronger or better

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.307
or to depress you.

00:28:43.307 --> 00:28:45.390
But whatever it is, it's
going to make you better.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.462
So what I say to you is--

00:28:49.462 --> 00:28:50.630
my mic just went out.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:51.520
That reminded me of the Oscars.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.560
Is it time for me to go?

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.820
Are they about start
playing the music?

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.640
So what I would say to
you is that those people

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.307
are [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:59.070
And as far as mentoring,
you see that kid

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.390
back there on the camera there?

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.170
He's one of them.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.560
And I have tons of
people at the studio who

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.020
are young and fresh and
excited, and who never

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.640
had the opportunity before.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.840
And they're walking
through those gates going,

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.350
a black man owns this?

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.310
What?

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.535
And for them, it's
like what it would

00:29:19.535 --> 00:29:21.910
have been like for me walking
into somebody else's space,

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.730
going wow, letting them know
that anything's possible.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:29.370
I mean, this army base was
once a Confederate army base.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.105
To be owned by a black
man, it's shocking.

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:34.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.900
So I think all of that
speaks to mentoring.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.400
OK.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.233
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:38.233 --> 00:29:40.020
TYLER PERRY: Thank you.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.520
AUDIENCE: Hello,
my name is Angela.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.330
TYLER PERRY: Hi,
Angela, how you doing?

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.310
AUDIENCE: And I've actually been
to-- since everybody's saying

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.060
their connection--

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.233
I went to Tyler Perry Studios in
2012 for the Obama fundraiser.

00:29:48.233 --> 00:29:49.275
TYLER PERRY: Obama, yeah.

00:29:49.275 --> 00:29:51.030
AUDIENCE: And that was
before I worked at Google,

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.460
and so I scraped all my
change together to get there.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.010
But it was a great experience.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.930
TYLER PERRY: I love
how she said it.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:56.770
It was before I
worked at Google,

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.050
because now I'm at Google,
I got a little money,

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:58.920
I could go down--

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.410
AUDIENCE: I made it a
little bit [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.780
But that was a great experience.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.930
I'd love for you to speak
more about your early days,

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.520
and talk about more the
communities and churches

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.467
and groups that supported
your early work, the circuit

00:30:15.467 --> 00:30:16.300
that you're running.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.300
I mean, you're writing the
plays and performing them

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.530
where really, local communities
and churches who thought it

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.470
was funny.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.410
So I'd love to hear you just
talk more about that experience

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.840
and what it was like getting the
word out among that community,

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.580
and then how you're also
remembering those communities

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.110
that supported
you in those days,

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.120
and what you're doing with them.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:34.960
TYLER PERRY: Let's
start with community.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.752
Because you talk about
being there in 2012.

00:30:36.752 --> 00:30:37.810
That was the old studio.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.570
You've got to see
the new one, whew!

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.780
But I'll never forget that.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.530
You talk about how I'm
supporting community by just

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.820
building in the community.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.940
Because it's in one of the
poorest areas in Atlanta.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.978
The median income is
about $25,000 a year.

00:30:50.978 --> 00:30:52.270
Nobody really owns their house.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.210
When the army base
closed in 2011,

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.320
it left the place decimated.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.790
So to build in that
area is so powerful.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:07.000
To build among black people,
the ones that supported me,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.840
the ones that put me
here, is so powerful.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.730
And I'll never forget that
day when President Obama came.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.590
He was the sitting
president, coming

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.750
to the poorest part of Atlanta.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.250
The motorcade comes
down the street,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.542
and I'm looking at all these
little black faces holding

00:31:20.542 --> 00:31:22.810
these flags, these kids
waving them, just thinking,

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.780
they never would have
seen this had I not

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.610
put the studio right here.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.700
So building in community and
hiring from the community

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.130
has been so important to
us, pulling people in so

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.720
that they know and take pride.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.990
And I'll never forget, I
was coming to work one day

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.860
and this woman was out
picking up trash in the grass.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.910
And I stopped, I was
like, hi, you need a job?

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:46.480
We're hiring.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.200
She said, no, I work for the
federal government, I'm good.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.580
I'm like, you're just
picking up the trash?

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.635
She said, yeah, yeah, because
you're in the neighborhood.

00:31:55.635 --> 00:31:57.010
And you did a
beautiful job here,

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:58.780
and we want you to
know how thankful we

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.257
are that you're here with us.

00:32:00.257 --> 00:32:01.840
So it's those kind
of moments that let

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.648
me know I'm in the right place.

00:32:03.648 --> 00:32:05.940
And going back to the beginning
and doing these plays--

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.460
back when I started, there
was a Mama on the Couch play

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:09.960
everywhere.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.715
That's we called them,
Mama on the Couch.

00:32:11.715 --> 00:32:13.810
(FEMALE VOICE) Mama,
my man left me.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.880
Mama, Jesus is real.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.995
Mama, where is my
shoes, you know?

00:32:17.995 --> 00:32:19.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.740
So I started putting my
name on it in front of it,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.792
like Tyler Perry's--

00:32:23.792 --> 00:32:25.000
I went a little far with it--

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.580
but it was Tyler Perry's,
Tyler Perry, Tyler Perry,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.402
Tyler Perry.

00:32:27.402 --> 00:32:29.110
And the audience
started to recognize it,

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.235
and they started identifying
that when you see his,

00:32:31.235 --> 00:32:34.353
it's going to be more than a
piece of plywood on the stage.

00:32:34.353 --> 00:32:35.770
Because man, in
these shows, there

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.280
was a sofa, a piece of plywood--

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.640
some of y'all been to 'em--

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.610
and a couple of speakers
from your mama's house trying

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.740
to do the sound in the theater.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.755
But trying to raise
that and elevate it

00:32:46.755 --> 00:32:47.880
was really important to me.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.513
So to see how far
it's come now--

00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:52.930
and even this show that I'm
doing now, this farewell tour,

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.590
it's been just phenomenal
to see the audience

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:00.040
and hear their reaction
to how far I've come.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.740
But going through those times
was very, very difficult.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.680
There was no social media.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.470
It was just word of mouth.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.320
And what I did was
I hired the most--

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.720
kind of what we're doing
with influencers now--

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.970
just hired the most popular
people in their churches

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.080
in their time, or
have these popular DJs

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.630
from their cities to come
and show up and help promote.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.470
And it all worked.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.870
Just to be at this place--

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.562
it's beyond moving.

00:33:27.562 --> 00:33:29.020
So I hope I answered
your question.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.478
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
you did, thank you.

00:33:30.478 --> 00:33:33.412
TYLER PERRY: OK, great, awesome.

00:33:33.412 --> 00:33:35.060
AUDIENCE: Tyler,
this is an honor.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.670
Chris Clark, I'm here
at Google as well.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:41.045
My mom has caused many
fights with my dad over you.

00:33:41.045 --> 00:33:41.920
TYLER PERRY: Oh Lord.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.882
AUDIENCE: So meeting you
right now is an honor for her.

00:33:44.882 --> 00:33:46.090
TYLER PERRY: I appreciate it.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:47.850
Wow, OK.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:48.635
Wow.

00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:52.370
AUDIENCE: My brother, I'm
curious for your legacy.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.285
You talk about all
the work that you've

00:33:54.285 --> 00:33:55.910
done with your studio
and the community

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.760
in Atlanta, amazing work.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.540
I think about the work that
you do as being inspirational,

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.060
not just for the
people you employ,

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.480
but for the people that
watch your performances,

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.989
your characters that you create.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.690
Are there any
characters that you

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.030
want to create, characters
you have not created yet,

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.040
or characters that
you want to play

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.469
from present history
or past history,

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:22.130
or shoot those
characters so that you

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.590
can display their
accomplishments on-screen?

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.650
Anything like that that's a
part of your future legacy

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:28.925
that we can look forward to?

00:34:28.925 --> 00:34:31.520
TYLER PERRY: Yeah,
Oscar Micheaux.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.020
So I'm working on
something with HBO

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.719
to tell the story
of Oscar Micheaux.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.280
He was the first
African-American

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.550
to own his own studio, to do
his own movies, to write novels.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.389
And I have such a kinship
to his life and his story.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:44.597
It's really, really powerful.

00:34:44.597 --> 00:34:46.722
If you don't know who he
is, you should look him up

00:34:46.722 --> 00:34:47.540
in history books.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.560
What he was doing back in the
1930s and '40s was phenomenal.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.900
And to be at this moment now--

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.108
yeah, he's one that
I look forward to.

00:34:56.108 --> 00:34:58.400
And I just read a great script
about Nat King Cole too.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.140
I had no clue the level
of fight he went through.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.835
So there's some great hero
stories that need to be told.

00:35:05.835 --> 00:35:07.130
So we'll see, we'll see.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.963
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:11.245 --> 00:35:13.620
TYLER PERRY: (AS MADEA) Don't
be nervous, girl, just talk

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.370
in the microphone.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:15.072 --> 00:35:15.513
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tyler.

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:16.395
TYLER PERRY: Hey.

00:35:16.395 --> 00:35:20.670
AUDIENCE: My name is Christy,
and I am a YouTube creator.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.838
And it's an honor and
a blessing to be here.

00:35:22.838 --> 00:35:23.880
I'm so humbled right now.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.190
And I'm a huge fan.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.770
Oh, my gosh!

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.330
Like, back in high
school, I did--

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.950
I'm sorry I'm so nervous--

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.570
but I did a play--

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.430
well, a part for play.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.550
And I had to audition,
and I did the Helen part

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.990
from "Diary of a
Mad Black Woman."

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.490
TYLER PERRY: Oh, you know
I'm about to ask you to do

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.573
that right now, don't you?

00:35:39.573 --> 00:35:41.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:42.214 --> 00:35:43.570
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.798
Let me explain something to you.

00:35:45.798 --> 00:35:47.840
TYLER PERRY: She remembers
every word, I love it!

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.500
AUDIENCE: Old Helen is
gone, and you are not

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.420
going to talk to me like that.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:59.492
Now I came here to help you,
but now I'm going to get even.

00:35:59.492 --> 00:36:00.795
(SCREAMING) So shut up!

00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:02.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.810
TYLER PERRY: That's good,
y'all give her a hand.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.470
That's good, that's good.
(LAUGHING) That's good.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.934
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:08.934 --> 00:36:10.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:11.310
I love it.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:12.630
AUDIENCE: I love
all of your movies.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.365
TYLER PERRY: Thank you.

00:36:13.365 --> 00:36:14.660
AUDIENCE: And the
whole class died

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.630
laughing when I did it 'cause
I was so extra with it.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.490
But I came here to ask--

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.450
as a creator who's using her
platform to build opportunities

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.360
for herself, because
I'm a stay-at-home mom,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.310
I'm just trying to
step out [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.340
and do something that I love
and am passionate about.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.223
But I'm also really
passionate about acting.

00:36:34.223 --> 00:36:35.640
Like, that's always
been my thing.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.180
That was my minor in college.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.140
And with the way
things are going,

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.090
just seeing how influencers
and YouTubers and social media

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.340
influencers are getting
these opportunities,

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.525
like commercials, magazines,
movie deals, like you guys,

00:36:50.525 --> 00:36:51.570
so proud of y'all.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.710
They're getting
these opportunities.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:57.990
So do you suggest just keep
putting yourself out there

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.030
and just hoping that
opportunities come to you?

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:02.560
Or do you suggest I
go the agency route?

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.560
Or what's your suggestion
when it comes to that.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.935
TYLER PERRY: I
think you do both.

00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:08.250
But yeah, keep doing
what you're doing.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.110
Be specific about
what you're doing.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.383
And find that unique thing.

00:37:11.383 --> 00:37:13.800
Like what is the thing that's
going to make you stand out?

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.020
What is that one thing
that's going to make

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.670
people notice and go viral?

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.010
And those are the moments
that make things change.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:22.350
So what is that thing, you know?

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.620
And everybody has it, they
just have to find what it is.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.230
And it's usually something
that lots of people

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.490
can connect to, right?

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.050
Laughter is always that.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.610
So if it's funny and it's
amazing, people are always--

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.310
I see clips of
stuff that I've done

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.850
that make myself laugh from
years ago that somebody's

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.120
put up on YouTube.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.745
And you know, it
shows up in the middle

00:37:41.745 --> 00:37:45.360
of somebody's day, and all of
a sudden, they're laughing.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.050
So whatever it is,
stay specific to it.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.055
And agency route
is not a bad route.

00:37:51.055 --> 00:37:53.430
But I shouldn't say this,
because the agents will get mad

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.330
at me.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.380
But there's a shift.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.630
Things are changing, you know?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.463
Things are changing.

00:37:58.463 --> 00:38:01.260
So I don't know, you're
in the right place.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.090
TYLER PERRY: You're
welcome, Helen.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:03.360
AUDIENCE: I'm happy to see you.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:03.810
TYLER PERRY: Good job.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:04.643
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:04.643 --> 00:38:06.764
TYLER PERRY: Helen, shut up.

00:38:06.764 --> 00:38:08.066
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.066 --> 00:38:09.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tyler.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:09.727
TYLER PERRY: He.

00:38:09.727 --> 00:38:11.225
AUDIENCE: I'm Michelle.

00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:12.600
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.808
I'm definitely super nervous.

00:38:13.808 --> 00:38:16.115
I had to write my
question down too.

00:38:16.115 --> 00:38:19.380
So being as ambitious
and hungry as you are,

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.970
I'm pretty sure
that you're managing

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.700
so many different
competing priorities

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.170
and responsibilities.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.780
How do you find time to
self-care and nourish

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.108
so that you're
able to give back?

00:38:30.108 --> 00:38:32.650
I know how deeply rooted you
are in faith, and being a prayer

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:33.060
warrior.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.810
And aside from smoking
the weed and stuff,

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.950
like how else are you
self-caring so that you

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:43.320
can be this creative and caring
individual who gives back

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:43.830
to so many?

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:44.997
How do you give to yourself?

00:38:44.997 --> 00:38:46.710
TYLER PERRY: I build in breaks.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.930
I work for really,
like three months

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:50.340
at a time really, really hard.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.020
Day and night,
let's go, let's go.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.385
I don't want a minute
off, just go, go, go, go.

00:38:54.385 --> 00:38:56.760
But then I'll take three, four
months off and do nothing,

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.460
just absolutely nothing,
just watch my beard grow.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.030
Just nothing.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:03.750
And I think it's very important
that you build in those breaks.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.310
And even if you
can't when you're

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.893
working at a place
like Google, you've

00:39:06.893 --> 00:39:09.950
got to be here a certain amount
of time and you get a vacation

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.940
so often, you can
still have places

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.940
that are sanctuaries
for you in your house.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.940
Just little things, man.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.398
You can have a little small
room in the corner that is just

00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:18.630
like, this is my sanctuary.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.080
This is what I do
for myself, you know?

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.192
A hot soft bath and just
relax and have a good time.

00:39:24.192 --> 00:39:26.775
But it's very important that you
build in breaks for yourself.

00:39:26.775 --> 00:39:27.608
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:27.608 --> 00:39:29.090
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.060
KEN WALKER: I actually think
that was the last question.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.435
TYLER PERRY: Oh,
you woke up now?

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:31.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:32.490
You woke up?

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:32.805
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:32.805 --> 00:39:35.138
He was sitting there sleeping
halfway through all of if.

00:39:35.138 --> 00:39:38.420
You back there too, I see
you got that NoDoz on.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.325
No, I'm just giving
you a hard time.

00:39:41.325 --> 00:39:43.620
AUDIENCE: My name
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.732
I'm originally from
West Africa, Mali.

00:39:45.732 --> 00:39:46.690
This is not a question.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.900
I just want to say
that your presence here

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.190
is very motivating.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.970
And DK for life,
very motivating.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.080
So as a person coming
from West Africa, Mali,

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.580
there's a lot of
ambitions and goals

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.710
that I have in mind that
I want to accomplish.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.850
And just the fact that
I have you guys around,

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.470
it's just like
I'm over the moon.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.280
I just want to just
share my gratitude.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.712
It's making me feel like the
sky is not even the limit.

00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:10.170
And there's so many things I
want to accomplish and take it

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:10.980
back home in Africa.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.060
Even though my
parents are there,

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.670
and my whole family is there,
I'm here to better myself.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.447
And if I can help
my country along,

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:18.030
that's what I want
to do in this life.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.840
So thank you, guys.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.240
That's all I wanted to share.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.070
TYLER PERRY: Thanks
incredible, man.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:20.630
Thank you.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.180
I appreciate that.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:21.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:21.802 --> 00:40:24.280
Thank you.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.780
KEN WALKER: All
right, guys, this is

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.595
going to be the last question.

00:40:26.595 --> 00:40:27.460
AUDIENCE: OK, hello.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.450
TYLER PERRY: So you
can go take a nap.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:30.830
AUDIENCE: Hey, we
both tired, man.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.480
TYLER PERRY: Yeah, that's right.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:31.690
AUDIENCE: We both working.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.357
TYLER PERRY: That's
right, that's right.

00:40:33.357 --> 00:40:34.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:34.752 --> 00:40:37.210
AUDIENCE: I know you as like
the TV mogul, the entertainer,

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.230
producer, and
everything like that.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.553
But I view you as
an entrepreneur,

00:40:41.553 --> 00:40:43.720
and this is just your
industry that you decided to--

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.080
TYLER PERRY: That's right.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.750
AUDIENCE: You know
what I'm saying?

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.360
So my question is the
entrepreneur-- here's

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:46.935
the thing.

00:40:46.935 --> 00:40:49.060
We all look at all these
entrepreneurs and whatnot,

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:49.900
and we want to--

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.650
oh, this person Elon Musk does
this, or Jeff Bezos does this.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.788
It's easy to follow someone
when they've made it.

00:40:56.788 --> 00:40:57.580
TYLER PERRY: Right.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.650
AUDIENCE: So my question is--
back during your early days

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.233
and your early times of how you
struggled to kind of establish

00:41:02.233 --> 00:41:03.730
yourself is well-documented.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:07.540
My question is as an
entrepreneur, what

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.640
happened when you have to decide
between being true to yourself,

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.940
believing in yourself,
and that decision

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.910
of taking investors' money,
or that financial gain where

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.018
your business will advance,
but at the same time,

00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:20.560
being who you are
and your foundation

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.490
is shooken a little bit?

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:22.960
You have to kind
of find a balance

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.252
of do I go left or right,
the fork in the road of being

00:41:25.252 --> 00:41:27.925
an entrepreneur, and what is
best for what you need to do?

00:41:27.925 --> 00:41:29.050
TYLER PERRY: I'm a gut guy.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.530
Everything has always
been about my gut.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:31.630
I'm like, how do
I feel about this?

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.190
And prayer, like how
do you feel about this?

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.530
How am I feeling?

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.310
Am I supposed to do this?

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.328
Am I supposed do that?

00:41:35.328 --> 00:41:37.120
And listen to me, here's
the thing, people,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.180
and when I say this, my agent
clearly doesn't believe me.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.490
But I never chased the money.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.270
I was very focused on
what I wanted to do.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.895
I knew I had something
that was special

00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:48.220
that was going to help people.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.630
Because my first show was about
adult survivors of child abuse.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.838
And I thought 1,200 people
would come the first week,

00:41:52.838 --> 00:41:54.130
and only 30 showed up.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.470
But out of that 30,
it helped somebody.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:57.570
So that was my focus.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:58.780
That was always my focus.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.020
So as long as I kept my
eye on what my focus was,

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.240
the money came, everything
else fell in place.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.633
So don't deviate from the focus.

00:42:05.633 --> 00:42:08.050
There have been moments that
I've had to turn down things.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.175
I mean, there was this one
deal, I'll never forget.

00:42:10.175 --> 00:42:16.890
It was so good but for me,
it just didn't feel right.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:18.863
It was "Two and Half Men."

00:42:18.863 --> 00:42:20.530
Chuck Lorre, who did
"Two and Half Men,"

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:23.410
"Roseanne--" we were working
on a sitcom together.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.490
And it just didn't
feel right for me.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:27.070
And I had this deal,
I was locked in.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.570
Everything in me,
I was just praying

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.460
that the deal didn't happen,
because it didn't feel right.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.400
But I remember my agent's
oh, my god, you're

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.192
going to make so much
money, so much money.

00:42:34.192 --> 00:42:35.870
But it just didn't feel right.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.590
So when the deal fell apart, I
was so happy and so relieved.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.670
Because out of that,
"House of Payne,"

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.280
"The Have and Have Nots," "Meet
the Browns," all these shows

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:43.780
were born.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.285
And the difference
is I own all of them.

00:42:46.285 --> 00:42:48.160
In that show, I wouldn't
have owned anything.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:48.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.620
So that made the difference.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.590
So go with how you
feel about it, man.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.780
What does this feel like?

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.890
Does it feel right?

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.172
And if it doesn't feel
right, don't do it.

00:42:59.172 --> 00:43:01.380
No matter what it is, no
matter how much money it is.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.180
And I know it's hard for a
lot of people to go, hey,

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.208
they just offered me $3 million,
and I got $2.50 in the bank.

00:43:08.208 --> 00:43:10.000
You think I'm not going
to take this money?

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.470
But it's got to
be what you feel.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.620
Because had I taken
that show, my life

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.850
would be very different.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:17.270
Ownership would
be very different.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.760
I would have never been
able to own the studio.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.302
I would never have been able to
hire all the people that I've

00:43:21.302 --> 00:43:23.830
hired and help all the people
and make as many millionaires

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:24.400
as I have.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.160
Because I would have been
tied to someone else owning

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.600
my intellectual property.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.350
So ownership is the key.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.080
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:31.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.937
TYLER PERRY: Thank
you, everybody.

00:43:32.937 --> 00:43:33.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.670
Thank you.
