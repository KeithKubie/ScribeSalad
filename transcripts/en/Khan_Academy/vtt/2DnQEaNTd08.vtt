00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.290
Pooja had a beautiful plant. The plant
began sprouting 2 days before Pooja

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.879
bought it,

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.090
and she had it for 98 days
before it died.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.920
At its tallest, the plant was 30
centimetres tall.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.690
Alright, let h of t denote the height
of Pooja's plant h,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.000
measured in centimeters, t days from
the time she bought it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.250
Which number type is more appropriate
for the domain of the function? They

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.939
tell us whether it's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.260
integers or real numbers.
So we just need to remind ourselves.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.350
The domain of a function, that's a
set of all the inputs for which the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.880
function is defined.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.450
And the inputs here, this is t and
it represents days

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.410
and if I input t, the number of days,
into the function h,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.590
it'll output the height of the plant. So let's
think about it. At first, you might

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.579
say, in terms of, 0 days, 1 days,
2 days, and you might be tempted to say

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.199
integers.

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.030
But why not think about one and a half
days or 3.175 days?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.879
So I don't see any real -- not any reason
why t couldn't be a subset

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.220
of real numbers. Why you can think about,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.100
you know, the 90 -- 97.99

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.790
day. So I would say real numbers. And let's see.
Define the interval of the domain.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.530
So t. Let's see, the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.900
t would be defined up to 2 days
before she bought the plant. So I would say

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.540
that t is equal to negative 2, all the way to 
98 days.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.040
And t could be equal to negative 2. That would be
2 days before she bought it,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.549
or as high as 98. So let's think about it.
So the interval --

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.990
I would include, I would include negative 2.
I would include

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.270
the low point, so that's why I'm
using the bracket. If I wanted t to be

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.619
greater than, not greater than or equal
to, I would do a parentheses. But since t

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.189
could be equal to negative 2, I'm gonna use the brackets.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.590
And at the high end, it's 98,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.079
and we're going to include 98. So I'm
gonna put the brackets

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.579
there as well. So t would be a member of
real numbers

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.320
such that it is a member of this
-- of this interval right

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.300
over here. So negative t-- t could
be negative 2

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.960
but -- right I would say negative 2 is going to be less than
or equal to t, which is going to be

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.980
less than or equal to 98.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.390
Let's check our answer. Got it right.
