00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:01.405
- [Voiceover] We have a square here

00:00:01.405 --> 00:00:03.481
and all the sides have length x.

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.688
And what I want to think about here

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:06.635
is whether the perimeter of the square

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:10.627
is proportional to the length of a side of the square.

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.202
So let's think about it a little bit.

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:13.887
I'm going to draw a table,

00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:17.101
so let me make some columns here.

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.444
So there you have that, we have that,

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:22.343
and we'll make three columns

00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:24.101
and on the first column

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:26.887
we're going to think about the Side length.

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:30.376
Side length,

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:32.116
and that's measured as x.

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:36.211
And in the next column I want to think about the Perimeter.

00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:37.177
Well what is that?

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:39.696
That's going to be x plus x plus x plus x

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:41.472
which is, of course, four x.

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.352
And then I want to think about the ratio.

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:48.550
The ratio between Perimeter,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.273
Perimeter and Side length.

00:00:56.173 --> 00:00:59.867
So let's see, when the Side length is equal to one,

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:00.865
what's the Perimeter?

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:02.118
It's going to be four times one.

00:01:02.118 --> 00:01:03.836
One plus one plus one plus one.

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:05.120
It's going to be four.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.207
And what's our ratio?

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:07.564
It's going to be four to one

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:09.599
which, of course, is equal to four.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.566
Now what if the Side length is two?

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.807
Well then the Perimeter is going to be

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:13.985
two plus two plus two plus two.

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:15.726
It's going to be four times two.

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.176
That's going to be eight.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.649
So the ratio's going to be eight to two

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.367
which is going to be equal to four.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.168
I think we see a pattern here.

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:24.688
The ratio of Perimeter to Side length,

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:27.556
it looks like it's always going to be four.

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:28.810
Now we could keep going here.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.368
If our Side length is three,

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:33.069
then our Perimeter is going to be 12.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.207
What's the ratio?

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:36.934
12 divided by three is equal to four.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.092
Now this isn't some magical thing here,

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:40.047
because to figure out the Perimeter

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:41.984
we're multiplying it by four.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.143
So if the ratio of Perimeter to Side length,

00:01:44.143 --> 00:01:46.785
it's always going to be,

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.280
the Perimeter is going to be four x

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.688
if the Side length is x,

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:51.243
and four x divided by x,

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.805
well that's always going to be four.

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:55.972
Well this definitely meets our conditions

00:01:55.972 --> 00:01:58.001
for being a proportional relationship.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.419
The ratio between Perimeter and Side length

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:02.137
is always going to be four.

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:04.157
We didn't have to do this table here,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.084
but this makes it a little bit more concrete.

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.242
Or we could write it like this,

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:09.538
we could write that

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:14.165
Perimeter

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.575
for a square

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:19.184
is equal to four times the Side length.

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.421
And so, once again, it becomes clear

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:25.717
it's a proportional relationship.

00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:28.621
The Perimeter is equal to a constant times the Side length,

00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:30.745
or the Perimeter divided by the Side length

00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:31.904
is equal to four.

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:34.436
So this is definitely a proportional relationship

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:37.245
between Side length and Perimeter.
