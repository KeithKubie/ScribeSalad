00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.630
An integral part of the game, immediately
prior to the start of play, the football quarterback

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.070
begins his cadence.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.270
More than just “hut,” the offensive leader
on the field uses short commands to prepare

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.430
the team, adjust to the defense’s line up
and even change the play.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.960
Whether it’s “53 is the Mike,” “Omaha,”
“Red 32,” “Set” or “Hike,” each

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.550
shout is an important tool in the quarterback’s
bag of tricks.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
The Short Words

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.820
The most well known cadence, “hike,” was
the brainchild of John Heisman (of the eponymous

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.820
trophy).

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.649
Prior to its introduction, commonly the quarterback
signaled the center to give him the ball by

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.170
simply scratching the center’s leg.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.500
During the 1890-1891 season, Heisman was playing
center for the University of Pennsylvania

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.010
when a leg scratch from an opposing player
tricked into hiking early.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.530
To fix the problem, Heisman introduced using
a word to start the snap, and that it be “hike,”

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.460
which already meant to lift up and also had
the added benefit of being a short, sharp

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.460
sound.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.590
“Hut” was a later introduction, although
by the 1950s it was commonly in use in football.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.311
Linguists trace its origins back to military
cadence, particularly of World War II, when

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.440
drill sergeants would holler “Atten-hut!”

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.760
Another short, sharp sound, it was perfect
for preparing the team for battle.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.160
Sharply yelling single syllable words to get
attention has a long history.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.789
Early on, animals were directed with such
commands (and still are today) and common

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.900
locutions included “hup,” “hip” and
“hep” (with “hup” dating back to the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.340
18th century).

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.890
Other short football commands include “set,”
after which the linemen get into their stance,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.090
and “move” which may direct many players
to adjust according to a planned shift, or

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.729
could just stir a few to action (e.g., the
tight ends assume a 3-point stance).

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.560
Longer Phrases

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.570
Colors and numbers are frequently used in
combination, such as “Green 19,” “Blue

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.690
82” and “43-2,” for any number of reasons.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.830
Sometimes, the phrase indicates an audible
(change in play called at the line of scrimmage

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.290
to adjust to a troubling defensive scheme),
and other times, it clues players in to their

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.750
blocking assignments.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.030
Often the phrase will put a receiver in motion
or simply designate when the ball is about

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.030
to be snapped.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.550
And frequently, a great deal of it (if not
all at times) is gibberish.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.080
Typically, a team will have a live color – after
hearing this color, offensive players know

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.550
the predetermined snap count (the number of
“huts” after which the ball will be hiked)

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.550
is about to begin (e.g., “Green 32, Green
32, hut hut.”)

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.129
Even though one color is live, other colors
will be used (gibberish), to distract and

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.370
confuse the defense, and sometimes even to
cause them to jump offsides if used with a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.130
hard count (e.g. if green is the live color,
“Blue 18, Blue 18, hut, hut, HUT hut.”)

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.500
The live color can be any color, although
according to Brett Favre, “a lot of teams

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.760
use black or red as a hot.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.760
When you hear that, there’s an audible coming.”

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.540
Nonetheless, as he concludes, “everyone’s
different.”

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.250
Another typical cadence denotes ” the Mike.”

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.200
Traditionally, “Mike” was shorthand for
the middle linebacker, and a common cadence

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.400
heard in the NFC North (and before that the
Central) from 2000-2012 was “54 has the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400
Mike.”

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.140
However, several commentators note that this
phrase is not necessarily applied to the Mike,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.939
but to the defensive player that requires
special attention – such as who the fullback

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.010
should block.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.319
A cadence that comes in many forms but generally
means the same thing is the word(s) used to

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.269
indicate a change in the snap count.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.030
Peyton and Eli Manning sometimes use “Omaha,”
(Eli says Peyton stole it from him), and Tom

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.959
Brady uses “Alpha.”

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.450
Defenses are wise to this use, and in fact
during a 2009 Giants-Dallas game, Eli used

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.940
it too much – to the point where Chris Collinsworth
thought he was tipping the snap.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.030
Adjusting yet again, now these quarterbacks
use “Omaha” and “Alpha” in other ways,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.310
such as when Peyton began incorporating it
into his hard count (with great success, apparently).

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.969
In order to clue the offense in, they will
have established a “freeze” word that

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:45.000
he yells before “Omaha,” so no offensive
players move, but the defense jumps.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Football insiders Randy Moss and Brian Urlacher
have a different take on “Omaha,” and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
though it was used to direct the offense to
run the planned play, but in the opposite

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
direction.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
A Rise in Gibberish

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.030
Fans have noticed an upswing in chatter from
quarterbacks over the last several years,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.269
and most believe this is due to placing microphones
on centers and guards in 2011.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.389
Used by the networks to bring the sounds of
the game to the viewers, prior to 2010, the

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.060
official, who was positioned in the defensive
backfield, wore the on-field microphone.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.370
After 2010, the official was placed in the
offensive backfield (due to safety concerns),

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.999
but with the quarterback’s back to him,
many sounds were muffled before it reached

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:13.999
the mic.

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:16.120
The solution: wire up some offensive lineman.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.710
Another example of unintended consequences,
now every code and cue uttered by the quarterback

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.620
is clearly audible to everyone, including
defensive players and coordinators.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.780
As a result, defenses were better able to
decode cadences, which, once again, stirred

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.090
offenses to adapt – now with a combination
of hand signals, gesticulations and a great

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.680
deal of meaningless chatter to hide the few
important code words.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.830
As one veteran defensive lineman noted: “He’s
holding up two finders . . . calling out all

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.730
these colors, ‘purple, blue’ . . . it’s
funny . . . when you see someone on TV jump

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.020
offisdes . . . but the fact of the matter
is that you get out there on Sunday and it

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:05.180
could happen 
to you.”
