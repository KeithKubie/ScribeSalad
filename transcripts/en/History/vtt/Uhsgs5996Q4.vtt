00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.710
NARRATOR: Life on
Earth seeded from Mars?

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.710
Could we in fact be Martians?

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.830
and suggest that
this seeding of earth

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.380
may even have been
a directed effort

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.750
orchestrated by
human-like beings

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.250
that existed on the red planet.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.920
And they claim these extra
terrestrial ancestors

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.250
can be found in the apocryphal
texts of the Hebrew Bible,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.580
represented as
the fallen angels.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.040
We know from ancient
legend, of the books of Enoch,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.880
that there was a group of
angels who descended to earth

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.040
in violation of divine law.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.420
They introduced to
humanity ways, means,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.040
knowledge, which we
would understand today

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.670
as science and technology.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.290
These angels were in human form.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.880
They were called in Hebrew
[hebrew],, which means men.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.120
They looked just like us.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.250
JONATHAN YOUNG: The
fallen angels were giants.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.460
They were at least 10 feet
tall, very striking to look at,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.460
enormous eyes, and no wings.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.210
WILLIAM HENRY: For
over 100 years,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.920
mythologists have
been contemplating

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.420
this idea that the fallen
angels came from Mars to Earth.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.620
Even Dante described
this in the "Paradiso."

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.580
He called this the
fifth level of heaven.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.290
Is it possible that the fallen
angels came to Earth from Mars?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.170
NARRATOR: Could we reinterpret
the story of fallen angels

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.000
as beings not from
heaven, but from Mars?

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.330
Based on examination of
the astronauts living

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.620
in the International
Space Station,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.960
scientists have
speculated on what

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.000
physiological changes might
be seen in future generations

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.460
of humans born on Mars.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.250
And ancient astronaut
theories suggest

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.500
the resemblance to the
description of fallen angels

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.170
may be uncanny.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.670
SUE ANN PIEN: One
of the most amazing

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.500
things about the human body
is its ability to adapt.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.170
And if you look at
astronauts who go into space,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.500
they actually grow about
two or three inches.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.540
And when you have a human
that's born on Mars, what's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.380
going to happen
is the environment

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.210
will change the structure
of the human body.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.500
And what you're going to
see in a few generations

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.710
is humans that are
taller and skinnier,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.290
because the gravity on Mars
is less than that of Earth.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.790
MIKE BARA: If humans evolve
long enough on the planet Mars,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.460
they could grow to be taller,
they'd have the bigger heads,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.210
they'd have the spindly limbs.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.040
They might actually grow
slightly larger eyes that

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.790
were equipped to see
better in the dark,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.210
because you simply have
less sunlight on Mars

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.620
than you do on the
Earth, because it's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.580
farther away from the sun.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.330
They could also end up looking
like representations of angels

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.830
and various other
godlike beings that we've

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.750
read about in the Bible and
other ancient documents.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.750
DAVID CHILDRESS: These
attributes to somebody

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.830
from a low-gravity
planet like Mars,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.420
or being in space
for a long time,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.750
may well be the attributes that
we see of the fallen angels

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.080
being very tall and
spindly, and perhaps pale,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.750
and with large eyes.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.670
Something that we might
expect to be coming

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.670
from another planet like Mars.
