00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:02.687
- So I have drawn four different

00:00:02.687 --> 00:00:05.125
triglyceride molecules over here.

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.064
And some of you might be saying,

00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:09.013
"wait I thought triglycerides they involve

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:11.952
"all of these carbons and hydrogens and oxygens".

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:14.158
Well I see the oxygens over here

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:16.654
but where's all of the carbons and hydrogens?

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:18.593
And my answer to you is that they will be implicit.

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:20.857
This is a short-hand way of diagramming out

00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:22.053
these large molecules.

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:23.388
And you'll see this many times

00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:26.128
when you take chemistry, biology, organic chemistry.

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:27.289
And what's happening here is that

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.516
each of these pointy parts of this chain,

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.024
each of these vertices there's implicitly a carbon.

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:34.791
There's a carbon there, there's a carbon there.

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:35.753
There's a carbon there.

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:36.588
And there's also,

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:39.386
if we don't put a letter at the end of the chain,

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:41.790
there's also a carbon right over there.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.345
So implicitly there's a carbon there,

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.656
there's a carbon there, there's a carbon there.

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:46.724
Now you might also be wondering

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:47.827
what about the hydrogens?

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:52.726
Well we assume that every carbon has four covalent bonds.

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:55.222
And so if there's extra covalent bonds

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.221
for each of these carbons,

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.089
we assume that those covalent bonds are with hydrogen.

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.445
So for example, this carbon right over here,

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:03.408
it has two covalent bonds.

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:06.252
So the other two covalent bonds must be

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:07.819
must be with hydrogens.

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.188
Same thing for this carbon right over there.

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:11.987
It must be bonded to two hydrogens.

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:13.508
This carbon, the way its drawn, we only

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:15.761
explicitly see one covalent bond.

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:18.222
So there must be three covalent bonds.

00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:21.124
There must be three covalent bonds to hydrogens.

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:22.881
So the carbons and hydrogens are all there.

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.025
They're just implicitly there.

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:26.953
Now you might notice, and actually, if you don't notice,

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.195
I encourage you to pause

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:29.518
and think about what the difference is

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:31.318
between this triglyceride, this triglyceride

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:33.350
this triglyceride and that triglyceride.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.067
And it might jump at you pretty quickly.

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.609
What jumps at you is this triglyceride has

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.258
no double bonds.

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:42.289
This one has one double bond.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.960
This one has several double bonds.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.583
And this one also has several double bonds.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:48.884
But these two are also different

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:50.590
and we're gonna think about the way that they're different.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.983
You might immediately see that this one

00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:54.654
kinda kinds and curves

00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:56.755
while this one is able to stay relatively straight.

00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:58.183
And actually that is the main difference.

00:01:58.183 --> 00:01:59.542
And we're gonna talk about it in a second

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.446
why that is.

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:02.793
But first lets talk about this one.

00:02:02.793 --> 00:02:05.242
When you have all single bonds

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:06.217
one way to think about it is that

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:08.550
you have put as many hydrogens onto

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.651
these carbon chains as you can.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:11.953
Or another way of thinking about it is

00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:15.889
we have saturated this fat with hydrogens.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.870
And that's why this is called a saturated fat.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.286
A saturated, this is a saturated fat.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:23.958
This is something that you might have heard of.

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.651
This is referring to things like butter.

00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:28.718
They've a lot of different fats that we tend to

00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:31.492
associate with being solid at room temperature.

00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:33.489
And the reason why they're solid at room temperature

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.193
is because this are all bonded to these hydrogens.

00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:39.724
There's no kinks for them to do to the double bonds.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:42.150
These are able to be relatively dense.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.787
Which allows it to be solid

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:47.189
or typically solid at room temperature.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.559
And these are sometimes associated with,

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.393
I don't want to get into the whole nutritional battles

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.750
about saturated fat and fat's good or bad.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.178
But these are sometimes associated

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:56.384
these are sometimes called your bad fats.

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:57.952
But as we'll see they aren't the worse fats.

00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:00.517
The worse fats are actually this one right over here.

00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:02.619
But we'll talk about that in a second.

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.627
So this is saturated fat because a way to think about it

00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:07.727
is it's saturated with as many hydrogens as possible.

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:09.620
Now this one of the right,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.595
and I don't know anything about it

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:11.686
it has all single bonds.

00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:14.925
Now over here, or all single bonds between the carbons.

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:17.421
Over here we see a double bond.

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:20.661
We see a double bond between that carbon and that carbon.

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:21.717
And because of that,

00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:25.223
this carbon already has three covalent bonds

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.325
so it's only gonna be bonded with one hydrogen.

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:28.881
This one already has three covalent bonds

00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:31.121
so it's only gonna be bonded with one hydrogen

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.326
as opposed to two like these characters over here.

00:03:34.326 --> 00:03:35.452
And because of that we don't have

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.391
as many hydrogens on the chain as possible.

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.596
So we consider this to be an unsaturated fat.

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:46.888
Unsaturated fat.

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:49.651
We don't have as many hydrogens as possible.

00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:51.323
And because of that unsaturated fat,

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:53.424
and specially polyunsaturated fats,

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:55.827
these double bonds they tend to form

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:58.056
these kinks in the structure

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.483
which keep the molecules from getting really, really dense

00:04:00.483 --> 00:04:03.989
which tends to make them liquid or more likely to be liquid

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.754
at room temperature.

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:07.553
So this is an unsaturated fat.

00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:09.295
This right over here, we have multiple,

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:13.591
we have multiple double bonds in play.

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.382
This is called a polyunsaturated fat.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:22.002
Polyunsaturated fat.

00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:23.170
And since this actually only has,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.817
they're both unsaturated fats.

00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:27.151
This is a polyunsaturated fat.

00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:28.718
And since this only has one double bond

00:04:28.718 --> 00:04:33.353
we can call this a monounsaturated fat.

00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:34.651
So these are both unsaturated fat.

00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:36.660
This is many times happening so poly.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.108
This is happening once, so we call it monounsaturated fat.

00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:41.513
Now one question you might have is

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:44.849
why are the kinks forming for

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.656
this molecule and this molecule.

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.827
And why are they not forming with this molecule

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:51.242
even though this one has double bonds as well.

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:52.890
And this goes to our good friends

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.119
cis and trans.

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:56.420
And so you might remember,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.520
if you have a double bond between carbons.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.482
And lets say that you have,

00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:06.358
lets say that you have one configuration.

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:08.250
Let me just do it this way.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.620
Lets say you've one configuration where

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.093
this is attached to some type of a carbon chain,

00:05:12.093 --> 00:05:14.495
and lets say that this is a hydrogen.

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:17.120
Then on the other side the rest of the carbon chain

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.326
it could be in one of two configurations.

00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:20.789
The rest of the carbon

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.983
the rest of the carbon chain could

00:05:22.983 --> 00:05:25.793
be on the same side as the carbon chain on the left.

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:28.443
So I'll put R' there.

00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:31.067
And, let me do that in the same color.

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:33.904
So you have your hydrogen.

00:05:33.904 --> 00:05:35.594
So this is one configuration.

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:38.000
Now another configuration would be

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.189
carbon double bonded to carbon.

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.093
You have your hydrogen but now the hydrogens

00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:43.951
are on opposite sides.

00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:48.780
And your chains,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.360
the rest of the carbon chains

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.469
are on opposite sides.

00:05:53.123 --> 00:05:54.261
And as we talked about before,

00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:55.793
this is because double bonds are rigid.

00:05:55.793 --> 00:05:56.885
You can't rotate around it.

00:05:56.885 --> 00:05:58.452
So it matters, these are actually different,

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:00.960
these are actually different isomers right over here.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.422
Depending on whether this chain is on

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:03.850
the same side as this chain.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.395
Or whether is on the same side.

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:06.486
When it's on the same side

00:06:06.486 --> 00:06:08.785
we call this a cis configuration

00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:13.858
and this is a trans, trans configuration.

00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:15.681
And it turns out that most naturally

00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:19.582
produced unsaturated fats are in the cis configuration.

00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:21.428
And because they're on the cis configuration

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:23.053
whenever you have these double bonds,

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:25.759
it forms, it makes the chain actually bend.

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.361
And if you have many of these double bonds

00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:28.789
it makes it bend a lot.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.751
And so polyunsaturated fats are even more

00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:34.060
likely to be liquid because it's very hard to pack them.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.557
So what's going on over here?

00:06:35.557 --> 00:06:37.786
Well these are actually the configuration

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:39.981
where the, I guess you could say,

00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.525
the rest of the carbon chains

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:43.789
are on opposite sides of the double bond.

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.287
Notice this carbon chain it might be

00:06:45.287 --> 00:06:46.517
a little bit hard to see

00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:48.061
is above the double bond.

00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:50.685
We formed a covalent bond going upward there.

00:06:50.685 --> 00:06:54.551
While this carbon chain,

00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:57.558
right over here, is below the double bond.

00:06:57.558 --> 00:06:59.288
And because of that it doesn't form a kink

00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:01.355
and these are in the trans configuration.

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:02.585
And so this right over here,

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:04.919
this is called a trans fat.

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.571
This is called a trans fat.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.745
And they aren't typically found,

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:12.512
they aren't typically found in nature.

00:07:12.512 --> 00:07:14.843
Now it's interesting about trans fats

00:07:14.843 --> 00:07:16.355
is a lot of folks say "hey you know, okay,

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:18.410
"maybe saturated fat is bad for us.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.418
"Maybe we shouldn't eat as much butter and all of that".

00:07:20.418 --> 00:07:23.518
And some of that's even up for debate these days.

00:07:23.518 --> 00:07:27.361
And they say, "what if we started with unsaturated fats?".

00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:29.927
Which are typically viewed as more healthy,

00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:32.249
our polyunsaturated fat.

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:34.350
And were just throw a bunch of hydrogens on them,

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.949
may be not to fully saturate it,

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.656
but enough hydrogen so that some of these

00:07:39.656 --> 00:07:41.084
double bonds disappear.

00:07:41.084 --> 00:07:42.860
And so it's more solid at room temperature which

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.622
might make it a good replacement for butter in cooking.

00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:49.455
And a lot of the shortening that you might have seen

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:52.138
even 10, 15 years ago, or even today in a lot of places,

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.482
they're essentially trans fat.

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:56.583
And so what happened is is that,

00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:58.395
yes, you can replace a lot of these,

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.821
you can start to saturate it more with hydrogens.

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:05.828
But that process also turned some of the

00:08:05.828 --> 00:08:07.528
cis double bonds

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:09.517
into trans double bonds.

00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:10.924
And at first people said, "oh that's harmless,

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:14.428
"this is probably good for you, it's still unsaturated".

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:17.690
But it has some of the properties of a saturated fat.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.291
It's nice and solid and buttery and all of that.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.183
And maybe is even cheaper to produce.

00:08:22.183 --> 00:08:23.855
You can take it from other oils.

00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:26.293
But it turns out that this is very unhealthy.

00:08:26.293 --> 00:08:27.884
There's a lot of debates in nutrition,

00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:30.287
but this is unequivocally unhealthy.

00:08:30.287 --> 00:08:31.460
This does not exist in nature

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.120
and it has all sorts of bad impacts.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.488
And that's why a lot of states, and even countries

00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:38.390
have now banned trans fats.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.783
They actually, I've even heard people

00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:43.116
go so far and say "this is actually poisonous

00:08:43.116 --> 00:08:44.684
"to your body" in certain ways.

00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:48.190
And it really affects you in extremely negative ways.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.152
That might be extra strong language

00:08:50.152 --> 00:08:52.061
but I'm, I guess I'm trying to scare you a little bit.

00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:53.334
Don't eat trans fats.

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:55.372
Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that.
