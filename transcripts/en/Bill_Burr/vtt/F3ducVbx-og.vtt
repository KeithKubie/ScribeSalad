1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.363
Okay.

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.890
<v 1>Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.</v>

3
00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:06.740
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.780
July 24th. Uh,

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.940
2017 was going on. How, why? Yeah,

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.790
I got to keep my voice down. I got my little,

7
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.270
little one here is sleeping and the next room I am in New York City.

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.390
I got a little acting Gig here on a little movie in a little city called New

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.800
York City. Um, for the next week I'll be doing that shit.

10
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.790
So I'm acting during the day and night whenever the hell they have me doing it.

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.310
And um, then I'm looking,

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.420
I come home and I look at the scripts that we're working on for F is for family

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.110
and um, I dunno,

14
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.640
that's become my life here. I actually did one spot this weekend though.

15
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.950
I went over to the Gotham comedy club,

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.930
hadn't been there in fucking years. Went over there,

17
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:02.330
had a great time and uh,

18
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.430
try to maybe pop in and do another spot maybe next weekend or something just to

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.000
get off. So, I don't forget all my fucking jokes, but, uh,

20
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.300
Jesus Christ Has New York changed? I can't believe it.

21
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.780
Like everybody lives in Brooklyn now.

22
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.543
<v 0>Um,</v>

23
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.760
<v 1>I don't know. I mean there's a bunch of people still living in Manhattan,</v>

24
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:28.720
but like, I don't know, Manhattan is a weird now. Like they, uh,

25
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.500
they took it too far. Like,

26
00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:36.670
I remember when I first lived here, it's like Manhattan was, it was scary.

27
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.540
Like you were always kind of, you know,

28
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.420
being aware of people around you.

29
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.310
I remember buying like a jacket behalf,

30
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.350
trying to look tougher than I really was just trying anything you could do to,

31
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.423
you know,

32
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.680
<v 0>okay,</v>

33
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.580
<v 1>keep that fucking thing off you. And I'm,</v>

34
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.701
and even then,

35
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.850
I guess it was way better obviously than it was in the 70s and the crack

36
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.810
eighties and everything and Giuliani had just taken over. But uh,

37
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.620
somewhere along the line, man, they, they, they just took it too far.

38
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:11.640
I felt like I was in like Sacramento or something,

39
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.403
<v 0>you know,</v>

40
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.530
<v 1>not saying there aren't dangerous parts of Sacramento,</v>

41
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.540
those dangerous parts of her, it just felt like a dish.

42
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.750
It didn't feel like New York, like there was just no, there was no vibe,

43
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.970
I guess. It was kind of cool, you know, like families and Shit.

44
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:32.170
It kinda just, it's starting to feel like a theme park. Um,

45
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.370
I know that's a weird thing to complain about that it's, it's like too safe,

46
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.860
but it's just a, I don't know, probably just a grumpy old man.

47
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:45.310
It's definitely not the city I remember. So, um,

48
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.310
I was out in Brooklyn, you know,

49
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:51.700
rehearsing some of the shit that I get to do for next week and, um,

50
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.800
just going through that, oh my God. All the fucking high rise it. Oh my God.

51
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.420
All the fucking high rises and shit, they're building over there and um,

52
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.570
it's, it's just not, I've,

53
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.530
I remember I used to date this woman that fucking lived off the g train like

54
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.420
fucking 15 years ago and it was like,

55
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.660
it was like going into another fucking world.

56
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.280
<v 2>Um, and uh,</v>

57
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.570
<v 1>now you go, I don't know what the fuck's going. I don't know.</v>

58
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.360
I'm just an old man going, there's no way used to

59
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.150
<v 2>me. Yeah, I went over there. That's like, we're all like the hipsters,</v>

60
00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:34.080
but even everybody is so anti hipster that even hipsters don't dress like

61
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.310
kippsters anymore. But you can still see them, you know?

62
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.690
Now the new vibe is you sorta like, yeah, Blake,

63
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.080
the Connor McGregor haircut with the good Charlotte tattoos and clothes,

64
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:46.830
you know, see kind of look like,

65
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:51.831
does this guy build custom motorcycles or does he ride a tricycle with the giant

66
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.480
front wheel? You know,

67
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.290
is he making his own brew is, you know,

68
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.530
is he working one of those fucking breweries and you know, it's none of that.

69
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.810
You know the Michael Jackson pants that don't quite make it down to your fucking

70
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.610
sneakers or shoes or whatever the fuck they are. So I don't know.

71
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.473
Like

72
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.500
<v 1>Brooklyn's like, it's like nice now. I don't know</v>

73
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.640
<v 2>fucking it was,</v>

74
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.500
<v 1>yeah, Jesus Christ. What I want to know is when did all those people go</v>

75
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.210
when they wiped it all up? Like where do,

76
00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:32.990
where do all the rest of the people go? Where do all of those restaurants go?

77
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.910
Where does that vibe go? All that culture. Where the fuck does it go?

78
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:41.030
Everything just looks like a fucking forever 21 now.

79
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.830
And everything's just a giant glass luxury fucking apartment building.

80
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.510
Who the fuck has all this money?

81
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.260
I thought these fucking millennials were broke.

82
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.650
They were coming out of college with all this college debt and there were no

83
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:58.260
fucking jobs and all they do, you know,

84
00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.670
<v 3>okay,</v>

85
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.430
<v 1>I don't what's going on if you're trying to buy a house right now, it's like,</v>

86
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:07.320
if you don't have, like you tried to buy a house and there's some Chinese guy or

87
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.750
<v 2>guy from the Middle East or a Russian guy that just comes in and just fucking</v>

88
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.150
[inaudible]

89
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.350
<v 1>bids all cash.</v>

90
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.140
<v 2>I think this is my fucking conspiracy theory that Russia,</v>

91
00:05:23.141 --> 00:05:27.760
China in the Middle East, Aramco, hoots with each other and they're like, look,

92
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:32.680
well, we can't like just go over and start bombing those guys. You know,

93
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.620
the United States have nuclear weapons and as we saw in World War Two, uh,

94
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.590
they will use them not once, but twice, right?

95
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.480
So they know they can't do that.

96
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.060
So I think what they're doing now is they're just going to fucking,

97
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.640
just slowly buy as much as they can and put a Chinese guy,

98
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.210
a Russian or an Arab in all of those. And then they'll be,

99
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.100
they'll have infiltrated our country then

100
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.950
<v 1>the run for office and then they'll just switch the whole fucking thing.</v>

101
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.920
Do I sound like that guy talking about bottle are precious bodily liquids or

102
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:11.750
fluids in a doctor? Strange love. I don't fucking know. Um,

103
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.590
I think this is a part of being my age where like you live long enough that you

104
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:18.170
remember how it used to be and now you've seen it changing.

105
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:21.260
It's kind of freaking you out. Maybe that's what it is.

106
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.270
Maybe I'm just one of those guys being like wow, you know when I die some day,

107
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:29.180
like no one's going to give a fuck and this is just going to keep going isn't

108
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:32.900
it? I guess I'm not that important. Um,

109
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.390
anyways. Um,

110
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.900
I'm fucking got my handheld goddamn recorded here cause I'm,

111
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.480
yeah,

112
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.720
cause I'm on the road and I didn't have any room to bring all my podcasts shit

113
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:51.680
cause I got the kid now and uh,

114
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.700
that's a fucking trip, Huh? Packing up all your stuff,

115
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.750
all this stuff you need for the kid. Um,

116
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.320
yeah, I dunno, it's not that bad.

117
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:08.321
You just pack it all up and then you just go to curb side fucking hand somebody

118
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:12.440
a 20 and just be like, yeah, just shove all this shit under the plane.

119
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.190
Then that's it. And you get one of those giant wheelie things when you land,

120
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.660
you just wheel it out and you throw it all in a cab. Right.

121
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.100
Again, you yank it out and then you got the guy at the hotel,

122
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.300
you fucking pee puts it on a wheelie thing. It's, it's really not that bad.

123
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.410
Everybody acts like they have to carry it and fucking hold it in their lap on

124
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.041
the plane ride.

125
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:39.041
You don't just pay the extra money shoving under the fucking plate and be done

126
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:43.550
with it. Um, but my daughter did great on the plane. You know,

127
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.820
I guess kids before, they're like one years old. Like the, uh,

128
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.930
the air pressure stuff doesn't quite bug them as much. I don't know why.

129
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.690
Maybe there you stationed tubes, they're so small, they, I don't,

130
00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:58.570
I don't understand why it wouldn't,

131
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:00.970
but people claim that it doesn't, you know,

132
00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:04.090
and for those of you who don't understand that ear popping thing,

133
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:07.120
which I didn't, it's just, you know,

134
00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:12.121
when you take off the air inside your ear on the other side of your ear drum

135
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.450
is a,

136
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.500
that pressure as you ascend becomes higher than the pressure on the other side

137
00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:27.970
of the eardrum. The outside part, right? That leads to the a,

138
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:30.580
the little fucking escape patch on the side of your head. Right?

139
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.620
So there's that difference in air pressure.

140
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:36.340
We all know high pressure always goes to low pressure and it takes the most

141
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:41.170
direct route, which is, you know, pushing against your fucking ear drum. Um,

142
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.680
and then when you land, it's the exact opposite. So when you're going up,

143
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:48.730
your ear drum is getting pushed out because the pressure is higher there.

144
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:53.020
And then when you land it becomes the opposite. I believe that's correct. Right?

145
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.870
Yeah, that's right. Cause as, as you go back down again,

146
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.790
the pressure becomes higher outside your ear. That's all that's going on. Um,

147
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.550
and you can't explain that to them, baby.

148
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.360
I was barely able to explain it to you. Um, so anyways,

149
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:16.740
she did great on the plane. She slept a lot. And then when she wasn't, you know,

150
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.640
I just got up and I was walking around with her and uh, you know,

151
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.280
the flight attendants loved them and who doesn't love a baby. Right.

152
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.100
And fortunately my daughter's like really cool.

153
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.380
She's got this thing where she just kinda like,

154
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.470
she's met so many people already that she's not freaked out by people.

155
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.340
So when she meets someone new, she just like, you know,

156
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:40.170
borderline in a rude way, just stares at them. And it takes a like a good,

157
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:43.870
like three minutes. And then eventually she's like, all right,

158
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.240
I get to this person is,

159
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:50.010
and then she smiles and then turns away into your chest. She gets a little shy.

160
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.780
Um, oh, would you look who's here? Will you look who's here?

161
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:59.040
And she gives me a wave and there she goes, you're going to come back out.

162
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.200
All right. Um, yeah,

163
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:08.910
so we able to do that and it wasn't that bad. And uh, this is kind of cool.

164
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:11.530
Like I'm a [inaudible] back in New York,

165
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.970
but the whole family makes doing the road way better.

166
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.530
I can tell you that now we just have to convince my wife to come along with me

167
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.030
with our daughter, woman. I go to like the not fun places.

168
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.940
He's given a shit about that, you know, she's always good to support me.

169
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.940
You know, when I go to a fun city, you know,

170
00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:38.650
but when I go to like fucking Jacksonville, Florida, I'm on my own, you know,

171
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.880
which is really bullshit because I have a lot of fun in that town. You know,

172
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:48.430
eat a little bit of alligator. You go to a gun range, why not? Anyways,

173
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.290
let's try and bring the energy up here. This is a fucking hard one to do.

174
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.810
It's hard to do. When I got to keep my voice down, you know. Um, anyways,

175
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.820
so I'm totally back into my New York vibe. You know,

176
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:01.170
I really missed what I had lived in.

177
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:05.100
The sense of living on the west coast is a really missed the yes network.

178
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.720
Um, when I lived here at 10 years ago,

179
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.650
I can't fucking believe that I've been in La for 10 fucking years. Um,

180
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.750
I used to always, you know,

181
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.190
I would watch the yes network and root against the Yankees.

182
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.340
That was like my shit. I never watched the mets.

183
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.730
I could never get into the fucking meds, but that's what I would do.

184
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.160
I would watch almost every single Yankee game as many of them as I could. Um,

185
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.220
or I'd watch the replays when I got home and I would just sit there and I would

186
00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:39.590
just root against them. But I mean, you had to watch them.

187
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:41.690
They were like this tour to $1 billion juggernaut.

188
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.360
And I used to always go to Yankee stadium.

189
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.230
I'd go by myself cause I lived on the east side. You'd just jump on the fucking,

190
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:49.730
what is that, the four, five, six,

191
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.270
take it right up to the Bronx old Yankee stadium,

192
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.570
which was actually renovated old Yankee stadium.

193
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.490
And I would sit in like the fucking upper deck for like 12 bucks and keep score

194
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.870
like an old man. And I used to watch Clemens and uh,

195
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.760
was it Mike Muse, Siena, that whole era. But I remember like in 1998, you know,

196
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.390
the 1998 Yankees, I got to go to a couple of a couple of games that year,

197
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:18.430
no one full well that I was watching what looked like was going to be one of the

198
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:21.940
great teams of all time. And you know, 20 years later I still believe that.

199
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.280
And um, but I used to fucking root against them, especially Clemons.

200
00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:30.400
I used to root against that guy hard. And um,

201
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.670
but so if I lived here once again,

202
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:37.600
I would be going to games because uh, now they got Aaron,

203
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:42.420
judge and I, Jesus' needy. Um,

204
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.900
you looking good. Um, anyways,

205
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.960
I used to always go up there and I would just root against it.

206
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:53.140
But now they got Aaron judge and even the Red Sox Fan,

207
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.290
you got to give it up to the fucking Yankees to the greatest franchise of all

208
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:58.330
time is as far as spotting talent.

209
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.180
Do you realize for basically the last 80 out of 100 years,

210
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.890
that'd be a century. Near a hundred years is a century.

211
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.680
You understand that? Huh? Well,

212
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:16.300
you clamming up where you going right now?

213
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.940
Okay. Um,

214
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.910
for the last 80 out of the last 100 years,

215
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.380
they have scouted and picked the guy.

216
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.530
There's no other fucking franchise out there that can say it. They fought okay.

217
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.980
They bought Babe Ruth. All right.

218
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.140
The Red Sox fucking owner was so goddamn pussy wet.

219
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.560
He had to keep his fucking wife quiet and she wanted to fucking,

220
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:50.650
I don't even know what the play was, you know,

221
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:55.420
but he needed to finance her fucking Broadway play to just shut her the fuck up.

222
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:59.320
And he sells babe Ruth. No excuse for that.

223
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.050
It's not like we didn't know who the fuck he was.

224
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.280
The guy was winning cy young awards and hitting the fucking zillion home runs,

225
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:10.930
and we still get rid of them because this fucking lady had to get a little tap

226
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:13.660
dance, fucking Fauci shit going right?

227
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.420
So they don't get credit for that one.

228
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.450
That was a dumb move by the fucking red sox and everybody knew the babe was the

229
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.960
shit. However, this is what they'd done for the last 80 fucking years.

230
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.300
All right. From their farm system,

231
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.540
they went Lou Gehrig to Joe Dimaggio to Mickey Mantle.

232
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.850
Right. Then June, then they added a little dip. George Steinbrenner comes in,

233
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.920
you know the Oakland A's don't want to pay anybody.

234
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:42.580
He buys the Fuckin Oakland A's. They went to championships. Fuck all of that.

235
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.400
And he buys Dave Winfield. Fuck all of that. A bad 2025 years in there.

236
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:52.010
Okay. Then fucking Derek Jeter,

237
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.690
I forgot. Oh wait, I forgot what's his face? Don Mattingly.

238
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.660
You know the reason why people don't look at him like he's one of the greatest,

239
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:01.340
cause he never won a fucking world series.

240
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.270
But don Mattingly to Derek Jeter,

241
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.380
to Aaron judge, you can argue with me on don Mattingly.

242
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:11.240
He wasn't quite one of the greats of the greats,

243
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:14.120
but like this fucking Aaron judges,

244
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:16.130
it's like Paul Bunyan's coming up to the plate,

245
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.440
six foot seven just did you see that whole money yet against Seattle the other

246
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.720
night? He almost fucking hit it out of the stadium.

247
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.560
You're not supposed to be able to do that. He hit it so hard, so fucking far.

248
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.480
They, they, they, they could measure it.

249
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.690
I think these are like 440 feet, which, you know,

250
00:15:33.691 --> 00:15:35.340
I've heard of shit going farther, but it's like,

251
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:40.350
that's just cause the stop top of the stadium stopped it. Um,

252
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.280
Jesus, oh, Seattle pitches get lit up, don't they?

253
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.600
Do you ever see that one McGuire hit off of Randy Johnson?

254
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.940
You almost put a hole in the roof of the fucking kingdom. Um, yeah.

255
00:15:53.941 --> 00:15:55.780
That was a brutal combination of like,

256
00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:00.480
like a hundred mile an hour pitch meeting. Fucking Andrew Steam,

257
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.610
whatever the fuck he was on. Um,

258
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.750
if you're old enough to remember what it was like to watch a roided up

259
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:15.590
professional athlete hitting baseballs and watching that fucking laser show that

260
00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:19.350
those guys put on, I don't think you can argue

261
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.940
that steroids definitely should be in the game. They'd to be like,

262
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.710
all they gotta do is just work on the side effects and just get it down.

263
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:33.830
Just like weed. You know you've got the, at the vaporizer.

264
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.820
Just if they can like vape arise like steroids.

265
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.140
Can you imagine that we pull a muscle or whatever the fuck you feel like an old

266
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:42.500
man.

267
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.500
He'd just just breathe in that missed you fucking muscles repair like a goddamn

268
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.860
x man and every day feels like the first day of spring.

269
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.460
Oh my God. Am I spending Tony Bennett every,

270
00:16:55.461 --> 00:17:00.461
if I ruled the world every day would be like the first day of spring.

271
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.450
So they'd done it at like [inaudible] with Aaron judge. I just had that,

272
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.730
that's the greatest fucking franchise of all time is far as their ability to see

273
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:19.280
the guy. No, the guy is the guy. And somehow sign them before anybody else.

274
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:20.540
I don't know how the fuck they do it.

275
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.510
Like how does everybody else miss out on Aaron? Judge.

276
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.590
I could see missing out in Derek Jeter. You know,

277
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.700
I could definitely see that he was a kid, you know, and another six, three, six,

278
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:34.460
four fucking guy. I mean this a zillion of those,

279
00:17:34.461 --> 00:17:39.461
but a six foot seven guy coming up there like the fucking jolly green giant.

280
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:44.330
Like how do you miss that guy somehow everybody does. Um,

281
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.490
I know there's probably some people out there arguing for the Lakers and I got

282
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.920
to give respect to the Lakers as,

283
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.830
as in my lifetime from 1968 until now,

284
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.160
the Los Angeles Lakers have won more championships than anybody else in my

285
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:00.360
lifetime. Believe it or not, it is the Lakers,

286
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:03.210
they won a c they won like one in the 70s.

287
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.730
Five in the 80s. That's a, that's six.

288
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.720
And then they won.

289
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.073
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

290
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.700
<v 1>they want five with Colby and a thousand fucking free agents.</v>

291
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.220
Um, so that's 11.

292
00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.960
<v 0>And, uh,</v>

293
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.480
<v 1>the only person that comes close to that in my lifetime would be the Canadians</v>

294
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.340
where they wanted 68, 69,

295
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:31.341
71737670770 870-NINE-8Y-69TY three they want 10.

296
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:40.110
Um, [inaudible] anyways, but I don't kind of like the Lakers,

297
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.003
like

298
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.300
the real story of the Los Angeles Lakers is fucking free agents. You know,

299
00:18:46.301 --> 00:18:47.134
like when they always stay,

300
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.140
we just try to get someone to join and become part of the history of the Great

301
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.870
Lakers centers in every one of them is a fucking free agent except for the first

302
00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:58.540
giant white dude that George, whatever the fuck his name was,

303
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.310
I'm going to send mirror son. What the fuck was that guy's name? I don't know.

304
00:19:03.311 --> 00:19:07.480
He looked like a giant science teacher and he actually played with Minneapolis.

305
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.130
Mike in the fuck was his name. I can't remember. Anyways,

306
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.450
then you got Kareem, he was a Milwaukee Buck, right.

307
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.520
Shaq, like they're all just fucking, you know, wilt,

308
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.140
they're all just from someplace else.

309
00:19:24.141 --> 00:19:28.490
So I have a bad feeling that fucking Lebron James is going to go out there and

310
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:30.080
that the Lakers are eventually,

311
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:31.583
<v 0>you know,</v>

312
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.360
<v 1>despite whatever Danny Ainge does, I just think it's inevitable that the Lakers,</v>

313
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.630
it will pass the Celtics as far as number of championships because for the

314
00:19:43.631 --> 00:19:47.140
simple fact, we cannot offer what the Lakers can offer.

315
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.000
I've said this before, like this is our pitch. Hey, you know,

316
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.740
do you want to come to racist Boston with Shitty fucking weather and Bang sixes

317
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.540
or do you want to go to racist fucking Los Angeles,

318
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.250
fuck movie stars and feel like you're in Hawaii with the weather.

319
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.740
You know what I mean? We can, we can't fucking compete with that.

320
00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.730
We can't compete with that. So that's, that's fucking it. Now, you know,

321
00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:19.120
and then like our colors, you know, our fucking mascots, a Goddamn Leprechaun.

322
00:20:19.121 --> 00:20:23.260
I mean we just can't get any wider. The Lakers have like, you know,

323
00:20:23.261 --> 00:20:26.320
you know the, the colors is somebody that has no money but they want,

324
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:28.270
they want to fucking look like they're doing something.

325
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:29.683
<v 0>That's fine.</v>

326
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.220
<v 1>That's what the Lakers colors up with the gold. And the purple,</v>

327
00:20:37.221 --> 00:20:40.190
you know what I mean? The Lakers just screamed new money.

328
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.120
Like you remember when you used to watch those MTV cribs and you'd watch some

329
00:20:44.121 --> 00:20:46.070
fucking idiot, you know,

330
00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:50.470
with the giant fucking need to have like a fish tank in his fireplace. You know,

331
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:54.910
yet the fire still works on, you know, like those, you look at that shit,

332
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.220
you're like, this guy's going to go fucking broke in.

333
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.670
This guy's going to go pro.

334
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.300
Like he's got like 20 people hanging out in his fucking house.

335
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.410
This guy's going to go broke. That's when I look at the Lakers uniform.

336
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.990
That's what I see. Especially those old road ones, those purple ones.

337
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.630
Um, I dunno, I always thought that their uniforms were a little silly.

338
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.290
I liked the home ones, but the road ones always looked really silly to me. Um,

339
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.390
but anyways, where I was for just like, you know, green and white,

340
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:30.040
we gotta fucking, Oh, a topic. Oman until, yeah, fucking mascot.

341
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.620
I mean, I can't imagine what Danny Ainge has to say to people to try to get them

342
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.480
to come to Boston. No, no, no, no.

343
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.160
The n word that was shouted at a red sox game this year. Not at a Celtics game.

344
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.810
It's fucking brutal. Um, having said that though,

345
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:52.870
I feel like the cops in La beat the shit out of black people way more.

346
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:56.560
I don't know. It's a push as far as like the racism, it's a real,

347
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.810
it's a push. You know,

348
00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:02.080
people always sit there and they try to act like all the racism is in the south

349
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:04.420
and in Boston. But you go out to la, it's fucking ridiculous.

350
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:09.130
They got all the black people quarantined, you know, in this little area.

351
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.780
That's coincidentally enough, final approach for fucking lax.

352
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:16.600
They got goddamned jets flying over their fucking heads every day,

353
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.250
fucking 500 feet off the fucking ground for runways all day long.

354
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.910
People just landing on final fucking approach. You know,

355
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.370
that wouldn't make you fucking be in a certain mood. I know what would make, um,

356
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.290
anyways, let me read a little bit of advertising here.

357
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.000
I know my stomach is grumbling here.

358
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:41.080
This always happens when I have the fucking, uh, the recording here.

359
00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:44.790
So I'm on my fucking, I have acting work diets so I don't, uh,

360
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.810
I go 12 hours without from the last time I ate and ate about 10 o'clock last

361
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:52.360
night. Something and have to deal with the grumbling and the grumbling here.

362
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.950

394
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.010
but Dava Dubbo, I don't know.

395

I'm fucking white and I could do whatever I want. I'm

396

sorry, I just woke up. I haven't had my fucking cereal yet. Um,

397
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.110

410
00:26:08.111 --> 00:26:11.820
you feel a little spring in your step. Same thing except it's with your Dick.

in their 50s?

418
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.070
That all sounds like late eighties shit that was spray painted onto somebody's

419
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.730

That usually helps with the comedy if he can hear yourself.

430
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:33.180
I don't know what it is. You kind of need to hear yourself. Hang on a second.

I gotta get a cause here. All right, there we go. Now we're back.

463
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.880
Bo and I'll else that I want to talk about.

464
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.590
I Dunno if I have anything else to talk about. Too busy stressing out,

465
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.160
getting picked

466
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.060
<v 1>up by the sad van, the sad van that always takes you to this set.</v>

467
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.100
It's a bare bones van.

468
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:52.810
It's always white with either gray or black vinyl interior.

469
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.790
And you just get in there and you're just like, I don't know.

470
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.990
I find it very stressful, this acting shit, you know what I mean?

471
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.000
Um, because I never could just focus on the day.

472
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:07.750
I always look at it like I'm always looking at the entire shoe.

473
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.750
Like I've already thought like, you know, you know,

474
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.870
this time next week I'll be done. You know,

475
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.060
rather than trying to enjoy it.

476
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.690
So I learned a long time ago,

477
00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.440
but I can't say I learned it cause I'm still stressing about it.

478
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:25.930
But I've just kind of learned to be like, okay, you know,

479
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.300
I am just going to just fucking deal with today when it comes to these acting

480
00:30:31.301 --> 00:30:32.140
gigs and just be like,

481
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:37.060
we are doing this scene and I've got to make these choices and this is what I'm

482
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.540
going to do and I'm going to listen to the fucking director if he wants it this

483
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:43.750
way, I'll do it that way and bucket that [inaudible] and then that'll be it.

484
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.320
And then I'll go home and then I'll memorize the lines for the next day and then

485
00:30:47.321 --> 00:30:48.850
I'll just fucking do that. And I just,

486
00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:51.760
rather than fucking looking over the horizon,

487
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.080
just dealing with that fucking day, you know? I know that sounds fucking weird,

488
00:30:56.081 --> 00:31:00.730
but that's how I have to do it. Cause if I don't do it that way, then I, I, uh,

489
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.250
you know what I mean?

490
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.230
It's the kind of thing that stops you from fucking looking at your taxes,

491
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.353
you know what I mean?

492
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.940
If you're incorporated and you play like quarterly taxes and shit, you know,

493
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.710
or refute. If you don't pay quarterly,

494
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.990
you got like the end of the years I fucking,

495
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.110
I ended up every month I get my receipts together, I get everything.

496
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.760
It fucking sucks but only sucks for like an hour, you know what I mean?

497
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:29.020
As opposed to waiting the entire fucking year and it takes like three days to

498
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:31.150
get through this shit. Um,

499
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:35.550
it also lets me know what the fuck I'm spending and um,

500
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.820
and all of that type of ship. So did that make any sense?

501
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:41.320
Cause it didn't even make sense to me. All right.

502
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.990
Why don't I just get out of this shit and I'm just going to read a few of these

503
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:47.740
questions, a couple of these questions. All right. On the arm.

504
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:49.091
All right,

505
00:31:49.091 --> 00:31:51.970
for those of you who listen to this podcast religiously or maybe cut the last

506
00:31:51.971 --> 00:31:53.620
one. Um,

507
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.880
I was asking like how that expression came about cause I brought it up in the

508
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.840
writer's room. I use a fourF is for family. I was talking about a,

509
00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.180
it's on the arm and it lose a number of people that had never heard that

510
00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:09.910
expression. And I said, well, it means, yeah, it means it's free.

511
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.440
You don't have to pay for it. Um, and then when I was looking it up,

512
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:17.890
trying to figure out where it came from, it said it was a, a m

513
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.060
it came from like law enforcement or whatever.

514
00:32:22.061 --> 00:32:25.180
But evidently I was wrong cause someone else went to another part of the

515
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:28.180
Internet and they came up with this. It said, Bill,

516
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.230
here's what the internet said about on the arm or is what you found that it

517
00:32:33.231 --> 00:32:33.551
said,

518
00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:36.730
because what I found that has said was above those from came from the fucking

519
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.250
law enforcement eat this person, uh,

520
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:45.080
<v 2>to show their respects to the mafia boss who protected their neighborhood.</v>

521
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.800
Um, or fear of being extorted.

522
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.540
The store owners would not allow them to pay for items. Well,

523
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:55.520
if you're afraid that you're going to be extorted,

524
00:32:55.521 --> 00:32:57.660
I don't think that like bowing down to somebody.

525
00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:01.700
You should make them fucking pay for it, I would think. But anyways, um,

526
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:06.350
the store owners would take their right hand and brush it against their left arm

527
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.760
as a way of saying, forget about it. No charge free.

528
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.590
All right. Well where I looked at it that it came from,

529
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.640
it came from law enforcement. The the cops wouldn't pay for stuff. I don't know.

530
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:24.440
You get me. Who the fuck knows? It's the Internet. You don't know what's true.

531
00:33:24.441 --> 00:33:28.600
You don't know what isn't right. How far did you look?

532
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.520
How far onto the Internet did you go?

533
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.630
I'm going to see how far it took me to get. Okay. On the arm here we go.

534
00:33:34.631 --> 00:33:36.160
On the arm

535
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.470
origin.

536
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

537
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:46.480
<v 2>Come on in. Come on. Internet work for me on the arm. Any idea do was origin.</v>

538
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.490
Is it that the police might have threatened with his gun?

539
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:55.060
I doubt it but I'm just trying to figure out this is what I get.

540
00:33:55.061 --> 00:33:59.210
That's the first one. The first one.

541
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.410
It's just one of these.

542
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.770
What are these fucking chat rooms by the way and who and who are these people in

543
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.000
him? Where are these things? How do you chime into these things?

544
00:34:10.001 --> 00:34:10.960
You get to sign in on,

545
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:16.350
I'm on like word reference.com and this guy just writes or this woman writes,

546
00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:20.290
hi there. I heard the phrase on the arm in the movie,

547
00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:22.930
Donnie Brasco about a Mafia guy,

548
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.620
Al Buccino as an undercover policeman. Parentheses,

549
00:34:26.621 --> 00:34:28.840
Johnny Depp is their movie. That old,

550
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.300
he could've just said fucking Donnie Brasco people that was in it.

551
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.530
I learned that it's police lingo for free of charge.

552
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.600
Any idea as to its origin?

553
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:41.440
Is it that the policemen might have threatened with his gun?

554
00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.360
I doubted, but I'm just trying to figure the arm in there.

555
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.470
Wait, why would you present a theory and then doubt your own fucking theory?

556
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.903
<v 0>Um,</v>

557
00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.160
<v 2>it was what the People's response was.</v>

558
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.150
Okay. Dictionary georeference reference somebody who has this click on this arm.

559
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

560
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.710
<v 2>The upper limb of the human body, especially part extending from the shoulder</v>

561
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.680
up. There was a series, the upper limb from the show you the formula,

562
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:22.070
the verb base, any arm like attachment

563
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:30.410
and administrative or operational branch of an organization and arm and a leg is

564
00:35:30.971 --> 00:35:34.600
a great deal of money. Ah, arm and arm,

565
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.950
arms linked together and arms length on the arm,

566
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.980
a slang free of charge.

567
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.000
And investigation of policemen who ate lunch on the arm.

568
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.390
Uh, put the arm on to solicit or borrow money from.

569
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.960
She put the arm on me for a generous contribution to force or use violence on

570
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.710
you strung up. I, you know what, I don't even give a shit.

571
00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:04.140
This is what happened. By the time it gets to this part of the Internet,

572
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.490
it's like I don't fucking care.

573
00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.910
And there's usually something I can click on in this side. Like,

574
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.920
oh look at Tyson. Keep it real. Keep it Tyson. Check them out.

575
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:15.660
I guess it's some sort of fucking lunch meat.

576
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.160
Luxury now what about me fucking I guess cause it's on the arm.

577
00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:22.050
Like they think somebody wants a free sandwich.

578
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.200
Catch it at a store near you.

579
00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.490
Some giant fish. Oh, where do the day Highfalutin.

580
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.630
That's a word I thought that was just something you s you send me sandwich.

581
00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:39.920
Say Dag burn. Highfalutin. Varmint um,

582
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.500
Dominic was at the back at a back table talking to a suited man in the som Bray

583
00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:47.923
in the somber,

584
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.630
Highfalutin English she put on for four people of stature.

585
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.220
Oh, it's like Madonna in this case. Probably the noodle salesman.

586
00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.500
I have no idea what that sentence meant.

587
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:04.610
And I probably mispronounced most of it, but Donna puts on the fake accent,

588
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.001
you know,

589
00:37:05.001 --> 00:37:07.820
why does she not act like she's just some white trash chick from Detroit?

590
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.800
She got that stupid English accent now. Uh,

591
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.320
[inaudible] still love it. Some. All right.

592
00:37:15.321 --> 00:37:18.380
Solution to dude's girlfriend with the gross teeth. Oh my God.

593
00:37:18.381 --> 00:37:22.010
Well this fucking story ever end. Hey Billy,

594
00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:25.370
ginger Vidas ah, that's a clever one.

595
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.960
I found a real easy solution for the dudes that's,

596
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.450
that's dating the girl with gross teeth. Yes. So did I dumper?

597
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.130
All you gotta do is when you're sitting down to watch a movie just happened to

598
00:37:37.131 --> 00:37:38.840
put on Austin Powers.

599
00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:42.620
There's a couple of different scenes where the woman,

600
00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.390
Austin is trying to bang,

601
00:37:44.391 --> 00:37:48.800
hint hints that Austin needs to brush his gross fucking teeth.

602
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:54.320
This would be a good subtle way for a girl to realize that maybe she should take

603
00:37:54.321 --> 00:37:58.670
care of her own teeth because believe me, she knows they're disgusting.

604
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:05.010
W W who walks around know that they stink when should do something about that.

605
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.550
And plus, I don't think that, you know,

606
00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.930
if you're with somebody who's overweight, if you put it on the clumps, you know,

607
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.820
the nutty professor. I mean,

608
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:18.390
I think it'll just make them feel self conscious and bad about themselves and

609
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:21.450
make the, the overweight person want to go fucking binge eat more.

610
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.710
I don't know what the gross tooth person does. I go eat some fucking

611
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.960
fucking head cheese with a, I don't know, some onions. I Dunno. Anyways,

612
00:38:30.961 --> 00:38:34.020
he said you could maybe even say something during the scene like, yeah,

613
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:36.730
why do British t people have gross teeth?

614
00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:38.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

615
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.730
<v 2>He goes, I don't know. Probably won't work, but it's worth the try.</v>

616
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.170
Is this everybody just shits on their own theories. Yeah. Dude, this won't work.

617
00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.900
You know, it won't work, but it was worth it for your Billy ginger Vidas there.

618
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.500
Uh, also built, uh, have you been doing any grilling or smoking this summer?

619
00:38:56.501 --> 00:39:00.310
I recently did some smoked chicken wings and they were the best wings I've ever

620
00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.760
ate. Hands down. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. No, my,

621
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.520
<v 1>my, uh, my grill,</v>

622
00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.530
my big green egg and my flat top grill have been like,

623
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:16.880
you know, if they were a car, I'd have them up on blocks right now. I just been,

624
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.630
um, so swamped with the work,

625
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.840
um, you know, and I get the kid and it's just like,

626
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.120
I dunno, I occasionally I will crank the thing up and I get into it,

627
00:39:32.121 --> 00:39:36.690
but I'm a bit spent super, super fucking busy writing, writing and writing,

628
00:39:36.691 --> 00:39:41.510
but I go taste sentiment. I actually really enjoy writing. Like, um,

629
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.720
I like, I hate the notes part and having to pull it apart.

630
00:39:46.721 --> 00:39:48.090
I get frustrated with that, but that's,

631
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.520
<v 2>it really is part of it. And people always goes, well, you know what they say?</v>

632
00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.660
Writing is rewriting. And I always want to be like, yeah. Is that what they say?

633
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.050
<v 1>She said No.</v>

634
00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.600
<v 2>Like, whatever the fuck he do for a living. Can you imagine if you just fucking,</v>

635
00:40:00.601 --> 00:40:01.140
if you feel,

636
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.220
if you put in floors and you put it in all the floors and then somebody comes in

637
00:40:05.221 --> 00:40:09.310
and tells you to rip up most of it, you know, and you're like, really? And Yeah,

638
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.450
you know what flooring is? Flooring is re flooring.

639
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.200
Once you want to just take the board and just fucking smash your own head in

640
00:40:15.201 --> 00:40:16.690
with it too. You just weren't consciously,

641
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.970
you wouldn't have to live that life anymore. Well, that's the life of a writer.

642
00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.880
<v 1>But I actually, uh,</v>

643
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.070
I really find that I like doing it and I think just by hanging out with, uh,

644
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.920
all of these writers that have been doing it for so long,

645
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.790
obviously they're way better at it than I am, but you just kind of,

646
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.460
<v 3>okay.</v>

647
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.690
<v 2>Start to absorb.</v>

648
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

649
00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.260
<v 1>How to write stories and shit like that, which was always my problem.</v>

650
00:40:43.261 --> 00:40:44.550
I could always write dialogue,

651
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:48.120
but I just couldn't get the story from the beginning to the end.

652
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:53.190
Like my brain just didn't work that way. I could write scenes.

653
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.670
I think that's why I became a comedian because I bits like, oh, look at that.

654
00:40:56.671 --> 00:40:59.310
That's a funny joke. That's a funny little scenario and done.

655
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.370
I don't have to fucking take the ball from the one yard line all the way to the

656
00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:06.900
end zone like, like writers have to, you know, I was on special teams.

657
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.190
I was a wedge breaker.

658
00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:11.683
<v 2>That was it.</v>

659
00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.100
That was the fucking level of artistry that I was doing there.

660
00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.280
What am I up to here? 41 minutes out. Jesus Christ.

661
00:41:19.281 --> 00:41:23.990
Bill 41 minutes of fucking mediocrity. All right. Microchipping.

662
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.630
Oh God. Don't even get me started on this.

663
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:28.770
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

664
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.510
<v 1>I just cannot fucking but like,</v>

665
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.380
<v 3>okay,</v>

666
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.030
<v 1>I just can't fucking believe this shit.</v>

667
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.680
Do you know Delta Airlines wants to start using people's fingerprints?

668
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:45.310
It's a way for you to get on the fucking plane and do you know that most people

669
00:41:45.311 --> 00:41:48.520
won't have a problem with it? This so fucking stupid.

670
00:41:48.521 --> 00:41:51.940
It's like there's so many people out in the world. It's almost like,

671
00:41:51.941 --> 00:41:55.630
you know what, dude? Why don't you just become a fucking slave? Like,

672
00:41:55.631 --> 00:41:57.400
how much are you going to give to these people?

673
00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.930
How underpaid are politicians that they will not stand up to these people,

674
00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.570
these corporations, I swear to God,

675
00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:08.290
they sitting there wasting all this fucking time with Isis and all this other

676
00:42:08.291 --> 00:42:10.820
bullshit. These fucking corporations, the mothers,

677
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.810
the shit that they're doing to their own goddamn country man,

678
00:42:13.811 --> 00:42:16.780
which they really don't have because they're fucking global.

679
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:21.730
They don't give a shit about anything about just trying to make more fucking

680
00:42:21.731 --> 00:42:26.230
money and they want, they're going to start microchip and people.

681
00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:27.290
This Wisconsin,

682
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:32.290
Wisconsin Company to implant Mike Implant microchips in employees

683
00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.310
and likes like five people already agreed to it.

684
00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.760
They're going to take something foreign that's not natural to your body and

685
00:42:39.761 --> 00:42:41.890
they're going to stick it underneath your fucking skin.

686
00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.970
They're going to know where you are at all fucking times and all these fucking

687
00:42:45.971 --> 00:42:49.050
dope blue hair. You know? [inaudible]

688
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.300
problem is the fucking problem. Okay?

689
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:57.390
Just because you're a fucking dope doesn't mean the rest of the world is okay.

690
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.720
I think it's safe to say that me and everybody else listening to this thing,

691
00:43:01.721 --> 00:43:06.400
for the most part was not as smart, is fucking George Washington. Right?

692
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.310
Fair enough. Okay, well, here's the deal.

693
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.610
If George Washington was microchipped and all his fucking buddies were

694
00:43:12.611 --> 00:43:13.360
microchipped,

695
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.350
this fucking country wouldn't exist because he would've known where he was.

696
00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.750
They would've gone over there and they would have fucking killed him.

697
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.670
And that would've been the end of the fucking rebellion.

698
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.041
So what you're doing is,

699
00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:26.890
is you're having faith that these fucking people at the top who have not even

700
00:43:26.891 --> 00:43:30.220
remotely demonstrated on any fucking level at any point in history,

701
00:43:30.221 --> 00:43:34.410
that they give a flying fuck about anybody other than themselves are gonna.

702
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.400
You're going to turn over that level of power.

703
00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.670
You're gonna get fingerprinted by Delta fucking airlines.

704
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:44.500
Like you've committed some sort of a fucking crime and fucking airline is going

705
00:43:44.501 --> 00:43:48.460
to have your fucking fingerprints. Who in the fuck did they think they are?

706
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.540
Do you know what I want to buy my car? They asked for my thumbprint. I was like,

707
00:43:52.541 --> 00:43:56.990
I'm not getting my fucking fingerprints to you're a car dealership. They legal.

708
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.990
This is to protect you. No, it isn't get Douche.

709
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:02.650
You're going to sell this to somebody. It's part of my profile.

710
00:44:02.651 --> 00:44:04.150
I think they just, they're collecting,

711
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.660
they're all sharing information about you, what you buy, where you live,

712
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.750
what your social security number is. You fucking fingerprints.

713
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.030
They're going to get it all the way down to your fucking DNA.

714
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.850
It's an it's, I dunno.

715
00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:18.930
<v 3>Okay.</v>

716
00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:23.730
<v 1>And these politicians will not push back on any level because the president</v>

717
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.200
makes 500 grand a year.

718
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.190
That's the highest paid political office is 500 fucking grand a year.

719
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.540
And they need $100 million. Get the job. I don't have 100 million.

720
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.350
You don't have 100 million corporations do. And that's who they all were too.

721
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:40.200
So they just look the other fucking way. And what do they do?

722
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:43.970
They sit there and they shit on fucking comedians constantly going up to do you

723
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.830
hear what he said about Caitlyn Jenner and they look the other way with

724
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:49.680
pharmaceutical companies handing out fucking opiates.

725
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:52.440
Like they've given out flyers to some sort of jam band.

726
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.200
And now we've got this heroin fucking problem. They don't give a fuck.

727
00:44:55.201 --> 00:45:00.180
They don't say anything about it. Sorry. I know I'm fucking losing my shit here.

728
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:01.014
But like,

729
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:03.783
<v 3>okay,</v>

730
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:07.690
<v 1>what they've done to the food supply, what the fuck they,</v>

731
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:11.230
they that what the bankers have done left all these people upside down in their

732
00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:14.050
own fucking houses. What they've done to the water supply,

733
00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.490
fracking causing earthquakes in parts of the world that never had fucking

734
00:45:18.491 --> 00:45:20.980
earthquakes. Fucking up the drinking water.

735
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

736
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.890
<v 1>You know,</v>

737
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.190
they got to send a fucking pipeline under the fucking native Americans land.

738
00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:29.490
I mean, like, like we haven't done enough to those fucking people.

739
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.860
You know? Do you hear any politicians talking about that now?

740
00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.320
Nobody talks about that shit. But God for fucking bid,

741
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.010
you'd do a fucking joke in a strip mall and it fucking all over it.

742
00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.090
Then that becomes like some big goddamn story. Um,

743
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.550
this is fucking horrific and it makes me happy that I'm 49 years of age.

744
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.500
The fact that I think I'm going to maybe get to live half a fucking century

745
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:55.430
without a fucking airline having my fingerprints and me walking around with the

746
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.490
goddamn microchip. You know, I love that.

747
00:45:58.491 --> 00:46:02.600
I lived 50 years before the fucking oh Jesus, she's up. Huh.

748
00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.360
Um, I love that it got to live 50 years before robots showed up.

749
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:13.120
Um, it's just,

750
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.650
it's just greed and power. Completely.

751
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.590
100% out of control.

752
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:25.000
And I hate like this is, I'm reading this,

753
00:46:25.001 --> 00:46:29.290
this is eye witness ABC News. So these guys are all bought and paid for.

754
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.890
CNN is bought and paid for a Fox News is bought and paypal,

755
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.490
they're all fucking bought and paid for because the same people I just brought

756
00:46:36.491 --> 00:46:39.370
brought up, they advertise on their fucking networks.

757
00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.350
So they have to watch what they say

758
00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.440
cause they don't want to lose the ad money cause that's how they get paid.

759
00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.940
Right. So they always have like the, oh Geez, this is a little unsettling.

760
00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:51.380
You know when they always come back from it,

761
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.350
when they show some fucking robot and you've ever seen that and watched the

762
00:46:54.351 --> 00:46:59.090
local news or they show somebody getting microchip and they always come back to

763
00:46:59.091 --> 00:47:01.760
the anchors and they kind of do that, Ooh, that's kind of a,

764
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.240
and then they just move on to the next thing.

765
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.450
But some fucking old lady who makes her own jam,

766
00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:11.450
like that's supposed to make you feel better at the end of the fucking newscast

767
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:16.400
or some puppy that they thought was lost and fucking sniffed its way back to the

768
00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:20.300
station wagon, three towns away, right? Whenever the fuck they leave you on.

769
00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.900
Um, no.

770
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:27.510
Corporations are completely out of control.

771
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:29.980
They've been out of control entire life

772
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.721
<v 2>and now it's,</v>

773
00:47:30.721 --> 00:47:35.110
it's reaching a level that it's like you're watching a bad scifi movie.

774
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:38.260
I think it's fucking insane. Why?

775
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:42.190
Why the fuck do you need my fingerprints as a fucking airline?

776
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:46.060
Who the fuck are you? You're not the FBI. You're not the government.

777
00:47:46.061 --> 00:47:47.260
You're fucking airline

778
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:52.970
your fingerprints. And this is the thing people will do.

779
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:57.350
People will fucking do all of this. So they don't have to stand in a line

780
00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:01.060
bill, let them scan their fucking retina.

781
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.920
They'll give them a fucking baby just so they can be pretty checked.

782
00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:08.720
That's all you gotta do.

783
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:12.370
You just hold a little cookie out and the average fucking mouth breathe and

784
00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:15.200
fucking more. But you know something. I go, I swear to God.

785
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:16.560
I mean this is really cynical, but I,

786
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:20.120
you walk around and I forget half the fucking people should be microchipped.

787
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.550
You should know where these fucking idiots are.

788
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.040
<v 0>That's that. That's that. Yeah.</v>

789
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.920
<v 2>I'll never forget that guy gallop in sideways on that Trump rally screaming at</v>

790
00:48:32.581 --> 00:48:36.510
all these stupid liberals. Go and fuck political correctness. Build the wall,

791
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.260
build the wall is he's fucking Gallup and like,

792
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.760
like that was gonna make his life better.

793
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:46.560
Like that was what was holding him back. I swear to God,

794
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.833
<v 0>like,</v>

795
00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.560
<v 2>I don't give a fuck how dumb you are.</v>

796
00:48:52.561 --> 00:48:56.580
You have to know as a white dude if you were born in the United States of

797
00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.413
America, okay,

798
00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:02.040
you're not going to get a better starting block than that.

799
00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:07.290
All right? And if you can't figure out some sort of gay, I mean,

800
00:49:07.291 --> 00:49:10.260
if you're going to fucking blame anybody, why are you going to look down?

801
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.620
You got to go up. That's what's fucking you over.

802
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.240
Democrats and Republicans fucking you over.

803
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:24.370
I just don't get how people don't see that. Um, but I'm like most people,

804
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:27.210
I feel like my ideas are right and no one else has a good point.

805
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:31.883
<v 0>Um,</v>

806
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.790
<v 2>unreal. This fucking car dealership, can we get your thumbprint? It's like,</v>

807
00:49:35.791 --> 00:49:40.350
yeah, no, you guys sell cars. Do you understand that?

808
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.970
You guys lie for a living?

809
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:47.070
Other salesman who lie for a living turn the other way.

810
00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.120
You let you turn the other way. When they see a car salesman you like to add

811
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.430
you like the bottom of the barrel fucking salesman here.

812
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.690
I'm going to give you my fingerprint.

813
00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.670
You know why they said they wanted my fingerprint?

814
00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.200
They go just in case somebody comes in and tries to,

815
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.210
<v 3>okay.</v>

816
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.390
<v 2>Is An impostor and pretends that they're you and tries to buy a car.</v>

817
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.180
And I just looked at the guy and I was like, you know what?

818
00:50:09.181 --> 00:50:10.750
I'm going to take my chances on that.

819
00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:17.590
<v 0>Okay, did</v>

820
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.650
<v 2>the guy literally goes, this is what killed me. He goes,</v>

821
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:25.240
you're the first person we've ever have say no to that.

822
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.010
Now I hope he's just being a car salesman.

823
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:31.640
And he was lying to me and that was his last ditch effort to try to convince me.

824
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:34.423
<v 0>Um,</v>

825
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.640
<v 2>but the other part is actually telling the truth. It's just like,</v>

826
00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.040
then what happens is what?

827
00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.720
This is how they do it is most people are adults.

828
00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:47.920
So they don't think,

829
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:51.400
and then what happens is it becomes a herd mentality and all they gotta do is

830
00:50:51.401 --> 00:50:54.880
get most of the herd to start running over the fucking cliff. And you,

831
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.220
you have to do it too. Cause if you don't,

832
00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:01.480
then you're just going to be fucking sitting there all by yourself. Like, Hey,

833
00:51:01.481 --> 00:51:03.880
I'm not gonna have a cell phone. Hey, I'm not going to have this.

834
00:51:03.881 --> 00:51:06.610
I'm not going to have that. And then your life,

835
00:51:06.611 --> 00:51:09.070
the way you're going to lead it becomes extremely limited.

836
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.330
And next thing you know,

837
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.680
you're fucking half naked walking around your backyard trying to s like trap

838
00:51:14.681 --> 00:51:15.450
squirrels,

839
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:19.870
seek and eat that day because you're not doing what everybody else is doing and

840
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:26.920
it's just, you know, it's going to be the worst is when they try to convince,

841
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.333
<v 0>uh,</v>

842
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.380
<v 2>when they tried to convince people to do it right.</v>

843
00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:36.100
There's going to be some politician getting it with that fucking smile on his

844
00:51:36.101 --> 00:51:39.130
face where he's like, I don't want to do this but I have to do this.

845
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:44.290
I have to do this so I can go on the post president fucking,

846
00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:45.880
you know,

847
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.800
$70 million speaking tour where I go out and I give speeches to the same fucking

848
00:51:50.801 --> 00:51:55.300
people that put me into office. Like the hero of all hero presidents.

849
00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:56.870
Obama is about to do. He just,

850
00:51:56.871 --> 00:52:01.720
he has that motherfucker has $69 million with the gigs on the books

851
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.870
<v 0>coming up. You know,</v>

852
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.320
<v 2>I will never, for the life of me understand why that guy,</v>

853
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.730
people look like liberals.

854
00:52:10.731 --> 00:52:14.300
Look at that guy like he fucking did something for him. I will never get that.

855
00:52:14.301 --> 00:52:17.990
It's like that guy had his face in the pig trough just like everybody else.

856
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:20.950
I mean, I dunno. I Dunno what it is.

857
00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:25.000
I think it's because he's sandwiched between two of the worst public speakers of

858
00:52:25.001 --> 00:52:28.330
all time, Bush and fucking Trump. You know what I mean?

859
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.630
I think if he came after Clinton where Clinton wasn't the greatest, Whoa, whoa,

860
00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:35.110
whoa, Whoa, whoa. But he got enough. The women fucking loved them.

861
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:40.060
I will never get that either. How much women love that fucking big fucking baby?

862
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:45.100
He, we look at goofball. Uhm, Jesus Boulder or any presidency you liked?

863
00:52:45.101 --> 00:52:46.330
Yeah, I lied in mind.

864
00:52:46.331 --> 00:52:51.190
The first George Bush fucking war hero and I liked, uh,

865
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:55.610
I liked Jimmy Carter. Um, anyways. All right.

866
00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:57.290
B of a outage.

867
00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:59.183
<v 0>Uh,</v>

868
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:04.430
<v 2>hey banker bill. I work for B of a and from the customer service side,</v>

869
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.870
that outrage was very stressful. If you haven't already mentioned it.

870
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:11.450
Slash found out the outrage was a result

871
00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.203
<v 0>of a,</v>

872
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.650
<v 2>Oh, Jesus Christ. This guy works for the fucking bank. He's going to,</v>

873
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:20.220
he's going to tell me what happened. And you can't even spell the words were,

874
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:24.780
I don't, I don't know. You wrote half a word here, buddy.

875
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.470
S. E. V. E. R a sever reboot.

876
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.030
Is that supposed to be a severe reboot is several word. I don't know.

877
00:53:33.031 --> 00:53:37.640
Maybe I'm wrong. Uh, I was told from my boss, my boss,

878
00:53:37.641 --> 00:53:40.800
his boss in passing, when he was leaving work,

879
00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:45.360
one of the tech guys managing the server ran a program to check for viruses and

880
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:48.000
shit. Okay. This guy manages your money,

881
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:51.260
checked for viruses and Shit and oh God.

882
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.650
He talks like me and the program

883
00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:55.990
<v 5>made [inaudible]</v>

884
00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:01.860
<v 2>Jesus Christ in the program made that one particular server to shut down causing</v>

885
00:54:03.431 --> 00:54:06.940
the rest of our online products to not work.

886
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.360
That's the sentence by a guy who works at a bank.

887
00:54:10.361 --> 00:54:15.361
The program made that one particular server to shut down to shutdown.

888
00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:21.810
The program made that one particular service shut down. Is that what you mean?

889
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.660
Causing the rest of our online products to not work.

890
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.930
The bank had to restart all the servers to sync that tech crap up resulting in

891
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:34.200
the six hour delay from the call center side.

892
00:54:34.201 --> 00:54:37.680
We could still see all the balances and account information.

893
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.120
Clients themselves just couldn't process any maintenance.

894
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:43.270
<v 5>Okay.</v>

895
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:47.710
<v 2>Nothing made my day more enjoyable than apologize into client after client for</v>

896
00:54:47.711 --> 00:54:52.360
our system error. Had a few people in the situation you mentioned on Thursday,

897
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:55.993
<v 5>what,</v>

898
00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.190
<v 2>where are they stuck outside the country with no money. Oh,</v>

899
00:55:00.191 --> 00:55:05.191
had a few people in the situation you mentioned on Thursday where they are stuck

900
00:55:06.611 --> 00:55:08.740
outside the [inaudible]. This guy is a fucking,

901
00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.450
this guy who should've been in summer school next to me. Totally agree.

902
00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:18.310
You need to have backup plans when it comes to accessing your money,

903
00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:23.470
whether it be multiple bank accounts or stuffing some cash underneath the pillow

904
00:55:23.471 --> 00:55:28.450
where you rest your bulb freckled dome at night. Keep doing what you're doing.

905
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:31.650
Uh, and go fuck yourself. Yeah.

906
00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.200
I've never met a banker that believes in the banking system.

907
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:38.100
If you really talk to them about it, they're nervous too.

908
00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.270
I Dunno. Anyways. Uh,

909
00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.500
was that supposed to make me feel better? I mean,

910
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.580
I guess it's good that no one hacked into your system.

911
00:55:47.581 --> 00:55:52.230
You guys just kind of were running something and something got fucked up. Um,

912
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.410
but he agreed with me. Yeah, I have a little money here. A little money there.

913
00:55:55.411 --> 00:55:57.780
A little money there. Don't have it all your eggs in one basket.

914
00:55:57.781 --> 00:55:58.770
We all know that. Right?

915
00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:03.120
Cause then everything's going to be on the arm with the fucking one flew over

916
00:56:03.121 --> 00:56:07.330
the cuckoo's nest. All right. Much older man. Okay, here we go. Well,

917
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.230
let me just tell you about that. Oh, 56. Okay. I mean there, I'm in there.

918
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:14.270
All right. Much older man. Bill Burr. How, why Ya,

919
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.700
I been listening to your pod. Oh, this is from a lady. I love it.

920
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:20.790
I love when the ladies write in. You guys don't do it enough. Um,

921
00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:23.800
I've been listening to your podcast for a little over a year.

922
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.190
Basically since the day I discovered them and have seen all your specials.

923
00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.160
Hope to catch a live one of these days. Well thank you. So here it goes.

924
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:34.600
I've been living for eight years and married for four of those years to a man

925
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:38.210
who was 21 years older than me. Yet.

926
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:43.220
We met when he was 45 and I was 23 and we have been together since Nia.

927
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:51.430
Can you do this one or no? You can. Okay. All right.

928
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:53.723
<v 0>Um,</v>

929
00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:55.270
<v 2>uh,</v>

930
00:56:55.270 --> 00:57:00.250
we have a two year old son and I am now 31 and he is 52.

931
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:06.220
Okay. I know many think that when they first heard my husband,

932
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.110
<v 0>uh,</v>

933
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:12.310
<v 2>that my husband is well old enough as well old enough to be my father,</v>

934
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.310
that it's some sort of sugar daddy situation,

935
00:57:15.311 --> 00:57:18.340
which honestly is not the case at all. Our lives are quite simple.

936
00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.130
We live in a four bedroom house. I own two soccer.

937
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.160
We own two soccer mom type vehicles.

938
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.700
The only expensive piece of jewelry to my name is my wedding ring and one would

939
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:31.600
not find a pair of red bottom shoes in my closet. But I digress.

940
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.100
Only so folks don't get the wrong picture. Uh, for the past year or so,

941
00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:39.610
it seems like he is aged mentally in a drastic way.

942
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:44.980
Our Age difference was never an issue until the last year or so. Um,

943
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.490
aw look Uzi. Hey Buddy.

944
00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:53.700
Hey Buddy. You Doing?

945
00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:01.060
You're making a lot of racket out there, aren't ya? This is called a podcast.

946
00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:06.820
Um, anyways, so anyways, now here's the deal. This, this lady,

947
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:12.220
uh, is married to this guy. He's, he's 21 years older.

948
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:17.590
Um, what's going on? Yeah, these, they had phones. He's looking at me like,

949
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:22.150
what is this? What is this? Um,

950
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.090
so if you're going to keep looking at me with that cute little smile,

951
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:32.350
how do I do this? Uh, alright. So,

952
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.950
uh, yeah, she was 23.

953
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.510
He was 45, so I guess he's 22 years old.

954
00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:43.630
And when they met 23 and 45 yeah.

955
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:47.290
And now she's 31 and he's 52. I don't know.

956
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:51.520
Somehow he was 22 years old and now he's only 21 must be when their birthdays

957
00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:55.150
are. But anyways, she said it wasn't a sugar daddy thing.

958
00:58:55.151 --> 00:58:58.570
They don't really have a lot of money. They'll just live in a basic lifestyle.

959
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.250
All you got to stop smiling kid. Um,

960
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.590
I'm totally losing my train of thought here.

961
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:09.210
He just too adorable it to adorable for me to do this.

962
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.810
Yeah, I know. That's what, that's what my listeners are doing. Eh,

963
00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.180
can you get through this please? Um,

964
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:23.000
so basically she said the only expensive of jewelry she has is her wedding ring.

965
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.090
She doesn't have any red bottom shoes. She just basically really loves the guy.

966
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.830
Okay. So, but for the past year or so,

967
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:31.460
it seems like he is aged mental mentally in a drastic way.

968
00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:35.660
Our Age difference was never an issue until the last year or so.

969
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:40.580
He seems to be almost bitter than I am in my thirties and he's beginning to

970
00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:45.260
become beyond insecure that I will decide I want a younger man out of nowhere.

971
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:48.860
One day, uh, I'm all over the place with this. She says,

972
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.230
it seems like you're pretty focused. Sorry. Anyways,

973
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:56.870
his constant insecurity in vastly changing behavior is really causing issues in

974
00:59:56.871 --> 01:00:00.310
our marriage that I believe may never go away. Being that are age differences,

975
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.050
not going away anywhere.

976
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:07.100
Obviously was hoping for some of your wise input on my current situation or tell

977
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:09.890
me I'm a dumb ass for marrying an older man,

978
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:12.470
older man than my father.

979
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.480
Like my mother does a have a good one. And of course go fuck yourself.

980
01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.640
Uh, so what do you think Nia?

981
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.600
<v 5>Um, yeah,</v>

982
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:27.630
he was probably too old for you because now that's just too much of an age,

983
01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:33.310
but he's older than your dad. Do you have daddy issues? Maybe.

984
01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.660
Well, regardless, it seems like the power dynamics have shifted.

985
01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:42.790
So before you were a young, you know, impressionable thing and he was the older,

986
01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:46.180
wiser, more in control. Now he's getting older,

987
01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:50.380
he's becoming aware of his mortality. And you're in your thirties what?

988
01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.920
You're like, you're towards your peak now as a woman.

989
01:00:53.921 --> 01:00:55.270
Like that's when you really peak in.

990
01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.250
You're actually in your forties but you're getting there.

991
01:00:57.251 --> 01:01:00.700
You're probably still hot. You're smarter than you were before.

992
01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:05.770
You're on top of your game where it's like, yeah, he's feeling some type of way.

993
01:01:05.771 --> 01:01:09.970
So I don't know if he's having a midlife crisis. Yeah.

994
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:14.620
I don't know if he's having a midlife crisis and you're gonna end up being

995
01:01:14.621 --> 01:01:19.030
collateral damage, um, or, or what's going on.

996
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:22.810
But you guys should probably have like a frank discussion about it. But yeah,

997
01:01:22.811 --> 01:01:24.670
if he's afraid of you leaving him,

998
01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:28.060
he might be having some kind of a midlife crisis. All right,

999
01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:32.170
let's have the frank discussion for her. I'll be the guy. All right.

1000
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.030
Oh you want to be the guy? No, you'd be that.

1001
01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:35.620
You'd be the guy cause you're the owner.

1002
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:39.340
You're an actual older guy in our relationship. So I know it's true.

1003
01:01:39.341 --> 01:01:42.550
That's just like too on the nose. Castic no, it's okay. We can, we can,

1004
01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:47.260
we can do it that way. So you're the older guy and I'm the hot young,

1005
01:01:47.261 --> 01:01:52.120
new bile wife. Okay. A boy. You gonna go out where you gone?

1006
01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:56.390
You gone out with no, I gotta be older. I'm still, I'm just done. Good.

1007
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.240
Where are you going? My girlfriends. I told you that. Did you not?

1008
01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:07.350
Do you not remember? Yeah, I remember that. Okay,

1009
01:02:07.351 --> 01:02:09.690
well I'll be bouncing [inaudible] I,

1010
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.180
I told you last night that I was going out with my girlfriends tonight wearing

1011
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.670
that. I'm going out.

1012
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
<v 2>I'll bring you back something by goes to have an affair with my young lover.</v>

1013
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:32.820
What do you think she should do? Just have a talk with him and if he's like,

1014
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:37.420
what is that noise that's just shown a dump truck makes one,

1015
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.470
it backs up before dumps the load up the back. Married the guys,

1016
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.750
she shouldn't just like completely jumps ship.

1017
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:45.630
But if it's like if he's becoming unbearable and you know,

1018
01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:49.710
difficult to live with and he won't make any strides to work it out,

1019
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:53.490
then why doesn't he take like those legal roids that those old guys that are all

1020
01:02:53.491 --> 01:02:56.760
shredded, you know, they jump in the pool and they come out and all those,

1021
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.580
those women who were sitting in the pool like look at that old guy and then he

1022
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:01.680
comes out of the pool and they're like, oh wait a minute.

1023
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.670
I think I'll bang that grandpa. Well maybe two,

1024
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:09.270
because they're live like the severity, like modest lifestyle.

1025
01:03:09.271 --> 01:03:13.230
He's feeling even more insecure that he doesn't have anything to like offer.

1026
01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:17.310
So even if he wanted to get out of it to like go back to a younger girl or

1027
01:03:17.311 --> 01:03:21.050
something like younger than her, he wouldn't have anything necessarily to offer.

1028
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:24.090
So it's the, this guy's an idiot. I wouldn't have married a girl that younger.

1029
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:28.780
I remember the time before I met Uni, I was like, oh,

1030
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:33.540
it was like 35 or something when it was when I was 25. You are 35. All right.

1031
01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:36.870
So I was like, whatever, 34 35 and I met this woman, right.

1032
01:03:36.871 --> 01:03:41.871
And she was like 22 2122 and she said the first night we hung out,

1033
01:03:42.181 --> 01:03:46.920
she goes, where is this going? I remember you told me this story. Yeah.

1034
01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:49.170
And I said, where's it going? I go nowhere.

1035
01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:53.850
I go when you're 30 and we'd be like 106 so this isn't going anywhere.

1036
01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:58.530
So I won't say what I said next, but it worked out well. Um,

1037
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.270
all right. That's the, uh, that's the pocket. You this,

1038
01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:06.630
is there a new thing she just grabs? You got such a grip.

1039
01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:10.350
That's my forearm here that you just grabbed a whole handful of.

1040
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:15.450
Um, all right. I want to hang out with her before you have to go to work.

1041
01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:16.770
So I gotta get off the thing here.

1042
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.310
You're just fascinated with anything that's technology. There's no screen on it,

1043
01:04:20.311 --> 01:04:24.750
so that's boring, right? It's got a light on it. Let's go light on it. Oh,

1044
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.860
it's got a light on it, doesn't it? Yeah.

1045
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.640
I always think you can't get any cuter than you get. Cute, Huh? All right. Okay,

1046
01:04:35.641 --> 01:04:37.950
cool. Hang on a second. I'll hang out with you in a minute. All right.

1047
01:04:37.951 --> 01:04:39.100
That's the podcast. I'm,

1048
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:44.100
I go f yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday. There.
