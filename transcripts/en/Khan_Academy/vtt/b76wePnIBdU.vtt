00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's say that we have
the indefinite integral,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:11.700
and the function is 3x
squared plus 2x times e

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.560
to x to the third
plus x squared dx.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.457
So how would we go
about solving this?

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:23.040
So first when you
look at it, it seems

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.720
like a really
complicated integral.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.340
We have this polynomial right
over here being multiplied

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.880
by this exponential expression,
and over here in the exponent,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.950
we essentially have
another polynomial.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.130
It seems kind of crazy.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.420
And the key intuition
here, the key insight

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.514
is that you might want
to use a technique here

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:42.430
called u-substitution.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:47.900
And I'll tell you
in a second how

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.910
I would recognize that we
have to use u-substitution.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.450
And then over time,
you might even

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.800
be able to do this type
of thing in your head.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.750
u-substitution is essentially
unwinding the chain rule.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.690
And the chain rule-- I'll go
in more depth in another video,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.624
where I really talk
about that intuition.

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:05.040
But the way I would
think about it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.250
is, well, I have this crazy
exponent right over here.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.920
I have the x to the
third plus x squared,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.220
and this thing right
over here happens

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.520
to be the derivative of x
to the third plus x squared.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.960
The derivative of x to
the third is 3x squared,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.000
derivative of x squared is
2x, which is a huge clue to me

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.920
that I could use u-substitution.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.580
So what I do here is this
thing, or this little expression

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.590
here, where I also see its
derivative being multiplied,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950
I can set that equal to u.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.370
So I can say u is equal to x
to the third plus x squared.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.360
Now, what is going to
be the derivative of u

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.900
with respect to x?

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.930
du dx.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.430
Well, we've done
this multiple times.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.900
It's going to be
3x squared plus 2x.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.480
And now we can write this
in differential form.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.550
And du dx, this isn't really
a fraction of the differential

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.780
of du divided by
differential of dx.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.000
It really is a form
of notation, but it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.420
is often useful to kind of
pretend that it is a fraction,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.357
and you could kind of view this
if you wanted to just get a du,

00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:18.690
if you just wanted to get a
differential form over here,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.980
how much does u change
for a given change in x?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.290
You could multiply
both sides times a dx.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.670
So both sides times a dx.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.920
And so if we were to pretend
that they were fractions,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.990
and it will give you the
correct differential form,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.720
you're going to
be left with du is

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.230
equal to 3x squared plus 2x dx.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.700
Now why is this over here?

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.490
Why did I go to the
trouble of doing that?

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.960
Well we see we have
a 3x squared plus 2x,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.270
and then it's being multiplied
by a dx right over here.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.740
I could rewrite this
original integral.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.770
I could rewrite this
as the integral of--

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.040
and let me do it in that color--
of 3x squared plus 2x times

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.210
dx times e-- let me do that
in that other color-- times

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.080
e to the x to the
third plus x squared.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.769
Now what's interesting
about this?

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.310
Well the stuff that
I have in magenta

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.070
here is exactly equal to du.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.840
This is exactly equal to du.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.000
And then this stuff I have up
here, x to the third plus x

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.690
squared, that is what
I set u equal to.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.850
That is going to be equal to u.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.090
So I can rewrite
my entire integral,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.590
and now you might
recognize why this

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.730
is going to simplify
things a good bit,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.897
it's going to be equal to--
and what I'm going to do

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.271
is I'm going to
change the order.

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:55.210
I'm going to put the
du, this entire du,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.440
I'm gonna stick it on
the other side here,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.230
so it looks like more
of the standard form

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.595
that we're used to seeing
our indefinite integrals in.

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:11.380
So we're going to have
our du times e to the u.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.810
And so what would the
antiderivative of this

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.645
be in terms of u?

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:23.030
Well, the derivative of
e to the u is e to the u.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.930
The antiderivative of e
to the u is e to the u.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.507
So it's going to be
equal to e to the u.

00:04:29.507 --> 00:04:31.090
Now, there is a
possibility that there

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.840
was some type of a
constant factor here,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.820
so let me write that.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.980
So plus c.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.220
And now, to get
it in terms of x,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.440
we just have to
unsubstitute the u.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.410
We know what u is
equal to, so we

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.960
could say that this is
going to be equal to e.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.010
Instead of writing u, we
could say u is x to the third

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.865
plus x squared.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.780
And then we have our plus c.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.330
And we are done.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.130
We have found the
antiderivative.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.460
And I encourage you to take
the derivative of this,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.940
and I think you will find
yourself using the chain rule,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.050
and getting right back
to what we had over here.
