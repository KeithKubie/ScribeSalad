in all of these discussions of
information technology you come back to

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920
information technology you come back to
 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.250
information technology you come back to
the fact that they are solving lots of

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260
the fact that they are solving lots of
 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.290
the fact that they are solving lots of
problems that aren't really problems can

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300
problems that aren't really problems can
 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.470
problems that aren't really problems can
we make a better Google or Bing yeah I'm

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480
we make a better Google or Bing yeah I'm
 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.800
we make a better Google or Bing yeah I'm
sure we can but it solves a problem that

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810
sure we can but it solves a problem that
 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.120
sure we can but it solves a problem that
isn't really a problem

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130
isn't really a problem
 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.250
isn't really a problem
you cannot point to any area of

hamstrung by some failure in their
 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.080
hamstrung by some failure in their
search technology can we honestly go to

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090
search technology can we honestly go to
 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.209
search technology can we honestly go to
some scientists and say the reason we

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219
some scientists and say the reason we
 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.560
some scientists and say the reason we
haven't cured cancer is you don't have

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570
haven't cured cancer is you don't have
 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.170
haven't cured cancer is you don't have
access to information about cancer

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180
access to information about cancer
 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.380
access to information about cancer
research No
