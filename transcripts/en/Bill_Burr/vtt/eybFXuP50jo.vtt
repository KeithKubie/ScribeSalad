00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.
I's time for the Thursday afternoon,</v>

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.320
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.310
<v 0>and ahhh</v>

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.350
<v 1>just checking in on you a little Tarzan.</v>

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.280
Little tours in very little Johnny.
Why Smell?

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.161
Hey,

8
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.910
remember that guy that's back when being and shake was just not like being fat

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.580
Johnny mice.

10
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.790
Millie was an Olympic swimmer and even he was yanking his fucking whatever the

11
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:33.870
hell he had days.
Little fig leaf over his junky yanked it up past his navel.

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.763
Nobody.

13
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
I challenge you to find one person who was shirtless back then.

14
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:41.400
You could actually see their belly button.

15
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:46.401
I don't know if that was because the naval was considered nudity back then or

16
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:53.630
lewd or the devil's work,
the port hole to to,
I dunno.

17
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.000
Getting some push.
I don't know.
I have no idea.

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.700
I don't pretend to know these things.

19
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.200
Why didn't I take out my fucking Invisalign?
Why didn't I take it?

20
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:04.790
I forgot to take the fucking shit out.

21
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:08.720
I am on tre number 11 1111 or 13

22
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.230
Trey 11 and 13 is an interesting story about Trey.
Number 11 okay.

23
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:19.790
I brought it to New York.
All right.
Cause I went back to do the Patrice O'neil,

24
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.620
the sixth annual Patrice O'Neal benefit and um,
which by the way,

25
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:29.180
I think that was probably the best one we had as far as everybody murdered.

26
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.670
Just a perfect mix of,
of uh,
people that knew them,

27
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.310
people that were fans of them,
black,
white,
male,
female.

28
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.020
Two stories about Patrice comic shitting on each other.

29
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.550
Vos took a fucking pounding.
He hosted,
I don't know what he was wearing.

30
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:53.560
He had this bing Crosby hat on.
Then he had like this flannel,
like a,

31
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:57.650
I'm going to go see Pearl jam shirt on.
But he buttoned it all the way up.

32
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.360
You know,
like they were going to,

33
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.860
we were joking like they were going to reboot that movie colors.
Um,

34
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.540
and then he had like these red plastic shoes on that he swore where the shit,

35
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:10.910
I don't know what it was just one of those deals where it's just like rich,

36
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:12.560
you have to take one of those things off.

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.010
If you're going to button up the flannel and have red shoes on,

38
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.250
get rid of the hat.
Where are we going to keep the hack?
Get rid of the shoes.

39
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.340
If you gonna wear the shoes in the hat,
put on a different fucking shirt.

40
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.560
All right.
The Rich Vos is not a smart man.
Okay?

41
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:31.160
He's driven.
He's dedicated,
but he's,
he's,
he's not always on the right track.

42
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:34.200
And this was one of these evenings and we tried to tell him,
uh,

43
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.580
he took a good pound and Keith Robinson actually just showed up just to trash

44
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:41.630
people.
You went backstage and Jim Norton was just minding his own business,

45
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:45.740
eating something and Keith slapped the food right out of his fucking hand onto

46
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.170
the floor.
You know,
the usual maturity.

47
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:52.310
But I want to thank everybody that came down in the crowd and all the comics,

48
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:56.880
Sam j who I'd never seen before,
fucking murdered p Ali,

49
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.880
rich vos,
safer sounds at,
thank you so much,
Jim Norton.

50
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.950
Dave Attell is always all the teen idols,
sensation from the leg.
Great.

51
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.840
Obion Anthony Show,
Robert Kelly,
my old roommate from back in the day,
Jessica,

52
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.290
Kirsten Greer Barnes and Maureen Taren for putting the whole thing together.

53
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.070
Thank you.
And thank you to everybody who came out.

54
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.080
It was just a fucking awesome show.
Just an awesome show.
All of them.

55
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.340
They had me [inaudible] I had to go on after,
uh,
most of them there.

56
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.710
And,
um,
I was just,
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
What did I do?

57
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.020
Okay.
What did I just do?

58
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.620
You can't even fucking lean back in this goddamned place.
Is it still recording?

59
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.950
It is recording,
but I can't hear myself.
Oh,
Jesus.

60
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.560
Where's the headphone narrative is going to plug it in?
It's eight.
Now.

61
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.300
Most people would fucking edit that out.

62
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.710
Most people are too afraid to look foolish on their own fucking podcast where

63
00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:56.730
it's just them and they play the producer and all of that bullshit.
But not me,

64
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.470
not me.
So I just,
I had the perfect fucking time.
You know,

65
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:05.910
I did the west side comedy club,
tuned up there the night before.
Uh,

66
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.990
just so happened Jerry Seinfeld came down,
so I've got to watch him do his set.

67
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:12.990
Absolutely crushed.
Um,

68
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.480
such a great comedy club,
right?

69
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.100
It's on 75th and Broadway and between Broadway and Amsterdam,

70
00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:24.300
it's literally right next to the beacon theater and a fucking loved that place.

71
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:29.130
Thank you to the stand for doing the after party and all that as they always do

72
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.250
a,
I might be in New York next week and I'll be down the stand.

73
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:35.880
I'll let you guys know.
I'm all right.
Plowing ahead.

74
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.030
So it's a perfect night.
Everything's going great.

75
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:41.720
We all hang out down the stand afterwards.
They're always so generous.

76
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.100
They've always hosted the afterparty.

77
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.650
They've given everybody food and all this shit.
Just be in the,
uh,

78
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:51.630
the great guys that they are.
And um,
so at the end of the night comes,

79
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:55.770
I go home and I'm thinking of what an absolute perfect two days in New York.

80
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.290
And uh,
and I even remembered I,
cause I was wearing train number 10.

81
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.230
I even remembered tre number 11,

82
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.240
because Wednesdays is when I got to put the new one in.

83
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.030
So the next day I wake up,
I already booked myself a car service,

84
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:16.170
which I always forget the fucking do.
I break open the bag,

85
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.210
I put trade number 11 in.
Ah,
it's only hurts that first couple of days,
right?

86
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.130
Oh I also did the Jim and Sam show had a great time on that.
Um,

87
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.680
just making sure I think everybody,
so anyways,

88
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:31.980
I put the fucking trays in and then I was like,
well,
you know,

89
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.050
I'm dying a thirsty or the car is coming so let me just have a nice light

90
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:38.520
breakfast.
So I go across the street,

91
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:40.830
I buy a fucking orange and a big thing of water.

92
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.180
So I take the Invisalign out of bucket,
eat in the orange and all that shit,

93
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.073
right?

94
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.860
Cause you can't eat with these things in unless you're an absolute fucking pig.

95
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.580
Drink the water and all that shit.
And then I just,
you know,

96
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.520
throw all the bullshit out,
right?
And all that type of stuff.
Throw it down.

97
00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:00.710
The fucking grabbed my bags and ready to go.
It's still got 10 minutes to spare.

98
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:05.360
And then I'm looking for the Invisalign,
where the fuck is,
I'm like,
oh no,

99
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.520
please tell me.

100
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.900
I just didn't throw it down that fucking garbage chute with everybody else's

101
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.470
garbage from the building.
Please tell me I didn't fucking do that way that

102
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.370
I threw it down the fucking shoot.
So I'm like,
now what do I do?

103
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.050
I can put the old tray back in so my teeth don't move or anything like that.

104
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.170
And maybe I could go home and put train number 12 and that's what the fuck I'll

105
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.430
do.
Fuck it.
It's gone.

106
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.120
I'm not going down and digging those fucking things out of the trash.

107
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.950
I'm not fucking doing it.
Right.

108
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.000
And then I just sat there and I was like,
you know what?

109
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.480
My wife would she tell me to go down and go get it and fucking just fucking soak

110
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:51.560
it and Listerine for a day.
So I'm like,
fuck.
All right,

111
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.210
I'll do it.
I'm going to do it.
I fucking go downstairs.
Right.

112
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.600
Do you remember peewee Herman when he ran out of the pet store with the snakes?

113
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.780
That's what I was like.

114
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.760
So it went down there and the super was there and we'd fucking fortunately no

115
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.680
one through any trash on top of it.

116
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.430
And there was sitting right on top.
Like I had a pizza box,

117
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.580
something like that.
One of them was in the pizza box,

118
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.870
the one was sitting right on top,
like a fucking prize,
but still right.

119
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.120
So I just took him through them in my bag and then,
uh,
I came home,

120
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.750
I rinse them off,
scrubbed him with this brush I have,

121
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.890
and then I just threw them in Listerine for like overnight and then said,

122
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.990
all right,
I'm going to pop these in the mouth,
my mouth,

123
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:40.280
and hopefully I don't get some fucking grown in my intestines.
So,
uh,

124
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.290
that's it.
Pretty Gross.

125
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.120
I'm from a guy who always sits there talking about people that fucking walk bare

126
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.320
foot into a public bathroom on a plane.

127
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.360
I actually fished my Invisalign fucking trays out of the trash from my fucking

128
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:55.700
building.
Uh,

129
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.830
and I'm so ashamed I had to admit it,
but that's how dedicated I am.

130
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.200
Not Jesus Christ.
They seemed fine,
man.
You know,
then,
you know,

131
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:08.460
I don't feel anything.
Nothing grown in my mouth.

132
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.840
I've been wearing them for like a day or so,
day or two.
Everything seems fine.

133
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.750
I know it's embarrassing,
but you know what,
what was I going to,

134
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.290
I didn't want to fucking jump to the next God damn tray.

135
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.970
I wasn't going to wait for another one.
I want this thing to be over.
All right.

136
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.920
This is how wars are won.
It make sacrifices.

137
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.770
So there you go.
Now everybody knows.

138
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:38.330
Now the world knows how disgusting it fucking human being.
I am,

139
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.400
um,
whatever or dedicated,
there's all different ways that you can look at it.

140
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.780
So anyways,
I uh,
I flew back on jet blue,

141
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:51.260
which is a shit and Lisha TV isn't working and everybody else's is.

142
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.530
That was my experience,
but I still had the vice still had the,
you know,

143
00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.260
the chair bed thing going on and I just sat there sort of stretching my fucking

144
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:03.190
arm cause uh,
the right shoulder is actually sits there,

145
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.860
starting to come around it,
starting to come around.

146
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.600
But I've been so goddamn busy.
I missed all the Olympics.
Oh,
what's the matter?

147
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.820
She upset.
Now it's getting that time.

148
00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.460
It's getting to be that time of night.
I had a busy day today,

149
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.190
but I've been so busy.
Um,
hang on one second.
Hang on one second.

150
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.700
<v 3>We are,
we are</v>

151
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.350
Ani.
Do you keep it down a little bit in the end?

152
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.283
What are we doing?

153
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.670
We heard years.
She put her hand.

154
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.610
<v 2>Oh God.
Oh</v>

155
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.810
<v 1>is this,
it was a crisis.
So my wife is getting my,</v>

156
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.740
oh Jesus.
You're going to hear a crying.

157
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.400
She just had a fucking little episode there.
You got my daughter's ears pierced.

158
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:05.770
I didn't want to fucking do it.
But you know what am I guess it's,

159
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.780
this is a good time to do it.
Cause they don't remember.

160
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.340
I don't know why she has to get her ears pierced at fucking one years of age.

161
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.330
Like when she read in the news,
you know,
was she presenting at an award show?

162
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:21.070
Can we just get the clip on ones?
What is the rush?
So anyways,

163
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.730
now nia has to clean around,
you know,
where they pierce the ears,
you know.

164
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.360
So she just went to do that.
She's given Lola bath and Lola doesn't like it.

165
00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:31.120
So she tried to duck out of the way and she put her face right in the water

166
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.180
and she did not enjoy it.
So anyways,
um,
uh,

167
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.970
what was I gonna say?
Oh sorry I missed all the Olympics but I get on,

168
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.020
I thought the gold medal game for the lay ace was tonight and hockey evidently

169
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.560
was last night and congratulations to the women of the United States of America

170
00:10:55.151 --> 00:11:00.070
for winning the Olympic hockey gold medals for the first time since I think like

171
00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:04.450
1998 or some shit.
I don't know what that's right.

172
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.720
And when we couldn't have beat a better opponent,

173
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.990
and I'm not talking about the Russians,
all right.

174
00:11:10.991 --> 00:11:14.140
We only compete with the Russians when it comes to blowing up the whole world.

175
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:17.950
But when it really comes down to hockey,
okay,

176
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.900
it's all about Beaton Canada.

177
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.980
And I actually called cause I'm called up Vancouver today cause I'm doing some

178
00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:26.840
gigs up there and I did the radio and they were all fucking ups.

179
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.800
They were all upset about it.
That's why I love Canada.
That's how much they care.

180
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.090
They even care about women's hockey.
You know which item,

181
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.680
not like I have anything against it,
but you know,

182
00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:37.980
down here it's all about the men.
What are the men don't,

183
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.260
we don't care what women are doing unless it's porn or they're playing

184
00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:44.050
volleyball and that's basically how it works in this country.

185
00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:48.970
I'm not saying that's right.
Okay.
But that,
that is how it is.

186
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.490
Okay.
Women's tennis every once in a while does,
you know?

187
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.970
I Dunno.
I Dunno why.
I don't know why it is okay.
It's just the way it is.

188
00:11:57.971 --> 00:11:59.240
It's all about that stuff.
So we,

189
00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:03.460
I call these people up up there at Vancouver over there and they're all like,
oh,

190
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.350
you bet.
Call did the game.
Oh,
I loved it.
I was,
I loved it.
I was that sick.

191
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.340
We want the fucking matter.
Next we're taking the,

192
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.580
the Canadian men's team is next.

193
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.440
I know we already lost again.
Pumps out by checklist abaya I believe.

194
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.250
I believe that's what happened.
I bet the fucking men's gold medals tonight.

195
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.630
I probably should be watching that shit.

196
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.900
But at this year kind of suck because they didn't let the fucking NHL players

197
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:31.810
play.
DNHL was like on TV are going to make some money,

198
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.690
not CLM picks on you or continue to skate.

199
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.150
I actually,
you know something,

200
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.300
I'm not even getting the NHL Shit for doing that because they actually did it

201
00:12:42.301 --> 00:12:45.210
for a couple of Olympics in a row.
They would just shut down the league,

202
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.420
you know what I mean?
And just eat all that money.
And I can tell you right now,

203
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:51.300
there's no fucking way the NFL would have done that.
You have to,

204
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:54.990
if football became a fucking Olympic sport,
right?

205
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:58.020
There's no way they'd be like they'd be of no Leon it players,

206
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.460
if they're going to get concussed,

207
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.590
they are going to do it by they make us the money.
Okay.
Um,

208
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.160
I've even,
we'll give you some scripts.
Um,
so anyways,

209
00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:13.161
congratulations to the u s a women for winning the gold medal in hockey and uh,

210
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.100
I'm going to sing them a song now.
All right.
Congratulations.

211
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.730
<v 4>[inaudible] to you.
You be today,
Adrian late.</v>

212
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.850
You kick their far
as,

213
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.920
even though I miss a gay by,

214
00:13:31.921 --> 00:13:36.921
I don't want to hear about those bad fucking calls at the end of the gay.

215
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.720
Quit your wine and you're fucking May.

216
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.380
Pecan are whores are better than yours.

217
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.640
I didn't mean to say whore.
I needed a word,
but yeah.

218
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.180
<v 1>One civil syllable.
Go fuck yourselves.</v>

219
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.370
And congratulations to the lay a,

220
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:57.570
sorry.

221
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.950
<v 4>Congratulations to the
[inaudible],</v>

222
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.880
the United States of America.

223
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.050
<v 1>How was that?
Was that better than Fergie?
Um,</v>

224
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.880
I actually didn't think that for you.
One was that bad.

225
00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:13.490
I actually watched it on the Jim and Sam Shelf and I thought it was going to be

226
00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:17.600
horrible.
I didn't mind it.
She kind of did a red,
red,
red ran one fucking word.

227
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.020
You know what I mean?
So I forgive him.
Yeah.

228
00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:25.700
And the rockets red glare,
I ran,
ran,
ran.
She did something like that.

229
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.300
I didn't know what that part was about.
The rest of it though was fine.

230
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.890
Thought it was totally fine.
Um,
anyway,

231
00:14:34.891 --> 00:14:37.220
speaking of me to,
uh,

232
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.120
I just feel like for me to,
when's that gonna Happen?

233
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.830
I just feel like for me.

234
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.253
<v 6>MMM.</v>

235
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.810
<v 1>Yeah.
I was in fucking in a cab in Times Square and I'm looking out the windows.</v>

236
00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:55.580
I'm,
and it was just woman with a fat ass and thick thighs were in black leather

237
00:14:55.581 --> 00:15:00.440
pants is tight as possibly could be just walking up the street and I know the

238
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:05.360
women's shoes.
Fuck.
Well,
it's just like,
it's like,

239
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.180
what are you doing in Times Square?
I you out of your fucking mind.

240
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.410
Why don't you just hang raw meat around your neck and jump in shark infested

241
00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:16.210
waters?
You know,
at some point,

242
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.620
at some point you gotta be looking out for yourself.
Right.

243
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.540
You know,
she looked fucking amazing,
but she was by herself late at night,

244
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.990
New York City Times Square.
Is that what you want to be wearing?

245
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.690
She was probably a cop.
Maybe they got a bunch of me,

246
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.890
two cops out there right now.
You know,
trying to get the,

247
00:15:37.891 --> 00:15:42.400
me too guys is then our works on a fucking know.
What do you want from me?
Okay.

248
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.670
Just saying a fucking the wrong national anthem.

249
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.320
Congratulating the women and accidentally call them away.
You know,

250
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.230
I called them horse right in just,

251
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.530
I'm sure somebody with hairy legs is going to get upset by that and then that

252
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.930
that's how it works.
Okay.

253
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.470
I know there's a lot of fucking problems out there right now.
And they'd be,

254
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.950
and people don't like being being a,
what do they call it?

255
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.320
Hooting and hollering and why they call it,

256
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.180
they call it a woman walks down the street and every guy's like,

257
00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.240
give me a number where they call it cat calling and all that shit.
You know?
Shit.

258
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.120
That's upsetting.
All right?
But you know,

259
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.640
I would be lying if I didn't tell you I was a little jealous.
Okay.

260
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.290
Cause when I walked by a construction site,

261
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.560
all I hear is the sound of men working.
Um,

262
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.630
you don't think I'd like a standing ovation every once in awhile.
Hey,

263
00:16:33.631 --> 00:16:35.850
nice ball hit their freckles.
You know,

264
00:16:35.851 --> 00:16:37.290
every once in a while get a little shout out,

265
00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:41.880
make you put a little pep in your [inaudible].
Um,
I'm fucking with you.

266
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.370
Um,
I don't have any advertising this week.
Can you believe it?

267
00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:48.420
After all the bullshit I've said yes.
Slowly back in a way,

268
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.920
slowly back in.
Okay.
Way,
I should adjust my tone.

269
00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.430
Um,
guess what my fucking drum room is finally done.
I built,

270
00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:05.431
I had this person build me a drum room in the fucking gay Raj and uh,

271
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.490
turned out that was still just a little bit too loud.

272
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.060
I learned a lot of things like 30 decibels

273
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.770
is basically the sound of a silent room with like a light on like the little

274
00:17:19.771 --> 00:17:23.460
buzz of a,
of a,
of a light bulb.

275
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:29.250
All right,
that's 30 decibels.
Queef thing is 35.

276
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.750
I read on all of this.
Okay.
Like 50 to 55.

277
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.190
It's like a light rain,
you know,

278
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.200
70,
I forget what the fuck that is.

279
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.390
And the nineties when it starts getting annoying.

280
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:48.120
So my room was built and I was still at 70,

281
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.620
right outside the garage.
She walked up the driveway.

282
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.110
You couldn't hear it too much.
But as I,
I can't add that.
All right.

283
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.610
So I had somebody else come in and they added this extra shit to it.

284
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.500
And then today it's just like,

285
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.530
it's the shit right outside the garage door is basically the sound of a light

286
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.540
rain and you'd go up the driveway,
you can't even fucking hear it.

287
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.570
So I have the dream bucket drum room.
I can,

288
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.040
if I could play at two in the morning,

289
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.200
and even when you stood outside the garage,

290
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.720
all you can really hear is like the snare drum and it just sold us to sound like

291
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:22.290
somebody has a stereo one,
a little bit low.
It's fucking perfect.

292
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:28.050
It's fucking perfect.
So,
um,
that's going to be what's going to keep me sane,

293
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.290
I think over the next few years.
Um,

294
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.160
as the orange guy in the hairless fat dude sit there pointing fucking missiles

295
00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:39.210
at each other,
you know what I mean?

296
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.100
Trump and what's his face there?
Almost face.

297
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.490
I Dunno.
Why don't they just go fucking hang out already?
You know,

298
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.210
have one of those fucking online dates,
you know what I mean?

299
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.070
Just discuss like oppressing people,

300
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.330
just kinda compare notes,
you know,

301
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.210
and then maybe they could like combine what it is that they both do.

302
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.390
I'm out of my fucking mind.
People,
I don't pay attention to anything.

303
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:11.770
Somebody actually said to me,

304
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.490
did you hear about so and so with like the Russians and all that shit?

305
00:19:15.491 --> 00:19:19.840
And I was like,
I'm going to be perfectly honest to you.
I did not.
Oh,

306
00:19:19.841 --> 00:19:24.220
did they do a probe and what's going to happen?
Is he going to get impeached?

307
00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.210
And then what?
Let me guess.
It's going to go to the fucking,
the,

308
00:19:28.211 --> 00:19:31.810
the place where all the people in the suits sit and then they're going to need

309
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:34.600
three quarters of a vote and nobody Republican will vote for it.

310
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.850
And then it'll still be an office.
Isn't that what's going to happen?

311
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.370
I seem to remember that's what happened that time.
That guy took this again.

312
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.310
All slick willy,
all slick Willie.
Um,

313
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.620
anyways,
yeah.
I don't pay attention any of that shit.
It's just not a,

314
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.000
I don't find it interesting
and weird.

315
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.570
The fact that I actually find sports interesting,

316
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.880
which are real but don't really matter,

317
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.670
but the actual shit that's going on,

318
00:20:06.671 --> 00:20:09.880
like this guy could get in that level of trouble.
I don't give a fuck.
Um,

319
00:20:09.881 --> 00:20:13.030
I hope that people keep a centimeter shit in about the,
uh,

320
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.370
about gun control or no gun control or a reasonable gun control.

321
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.870
Cause I find all of that fascinating.

322
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.620
I guess all the kids are going to get together and they're going to do some big

323
00:20:23.621 --> 00:20:26.040
protests.
And I like how people who are into guns and going,

324
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.500
these kids are coached that totally be in coached.
Right.

325
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.330
Um,
that's the exact thing that nobody needs.
You know,

326
00:20:34.331 --> 00:20:37.540
I'm not saying that both sides aren't going to try to like fucking finesse their

327
00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:42.410
whole
angle or whatever and that they won't be somebody coach.

328
00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.370
But you should probably listen to people or you only want to know,

329
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.430
I could become fascinated with the ar 15.
Right.

330
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.520
I mean I might buy one before they get fucking band just to,

331
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:55.870
because it will be worth money.
You know what I mean?
They can,
people buy like,

332
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:58.330
you know,
when they reissued the Jordan's and people buy them,

333
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:00.580
they don't wear them and they just stick them in the back of the closet.

334
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.750
So just one day they can just bust it out and everybody's like,
Oh shit.
Right?

335
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.870
Um,
I want to know people who have ARF 15th.
I know this.

336
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.190
People listen to this podcast.
She got one.
Let me ask you this.

337
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:15.940
What do you do with it?
Okay.

338
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.940
I know what I would do with it.
Okay.

339
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:22.710
I wouldn't take it down to some stupid fucking gun range.
And like,
dude,

340
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.870
like target practice,
that's not what you get that gun for.

341
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.820
You get that gun to reenact safely the end of Scarface.

342
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.690
So if I had an ar 15,
what I would do every year around Halloween,

343
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.870
I waited a couple of days after when everybody's Pumpkin's are getting all mushy

344
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:39.700
and I would just knock on the door and be like,
Hey,

345
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.960
do you want me to take that off your heads?
I'll take your old pumpkin's right?

346
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.070
You know,
put up a sign all pumpkin's recycled here,
right?

347
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.270
And I get a whole fill up the whole back end of my truck with a bunch of old

348
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:55.630
pumpkin's.
Right?
And then I would fucking,
uh,

349
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.590
I just take them out in some field.
Right?
I got an ar 15,
you know,

350
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:02.800
I live in the middle of nowhere,
right?
I fucking take them out into a feel.

351
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.410
They put wigs on him and shit.

352
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.800
Maybe a little suit underneath depending on how far I wanted to get with that,

353
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.850
you know?
And then just fucking light him up.

354
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.970
Other than that,
what the fuck the avid for?

355
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.370
That's like these assholes who get like a Ferrari and are they just drive it up

356
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:27.610
and down the sunset strip.
It's like fuck head.
Put It on a truck,

357
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:31.780
take it to a track and drive it the way it's supposed to be driven,

358
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.890
you know?
I mean,
that's what I would to,
that's what the fuck.
I mean,
you got it.

359
00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:39.940
Don't you want to do that?

360
00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:44.140
You can't tell me somebody anonymously right in and just tell me the stupidest

361
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:48.100
fucking thing you did with your ar 15 just having fun,
you know?

362
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.790
Or if my neighbor pissed me off when they weren't around,

363
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.360
I just fucking shooting into the side of his fucking above ground pool.

364
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.040
Get some you mother fucker.
Right.

365
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:07.810
I would do silly shit if I had an ar 15 I wouldn't hurt anybody else.

366
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.260
Destruction of property,
you know?
Yeah.
I would do that.
But you know,

367
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:12.790
women are allowed to get away with that.

368
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.650
Take their fucking ex husbands shit and light it on fire.

369
00:23:16.651 --> 00:23:20.110
A fucking cheating boyfriend,
throw it out on the fucking yard and you know,

370
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.670
stab it all up.
Cops come down laughing,
they don't give a fuck.

371
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.180
The woman goes back in the house,
they don't care.
They don't give a fuck.

372
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.250
Why can't a man go out every once in awhile and just shoot somebody above ground

373
00:23:33.251 --> 00:23:34.740
pool with they are 15 is that,

374
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.270
isn't there a re while you're gonna make sure there's nobody in it,
right?

375
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.820
It's also a waste of water.
It's irresponsible.
But you know what I mean?

376
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.010
You can't tell me if there was a youtube video of that,
you would want to see it.

377
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.270
Right.
And then scroll down and look at all the comments like

378
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.810
wastewater much.
And then it'd be a flat d flat liver snow fight.

379
00:23:56.811 --> 00:24:00.260
Game off all you live out there in Hollywood and the thought and desert.

380
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.530
Couple more comments.
Somebody drops the n word.
You know,

381
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.720
the basic conversation on Youtube.
Right.
Um,

382
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.350
that's what I do anyways.
Uh,

383
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.580
so I don't have any fucking advertising.

384
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.260
I don't have any fucking emails and I got six more minutes to go.

385
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.420
Can he do it?

386
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.770
Can he think of something that he can fucking talk about for the next six

387
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:30.980
minutes?
What about why do I,
why do I gotta think about something.

388
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:33.600
What about fucking you just sitting there listening.
Huh?

389
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.380
The next six minutes of your life is going to go by [inaudible] they,

390
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.050
you know back and you're going to sit there,

391
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.250
you're going to sit there waiting for me to try to come up with something to say

392
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:47.150
aren't you?
That's where you're at.
Um,

393
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.320
a non gone,
not non gun people.
All right.

394
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.520
The people want to get rid of all the guns.
They want to get rid of all the guns.

395
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:58.280
Can you do that?
Isn't that turning like get rid of all the straws.

396
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.960
Like how would you do that?
It's like they're out there.
People come in and again,

397
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.840
these are all the straws I have.
How would you know that?

398
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.043
<v 0>You know,</v>

399
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.760
<v 1>straws,
it made out of plastic.
Everybody,</v>

400
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.820
which means evidently they never break down.

401
00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:21.040
So they'll just think while the way the first time you went to fucking

402
00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:23.860
Mcdonald's,
you're like,
well God,
Carla,
Carla,
chocolate shake.

403
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.180
Just think of the fact that that cup is long gone because it was made out of

404
00:25:28.181 --> 00:25:31.900
paper,
but that Straw that you fucking drank out of what?

405
00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:35.860
That little thing on top,
it's still fucking there.
It's somewhere.

406
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.720
It's in the ground.
It's out in the fucking ocean.
Just swirling around.

407
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.940
That's the type of Shit I think about,
you know,

408
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.150
with all these minimalists people gone the fucking minimalist.
It's like,

409
00:25:49.151 --> 00:25:51.610
what do you do with all your shit?
You just throw it out.

410
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.590
So now you don't have to look at it.
It all went somewhere,
right?

411
00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.520
That's why you got to have a fucking yad sale.
Jesus Christ.

412
00:26:00.521 --> 00:26:04.380
Just open yourself up to a bunch of fucking cheap cons.

413
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.130
Or maybe they're environmentalist's some of this shit that they have out there.

414
00:26:09.131 --> 00:26:09.370
You know?

415
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.930
This is somebody who fucking fishes Invisalign out of a goddamn communal trash

416
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.780
bin earlier this week is literally going to sit here and judge people that go to

417
00:26:16.781 --> 00:26:19.480
yard sales and try to find gems.

418
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.070
You know what's really going away as those stores where you just have that

419
00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:28.210
fucking like a hoarder and he just says all this random shit and they like a

420
00:26:28.211 --> 00:26:32.980
fucked up lamp and an old cash register next to like a propeller for some

421
00:26:32.981 --> 00:26:34.830
fucking plane,
you know.

422
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.520
But with those kinds of store agon and I antiques thank is beyond antiques.

423
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.730
It's like modern antiques.
It's just plastic shit.

424
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.750
You know that nobody fucking wants these be a guy down the street from me.

425
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.650
He dealt all in speakers and shit.

426
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.830
Crazy fucking do crazy crazy mother fucker.
I went in there one time and I,

427
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:59.850
these iPod speakers that I wanted fixed and he started telling me that he had

428
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.340
this revolutionary way that he was going to record music.

429
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.170
<v 7>Okay,</v>

430
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.290
<v 1>okay.
He was trying to tell me,</v>

431
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:14.650
you Simon and Garfunkel as as an example saying nobody really knows what they

432
00:27:14.831 --> 00:27:19.330
sound like even if they've heard the recordings because they weren't recorded

433
00:27:19.331 --> 00:27:24.331
correctly because Garfunkel is like a foot taller than Paul Simon.

434
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.670
So if she was standing in the room,
Garfinkel's boys would be coming at you from,

435
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.590
you know,
eight to 12 inches higher than Paul Simon's voice.

436
00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.850
And the way that that would reverberate around the fucking room would be what

437
00:27:39.851 --> 00:27:43.480
they actually sounded like.
Whereas when they go to record them,

438
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.440
it makes them sound like they're both the same height and I'm just sitting
there,

439
00:27:47.441 --> 00:27:49.720
listen to this guy going,
this guy's out of his fucking mind.

440
00:27:49.721 --> 00:27:51.790
But he also might be onto something.

441
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.290
So he was trying to explain to me how the fuck he was going to record that.

442
00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.750
And I was just like,
you know what?

443
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.510
As much as this guy seems like he's out of his fucking mind,

444
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:06.310
he still ended this shit.
He's going to be able to fix these speakers.

445
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.580
And you know what,
he took my speakers,
you know,

446
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.840
and set him behind the cash register,
whatever,

447
00:28:13.841 --> 00:28:16.780
where I just saw a wall of speakers

448
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.510
anywhere from fucking,
I dunno,
10 years old to 40 50 years old,

449
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.231
all behind him.

450
00:28:24.231 --> 00:28:27.740
It was like Sanford and sons junk yard and it was all fucking speakers

451
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.380
and a,
sorry like at that dumps sound effect.
It's the only way I can hear.

452
00:28:33.381 --> 00:28:36.140
If somebody fucking sends me a text,

453
00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:39.070
that gum shoe wear them anyway,

454
00:28:39.071 --> 00:28:42.680
so he takes my speakers and you know what he does?
He never fucking fix them.

455
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:43.700
And I kept calling him up.

456
00:28:43.701 --> 00:28:46.520
He didn't even know where the fuck they were and I never got him back.

457
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.130
And he used to drive by a store for two years being like that.

458
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.520
Motherfucker's got my speakers and he's going to find one of these cuts,

459
00:28:52.521 --> 00:28:54.950
a yard sales to give him like 25 bucks for it.

460
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.670
One of these days when I got the time,
I'm going to go in there and be like,

461
00:28:58.671 --> 00:28:59.504
hey man,

462
00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.040
remember we took my speakers and you didn't give me a piece of paper or any sort

463
00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:09.041
of proof that I actually gave you speakers and you've talked to another 3

464
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.240
million people since I came.
When the place,
well guess what?

465
00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:13.570
I'm back without any proof.
And I'm telling you,

466
00:29:13.571 --> 00:29:15.890
you got my speakers in here somewhere and I want him back.

467
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.340
I was so meaning to do that and I never,
I never got around to it.

468
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.780
And then one day I drove by and it was just,
it just didn't exist anymore.

469
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:30.540
So,
you know what that means,
right?
Unless this guy took all that shit,

470
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.040
my fucking speakers right now,
probably in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

471
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.090
floating around and floating around it,
and they swirling and swirling,

472
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:43.150
and eventually they're gonna run into that Straw that I had at Mcdonald's.

473
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.420
And now,
you know the rest of the story.
Sorry,
did that take a six minutes?

474
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:54.370
29 seconds ago?
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking bull shit.
Um,

475
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.700
I got to get caught up in the Bruins.
I guess we,
uh,
we made some,

476
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.010
we made some moves at the trade deadline.

477
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.360
We've got some defenseman from,
uh,
the fuck is it from the,
the,
the,

478
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:10.480
the New York ranges,
I guess said just packing it in.
They said to hell with it.

479
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.940
Um,
does that mean they're going to get rid of,
Hey Henrik Lundqvist,

480
00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.160
you know,
they can't do that.

481
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.100
I mentioned the overhead of that guy and fucking shipping all those suits to

482
00:30:21.101 --> 00:30:23.620
some other town.
And where would he wear you?

483
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.240
Imagine if Henrik lundqvist ever got fucking,
well,

484
00:30:27.241 --> 00:30:31.540
he got traded to like Columbus.
You know,
it's all these Gq,

485
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.860
GQ clothes walking around fucking Columbus.
They don't give a shit.

486
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:37.750
They barely give a shit about hockey out there,
right?

487
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:41.320
They're all about the IO state.
Buckeye's now that's actually a good hockey town.

488
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:44.560
I went out there one time for a Redwings game playoff game and it was fucking

489
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:49.510
great.
Columbus and Nashville,
crazy fence,
great fence.
However,

490
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.060
not exactly the kind of place where you're going,

491
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.860
where Henrik lundqvist can wear some of his fancy suits,

492
00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.233
you know,

493
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.940
that's a pretty confident moved to buy suits like that as a professional
athlete,

494
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.140
you know,
or you probably think of,

495
00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:07.480
well maybe I'll just wear them in the off season or bucket help light the

496
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:11.400
Columbus,
but I want to live in New York cause God dammit I'm going to,

497
00:31:11.401 --> 00:31:12.280
I'm going to wear these buckets,

498
00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:14.410
suits or maybe you wear the suits and Columbus scene.

499
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:18.280
Did you show people what the next level looks like?
Um,
I don't know.

500
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.440
I'm talking about he,
they're not even thinking about trading him,

501
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.800
but all I know is we got a defensemen out of it and we gave up a couple of draft

502
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:27.430
picks or whatever and I don't know,
the Bruins are like,
hey,

503
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:30.280
they got the second most points and I'd barely watched the game.

504
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.770
This shit cause I got a little kid and I'm edited into the fucking series.

505
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:36.670
I did four hours today with the Great Laura dern.

506
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:40.540
She absolutely fucking murdered today.
Um,

507
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.570
she does the voice of sue Frank's a wife and I'm,

508
00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.540
I'm telling you the season's coming together.

509
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.310
I think I'm going to talk a little shit here.

510
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.170
I think this might be our best season.

511
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.920
I think this is the season where we finally break out of the pack and we get

512
00:31:56.231 --> 00:32:00.760
invited to one of them fucking shows and they give us some shiny shit and we all

513
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:03.580
go up in a big group hug,
you know,

514
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.820
and we enjoy it for eight seconds before they take it away from us and they say,

515
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:12.940
get back in that room and do it again.
Um,

516
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.020
all right.
That's the podcast.
Sorry.
Got a little fucking nuts.

517
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.160
They're just trying to fill time.
I said a lot of things.
Uh,

518
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.290
I meant very little little of it.
Okay.

519
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.230
But it doesn't matter in this day and age.

520
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:31.180
What your job is to do now is to take it seriously and started talking about how

521
00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:36.181
offended you were in ignore real problems and talk about this podcast

522
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:41.980
as if it sets swirl the on the road.
All right.

523
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.340
That's the fucking pissed here.

524
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.290
Sorry.
My brain's fucking fry.
Um,
that's a Thursday afternoon,
uh,

525
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.500
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
Have a great weekend.

526
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:57.950
You can enjoy this music and a,

527
00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.110
I'll do the whole Trump thing with the index finger and the thumb.

528
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.660
They make a little point there and then we're going to play a little bit of

529
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:06.440
throwback fucking Thursday podcast after podcast from Thursday,

530
00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:11.390
from this year or years before.
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
oh,

531
00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:15.410
by the way,
I almost forgot to say,

532
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.910
are you going to bed?
Little Cutie.
Hi.

533
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:26.000
Oh,
are you adorable?
Is it even legal to be that cute

534
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.390
Nia to,
you know,
something as far as business goes,

535
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.700
you ever see somebody make a business move and you think,

536
00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:38.780
why didn't I think of that?
Yes.
All right.
Here's my latest one.

537
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:44.060
Do you know Barstool sports?
Yes.
Yeah,
they're huge.
They're huge.

538
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:48.080
Do you know what they bought?
There's some sort of like fighting,

539
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:49.700
I forget even what it,
what it's even called.

540
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:53.870
It's just like this regular person fight night.

541
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:55.341
It started in,

542
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:59.810
I believe Virginia and just regular people go up there just throwing haymakers

543
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:01.180
beaten the s out of each other.
Sorry,

544
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.390
my kids here beating the crap out of each other and it's just,
you know,

545
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.513
hey makers,

546
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.280
very little technique and then they get haymaker is drink.

547
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.040
Haymaker is actually an expression that came from farming and I can think of was

548
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:19.420
when you took the sickle and you just swung from behind you to chop it down.

549
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:23.770
I looked it up one time.
Um,
so anyways,
hey,
why don't you take the microphone?

550
00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:28.420
I got this all,
I got this,
I got this all set up.
I know.
I'm trying to,

551
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:31.520
okay,
on this one.
So she has an unplugged,
let me just finish this real quick.

552
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.360
So these regular people come in and did the fights are crazy because these

553
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:38.150
people are just swinging for the fences and eventually somebody connects with

554
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:41.630
somebody or,
I'm not saying they're all bad,
but it's just like this crazy,

555
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.230
it's like a,
I don't know,
it's like barroom brawls.

556
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.870
So barstool sports bought it and then they put it on paper view.

557
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:53.990
It's like if you,
if you order it early,
it's 10 bucks.

558
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.780
Who isn't going to buy that?

559
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.310
And how aren't you going to get your money back or those people that are coming

560
00:35:01.311 --> 00:35:05.000
in to fight or do they get paid?
They get paid.
I don't know what to get.

561
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.760
I don't think there's want to be a TV.
I have no idea.
I don't know how it works.

562
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.960
I don't care about them.
It's all about me.
I attend bucks here.
Okay.

563
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.180
I'm ordering that.
I don't know when the next one is,

564
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.940
but I am ordering that and that's one of those things where that is going to

565
00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:17.840
turn into like,

566
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.110
it's going to be like the regular person UFC and I guarantee you sometime
that's,

567
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.960
that's gonna sell for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars

568
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.960
calling it right now.
Well,
all right.

569
00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.570
Now there's no regular.
I remember Rogan said one time,

570
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.980
if you just driving down the and EPC,
two

571
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.920
<v 4>people beating the crap out of each other,
you'd slow down and look at it.</v>

572
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.780
What did you rather watch?

573
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:46.380
Professionals who have trained and have techniques and have moves.
Oh,

574
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.880
I wish I were appreciate both.
Yeah.
Yeah.

575
00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:53.190
Because this is the thing is,
even though they're not professionals,

576
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:57.930
they're really fighting and people really get knocked up.
And this is the thing,

577
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.500
there's none of that as far as I could tell,
just the clips I watched,

578
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.180
there's none of that ground and pound strategy.
It's just people.
It's like,
yeah,

579
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.850
cause they're all just like,
eh.
No they're not.

580
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.840
I would not want to get hit by any of the punches I saw thrown.
Right.

581
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.850
Is this like,
like that?

582
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.710
But shit that like Kimbo slice used to do like the backyard,

583
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.620
like guy,
all I saw was highlights.
I was just,

584
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:25.710
it was like Jerry Springer.
If you edit it out,

585
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.570
all the crap and you just had the fight.
Yeah.
Well cool.

586
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.940
All right.
Maybe you're the wrong demographic.
Yeah,
I could,

587
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:40.820
I finally would say something positive on the God damn podcast.
Um,

588
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.580
I,
I couldn't be less interested in,
yeah,
you don't want to get one on us,

589
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:48.500
smoke a joint and just watch that.
I'll have a little sippy cup and just,

590
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.550
if I'm gonna Watch UFC or boxing and stuff,
I guess I could get into that.

591
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.120
I don't know.
They're just,
here's what we're going to do.
The next one of those,

592
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:57.930
we're going to rent,

593
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.120
we're going to rent and then you're going to come back on the podcast and talk

594
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:04.230
about it please.
All right.
That's nice.
That's fair.
You know what?
It is nice.

595
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:07.410
Nice baby.
It feels exploitative to me.

596
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.020
That's why I asked if the people who are doing it are getting paid,

597
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.780
I'm sure they get into,

598
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:14.130
they probably have some tough man purse in the end of it cause it's like there's

599
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.490
there,
they're selling it for like $10 each.
These people,

600
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.530
they're whole thing is that they're like not professional,

601
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.530
so it's not like they're going to go on to have a career and fighting.

602
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.470
So what are they?
Here's the thing,
cause if they win,

603
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:27.630
make sure she doesn't take that and make sure she doesn't take that.
Yeah,

604
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.940
she's pulling it off.
I don't think she can get it out.

605
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.143
<v 7>Oh</v>

606
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.770
<v 4>she turns around.
Can you just thank you.</v>

607
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.470
She pushed it all the way into the keyhole.
Yeah.

608
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:41.370
<v 7>All right.</v>

609
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.160
<v 4>I don't know.
Well I was excited.
I was excited about you.</v>

610
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.920
You just got to see it near it's,
it's still people fighting.

611
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.770
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

612
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.070
<v 4>Is it like people?
Yeah.
Like I'll be with the people in the UFC get day.</v>

613
00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:57.550
They get exploited.
Do you think they make in the lion's share of the money?

614
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.230
They don't want to take in the concussions and all that.

615
00:37:59.231 --> 00:38:00.190
There's been plenty of fighters.

616
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.000
I've been in the UFC that talk about the same thing.
Yeah.
All right.

617
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.800
And is it takes,
they're getting paid something.
Yeah,
but you know,

618
00:38:05.801 --> 00:38:10.030
you get to be on TV and it's your,
when you know,
you knock somebody out,

619
00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:13.510
you're on TV and it's pretty cool.
Okay,
sure.
Cool.

620
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.533
<v 7>Okay.</v>

621
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:19.030
<v 4>You know what it's like,
it's like American idol.
None.</v>

622
00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.550
Most of those people had no business singing on television,

623
00:38:21.551 --> 00:38:25.510
but what they do and they get to do that.
Right.
Okay.

624
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.990
Is that all right?
Yeah.
But do they have a referee?

625
00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.100
Like do they have somebody that's like,
don't kill each other,

626
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.980
but really you just,
I'm going,
are you coming at like a mother?
Who

627
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.440
<v 2>Cares?
We don't know these people.
It's entertaining.
Yes.</v>

628
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:40.870
There's a referee and there's two hilarious announcers.

629
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.490
I have become really soft since having the baby and it's been a beautiful thing

630
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:49.720
to say,
I'm so soft now.
I'm just like,
oh,
that's not nice.
Don't do that.
Like,

631
00:38:49.721 --> 00:38:53.410
you know,
as you're doing a pushup,
she's uh,
she's doing something.

632
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.123
<v 1>Huh?</v>

633
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:59.860
<v 2>Are you ready for the nose?
Cheeks?
You ready for bed?
Qut.
And not at all.
She's,</v>

634
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.350
she loves being in here and she does.

635
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.020
<v 7>What are you talking about?
Um,</v>

636
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.300
<v 1>what'd she just cracked herself up?
What are you thinking about?
All right,</v>

637
00:39:14.301 --> 00:39:16.070
this is,
this kid's too cute.
I gotta get off here.

638
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.150
I've got to say goodnight to my girl here.
I'm all right.
Thanks for coming here.

639
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.190
Let's see.
Here's the deal.
The next one that comes on provided I'm not working.

640
00:39:22.191 --> 00:39:25.820
Even if I'm working,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm ordering it.
Okay,
we're going to record it.

641
00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:29.320
We're going to watch it and I want to hear what you had to think about it.
I,
I'm,

642
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:34.040
I'm 100% willing to do that.
Okay.
I won't.
I'm going to those guys,

643
00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.930
whoever those guys are that that run that thing that they are going to make an a

644
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.680
,
an effing fortune off of that.
I think it's gonna.
I think it's going to blow up.

645
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.863
<v 7>Okay.</v>

646
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.150
<v 2>I'm not pointing at you.</v>

647
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.470
[inaudible] I am as excited about this as you were excited about to see Black

648
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.140
Panther and you're literally doing the exact opposite.
All right,

649
00:39:54.141 --> 00:39:55.700
that's the podcast.
Thank you for listening.

650
00:39:55.701 --> 00:39:58.010
Everybody and I will talk to you on Monday.

651
00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:07.723
<v 7>Oh,</v>

652
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:18.763
<v 2>all the,</v>

653
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.560
the Gino

654
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.343
[inaudible]

655
00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:53.910
shop
at the bottom.

656
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.350
I'm going to continue on.

657
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.290
What

658
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:11.850
<v 4>is happened in sports?
Can we ate ESPN?
Can we,</v>

659
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.100
you know,
100% access?
Can you dial it back down to like maybe 40% access?

660
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:20.460
Can you stop interviewing fucking coaches,

661
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.860
Fox in whatever NBC as they're jogging off the field trying to think of their

662
00:41:25.861 --> 00:41:29.850
halftime adjustments.
Can we just stop fucking doing that?
I don't give a fuck.

663
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:35.360
Nhl.
Can we stop interviewing players inbetween the fucking,

664
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.010
uh,
periods?

665
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.750
Is this sickness still out of breath from their last shift and that fucking drop

666
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:46.130
a fucking sweat hanging off their nose looking like snot that they have to keep

667
00:41:46.131 --> 00:41:49.250
wiping and that it of it comes back again.
Can we just enough,

668
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.980
I don't give a fuck what happened in that first period.

669
00:41:52.981 --> 00:41:55.350
I just watched the first period.
I know.
What happened.

670
00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.330
What do you think you have to do in the second period?
Oh baby score.
More goals.

671
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.610
Benny Nhl players listening to this.
Uh,

672
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.270
I'll give you a free podcast tee shirt even though you're going to get fined

673
00:42:09.271 --> 00:42:10.680
probably a hundred grand by the league.

674
00:42:10.681 --> 00:42:13.800
Is there any way you could wipe your nose and the blouse of the person who's

675
00:42:13.801 --> 00:42:15.330
interviewing you in between periods?

676
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:21.450
Just reach out and grab that tie and just Dab your eyes.
You know,

677
00:42:21.451 --> 00:42:23.460
I got nothing to give you.
You're a millionaire athlete,

678
00:42:23.461 --> 00:42:26.790
but could you just do it for the,
just for the fucking ridiculousness of it.

679
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.540
Like they're not going to interview you after the fucking game.

680
00:42:31.541 --> 00:42:32.710
Like I have to have it.

681
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.640
They got that fucking guy who stands down there and what looks like the penalty

682
00:42:36.641 --> 00:42:38.470
box in between the fucking benches,

683
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.800
whatever the fuck his name is,
prince fielder,
the hell's his name.

684
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.570
Prince Harry standing down there.
We'll,
I'll try.
It's really ate up down here.

685
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.000
Like why do I need to hear that guy?

686
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:53.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

687
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.720
<v 4>Well [inaudible] has got to stand up for three periods in his loafers.</v>

688
00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.460
Probably gonna Hammer toes by the end of the year.
Less access.

689
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.380
Do you think you could do that?

690
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:05.590
Do you think you could actually start a sports network that could compete with

691
00:43:05.591 --> 00:43:08.260
ESPN and the whole thing is less access?

692
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:14.350
Yeah,
no miked up players.
You just fucking uh,

693
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.590
just trim the fat.

694
00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.150
Can I just go back to watch Bob Lowe Bell at the end of the news and just seeing

695
00:43:22.151 --> 00:43:23.350
five minutes of the shit?

696
00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.010
Can I just see that as he sits there in a fucking blazer?

697
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.090
You know,
every once in a while it takes a day off in new me comes in,

698
00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.820
Bob Neumeier I miss those days.

699
00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:36.620
<v 2>I really miss those fucking day.</v>

700
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.263
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

701
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.610
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

702
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.380
<v 4>I gotta I gotta talk about the do's on southwest.
So,
um,</v>

703
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.860
I went to Albuquerque this weekend and I had a fucking unbelievable time,

704
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.390
have not been back there since,
uh,

705
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:35.940
all those wonderful episodes of breaking bad that I got to be on.

706
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.580
And,
um,
you know,

707
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:43.410
I was going to go on a hike is what I wanted to do.
I wanted to do that.
But,
uh,

708
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.080
you know,
Nia had some friends out there.

709
00:44:46.081 --> 00:44:48.960
We were going to go to lunch and you know,
that is,

710
00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:54.030
it'll only take like an hour.
That's three hours,
you know,

711
00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:59.190
so I'm just like,
I'm too fucking old too.
Um,

712
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:05.570
I'm too old to fucking hike and have a social event in one day and then actually

713
00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:09.990
give any sort of a decent,
decent,
uh,
performance.

714
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.440
So I was like,
all right,
fuck it.
I'm not going to go on the hike.
I'll go over.

715
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.740
And we met,
um,
I met his friends and they were,
they were awesome.

716
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:20.730
Fucking cooked up burgers the middle of the day,
you know,

717
00:45:20.731 --> 00:45:23.390
those homemade burgers that are way bigger than the ones that you get in a

718
00:45:23.391 --> 00:45:27.210
restaurant.
And then you eat them and,
uh,
you don't feel 60th,

719
00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.990
some stomach afterwards.
Fucking phenomenal.

720
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.830
And,
uh,
the people's house,
we went over to the head,

721
00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:37.920
all these bears and that type of stuff.
And I stayed away.
I was a good boy,

722
00:45:37.921 --> 00:45:40.410
so I could have the show,
but I know myself at this point,

723
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.010
so I still that I see I can't do all of those activities in one day.

724
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:46.560
So I just decided like,
uh,
all right,

725
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.170
I'll just do the social thing and I'll show out.

726
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:51.840
Which was actually really cool because I've been to Albuquerque a bunch of times

727
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:56.580
and I never got to ride around and,
uh,
see any of it.

728
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.080
And,
uh,
it's really,
really fucking cool placement.
Really,
really cool.

729
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.630
Um,
so anyway,
so that night I was at the,
uh,
the 66 casino,

730
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.830
meaning basically route 66 and,
uh,
one of the coolest stuff in casinos.
I've,

731
00:46:11.831 --> 00:46:14.760
I've seen,
I'll try and have some images up for I,
you know,

732
00:46:14.761 --> 00:46:18.570
you try to take pictures of those casino lights and it never comes out on your

733
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:23.250
cell phone.
At least the one that I have,
the four S.
Um,

734
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.900
but it was really cool.
Like the hotel had like that,
you know,
uh,

735
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:31.380
the route 66 sign instead of the 66,
it just said hotel.

736
00:46:31.381 --> 00:46:35.190
It was all lit up and then,
you know,
it's native Americans own it.
And then the,

737
00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:38.100
the,
the arrows pointing in where to go.

738
00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:41.370
We're literally like arrows and they looked like they were stuck into the
ground.

739
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.210
They were all lit up.
It's fucking Badass.
It was bad ass.

740
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:50.370
And then I got to play in the,
the name of the theater was the legends theater.

741
00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.100
I played a place called the legends theater.

742
00:46:57.101 --> 00:46:58.930
I remember I was doing some press for it and they said,

743
00:46:58.931 --> 00:47:03.880
what can people expect when they come down to the legends theater?
And it's like,

744
00:47:03.881 --> 00:47:05.470
well,
they should expect to see a legend.

745
00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.960
It shouldn't expect to see me go fresh out of the fucking horse stable.

746
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.930
Where do I go?
Is this the way to the great room?

747
00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.540
Is there going to be allowed people?
I'm scared.
Uh,
fortunately it all went,

748
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.190
it went great and a fucking great people out there,
man.
Once again.

749
00:47:27.191 --> 00:47:31.330
And this was another place that was supposed to be a
on the,
uh,

750
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:36.220
Billy red state tour.
And,
um,
I dunno for any comics who are listening to this,

751
00:47:36.221 --> 00:47:40.150
don't buy into that horseshit that these are fly over states.

752
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.100
They have beautiful places to go and the people are ridiculously appreciative

753
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:48.820
that you showed up this site and they always say the same shit.

754
00:47:48.821 --> 00:47:51.460
Can you tell this person to tell this person?
You know,

755
00:47:51.461 --> 00:47:54.340
they're always asking for Jim Norton and all these guys that I know from the

756
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:58.030
opie and Anthony show telling them to come out there.
You know,

757
00:47:58.031 --> 00:48:02.830
we like comedy too,
so I pass the word onto him and a lot of them have,

758
00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.740
uh,
started coming out,
which is cool.
MMM.

759
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.430
I just hope that they don't become a,

760
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.800
an an all jaded like when you play like the bigger cities and they're just like,

761
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:16.510
whatever,
whatever,
man,
you know,
I got other things to do,
man.

762
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.480
Um,
it was great and they actually bought a bunch of DVDs,

763
00:48:19.481 --> 00:48:22.750
which is phenomenal because I got a bunch of them sitting in my garage.

764
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:25.150
I feel like in my garage is filled with fucking laser discs.

765
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:31.300
I've got to get those things out of there.
Um,
anyways,
so,

766
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.870
oh,
the douche southwest,
sorry,
I'm all over the place today.
So we're flying back,

767
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.910
um,
quick flight back.
I own 45 minutes,
fucking phenomenal.
And uh,
you know,

768
00:48:41.911 --> 00:48:44.790
the southwest people,
they always try to be funny to put a smile on your face.

769
00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:48.060
Most of the times they're not.
And this guy was actually kind of funny.

770
00:48:48.061 --> 00:48:48.960
Then we go to land,

771
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:53.180
we were landing in Los Angeles and this fucking asshole gets on the,

772
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.670
the fucking Mike and it starts going,
you know,

773
00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.080
he's like going welcome to Los Angeles,
which is a

774
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.260
interesting place.
Yes.

775
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:12.950
Very interesting.
Okay.

776
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:16.910
He kept doing this weird laugh and I'm looking at here,
first of all,

777
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:21.490
it was sounded creepy as fucking hell.
Um,
I don't want to be homophobic,

778
00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:24.790
but the guy sounded gay,
you know,
the gay accent.

779
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.510
And so I used to do a joke on this,
like gay people come from all 50 states,

780
00:49:28.511 --> 00:49:32.350
yet they,
they kind of all have the same accent,
which isn't true,

781
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:35.650
but generally speaking,
there is a gay accent,
which makes no sense.

782
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.110
How did that joke?
That's how that joke used to go.

783
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.750
Like if you were gay from Alabama would be like,
hey,

784
00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:43.900
I bought out rule locked to suck your Dick.

785
00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:48.930
Like that's the way you should sound to do a stereotypical redneck accent with

786
00:49:50.731 --> 00:49:54.250
my stereotypical gay accent.
Right.
But they thought,

787
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.410
I grew up in Alabama and let's just say I'm not going back there.

788
00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:00.960
It's probably more valuable.
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

789
00:50:00.961 --> 00:50:01.950
That's what the guy sounded like.

790
00:50:01.951 --> 00:50:04.680
So I'm just sitting there on the backhoe and like,
did a,
you know,

791
00:50:04.681 --> 00:50:07.530
this guy get blown in west Hollywood and somebody stole his wallet.

792
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.490
Did he want to be the next Jim J uh,
uh,
buffoons,

793
00:50:11.491 --> 00:50:13.890
whatever the fuck the guy's name is from too close for comfort.

794
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.370
I don't know what his fucking deal was,
but I'm just sitting there in my head,

795
00:50:17.371 --> 00:50:21.120
go and let them get another most fucked up thing about living in Los Angeles.

796
00:50:21.121 --> 00:50:23.910
I've never lived in a city where everybody trashes it.

797
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.730
Everybody just shits on and it kills me about that.
Let's see.

798
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.860
These are the only fucking city where you could do that.

799
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.110
I guess you can kind of make like a gambler joke,

800
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:36.560
but you can actually land in Los Angeles.
Not give a fuck that everybody,

801
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:40.400
their lives on the plane for the most part lives there and then just shit on it.

802
00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:44.720
MMM,
I had it.
Can I fucking drove me nuts?

803
00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.320
Drive me fucking say interesting place.
That's just like,
well,

804
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:50.690
what the fuck are you doing?
What makes you such a good person?

805
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:56.450
What happened to you here?
Huh?
What Sit-com did you test for?

806
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.800
And he got to coked up the night before and you fucking blew it.
Ah,

807
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.860
what were we supposed to be unwilling grace here.
I'm sorry.

808
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:08.920
In order to,
as I'm defensive of La at this point,

809
00:51:08.921 --> 00:51:12.400
because I have to live out here because this is the fucking business on it.

810
00:51:12.401 --> 00:51:13.570
I don't have to,
but you know,

811
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:18.600
it makes life a lot fucking easier to be where everybody else is in this

812
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:22.670
business.
You know,
if I was into fucking computers,

813
00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:28.220
go move up to watch the fucking,
uh,
the valley up there,
the silicone valley,

814
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.940
which for the life of me,
I don't know what,
why do they call it silicone?

815
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.810
Isn't it?
What's in fake titties?
Is it

816
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:10.680
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
