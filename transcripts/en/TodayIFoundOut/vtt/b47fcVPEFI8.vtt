00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.910
Napoleon was a lot of things, but modest wasn’t
one of them.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.570
This is something no better proved than that
time he responded to being declared Emperor

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.680
of the French by planning an elaborate ceremony
that would see him stroll around wearing an

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.560
80 pound (37 kg) cape…

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.269
No, that isn’t a typo.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.480
Although Napoleon was formally declared Emperor
of the French by the Senate on May 18, 1804,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.640
his coronation wouldn’t actually take place
until December of that year, which is kind

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.250
of understandable when you realise just how
impossibly opulent the event itself was.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.760
Planned months in advance and set to take
place in the famed Notre Dame cathedral under

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.100
the watchful eye of none other than the pope
himself (after a lot of negotiation), Napoleon

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.930
saw to it that the very streets themselves
were scrubbed clean, lest he be offended by

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.530
the sight of a speck of dirt or… other matter…
on his trip through central Paris.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.090
(See: Did People Really Used to Throw Fecal
Matter Out Their Windows?)

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.969
So hotly anticipated was the event that many
people turned up to the cathedral the day

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.369
before, dutifully waiting outside for a chance
to watch the procession.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.710
Despite the fact that Napoleon himself wouldn’t
arrive until around noon, the doors to the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.130
cathedral itself ultimately opened at 6AM
the next morning, around which point the air

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.040
of Paris was filled with the sound of thundering
cannon fire.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.310
The purpose of the cannon fire, beyond no
doubt terrifying local birds, was to wake

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.259
Napoleon who was asleep in a giant, opulent
bed.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.613
He soon adorned himself in white satin underwear
covered in gold embroidery, silk stockings,

00:01:47.613 --> 00:01:48.613
dressing gown, tunic, cape and sword.

00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:52.409
As for the latter, he had the weapon accessorised
with a giant diamond attached to its pommel.

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.670
Before leaving, the Emperor stood dressed
in his finery and reportedly barked an order

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.990
for his wife’s lawyer, Raguineau, to be
brought before him.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.399
The new emperor then sarcastically asked Raguineau
“Well now, Monsieur, do I have nothing but

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.569
a cape and a sword?”

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.660
Why the jab?

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.380
Well apparently Raguineau had once advised
Napoleon’s wife, Joséphine, not to marry

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.909
Napoleon as he was a man “who has nothing
but a cape and a sword”- a statement Napoleon

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.760
had evidently taken great offence to and wanted
to take the chance to bring up one last time

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.739
before being crowned the most powerful man
in all of France and, indeed, one of the most

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.310
powerful men in the world.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.620
Napoleon and his entourage, which included
Pope Pius VII, then left for Notre Dame cathedral

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.180
led by a donkey ridden by the Pope’s crozier-bearer.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.760
According to papal tradition, the crozier-bearer
was supposed to ride a mule, but owing to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.430
trouble finding a mule, a donkey was deemed
suitable.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.430
(See: What’s the Difference Between a Donkey
and a Mule?)

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.780
Upon arriving in the cathedral to thundering
applause, the sound of a several hundred person

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.530
choir, and yet more cannon fire, Napoleon
and Joséphine then donned giant, impossibly

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.770
fuzzy ermine-lined pimp capes weighing some
80 pounds each.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.510
At this point walking around required the
help of four people for the soon to be emperor,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.489
with these individuals trailing Napoleon lest
he have to comically lean forward and struggle

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.610
for every step.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.100
As for his wife, Joséphine’s helpers were
none other than Napoleon’s sisters, Elisa,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.099
Pauline and Caroline- a task they loathed
given their dislike of Joséphine, rumored

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.099
to be because of resenting her grace and sophistication.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.140
At one point they reportedly flat out refused
to be the empresses’ entourage, but when

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.180
Napoleon made threats against them if they
didn’t, they acquiesced.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.140
That said, it is noted that after being crowned,
Joséphine attempted to ascend to her throne

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.579
only to almost fall over backwards when her
helpers forwent their duty and remained at

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.090
the bottom of the steps.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.739
It is generally stated that this was an intentional
jab at the woman.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.640
However, that same thing happened to Napoleon
himself when his helpers likewise let him

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.670
ascend on his own, resulting in him initially
miscalculating the effort needed to drag the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.459
cape up the steps and almost falling over.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.870
So the common rumor that this was an intentional
slight at Joséphine is probably incorrect,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.420
even if Napoleon’s sisters perhaps enjoyed
it either way.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.730
Going back to the grand entrance- Napoleon’s
walk through the cathedral was accompanied

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.240
via a carefully orchestrated series of movements
from his entourage, all of which was planned

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.930
out in excruciating detail before hand with
dolls and a to-scale drawing of the cathedral.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.259
Throughout the coronation, Napoleon stood
in his giant cape visibly bored, stifling

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.710
several yawns and by accounts spending much
of his time observing his wife in her diamond

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.520
encrusted dress instead of the proceedings.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.620
Napoleon then shocked the crowd further by
snatching the crown before the Pope could

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.949
put it on his head and instead did it himself.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.949
While this is often stated to have also shocked
and offended the pope himself, the truth is

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.669
that every tiny detail of the ceremony had
been painstakingly negotiated and planned

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.139
out, including Napoleon making sure he’d
get to crown himself.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.229
Thus, the pope was well aware Napoleon was
going to do this, contrary to what is often

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.229
reported.

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.740
As to why Napoleon wanted this, he thought
it important to indicate that he was being

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.949
crowned Emperor not by the will of the Church,
but by his own merits and the will of the

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.120
French people.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.740
Napoleon then crowned his wife empress, adorning
her with a crown it should be noted he specifically

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.449
asked her to continue wearing right up until
they went to bed that night…

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.860
The last thing he was heard saying to the
new empress before they left for their bed

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.039
chambers was “To whom will I leave all this?”

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.550
Unfortunately for Joséphine, she was unable
to get pregnant, which was a big problem for

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.920
Napoleon who, as he so aptly put, needed an
heir.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.940
Her inability to provide an heir was somewhat
surprising given she’d already given birth

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.330
to two kids by her previous husband, General
Alexandre de Beauharnais, who had been guillotined

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.770
during the Reign of Terror.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.580
Nevertheless, whether because of some complication
from her last pregnancy, Napoleon’s Le Petit

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.210
Caporel not firing enough rounds, or perhaps
her age (she was 41 at the time, 6 years Napoleon’s

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.850
senior) or a combination of all of these,
she remained barren as the Gobi.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.729
This all resulted in Napoleon having the marriage
dissolved about five years later, marrying

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.410
the sprightly young 18 year old Duchess of
Parma, Marie Louise, with the hope that he’d

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.570
have better luck impregnating her.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.620
However, despite while married he and Joséphine
having had affairs (including some in which

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.810
he sired offspring) and him casting her aside,
he apparently never lost his affection for

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.129
his first wife, nor she for him.

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:31.440
The former couple frequently wrote one another
remarkably intimate letters, with Napoleon

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.330
still often addressing her as “my love”,
writing about everything from day to day matters

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.080
to seeking council about matters of state.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.170
They even visited each other on occasion.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.811
As you might imagine, this was much to the
chagrin of his very jealous second wife, Marie

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:51.229
Louise, who no doubt was well aware that she
was only around instead of Joséphine because

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.700
of her baby making abilities.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.200
And baby making she did do, rather quickly,
providing the heir Napoleon sought.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.759
When Joséphine found out (after having been
sent away for political reasons during the

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:08.300
birth and announcement), she wrote Napoleon
this amazingly touching letter:

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.509
Amid the numerous felicitations you receive
from every corner of Europe…can the feeble

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:19.360
voice of a woman reach your ear, and will
you deign to listen to her who so often consoled

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.069
your sorrows and sweetened your pains, now
that she speaks to you only of that happiness

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:27.319
in which all your wishes are fulfilled!

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:32.539
… I can conceive every emotion you must
experience, as you divine all that I feel

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:38.379
at this moment; and though separated, we are
united by that sympathy which survives all

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:39.379
events.

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:44.280
I should have desired to learn of the birth
of the King of Rome from yourself, and not

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.110
from the sound of the cannon of Evreux, or
the courier of the prefect.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.220
I know, however, that in preference to all,
your first attentions are due to the public

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.080
authorities of the State, to the foreign ministers,
to your family, and especially to the fortunate

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.610
Princess who has realized your dearest hopes.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:09.090
She cannot be more tenderly devoted to you
than I; but she has been enabled to contribute

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.740
more toward your happiness by securing that
of France.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.410
She has then a right to your first feelings,
to all your cares; and I, who was but your

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.280
companion in times of difficulty – I cannot
ask more than a place in your affection far

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.440
removed from that occupied by the Empress
Maria Louisa.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.099
Not till you shall have ceased to watch by
her bed, not till you are weary of embracing

00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:36.530
your son, will you take the pen to converse
with your best friend – I will wait…

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.120
Meanwhile, it is not possible for me to delay
telling you, that more than any one in the

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.320
world do I rejoice in your joy…

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.310
I do not suffer, while you are happy; and
have but one regret, in not having yet done

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.910
enough to prove to you how dear you were to
me….

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:57.399
She likewise wrote a letter to Marie Louise
in an attempt to bury the hatchet, as it were:

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:01.870
While you were only the second spouse of the
Emperor, I deemed it becoming to maintain

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.860
silence toward your Majesty.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.830
That reserve, I think, may be laid aside,
now that you are become the mother of an heir

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.830
to the Empire.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.829
You might have had some difficulty in crediting
the sincerity of her whom perhaps you regarded

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:20.660
as a rival; you will give faith to the felicitations
of a Frenchwoman, for you have bestowed a

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.090
son upon France.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.910
Your amiableness and sweetness of disposition
have gained you the heart of the Emperor – your

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:33.000
benevolence merits the blessings of the unfortunate
– the birth of a son claims the benedictions

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.529
of all France.

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:38.680
How amiable a people, how feeling, how deserving
of admiration, are the French!

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.690
To use an expression which paints them exactly,
“They love to love.”

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.610
Oh, how delightful, then to be loved by them!

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:51.279
It is upon this facility, and at the same
time steadiness of affection, that the partisans

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:56.830
of their ancient kings have so long rested
their expectations; and here their trust is

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.230
not without reason…

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.410
It must be confessed, however, that the Revolution,
without corrupting the heart, has greatly

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:08.560
extended the intelligence, and rendered the
spirits of men more exacting.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.710
Under our kings, they were satisfied with
repose, now they demand glory.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.700
These, Madame, are the two blessings, the
foretaste of which you have been called to

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.850
give to France.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:24.320
She will enjoy them to perfection under your
son, if, to the manly virtues of his sire,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.500
he join those of his august mother, by which
they may be tempered.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.010
At one point, Napoleon even brazenly tried
to get the two women together, hoping they’d

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.750
become bosom buddies, presumably allowing
him to have Joséphine around on occasion.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.459
For Joséphine’s part, she was very keen
on the idea.

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:42.850
However, Napoleon would write of the disastrous
attempt,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.230
I wished one day to take [Marie Louise] to
Malmaison, but she burst into tears when I

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.389
made the proposal.

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:53.700
She said she did not object to my visiting
Joséphine, only she did not wish to know

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.700
it.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.350
But whenever she suspected my intention of
going to Malmaison, there was no stratagem

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.709
which she did not employ for the sake of annoying
me.

00:11:02.709 --> 00:11:03.740
She never left me…

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.790
Still, however, when I did happen to go, I
was sure to encounter a flood of tears and

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.300
a multitude of contrivances of every kind.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.170
Joséphine, as always, was accommodating,
writing, “But [Marie] rejected this proposal

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.930
with such manifest dissatisfaction, that it
was not renewed.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.209
I am sorry for it; her presence would have
given me no uneasiness, and I might have bestowed

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:29.579
good counsel as to the best means of pleasing
the Emperor…”

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:34.800
Of course, as noted, this didn’t stop Napoleon
and Joséphine from incessantly writing to

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800
one another.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.579
In fact, reportedly unlike many other correspondence,
Napoleon nearly always immediately stopped

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:45.740
whatever he was doing to tear open any letter
from Joséphine immediately upon receiving

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.120
it, even occasionally interrupting meetings
while campaigning to do so.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.630
When his son was around two, he also began
secretly allowing Joséphine to see the boy

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.440
so she could get to know him.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.430
This, however, didn’t last owing to the
risk that the growing boy would accidentally

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.250
reveal this fact to his mother.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.610
As Joséphine wrote to Napoleon,

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:08.410
Assuredly, Sire, it was note mere curiosity
which led me to desire to meet the King of

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.959
Rome: I wished to examine his countenance-
to hear the sound of his voice, so like your

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:19.589
own- to behold you caress a son on whom centre
so many hopes,- and to repay him the tenderness

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:22.209
which you lavished on my own Eugene.

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:26.779
When you recall how dearly you loved mine,
you will not be surprised at my affection

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:32.360
for the son of another, since he is yours
likewise, nor deem either false or exaggerated

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.240
sentiments which you have so fully experienced
in your own heart.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.910
The moment I saw you enter, leading the young
Napoleon in your hand, was unquestionably,

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.040
one of the happiest of my life….

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.839
Still I am perfectly sensible, Sire, that
those meetings which afford me so much pleasure,

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:53.940
cannot be frequently renewed, and I must not
so far intrude on your compliance as put it

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.820
often under contribution.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.730
Let this sacrifice to your domestic tranquillity
be one proof more of my desire to see you

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.730
happy.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.410
Later when Napoleon was banished to Elba,
this put Joséphine in a somewhat precarious

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:12.040
political position of still being an unapologetic
Napoleon supporter and former wife of the

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.040
emperor.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.720
In fact, she even technically still held the
title of empress, as Napoleon himself had

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.540
decreed, “It is my will that she retain
the rank and title of empress, and especially

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:27.190
that she never doubt my sentiments, and that
she ever hold me as her best and dearest friend.”

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.710
She needn’t have worried as her reputation
preceded her, with Tsar Alexander I writing

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.760
to her of her status, “I have never heard
your name pronounced but with benedictions.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.699
In the cottage, and in the palace, I have
collected accounts of your angelic goodness…”

00:13:41.699 --> 00:13:45.820
As for Napoleon, his wife and son did not
join him on Elba, resulting in Joséphine

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.940
offering to do so,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.940
…Ah!

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.410
Sire, why cannot I fly to you!

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:54.839
Why cannot I give you the assurance that exile
has no terrors save for vulgar minds, and

00:13:54.839 --> 00:14:00.750
that, far from diminishing a sincere attachment,
misfortune imparts to it new force!

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.699
I have been on the point of quitting France
to follow your footsteps, and to consecrate

00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:10.019
to you the remainder of an existence which
you so long embellished.

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:13.850
A single motive restrained me, and that you
may divine.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:19.380
If I learn that, contrary to all appearance,
I am the only one who will fulfill her duty,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.170
nothing shall detain me, and I will go to
the only place where henceforth there can

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.220
be happiness for me, since I shall be able
to console you when you are there isolated

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.540
and unfortunate!

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.480
Say but the word, and I depart.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.860
Adieu, Sire; whatever I would add would still
be too little; it is no longer by words that

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.870
my sentiments for you are to be proved, and
for actions your consent is necessary…

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.550
Of course, being still married, Napoleon seemingly
could not give that consent.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.540
And, unfortunately for both of them, Joséphine
died suddenly not long after.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.170
Her last recorded words, reportedly spoken
in front of Tsar Alexander I, who was visiting

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.459
at the time, and her son Eugene and daughter
Hortense, were:

00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:04.079
At least I shall die regretted; I have always
desired the happiness of France; I did all

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:09.690
in my power to contribute to it; and I can
say with truth to all of you now present at

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:15.940
my last moments, that the first wife of Napoleon
never caused a single tear to flow.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.509
As for Napoleon, when he received the news
that Joséphine had died, he locked himself

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:21.279
away for two days.

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:26.000
About seven years later, when lying on his
own deathbed, his last recorded words were:

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.779
“France, the Army, the Head of the Army,
Joséphine.”

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:33.360
“Joséphine” wasn’t actually named that.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.500
Her real name was Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher
de la Pagerie.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.720
Before Napoleon, she always went by Rose,
but he disliked that name and began calling

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.460
her Joséphine, a slight variant of “Josèphe”.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.010
He was the first to call her that, but as
he liked it, for the rest of her life she

00:15:48.010 --> 00:16:09.199
went 
by 

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:13.519
that name.
