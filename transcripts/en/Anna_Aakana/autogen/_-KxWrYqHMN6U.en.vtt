00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.460
Over the past 12 years I have always been a partner since my first boyfriend at 15

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.689
I haven't even had three consecutive months being single between relationships like holy fuck and two and a half years ago

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.900
I made the mistake of publicly saying I'm going to be single for a year and then of course immediately meeting a great guy

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.109
So I learned my lamingtons lesson, and I'm not going to say that now

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.160
But I do want to really take this time and focus on myself

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.139
You know I don't know what it's like when I'm not one half of a unit, how do I act?

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
How do I choose to spend my time and with who, like these are the things that I'm really

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.360
curious about. How do I define myself when I'm not factoring someone else's wishes into my life. What is it like when I super saiyan?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.640
 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.780
Oh my god, I look really

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.940
good as a blonde

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.400
Oh, I should have gone Sailor Moon

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.660
I've been feeling weird for a little bit like I didn't realize how much extra time

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.579
I'd have on my hands to just wonder if I'm going to die alone and be eaten by my six cats for their survival until

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.029
Someone eventually discovers my body and it's an honorable death don't get me wrong

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.570
I'm stoked about that kind of death, but it is a possibility that I have to consider

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.250
But on the other hand like now

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250
I have all this extra time to rediscover my

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.330
Creativity and and study new skills and buy a death machine that I was never allowed to get in relationships

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.790
And bonds with my girlfriends and workout and take new classes and watch whatever I want on TV

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.720
while I eat whatever I want to eat that night! It's nice

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.240
Though sometimes I do forget that I'm alone and I'll say things like 'Hey, what's that word for?'

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.420
Oh my god I live alone, who the hell am I talking to?

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.540
I guess I'm talking to you, aren't I? Yes, we're the only ones here

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.760
But you don't know what I'm talking about, you don't understand words!

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.860
You don't know any of that, noooo, no you don't!

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.880
and we're not going to find you a father for a long time

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.020
for a long... long... time

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.380
Single life so far is weird because I'm in that in-between phase where I'm not like heartbroken anymore

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.360
But I'm not exactly like *weird noise* I'm single, independence! So can I be happy being single? Well

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.119
I sure fucking hope so. I know that the first thing

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.569
I need to do is stay single and ignore all the desperate voices in my head

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.270
Urging me to jump into a relationship with anybody because it's comfortable and familiar. And two become the most badass

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.829
Leveled up Super Saiyan version of myself so I can practice self-love and be really happy and three, finally chill

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.219
This is the hardest one for me because I'm such a like gotta

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.699
Do everything now! kind of person that if I'm not pursuing something or someone I feel like I'm not actually living

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.079
So I know that the lesson I need to learn to be happy as a single independent woman

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.809
Is to just be okay with being alone

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.720
Wish me luck. I'm Anna Akana, stay awesome gotham
