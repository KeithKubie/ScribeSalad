00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.060
If we want to understand
where we've come from,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.440
the stories that have led
us to our present condition,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.600
if we want to
understand our history,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.150
one of the
prerequisites is to have

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.620
a good sense of chronometry.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.910
And chronometry,
very fancy word,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.640
but it really is just the
science of the passage of time.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.900
Chrono relating to time.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.710
Metry, time measurement.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.780
And we take many, many things
for granted these days.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.500
We assume that we know
what happened the last 50

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.280
years, the last 100 years.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.860
And now we're
starting to assume we

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.450
know what happened
10,000 years ago,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.560
or what happened to our planet
100 million years ago or 1

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.640
billion years ago.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.140
But these are all very,
very, very new phenomena,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.830
this ability to kind of
shine a light on the past.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.070
And even the traditional
notions of history,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.850
the traditional stories
of, what led to what?

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.270
The political nations that
formed, the migrations

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.590
of people, and then
when they happened,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.270
that traditional
notion of history

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.740
is even fairly
new when you think

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.950
about just the scope of
how long we think humans

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.090
have now been on this planet.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.540
And that first traditional
notion of history

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.600
you can kind of view as the
first chronometric revolution.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.110
And that first
chronometric revolution

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.520
that gives us this kind
of traditional notion

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.300
of history really just comes out
of humanity's ability to write.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.762
So writing gives us our first
chronometric revolution.

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:36.720
Because this was the
first time, even though we

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.180
think humans or
human like creatures

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.290
have been around for
hundreds of thousands

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.780
of years at this
point, they weren't

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.220
able to keep their stories
in a very exact way.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.990
They might have had
an oral tradition.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.400
It might have gone from one
generation to the other.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.620
But with those oral traditions
things would get lost.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.870
And the most important
information that would get lost

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.340
is how long ago did
these stories start up?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.100
And we weren't
able, as a species,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980
to really have a
firm understanding

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.570
of when things happened, and
how long ago things happened

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.740
until writing became mainstream,
and until writing was done

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710
in a way that it
became permanent.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.530
And our best sense of when
this happened the first time

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.460
was by the Sumerians
with cuneiform.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.910
And this happened right around
the third millennia BC, so

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.020
around 5,000 years
before the present time.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.130
And this is what some of that
earliest writing looked like.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.630
This is actually a letter from,
I believe this is from a king.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.380
And you can see it's just
highly symbolic carvings.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.450
This is what we more
traditionally associate

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.950
with cuneiform.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.520
And it was symbolic-based,
as opposed to now.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.470
Most of our languages
are based on phonetics.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.600
So you have fewer symbols that
can represent more meanings.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.920
But this was a huge
technological revolution.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.190
I could say, for humanity,
because now with the advent

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.970
of cuneiform you now had
permanent writing that someone

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.640
could look at 1,000 years
later, 2,000 years later.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.980
And if they can
decipher the cuneiform,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.000
they can get a written
testimony of what

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.560
was happening at
that time, and they

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.670
didn't have to rely
on an oral tradition,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.590
or even guess when that oral
story might have started.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.810
But writing, since it only
happened about 5,000 years

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.815
ago-- so this is 5,000
years before the present,

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:37.210
or you could say 3,000
years BC, give or take.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.040
That was a start.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.220
But this only gave us stories
of about 5,000 years old.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.700
And even then it was a very
spotty historical record.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.440
We didn't really get
really deep history,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.180
depending on where
you are in the world,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.870
until really the last
few thousand years.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.740
But it was a start.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.820
This was the first
chronometric revolution.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.320
But what you may or may
not realize is that we are,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.950
frankly, I believe, at
the very early stages

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.120
of another chronometric
revolution that has really

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.700
just begun to accelerate in
the last 50, 60, 70 years.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.460
And this second
chronometric revolution-- I

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.350
should write
revolution up here too.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.740
This was a revolution.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.329
It allowed us to keep
time in a permanent way,

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.940
to understand things, to not
have to talk to the people

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.410
to whom something happened.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.200
We can see their
written testimony of it.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.850
But the second revolution
really comes out

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.940
of the advent of a lot
of our understanding

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.610
of modern science.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.870
So in the late 1800s
you have radioactivity

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.360
gets discovered by
Marie and Pierre Curie.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.032
So this is 1900 right here.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.240
So this is relatively recent.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.430
Remember, we're talking about
a species that has been around

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.650
for several hundreds
of thousands of years,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.140
and protohumans have been
around for millions of years.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.980
And now only 5,000 years ago,
at least as far as we know,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.910
was the first writing.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.420
And then only a little
over 100 years ago

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.833
was the discovery
of radioactivity.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.907
And then the ability
to use radioactivity.

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:11.240
So radioactivity is interesting.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.710
It's this idea that,
essentially elements, can change

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.770
from one variation to another
of an element over long periods

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.150
of time, so through
radioactivity.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.950
So they become kind
of this natural clock.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.610
No one had to go there and
set up a times piece for it.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.360
That luckily, there
are these things

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.580
that decay at a very
predictable rate.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.140
So we discover radioactivity
a little over 100 years ago,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.490
and then over the course
of the 20th century

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.010
we got better and better,
more sophisticated

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.680
at really understanding
radioactivity

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.710
to be able to use it to
measure the times of things.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.460
And if you fast forward
to the second half

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.680
of the 20th century, so
now say we're at 1950,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.970
this is where the second
chronometric revolution really

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.230
took hold.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.020
This is where it
really took hold,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.420
where we started to
understand carbon-14 dating,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.690
we started to understand
some of the other techniques

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.160
that we talk about as we start
to date older and older things.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.560
And I want to be clear.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.100
The radioactivity, the
understanding of radioactivity,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.670
was just the beginning of this
second chronometric revolution.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.270
The second chronometric,
which frankly, we are still

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.530
a part of, isn't
just radioactivity.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.110
It's also understanding
the expansion

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.870
of the universe, the
constancy, kind of the speed

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.880
limit of light that
now lets us figure out,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.360
wow, that background
radiation we're getting,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.310
that must have been traveling
for 13.7 billion years ago.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.500
So we can now look at
evidence from our environment.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.520
And our environment is
not just the Earth itself.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.470
It's radiation
bombarding us from space

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.440
that gives us clues
as to not just

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.990
the age of us, of humanity,
the age of species,

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.360
the age of the plant, but the
age of the universe itself.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.500
So it isn't just
about radioactivity.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.670
Radioactivity is a big part of
our chronometric revolution.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.210
This is what allowed
us for the first time,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.400
if we have layers on the
Earth, people have known

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.200
for a long time
that if we assume

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.170
that these layers
haven't been jostled,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.580
that something at a lower
layer, down here, is probably

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.690
going to be older than
at an upper layer.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.895
Because year after
year you have deposits,

00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:18.280
if it hasn't been
messed up in some way.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.020
But no one knew.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.290
They said, OK, well,
this is relative dating.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.210
This is older.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.630
This is a younger.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.850
But we had no way of
knowing that, hey,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.880
is this 1,000 years old?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.171
Or is this 1 million years old?

00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:30.590
Or is this 1 billion years old?

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.740
But now with radioactivity
we could start to say,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.790
hey, we can date some
of the rocks here

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.070
that are 150 million years old.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.990
And some of the rocks here are
about 100 million years old.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.620
So maybe this fossil of a
fish that we're finding,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.560
or this primitive fish-like
creature right over here, this

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.537
would be between 100 and
150 million years old.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:52.120
And the only way
we're able to do this

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.070
was with being able to date
things using radioactivity.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.570
But radioactivity
is just the start.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.540
As I mentioned, we're getting
better and better understanding

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.600
of cosmology.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.000
We're getting
better measurements

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.220
of the universe itself.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.460
We're understanding
physics at a deeper level.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.500
Now we can start to
look at the genome,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.730
and think about how the genome
diverges from one species

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.054
to another, and how
quickly it changes.

00:08:15.054 --> 00:08:16.720
So all of these things
are just allowing

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.340
us to get better and better
refinements on the chronology.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.280
Obviously this is a
start, but you still

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.020
don't know plus or minus 50
million years how old this is

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.870
and how this relates to other
things that we might find.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.670
So I just wanted
to point this out,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.660
that what we take
for granted now,

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.489
the age of the universe,
the age of Earth at 4

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:36.110
and 1/2 billion
years old, humans

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.600
being around for several
hundreds of thousands of years,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.159
this understanding is a very,
very, very new phenomenon.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.250
It's due to the second
chronometric revolution

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.510
that I think we are
still a part of.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.650
And even the first
chronometric revolution,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.640
this version of history--
and I want to be clear.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.870
History was limited by this
first chronometric revolution.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.280
It was limited by
whatever was documented.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.507
But now maybe we can expand
our notion of history.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:03.340
And a lot of the videos
I've been working on

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.470
have been for this big history
project, which says, hey,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.960
before history was limited
by the first chronometric

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.100
revolution, to what was written,
by what was testified by people

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.150
and was made
permanent in some way,

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.120
now chronometry has taken us,
so that we can understand things

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.210
into our deep past, before
even the Earth has existed.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.820
So why not redefine
history in a big way

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.430
for it to encompass everything,
for it to be big history.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.800
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.170
And actually I want
to also emphasize

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.970
that the second chronometric
revolutions is a big deal.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.370
It allows us to transform even
our understandings of history.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.100
But even this first
chronometric revolution right

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.100
over here, 5,000
years is still not

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.434
very long in the entire scope
of even human civilization.
