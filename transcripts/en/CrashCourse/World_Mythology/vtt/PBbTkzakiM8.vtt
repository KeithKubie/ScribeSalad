Hi I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today, rather than focus on

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.220
how the earth and what’s around it was created,
we’re going to look specifically at what’s

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.610
on it, more specifically people, and even
more specifically, men and women.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.610
People.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.610
Also the occasional animal.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.900
No, not you Thoth.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.310
You’re a god with an animal head, it’s
different.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.300
Anyway, we’re going to see how myths explain
our origins and our relationships with each

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.519
other, or at least how they try to explain
them.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:38.100
It’s couples therapy, myth style.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.440
INTRO
Myths don’t usually incorporate contemporary

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.920
ideas of gender fluidity, although sometimes
they do--Tireisias, ancient seer, I’m looking

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.920
at you.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.310
As we’ve seen from the Chinese and Zoroastrian
creation stories, myths often tend to focus

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.540
on dualities, or binaries, and one of the
key ones we find is a distinction between

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.270
men and women.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.400
And this binary opposition frequently sets
women as subordinate to men, at least on earth.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.210
In the heavens, it’s a little bit more complicated,
as it tends to be.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.219
Let’s start with a story that is probably
well known to many of our viewers: the creation

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.619
of man and woman from the Bible.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.320
Close readers of the Book of Genesis will
know that there are two or even three creation

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.860
stories in it, which, according to Biblical
scholars reflects different writing traditions.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.140
We’re going to focus on the second one,
found in Genesis 2.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.220
As we join our story, God has already created
the the earth and the heavens and man to till

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.030
the earth, because as we established last
time: Gods don’t like weeding.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.869
Unlike the first version of creation in Genesis,
man is created near the very beginning, which

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.920
suggests that he’s actually pretty important
in the grand scheme of things.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.479
But apparently one man wasn’t enough for
all that Edenic gardening.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.490
Genesis 2 verse 21 begins:
So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.549
upon the man, and while he slept took one
his ribs and closed up its place with flesh:

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.079
and with the rib the Lord God had taken from
the man he made into a woman and brought her

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.079
to the man.

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.590
Then the man said,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.670
This is the bone of my bones and flesh of
my flesh, she should be called Woman, because

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.099
she was taken out of Man.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.380
Therefore a man leaves his father and his
mother and cleaves to his wife and they become

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.400
one flesh.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.260
Here we see an early justification for men
being superior to women and it’s kind of

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.170
based on bad word play.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.000
In the rest of the Genesis story, one of the
things that marks man’s dominion over other

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.959
creatures is that he is given the power to
name them, just as he is permitted to name

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.959
woman here.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.400
The word play here also works in the original
Hebrew, where the word for man is “ish”

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.390
and the word for woman is “isha” Get it!

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.190
She was taken out of man and so even her name
is taken out of man.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.190
Yup.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.190
It’s Hilarious.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.209
Just ask Gelos, Greek god of laughter.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.420
Yeah, tough crowd.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.340
This passage also explains marriage -- although
only between a man and a woman -- and describes

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.640
a social order in which men leave their parents’
household when they marry to have their own

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.640
homes.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.909
Whether this describes a family structure
that already existed or was written in order

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.670
to encourage such a family structure, we can’t
say for certain, but it’s likely that this

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.790
was an after-the-fact description.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.680
Providing a rationalization for what people
encounter in their daily lives is an important

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680
function of myths.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.480
The Bible goes on to refine the “natural”
relationship between men and women and not

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.140
in an especially fun or feminist way.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.790
After they eat the fruit from the tree of
knowledge, God is miffed and he punishes them.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.720
To the woman he said,
I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing;

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.770
In pain you should bring forth children,
Yet your desire shall be for your husband,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.280
And he shall rule over you.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.510
And to Adam he said,
Because you have listened to the voice of

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.760
your wife,
And you have eaten of the tree of which I

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.020
commanded you,
“You shall not eat of it,”

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.760
cursed is the ground because of you;
in toil you shall eat of it all the days of

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.379
your life;
thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.490
you;
and you shall eat the plants of the field.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.249
In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread
Till you return to the ground,

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:17.900
For out of it you were taken;
You are dust, and to dust you shall return.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.660
There’s just a lot going on here.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.950
One way to interpret this is that it provides
justification for man’s dominance over women

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.289
as a punishment for what one woman did in
disobeying god.

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.660
The first punishments directly affect the
experiences of women, causing the pain of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.389
childbirth and desire for a husband that shall
“rule over” her, establishing a patriarchal

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.030
order that really caught on.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.110
Men are punished too, by having to work hard
in order to eat, toiling at bringing food

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.110
out of the ground.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.110
More gardening.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.370
And what is the reward for all this hard work?

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.370
Death.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.370
And returning to the ground.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.460
Not even dental benefits.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.130
Worse yet, as far as solidifying male-dominance
goes, all of this is because man listened

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.390
to the voice of his wife.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.419
So that sets a pretty nasty precedent.

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.450
Greek mythology creates a similar rationale
for misogyny with the story of Pandora.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.389
Even before she opened the jar bringing sorrows
to all the world, Zeus made her as a punishme

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.180
nt for Prometheus who stole fire and gave
it to the humans.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.660
This is in addition to having his liver eaten
by an eagle for all of eternity.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.580
According to Hesiod she would be, “Another
gift to men, an evil thing for their delight.”[1]

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.380
Hermes endowed Pandora with “lies and persuasive
words and cunning ways.”[2] And probably

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.300
also, like, the absolute perfect shade of
lipstick, but before we agree to this image

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.860
of women as conniving and untrustworthy, let’s
pause to remember that it’s Hermes, a male

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.950
god and one of the great misogynists of the
ancient world, who bestows these qualities

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.669
on Pandora, so this is a dude’s hateful
vision of women.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:00.639
Anyway, Zeus gave Pandora as a gift to Prometheus’s
brother Epimetheus, who accepted her, even

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.700
though Prometheus had told him to never accept
a gift from Zeus.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.419
Maybe Zeus gifted lots of socks.

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.599
According to Hesiod, here’s what happened:
Before this time men lived upon the earth

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.340
Apart from sorrow and from painful work,
Free from disease, which brings the Death-gods

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.340
in.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.979
But now the woman opened up the cask,
And scattered pains and evils among men.

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.090
Inside the cask’s hard walls remained one
thing,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.110
Hope, only, which did not fly through the
door.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:38.270
The lid stopped her, but all the others flew,
Thousands of troubles wandering the earth.[3]

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.889
Unfortunately, this concept that a social
order of male dominance and female subordination

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.300
resulting from women acting out of turn, is
not unique to the Biblical or the Greek tradition.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.009
We find a similar story in Japan, just without
an evil serpent or an all powerful death chest.

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.360
Let’s go to the Thoughtbubble.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.650
1.One Japanese creation myth starts with a
young, not fully formed earth that looks something

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.650
like a jellyfish.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.509
2.Three invisible gods came into existence
in Takamagahara, the High Plains of Heaven.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:13.340
These three gods, called kami, were led by
the Lord of the Center of Heaven, Amanominakanushi-no-kami,

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.550
After them were seven more generations of
“heavenly” gods, 3.followed finally by

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.830
the primal couple Izanagi and his wife Izanami,
who was also his sister.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.610
4.Izanagi and Izanami were commanded by the
gods to solidify the drifting land, so they

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.879
went to the Floating Bridge of Heaven and
stirred the soupy liquid below with a spear.

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:37.289
Drops congealed on the tip of the spear, and
formed the island of Onogoro, the first dry

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:38.289
land.

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:41.510
5.The Primal Couple went down to Onogoro and
built a heavenly pillar.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.819
Then they decided to procreate
Izanagi asked his sister how her body was

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:50.650
formed and she told him that there was an
unfinished part between her legs.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.870
He replied that between his legs was an excess
and perhaps the two should join there.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.370
They devised a marriage ritual whereby each
would walk around the pillar, and when they

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.310
met they would exchange compliments and have
intercourse.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.750
6.A child was born, but it was a deformed
leech-child called Hiruko.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.949
Its parents put Hiruko in a boat and set it
out to sea.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:17.280
The gods determined that the reason that the
first child was born deformed was that Izanami

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.569
had spoken first.

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:23.360
7.Izanami and Izanagi returned to the heavenly
pillar in Onogoro and repeated the ritual,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.750
only this time Izanagi spoke first.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:32.089
In due time, Izanami gave birth to an abundant
number of children, islands, gods and goddesses.[4]

00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:33.089
Thank you, Thoughtbubble.

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:38.089
This rationale established male precedence
and female subservience in Japan.

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:42.849
Not only does this myth explain Japanese gender
inequality, it also may explain an ancient

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:48.769
Japanese ritual in which the birth of a first
child was celebrated by putting a clay figurine

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:53.240
into a reed boat and floating it away.[5]
There is often a strong connection between

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.790
myths and rituals.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.320
Many creation stories begin with the idea
that human beings are immortal until something

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.640
or someone intrudes.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.279
Biblical humans were immortal until Adam and
Eve ate from the tree of knowledge, for example.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:11.440
It was human error that brought death into
the world.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.960
Oops.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.470
So we see another theme emerging here.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:22.700
The Biblical, Japanese, and Greek explanations
place the blame for human toil, pain, disease

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.700
on women.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.930
It’s a pernicious idea, and it’s one that
has had profound consequences for gender relations.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.589
Perhaps what we are seeing is a justification
for a system in which men feel it is their

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:39.000
right to rule over women, and find stories
to tell to support it.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.070
After all, there is no logical reason why
women should be blamed.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.070
Men make mistakes, too.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:50.730
We’re gonna get to Phaeton, and that time
he almost burned down the entire Earth, eventually.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.860
Thanks for watching, see you next time.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.950
