00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.080
Humans can discern between 2.3 million colors - but try staring at this picture of us bursting

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.110
through the periodic table and focus on the green dot as we invert the colors. Don't

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.230
stop staring there until I say the light is traveling as a wave to your eye, and the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.119
frequency of these wavelengths determines the perceived color of everything in this

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.460
picture and around you. Humans have trichromatic vision, meaning we have three con cells in

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.640
our retinas, each which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light; blue, green, or red.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.370
Keep looking at the green dot and your brain will do something pretty neat.  Did the image

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.570
change back to the original color? Even though you were staring at a black and white image,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.890
your brain perceived it to be in color.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.820
This phenomenon is known as "after imaging" - after staring long enough at the brightly

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.050
colored image, your cones slowly become fatigued and the supply of photo pigment in the respective

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.980
cones becomes exhausted, which ultimately stops sending signals to the brain.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.470
In case of this illusion, the part of the photo where you can see cyan, the green and blue cones

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.030
become tired and as a result, there is increased activity in the fatigued red cones.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.270
So when the image switched to black and white we see "red" - cyan's complimentary color.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.640
Growing up, you likely learned about the primary colors red, yellow, and blue

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.990
and their respective complimentary colors.  But things are more complicated when you consider that the primary

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.810
colors in your printer are magenta, yellow, and cyan, or that the screen you're watching

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.630
this on uses red, green, and blue.  These are different color models, where RGB is "additive"

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.530
meaning the mixing of different lights of color creates new colors - while the other

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.200
two are "subtractive" models and absorb different wavelengths of light.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.670
For example, when you hold a yellow object in real life,  it's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.380
actually absorbing every wavelength except yellow - that yellow light bounces back and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.950
hits your eyes. But, when you look at this yellow object through your screen, it's actually

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.840
not yellow at all!  Because your screen can only use red, green, and blue colors,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.439
if you were to zoom in physically on anything yellow, it would actually be a combination

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.420
of red and green - and because the wavelength of yellow is between red and green, our brain

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.119
interprets this mix as yellow. So, what you're seeing here is in fact not

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.580
yellow at all, but it's stimulating a mix of your red and green cones

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.170
interprets as yellow!

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.989
While plants come in a range of colors, the predominant color is green, due to chlorophyll,

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.189
the energy absorbing pigment found in plants critical for photosynthesis. So, the effectively

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.180
attract pollinators such as bees, insects, and birds, flowers have evolved to stand out

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.489
against green. It’s why you don’t see many green flowers! And flowering plants have

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.370
even evolved a suite of different colors to attract specific pollinators - known as

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.650
pollinator syndrome. Bird-pollinated flowers are mostly red, potentially to discourage

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.970
visits from bees, as their visual system is different than birds, making it hard from

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.239
them to discriminate between red and green.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.720
Similarly, we all have our own favourite colors, but why? One theory suggests that color preference

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.610
is gendered, where given the choice between cyan and red, men prefer cyan colors and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.900
women prefer redder colors. Researchers hypothesize this preference has evolved from our hunter-gatherer

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.430
societies where women's visual systems were specialized to see ripe red berries against

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.110
green foliage. Another theory suggest that we like hues that we associate with pleasant

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.579
things - however pleasant and unpleasant things are often the same color - we love blue Slurpee

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.700
but not blue mold.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.420
Investigating these questions of color had us thinking about links between science and art

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.870
So in our latest AsapTHOUGHT we asked both artists and scientists about how they

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.849
view the world.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.530
