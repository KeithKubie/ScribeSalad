00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.810
The Joe Rogan experience now when they found that ancient Greek,

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.640
uh,
computer thing on what is that called?
Sierra mechanism?
Yes.

3
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:11.361
Yeah.
Again,

4
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:16.361
not testifies to a lost navigational skill that we have not taken account up

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.950
incredibly complex.

6
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.960
And it took a long time for them to figure out what that even is.
Yeah.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.660
What do they think that is now?

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.150
<v 1>Um,
it,
it tracks the movements of the planets.
It's a,
it's a navigational device.</v>

9
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:29.330
It's a,
it,
it,
it,

10
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:34.090
it's a geared cogged system that allows you to track the passage of time and

11
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:35.290
figure out where you are.
It's,

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.860
it's some kind of navigational devices not fully understood.
And how old is that?

13
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.170
I think that goes back to Greek Times,

14
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:45.040
I'm guessing here because the Greek times are not of great interest to me,

15
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.320
but I'm thinking around about 500 BC.

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.180
<v 0>So at least 2000 years old.
2000 plus.</v>

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.780
And we know that there had to be more than one.
Yeah.

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.900
<v 1>Yes.
It,
you can't,
you can't have something like that without,</v>

19
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.500
without a vast effort behind it.
Human beings.

20
00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:06.640
We're working on creating this geared and cogged machinery,
uh,
that,

21
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:07.540
that reflected that.

22
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.160
<v 0>How was that a recreation?
That's a recreation.
Wow.
Did He,</v>

23
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.500
can you buy one of those?

24
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.680
It looks like you buy that dude find bookmark that we need one right there,

25
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.420
right next to the plasta cells.

26
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.850
<v 1>Sure thing is a,
is a cultural artifact,
which doesn't just appear out of nowhere.</v>

27
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.570
It has,
it has to have a context.
It has to have a background.
And again,

28
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.670
my suggestion would be
perhaps a secret technology.

29
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.760
It's very odd that very few of these have been found.

30
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:41.210
And it may be that ship owners and navigators in Greek times,

31
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.970
we're extremely careful about who they shared this technology with it.

32
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.490
They may,
it may have been as top secret as,
you know,
nuclear power is in,
in,

33
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.880
in our world today.
Oh,
that makes sense.

34
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:57.590
But the fact is that then we have to wait.
It exists.
It's real.

35
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.100
It's there.
And then we must consider what's behind it.
What,

36
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.170
what led to that?

37
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.160
Is that just the latest manifestation of something that that goes much more

38
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:10.940
deeply back into human,
human culture.
And I think that is,
I think,

39
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.780
I suppose my main,
my main message is that we have,
uh,

40
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:19.280
so far untold backstory that we're concentrating entirely on the front story.

41
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.180
And the backstory is missing,
very largely missing from the picture.

42
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:25.670
And what I've tried to do is to fill in bits of the backstory.
