00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:04.857
   &gt;&gt; Good Evening, I'm Jane and
I'd 

00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:11.344
Like to Welcome You to tonight's
event 

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:17.053
which concludes the first term 
of our 

00:01:20.138 --> 00:01:22.138
22nd Poet Laureate Consultant in
Poetry, Tracy.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.302
The Librarian of Congress has 
appointed her to a second term. 

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:31.542
She was eager to do so because 
Tracy has already accomplished a

00:01:31.543 --> 00:01:33.543
great deal in 

00:01:35.203 --> 00:01:37.203
her signature laureate project.

00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:41.917
With this project, Tracy seeks 
to bring more poetry to rural 

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:45.995
communities, communities like 
Fairfield, California, where she

00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:49.877
grew up.
   This spring, with pilot trips

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:51.878
to New 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.780
Mexico, South Carolina and 
Kentucky, 

00:01:57.428 --> 00:02:00.084
Tracy developed the model for 
how she plans to spend her 

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.925
second term. And also on behalf 
of the library, I'd 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.832
like to thank senator of New 
Mexico, Congressman James of 

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.833
South Carolina, 

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:14.896
Congressman Brett of Kentucky 
and their 

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:21.248
staff, of course, and the 
Kentucky State Senator. I'd like

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.249
to thank all of them for 

00:02:25.948 --> 00:02:27.948
making Tracy's spring trip so 
incredibly successful.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:33.894
Tonight, in a talk entitled 
Staying Human, Poetry in the Age

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:38.152
of Technology, Tracy will tell 
you more about her project. 

00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:40.153
She'll also make the case for 
poetry as 

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:44.666
a reprieve from the noise of the
21st century life, and she'll 

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.308
read a selection of her work, 
including some 

00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:54.421
poems from her new anthology, 
American 

00:02:57.904 --> 00:02:59.128
Journal: 50 Poems for Our Time, 
being published with the 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.129
library.

00:03:02.793 --> 00:03:04.821
After that, Ron Charles, editor 
of the Washington Post Book 

00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:07.672
World and host of our Life of a 
Poet series will talk with 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.359
Tracy about her poetry and her 
plans in 

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:16.646
the next year as Poet Laureate. 
I'm very happy that all of you 

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:18.647
could be with us for this 
special evening.

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.545
So please join me in welcoming 
our 

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:28.095
United States Poet Laureate, 
Tracy K. Smith. Thank you.

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.094
(Applause)

00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:39.938
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Thank you.

00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:46.811
Good evening.

00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:50.487
It's such a delight and an honor
to be 

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:53.976
back here in this wonderful, 
wonderful building.

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.278
I wanted to talk about why 
poetry feels 

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:05.342
so important to me now

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:09.862
and a little bit about what 
taking this 

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:13.933
sense of mission into other 
parts of the U.S. has felt like.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.655
And I look forward to continuing
that conversation with Ron 

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.521
Charles in the second half of 
the program.

00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:28.413
Poetry is not the language we 
live in.

00:04:30.078 --> 00:04:32.715
It's not the language of our 
day-to-day errand-running and  

00:04:34.172 --> 00:04:37.014
obligation-fulfilling, not the 
language with which we are asked

00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:40.891
to justify ourselves to the 
outside world.

00:04:44.357 --> 00:04:45.982
It certainly isn't the language 
to which commercial value has 

00:04:45.983 --> 00:04:47.983
been assigned.

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:52.914
But poetry, which awakens our 
senses, frees us from the 

00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:54.915
tyranny of literal 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.389
meaning, and assures us of the 
credible 

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:01.891
reality of emotional truth puts 
us in touch with something 

00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:03.892
bigger than 

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:08.607
language, something I believe 
each of us was perhaps fluent in

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.608
before the moment 

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.478
when language became our chief 
vehicle for meaning.

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.182
Before I go any farther, let me 
say 

00:05:20.244 --> 00:05:22.065
that this lecture, like the 
poetry I write, is the product 

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:24.066
of a particular 

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:28.133
imagination, one as informed by 
belief 

00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:32.008
and a vast and mysterious, and 
yet 

00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:35.678
orderly and purposeful universe,
as by a 

00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:41.634
deep curiosity about the voices 
and lives of strangers. 

00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:43.635
Furthermore, I'm operating on 
the 

00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:48.157
notion that poetry can save me 
from disappearing into the 

00:05:48.158 --> 00:05:50.801
narrow version of myself I may 
be tempted to resort to 

00:05:54.284 --> 00:05:56.929
when I feel lazy, or defeated, 
or when my greedy ego takes 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.178
over.
   I'm operating on the belief 

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:01.179
that 

00:06:02.855 --> 00:06:05.088
poetry can restore me to the 
large, original self I haven't 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.959
yet fully learned to recognize. 
Poets have different names for 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.960
that self.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.096
Stanley called it a "pool of 
energy that has nothing to do 

00:06:17.097 --> 00:06:19.097
with personal 

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:23.066
identity, but that falls away 
from self, blends into the 

00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:25.067
natural universe.

00:06:26.147 --> 00:06:29.000
"  Emerson believed it lived in 
the same place the inner voice 

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:31.001
does, and that it 

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:34.272
had access to the large whole of
which 

00:06:35.318 --> 00:06:37.318
each of us are but small parts, 
what he 

00:06:39.786 --> 00:06:41.003
called the oversoul, "the 
silent, the universal beauty." 

00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:43.262
   Elizabeth Bishop's view of 
such 

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.378
oneness, at least in her famous 
poem In the Waiting Room, is 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.379
less consoling.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.480
Suddenly, from inside came an 
owe of 

00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:01.356
pain, a voice, not very loud or 
long.

00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:07.899
I wasn't at all surprised. Even 
then I knew she was a foolish, 

00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:14.027
timid woman. I might have been 
embarrassed, but wasn't. What 

00:07:14.028 --> 00:07:16.028
took me completely by surprise 
was 

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.999
that it was me, my voice and my 
mouth. Without thinking at all, 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I was my foolish aunt.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.197
I, we, were falling, falling.
   One of poetry's great effects

00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:33.198
through its emphasis on feeling,
association, 

00:07:36.308 --> 00:07:38.308
music, and image, things we 
recognize 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.202
and respond to even before we 
understand why, is to guide us 

00:07:42.203 --> 00:07:44.203
toward the part of 

00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:47.253
ourselves so deeply buried that 
it borders upon the collective.

00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:53.232
Now, I feel strongly about 
poetry for what it offers in 

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:55.233
these terms, but I 

00:07:56.282 --> 00:07:59.157
also, more and more, recognize 
its value as a remedy to the 

00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:01.158
various things that 

00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:05.463
have bombarded our lines of 
sight and our thoughts, and that

00:08:05.464 --> 00:08:07.464
tamper with our 

00:08:10.345 --> 00:08:12.165
ability or even our desire to 
listen to that deeply rooted 

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.847
part of ourselves.
   I'm talking about the many 

00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:16.848
products, 

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:20.506
services, networks, trends, 
apps, tools, 

00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:24.410
toys, as well as the drugs and 
devices for remedying their 

00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:26.411
effects that are 

00:08:27.489 --> 00:08:29.489
pitched at us nonstop.

00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:34.181
in our browser sidebars, in the 
pages 

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.088
of present media, embedded in 
movies and TV shows, on 

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:40.089
airplanes, and taxis, and 

00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:43.141
trains, and even toilet stalls.

00:08:44.802 --> 00:08:46.841
I guess more and more I see the 
technology we live, listening 

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:49.078
for and hearing into, as the 
primary and most 

00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:54.744
effective vehicle of that sales 
pitch.

00:08:58.243 --> 00:08:59.666
, so much so that I now wonder 
what came first -- the device, 

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:02.915
or whatever the device is urging
us to click on and pay for.

00:09:06.793 --> 00:09:08.830
The glib, facile, simplistic and
prefabricated language by which 

00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:10.865
we as consumers are constantly 
surrounded it a 

00:09:15.353 --> 00:09:17.201
language that flatters us, that 
urges us to indulge ourselves, 

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:19.202
to get away from 

00:09:21.064 --> 00:09:23.702
it all, to be unique by opting 
in, talking back, liking us on 

00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:25.703
Facebook, 

00:09:27.156 --> 00:09:29.156
leaving a review, sharing, 
re-tweeting, etc.

00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:34.491
It's a sell so smooth that its 
terms have infiltrated the 

00:09:34.492 --> 00:09:37.746
language of other facets of 
daily life -- that of education.

00:09:40.387 --> 00:09:42.843
Rate your  Professor, does she 
make the material relatable and 

00:09:42.844 --> 00:09:46.748
easily digestible, or did you 
have to work to learn something.

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:52.247
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: What are the 

00:09:52.248 --> 00:09:56.113
job outcomes and earning 
potentials of your intended 

00:09:56.114 --> 00:10:00.380
major? Individual self-hood has 
taken on a different tenor. We 

00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:02.381
brand ourselves.

00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:05.675
What an awful verb, aligned as 
it is with the practice of 

00:10:05.676 --> 00:10:08.526
burning the owner's  initials 
into flesh.

00:10:12.188 --> 00:10:14.188
We vie for followers on social 
media.

00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:17.268
We turn our experience into 
content 

00:10:18.522 --> 00:10:20.522
that can be assimilated and 
liked, 

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.826
quickly and reassuringly by 
others in our network. 

00:10:24.827 --> 00:10:26.827
Friendship is different now, 
too.

00:10:28.276 --> 00:10:30.328
We have allowed conversation to 
be splintered and atomized by 

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:33.629
the devices we invite to 
interrupt and distract us.

00:10:36.288 --> 00:10:38.288
We aren't listening to what or 
whom we think we are.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:44.052
I go so far as to say that much 
of the time, perhaps as an 

00:10:44.053 --> 00:10:48.735
unconscious coping mechanism, we
aren't listening at all, not to 

00:10:48.736 --> 00:10:50.736
other  people, and least of all 
to ourselves.

00:10:53.198 --> 00:10:55.198
We can't afford to.

00:10:57.272 --> 00:10:59.272
What does this have to do with 
poetry?

00:11:04.012 --> 00:11:06.012
As a writer, I'm convinced one 
of the 

00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:09.729
only defenses against the 
delegation of our market-driven 

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.730
culture is to cling to 

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:15.038
language that fosters humility, 
awareness of complexity, 

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:17.039
commitment to 

00:11:18.906 --> 00:11:20.537
the lives of others, and a 
resistance to the easy and 

00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:22.538
false.

00:11:24.796 --> 00:11:26.427
Poetry is one vehicle for this 
humanizing version of language, 

00:11:26.428 --> 00:11:29.280
because the features of the poem
insist upon a 

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:39.669
different value system. Rather 
than numbing or drowning out the

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.506
difficult to describe, but 
urgently sensed feelings that 

00:11:41.507 --> 00:11:46.816
are part of being human, poetry 
invites us to tease them out, to

00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:48.817
draw them into language that is 

00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:53.752
rooted in intricate thought and 
strange impulse. Rather than 

00:11:53.753 --> 00:11:56.398
putting up a buffer between 
ourselves and those outside our 

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:03.565
immediate sphere, poems devise 
means to contemplate those 

00:12:03.566 --> 00:12:05.566
others and to take in their 
perspective.

00:12:06.805 --> 00:12:08.805
Rather than solving, 
side-stepping, 

00:12:11.268 --> 00:12:12.696
or denying problems, poems bear 
witness to dark facets of 

00:12:12.697 --> 00:12:18.222
experience. They give us 
vocabulary for the terror, the 

00:12:18.223 --> 00:12:20.223
shame, the regret, as well as 
the 

00:12:21.684 --> 00:12:23.684
terms of hope resulting from the
choices 

00:12:25.141 --> 00:12:27.580
we make and those we consent to.
In other words, poems say hey, 

00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.227
come here, let me tell you what 
it was like.

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:36.152
And they ask us to submit to 
another experience of reality.

00:12:40.026 --> 00:12:42.679
They disorient us from our home 
base and they teach us to admit 

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.680
and submit to 

00:12:45.757 --> 00:12:48.011
the feeling of  vulnerability, 
to act upon empathy and 

00:12:48.012 --> 00:12:50.012
curiosity, and to 

00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:53.099
follow along, allowing sense to 
accrue 

00:12:55.403 --> 00:12:57.403
at its own pace and upon its own
terms.

00:12:57.457 --> 00:12:59.690
If you do that enough times with
a poem, you might begin to think

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:04.129
differently about actual 
strangers.

00:13:05.589 --> 00:13:07.415
You might also begin to 
recognize that there are new 

00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:10.260
possibilities of feeling and 
awareness available to you, ones

00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:14.529
that take you far beyond those 
pitched 

00:13:15.584 --> 00:13:17.816
to you by the marketing teams, 
the corporations whose products 

00:13:17.817 --> 00:13:19.817
are at the 

00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:22.911
moment enjoying a good run.

00:13:24.794 --> 00:13:27.648
In case I haven't said it 
clearly, the language 

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:29.649
circulating upon the surface of 

00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:33.308
the 21st century is in the 
business of 

00:13:34.568 --> 00:13:36.568
pulling us away from the 
interior, the 

00:13:38.032 --> 00:13:40.032
reflective, the singular, the 

00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:43.292
impractical, and the 
un-summarizable.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.575
In such occurrence, the language
of poetry is a radically 

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.576
re-humanizing 

00:13:49.636 --> 00:13:50.853
force because it is one of the 
only generally accessible 

00:13:50.854 --> 00:13:52.854
languages that 

00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:56.357
rewards us for naming things in 
their realness and their 

00:13:56.358 --> 00:14:01.241
complexity. And despite what 
social media would have us 

00:14:01.242 --> 00:14:03.242
believe, it is not the language 

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.910
of sharing, and following, or 
buying and 

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.960
wearing, but rather that of 
bearing deep 

00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:13.205
and un-abashed witness to the 
urgencies 

00:14:14.672 --> 00:14:16.672
and upheavals of lived 
experience that 

00:14:17.925 --> 00:14:19.925
comes closest to bringing us 
into 

00:14:21.383 --> 00:14:23.383
visceral proximity with the 
lives and plights of others.

00:14:24.647 --> 00:14:26.647
That's not just distraction, and
it's not a luxury.

00:14:28.712 --> 00:14:30.712
It's a means of 
self-preservation, a 

00:14:31.777 --> 00:14:34.215
way of affirming commitment to 
the belief that our lives can 

00:14:34.216 --> 00:14:36.216
and should 

00:14:37.491 --> 00:14:39.491
matter to one another and to 
ourselves.

00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:43.169
So this might be a good time for
a poem.

00:14:46.096 --> 00:14:48.096
Can we listen to Laura read her 
poem Heart Mine?

00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:51.145
&gt;&gt; Heart, mine.

00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:55.824
A bear batting at a beehive.

00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:01.163
How clumsy the mind was with the
heart, wanting what it wanted. 

00:15:01.164 --> 00:15:03.202
The accountant, how timidly the 
heart approached the business of

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.237
the mind,  counting what it 
counted.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.310
Light inside a cage, the way the
heart, bird trapped in an 

00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.151
airport, the way the mind. How 
it flashed on the floor of the 

00:15:15.597 --> 00:15:20.289
phone booth, my last dime, and 
this letter I didn't send. How 

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.290
surprising to find it now, all 
this love I must have felt.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.988
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I love how 
that sounds like a landline 

00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:29.016
phone call from long distance.
   (Laughter)

00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:31.626
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Sometimes maybe 
that's what poems are like.

00:15:35.156 --> 00:15:37.193
They return us even just to the 
recent past that feels so remote

00:15:37.194 --> 00:15:39.194
and real.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.270
I think any successful poem 
teaches you how to read it.

00:15:44.748 --> 00:15:46.748
In this case, hear it.

00:15:49.216 --> 00:15:51.042
And Laura's poem Heard Mind 
provides a good road map to that

00:15:51.043 --> 00:15:54.306
process, beginning with the 
title. You don't have it in 

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:57.979
front of you, but it's 
Heart/Mind. So the first thing a

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.980
reader might ask 

00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:04.069
is, what is that slash meant to 
signal?

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.332
Is the poem called Heart/Mind, 
is it 

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.480
heart-mind, or as a participant 
in a conversation that I had 

00:16:13.481 --> 00:16:15.481
recently at a 

00:16:16.937 --> 00:16:19.406
men's addiction rehabilitation 
center in Kentucky pointed out, 

00:16:19.407 --> 00:16:21.407
perhaps it is 

00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:26.129
heart over mind, an emotional 
reversal of the common notion of

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.130
mind over matter.

00:16:29.997 --> 00:16:32.848
So the poem invites you to 
question and theorize. And then 

00:16:32.849 --> 00:16:34.849
it begins to tell you what it 
thinks of itself.

00:16:39.386 --> 00:16:41.421
In this poem, I'm going to 
repeat the early stanzas, with 

00:16:41.422 --> 00:16:46.521
metaphors that unfold into 
concrete and surprising visceral

00:16:46.522 --> 00:16:49.572
examples over the span of a few 
lines. They set up a pattern 

00:16:49.573 --> 00:16:51.609
that becomes useful to the 
reader once the poem 

00:16:56.853 --> 00:16:58.853
becomes more spare and

00:17:00.556 --> 00:17:02.556
gesturel.

00:17:03.806 --> 00:17:06.679
A bear batting at a beehive, how
clumsy the mind always was with 

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.531
the heart, wanting what it 
wanted.

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.473
The blizzard's accountant, how 
timidly the heart approached the

00:17:16.474 --> 00:17:19.915
business of the mind, counting 
what it counted.

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.401
I love what happens when I get 
these strange images that give 

00:17:24.402 --> 00:17:26.402
me an intense, you know, like, 
feeling.

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:31.128
A bear batting at a beehive. Not
only do we have all those silly,

00:17:33.173 --> 00:17:35.173
fun bees, but you have the image
of this 

00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:38.434
big animal, angrily and hungrily

00:17:39.681 --> 00:17:42.525
swatting at is something. And 
you have a sense of danger, 

00:17:42.526 --> 00:17:46.803
threat and counterthreat, on 
both sides of the equation. So 

00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:48.804
the poem begins with this 
strange 

00:17:50.271 --> 00:17:52.927
sense of fraught balance. And 
then how clumsy, which 

00:17:54.755 --> 00:17:59.226
characterizes that bear.
   So it's not such a threat. 

00:17:59.227 --> 00:18:01.676
It's just ham-fisted. How clumsy
the mind always was with the 

00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:06.784
heart. And suddenly the heart is
the hive. There's something in 

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:10.415
there that is wanted and also 
worth protecting. Wanting what 

00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:12.416
it wanted.

00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:15.304
So those first four lines of the
poem guide you into a sense of 

00:18:15.305 --> 00:18:20.222
all of the potential registers 
of emotion that are making this 

00:18:20.223 --> 00:18:24.088
metaphor happen. And the  second
-- or the third stanza does the 

00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:28.352
same thing. The blizzard's 
accountant. I don't have a way 

00:18:28.353 --> 00:18:30.353
of picturing that.

00:18:31.604 --> 00:18:33.844
I'm already kind of like on 
alert from having had some 

00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:35.845
senses activated by the 

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:40.974
if IRS first metaphor, but I've 
got to let the next stanza show 

00:18:40.975 --> 00:18:42.975
me what to see.
   How timidly.

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.325
Maybe that's the accountant, the
heart approaches the business of

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:49.326
the mind. Of course.

00:18:53.474 --> 00:18:55.474
What kind of math would suffice 
in the 

00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:59.630
face of a blizzard's worth of 
snow? And yet,  counting what it

00:18:59.631 --> 00:19:03.116
counted, the heart persists. By 
the time in the poem that we 

00:19:03.117 --> 00:19:05.117
reach 

00:19:08.201 --> 00:19:10.201
the lines, light inside a cage, 
the way 

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:13.875
the heart -- which ends with a 
dash -- 

00:19:17.771 --> 00:19:22.882
bird, trapped in an airplane the
airport the way the mind, dash. 

00:19:22.883 --> 00:19:25.146
We can instinctively see the 
little drama that is to be 

00:19:25.147 --> 00:19:27.800
played out in our imagination.
   Those lines become a 

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:31.880
shorthand for a process that we 
are now educated and equipped to

00:19:31.881 --> 00:19:33.919
complete on our own. Yet even 
having taught us how to work 

00:19:37.014 --> 00:19:38.846
with what we've come to expect, 
the poem still manages to 

00:19:38.847 --> 00:19:42.724
surprise us. I love this. I 
think every poem, every fully 

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:48.447
realized poem, finds a way to 
surprise its reader. Moreover, 

00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:51.300
as a poet, I understand that a 
poem is only finished, only 

00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:53.301
fully 

00:19:54.355 --> 00:19:55.782
realized if it succeeds in 
alerting me to something I 

00:19:55.783 --> 00:19:58.627
couldn't have been capable of 
seeing at the outset, 

00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:04.525
something I couldn't have known 
to say were it not for all of 

00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:07.172
the things that the process of 
writing the poem has led me to 

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:09.806
say.
   Her poem moves through images

00:20:09.807 --> 00:20:16.304
of the heart as an indomitable 
beacon, something uncagable. And

00:20:16.305 --> 00:20:18.779
then the image of the mind, 
trapped, bumping up against 

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.455
invisible barriers, forever 
barred from where it seeks to 

00:20:21.456 --> 00:20:26.148
go. And then she leaps from 
there to the sense of 

00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:28.149
frustration and desperation in 

00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:31.642
that image of the last dime on 
the mucky, disgusting phone 

00:20:31.643 --> 00:20:34.293
booth floor. Speaking of 
technology.

00:20:34.495 --> 00:20:36.528
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Let me 

00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:38.529
concede that there are some 
things that have 

00:20:41.605 --> 00:20:43.605
definitely been improved upon.
   (Laughter)

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.893
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: All of the 
visceral feelings that the poem 

00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:47.894
draws upon from its very opening
work to invest its 

00:20:51.812 --> 00:20:53.243
arrival with a palpably felt 
urgency. I don't believe it was 

00:20:53.244 --> 00:20:55.244
a plan, something outlined and 
plotted from the 

00:20:57.725 --> 00:20:59.753
start, but rather that moving 
through the register of those 

00:20:59.754 --> 00:21:04.833
different, distinct feelings  
created the momentum that pulled

00:21:04.834 --> 00:21:06.834
her to the poem's closure, 

00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:09.834
which

00:21:11.161 --> 00:21:13.185
incidentally, resists metaphor. 
Perhaps the poem is free from 

00:21:13.186 --> 00:21:17.879
the need for corollary, invested
as it is in the confluence of 

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.319
newly activated feelings.
   These are the final lines of 

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.320
the poem.

00:21:23.773 --> 00:21:26.215
This letter I didn't send, how 
surprising to find it now.

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:32.279
All this love I must have felt.

00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:36.187
And how did this poem speak to 
my concerns about  market-driven

00:21:36.188 --> 00:21:38.188
language? I think about it this 
way.

00:21:41.719 --> 00:21:43.548
We don't read poems only for 
their rhetorical stance they 

00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:49.046
take, or for the arguments they 
may actively or subtly make 

00:21:49.047 --> 00:21:51.047
about their conscious material.

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:54.944
We also -- and I'd argue, mostly
-- read them for how they direct

00:21:54.945 --> 00:21:59.213
our attention in ways that are 
antithetical to mere utility.

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:05.127
In Heart/Mind, Laura is not 
making editorial-like claims 

00:22:05.128 --> 00:22:07.770
against the language of the 
marketplace or of commodity.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.030
But in urging us to think and 
respond 

00:22:15.708 --> 00:22:17.534
as it does, the poem 
persuasively unsettles the 

00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:20.380
unthinking or automatic ways we 
often experience content, 

00:22:23.226 --> 00:22:25.226
language, and narrative.

00:22:26.277 --> 00:22:28.514
It is in this manner that this 
and other poems invite our 

00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:30.758
dissatisfaction with the view of
the world as a place 

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.459
made up mostly of resources to 
exhaust or consume.

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:40.079
Let's listen to another poem.

00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:43.533
This is called Music from  
Childhood by John Yao.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.920
&gt;&gt; Music from childhood.

00:22:55.586 --> 00:22:58.084
You grew up hearing two 
languages. Neither fits your 

00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:00.085
fits.

00:23:01.545 --> 00:23:03.605
Your mother informs you moon 
means window to another world.

00:23:08.094 --> 00:23:09.716
You begin to hear words born of 
sounds buried inside their 

00:23:09.717 --> 00:23:13.794
mouths. A row of yellow windows 
and a painting of them.

00:23:17.659 --> 00:23:21.937
Your mother informs you moon 
means window to another world. 

00:23:21.938 --> 00:23:24.175
You decide it is better to step 
back and sit in the shadows.

00:23:28.232 --> 00:23:32.316
A row of yellow windows and a 
pint painting of them. Someone 

00:23:32.317 --> 00:23:37.217
says you can see a blue pa goda,
or a red rocket ship. You decide

00:23:37.218 --> 00:23:39.658
it is better to step back and 
sit in the shadows.

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:48.220
Is it because you saw a black 
asteroid fly past your window? 

00:23:48.221 --> 00:23:50.656
Someone said you could see a 
blue pagoda or a red rocket 

00:23:50.657 --> 00:23:52.657
ship.

00:23:53.713 --> 00:23:55.713
I tried to follow in your 
footsteps, 

00:23:57.173 --> 00:23:59.173
but they turned to water.

00:24:00.466 --> 00:24:04.779
Is it because I saw a black 
asteroid fly past my window? The

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.780
air hums.

00:24:08.076 --> 00:24:11.735
A circus performer riding a 
bicycle towards the ceiling. I 

00:24:11.736 --> 00:24:14.197
tried to follow in your 
footsteps, but they turned to 

00:24:14.198 --> 00:24:16.198
water.

00:24:18.687 --> 00:24:21.143
The town has started sinking 
back into its commercial. The 

00:24:21.144 --> 00:24:23.144
air hums.

00:24:24.597 --> 00:24:26.848
The circus performer riding a 
bicycle towards the ceiling.

00:24:30.172 --> 00:24:32.443
You grew up hearing two 
languages. Neither fits your 

00:24:32.444 --> 00:24:34.444
fits.

00:24:36.734 --> 00:24:38.734
The town has started sinking 
back into its commercial.

00:24:41.015 --> 00:24:43.054
You begin to hear words more in 
the sounds buried inside their 

00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:45.055
mouths.

00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:49.589
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: So this poem 
behaves quite differently.

00:24:54.073 --> 00:24:56.073
Firstly, you probably noticed a 
little 

00:24:57.138 --> 00:24:58.973
bit of repetition, not enough to
make you confident of a pattern 

00:24:58.974 --> 00:25:00.974
that you were going to be able 
to anticipate.

00:25:04.631 --> 00:25:07.115
So this poem is a pantoom, the 
second and fourth lines of 

00:25:10.771 --> 00:25:13.650
the poem occur further down, 
only once, and then the next 

00:25:13.651 --> 00:25:16.101
stanza, the lines that sit in 
that place will occur further 

00:25:16.711 --> 00:25:18.711
down.

00:25:22.983 --> 00:25:24.983
And so it creates this sense of 
eerie

00:25:28.342 --> 00:25:30.368
deja vu, almost like you're 
being gaslighted, did I hear 

00:25:30.369 --> 00:25:32.833
that, do I know that? Some of 
the other behavior in the poem, 

00:25:34.258 --> 00:25:35.884
you probably  noticed there are 
statements that don't finish.

00:25:35.885 --> 00:25:39.564
   And there are shifting 
pronouns. There's a you that's 

00:25:39.565 --> 00:25:41.565
being addressed 

00:25:42.827 --> 00:25:46.077
that seems like maybe the 
speaker talking to himself. Then

00:25:46.078 --> 00:25:48.736
later that you seems to become a
specific person. I tried to 

00:25:48.737 --> 00:25:54.234
follow in your footsteps, but 
they turned to water. There are 

00:25:54.235 --> 00:25:56.472
visual images in the poem. 
There's a sense of place.

00:26:00.956 --> 00:26:02.798
But none of it feels anchored so
that I could confidently say 

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:07.717
these are the terms of this 
person's life. What I do feel 

00:26:07.718 --> 00:26:09.768
confident of is what seems to 
accrue emotionally through the 

00:26:12.846 --> 00:26:14.846
poem, the sense of searching, of
turning 

00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:20.388
back, of recalling something 
that's partially clear.

00:26:22.232 --> 00:26:24.232
There's even an interesting way 
that 

00:26:25.686 --> 00:26:27.308
some of -- you don't have the 
line breaks in front of you, so 

00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:29.309
you have to trust me.

00:26:32.196 --> 00:26:34.018
but one line leads into another 
in a way that almost feels 

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:36.019
linear and logical, and then 
something shifts.

00:26:38.921 --> 00:26:40.921
So in the second stanza of the 
poem, 

00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:44.381
the beautiful line, you begin to
hear 

00:26:46.053 --> 00:26:49.316
words mourn the sounds buried 
inside their mouths. I can't 

00:26:49.317 --> 00:26:51.317
tell you exactly what that 
means.

00:26:54.218 --> 00:26:56.056
But mourn, sounds, buried, 
mouths, creates a kind of 

00:26:56.057 --> 00:26:58.533
authority for the line that I'm 
going to goal upon a bit more.

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:01.389
   And I think of loss, of 
language and voices.

00:27:05.055 --> 00:27:07.303
But then the next line -- so 
buried inside their mouths, a 

00:27:07.304 --> 00:27:11.763
row of yellow. And maybe this is
just me, but after mouths and I 

00:27:11.764 --> 00:27:13.764
see a row of yellow, I think 
maybe teeth or something is what

00:27:16.254 --> 00:27:17.878
I'll see next, but no, a row of 
yellow windows and a painting of

00:27:17.879 --> 00:27:19.879
them.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.140
So suddenly we go from this 
almost 

00:27:25.212 --> 00:27:27.459
philosophical, mournful 
perspective to a shifted gaze of

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.505
looking out, maybe looking out.
   Maybe it's just a painting of

00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:35.415
someone -- something that is 
looked out upon. So it's a poem 

00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:37.488
that's not going to guide you by
the hand.

00:27:44.226 --> 00:27:46.867
But if you surrender to did you 
get it, you feel many things. I 

00:27:46.868 --> 00:27:49.109
think about maybe someone who 
grew up in a household with more

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.110
than one language.

00:27:52.802 --> 00:27:55.254
But I also feel the sense of 
interiority and privacy that's 

00:27:55.255 --> 00:27:57.255
so active 

00:27:58.715 --> 00:28:00.742
in this poem that I feel that 
any  person, anywhere is living 

00:28:00.743 --> 00:28:03.187
in two languages.
   The language of the self, and

00:28:03.188 --> 00:28:05.225
the language that comes from 
outside.

00:28:10.737 --> 00:28:12.535
I shared this poem at an air 
Force base in New Mexico with 

00:28:12.536 --> 00:28:14.536
men and women 

00:28:16.438 --> 00:28:18.473
enlisted in the air force and 
air base employees and military 

00:28:18.474 --> 00:28:22.345
spouses. It's the kind of poem 
that requires you to let go of 

00:28:22.346 --> 00:28:24.790
that wish for linear narrative 
and respond instead to the 

00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:29.886
tone, the accrual of images, to 
the almost haunting effects of 

00:28:29.887 --> 00:28:33.134
hearing every line repeated once
and no more.

00:28:36.024 --> 00:28:38.024
I asked what people noticed. 
That's the question I asked the 

00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:42.400
students in my classroom, as 
well as the audience members who

00:28:42.401 --> 00:28:46.675
have attended readings I've 
given in rural communities in 

00:28:46.676 --> 00:28:48.710
New Mexico, South Carolina, and 
Kentucky over the last several  

00:28:48.711 --> 00:28:50.711
months.

00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:55.683
And just as with Laura's poem, 
which in a room of men working 

00:28:55.684 --> 00:28:59.363
to overcome addiction activated 
very specific memories of 

00:28:59.364 --> 00:29:01.364
struggling with similar 

00:29:02.654 --> 00:29:04.654
questions of mind over -- or 
reason 

00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.763
versus feeling or urge, John's 
poem reminded airmen of their 

00:29:08.764 --> 00:29:13.063
time in the service, of seeking 
perhaps to follow in the 

00:29:13.064 --> 00:29:15.723
footsteps of a parent or family 
member, and then finding 

00:29:15.724 --> 00:29:20.196
themselves in their own lives 
lost at times without a clear 

00:29:20.197 --> 00:29:23.053
model or guide.
   The poem with its sense of 

00:29:24.914 --> 00:29:27.754
rootlessness, of struggle to 
make sense of disparate 

00:29:27.755 --> 00:29:30.386
languages, also reminded people 
of displacement, the kind one 

00:29:33.236 --> 00:29:35.687
feels in childhood or 
adolescence, as well as the kind

00:29:35.688 --> 00:29:37.688
one feels upon being 

00:29:38.958 --> 00:29:40.780
deployed, say, or being uprooted
again and again by assignment in

00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:44.271
different places. One audience 
member spoke about the 

00:29:46.311 --> 00:29:48.965
occasional feelings of social or
racial isolation he sometimes 

00:29:48.966 --> 00:29:52.026
feels in the service.
   Just as none of the addicts 

00:29:52.027 --> 00:29:54.027
felt the 

00:29:55.695 --> 00:29:57.924
need to argue that  Laura's poem
is about addiction, nobody at 

00:29:57.925 --> 00:29:59.925
the men's 

00:30:01.184 --> 00:30:02.823
rehab center felt the need to 
say John's is a poem -- I'm 

00:30:02.824 --> 00:30:05.704
sorry. Nobody at the air force 
base felt the 

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:10.799
need to say that Yao's is a poem
about being in the armed forces.

00:30:12.864 --> 00:30:15.512
But in both cases, the poems 
afforded listeners with new 

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:20.813
images, new metaphors, and new 
vocabularies for living with the

00:30:20.814 --> 00:30:22.814
feelings indigenous to 

00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:26.118
their lives, whoever they were.
   That's one of the remarkable 

00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:29.580
things poems do. One of the ways
poems lead us first 

00:30:33.657 --> 00:30:35.481
more deeply into ourselves, and 
then more naturally toward the 

00:30:35.482 --> 00:30:40.159
areas of common feeling we share
with  others. That's how poems 

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.608
teach us to recognize that there
are forms of community that 

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.497
exist across or inside of the 
obvious dividing lines we're 

00:30:48.498 --> 00:30:50.498
taught to respect.

00:30:51.747 --> 00:30:53.747
My rural outreach  project, even
in 

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.493
just three pilot trips, has 
awakened a belief in the real 

00:30:58.494 --> 00:31:01.343
possibility that we might learn 
to become open to 

00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:07.264
participation in realtime 
communities forged along varied 

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:11.150
and sometimes unlikely lines.
   And it's urged a powerful 

00:31:11.151 --> 00:31:13.151
submission 

00:31:15.053 --> 00:31:17.270
to feelings of shared 
vulnerability, humility, doubt, 

00:31:17.271 --> 00:31:21.790
and trust. It's been a privilege
to share my own work and the 

00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:23.791
work of other contemporary 

00:31:26.054 --> 00:31:27.878
poets with strangers that 
crowdsourcing algorithms tell me

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:29.914
I ought to have nothing in 
common with.

00:31:33.368 --> 00:31:35.811
And to hear people say things 
like, I'm white. You're black. 

00:31:35.812 --> 00:31:39.680
I'm from this place. You're from
another. And yet when you talk 

00:31:39.681 --> 00:31:41.681
about your 

00:31:43.757 --> 00:31:47.029
father, you re-stormy restore my
own father to me. This that 

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.030
happens again and again though 
the vocabulary is different from

00:31:50.087 --> 00:31:52.087
person to person and poem to 
poem.

00:31:52.116 --> 00:31:54.116
I think my interest in such a 
project 

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.044
is an extension of my own belief
or wish that Americans of all 

00:31:59.045 --> 00:32:02.324
backgrounds might have something
quietly urgent and humanizing to

00:32:02.325 --> 00:32:06.800
offer one another. But in order 
to get to it, we have to turn 

00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:09.257
down the volume on all the many 
sources seeking to sell us on 

00:32:09.258 --> 00:32:11.258
the notion 

00:32:13.516 --> 00:32:15.516
of an unmendable divide, because
that's what they're doing.

00:32:18.015 --> 00:32:20.654
They're selling us on a product 
which is strife. In order to get

00:32:20.655 --> 00:32:22.655
to community, we have 

00:32:24.518 --> 00:32:26.518
to go quiet, slow down, allow 
ourselves 

00:32:28.186 --> 00:32:30.457
to be both vulnerable and brave,
and approach one another with an

00:32:30.458 --> 00:32:32.458
idea as 

00:32:33.905 --> 00:32:35.956
simple as I'm me, you're you, 
we're not the same, and yet 

00:32:35.957 --> 00:32:40.631
perhaps we can feel safe here 
together talking about something

00:32:40.632 --> 00:32:44.313
as simple as a poem.
   Poems encourage the notion 

00:32:44.314 --> 00:32:49.225
that your life must be as 
important to you as mine is to 

00:32:49.226 --> 00:32:54.535
me. And they encourage the more 
difficult notion that your life 

00:32:54.536 --> 00:32:56.536
must be as 

00:32:59.208 --> 00:33:01.208
important to me as my own life, 
that I 

00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:05.116
can only truly honor and protect
myself by honoring and 

00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:07.975
protecting you. Now, maybe that 
last bit is a distant dream.

00:33:11.036 --> 00:33:13.892
The purview of a few great poets
and philosophers. But I hope it 

00:33:13.893 --> 00:33:15.893
isn't.

00:33:16.941 --> 00:33:19.798
Either way, I believe that 
poetry helps bridge the gap 

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:21.799
between self-centeredness 

00:33:22.874 --> 00:33:24.874
and tribalism, and true 
compassion.

00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.128
Poems do this in myriad ways.

00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:30.185
One of them is by helping to 
inoculate 

00:33:31.845 --> 00:33:34.282
us against the catchy, 
inescapable, strategically  

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:36.283
biased language of the 

00:33:38.568 --> 00:33:41.031
market, firing away at us from 
every direction in its ceaseless

00:33:41.032 --> 00:33:45.950
ploy to be the only language. 
Thank you.

00:33:49.171 --> 00:33:51.171
(Applause)

00:33:58.006 --> 00:34:00.006
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Thank you.

00:34:01.879 --> 00:34:04.737
Okay. Thank you.

00:34:14.338 --> 00:34:20.250
Thank you. I want to welcome Ron
Charles up to the stage. I want 

00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:22.487
to welcome Ron Charles up to the
stage.

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:27.501
(Applause)

00:34:31.058 --> 00:34:35.555
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: So beautiful 
and inspiring. This is on.

00:34:36.988 --> 00:34:38.988
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: No secrets up 
here now.

00:34:39.653 --> 00:34:41.653
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Thank you.

00:34:44.597 --> 00:34:46.643
Let me get this for my Instagram
followers.

00:34:49.648 --> 00:34:51.648
(Laughter)

00:34:57.654 --> 00:35:02.117
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: A few years 
ago in an essay, you asked with 

00:35:02.118 --> 00:35:04.118
a certain degree 

00:35:05.434 --> 00:35:07.261
of exasperation, why is there a 
vast majority in this country 

00:35:07.262 --> 00:35:09.485
that suspects poetry has nothing
to do with the real world?

00:35:13.565 --> 00:35:15.565
What is the source of that 
suspicion?

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.230
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Well, I'm 
biased.

00:35:21.495 --> 00:35:23.495
I think it has to do with fear, 
because 

00:35:24.967 --> 00:35:26.967
the question that often follows 
that, 

00:35:28.653 --> 00:35:30.653
why is it so hard.

00:35:32.106 --> 00:35:34.106
I think, you know, part of it 
probably 

00:35:36.403 --> 00:35:38.403
has to do with the way that 
we're taught 

00:35:39.866 --> 00:35:41.926
to -- I want to say summarize 
things, prove that we've 

00:35:41.927 --> 00:35:43.927
comprehended, demonstrate our 
knowledge and expertise.

00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:49.464
Part of it has to do with the 
way that tests produce a lot of 

00:35:49.465 --> 00:35:51.736
anxiety, and so we think this 
poem is out to get me.

00:35:51.737 --> 00:35:53.382
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Some of it 

00:35:53.383 --> 00:35:55.383
has to do 

00:35:56.845 --> 00:35:58.479
with the awful question that 
many people ask, what do you 

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.480
think this poem is trying to 
say?

00:36:00.509 --> 00:36:04.787
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes. Do you know
what it would mean to  America's

00:36:04.788 --> 00:36:07.645
high school students to see the 
Poet Laureate of the United 

00:36:07.646 --> 00:36:09.646
States stand there and say, I 
don't know 

00:36:13.148 --> 00:36:15.148
exactly what that means?
   (Laughter)

00:36:15.414 --> 00:36:17.016
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's such a 
rebuke of a thousand horrible 

00:36:17.017 --> 00:36:19.690
high school experiences.
   (Laughter)

00:36:22.339 --> 00:36:24.339
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah.

00:36:26.605 --> 00:36:27.838
The position of the Poet 
Laureate is undefined, isn't it?

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:30.906
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: It is. Yeah. 
It is a kind of freedom, you  

00:36:30.907 --> 00:36:32.529
know.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And terror.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.364
   (Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I mean, it's 

00:36:34.365 --> 00:36:37.018
a strange position. It's been 
funded by the federal 

00:36:38.656 --> 00:36:39.873
government, but not officially 
answerable to the federal 

00:36:39.874 --> 00:36:45.370
government. You don't have to 
write a poem for Donald Trump's 

00:36:45.371 --> 00:36:47.891
birthday or any other occasional
things like that.

00:36:51.098 --> 00:36:53.098
(Laughter)

00:36:55.266 --> 00:36:55.675
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: He's not here, 
is he?

00:36:55.676 --> 00:36:56.888
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What inspired

00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:58.889
you to 

00:37:00.353 --> 00:37:02.353
go on the road with this 
project?

00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:08.479
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I had this wish 
to 

00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:13.161
test out this idea that if we 
can stop 

00:37:15.238 --> 00:37:17.238
trying to tell ourselves what 
other 

00:37:18.906 --> 00:37:21.767
people think and just talk, we 
can maybe find ourselves not 

00:37:21.768 --> 00:37:24.012
yelling, not, you know, enraged,
and maybe hearing 

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.313
something that's useful and that
resonates somehow. I grew up 

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:34.389
going to church. And I remember 
feeling that. I remember 

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.244
feeling, I love these people. I 
see them. But I don't agree with

00:37:37.245 --> 00:37:39.717
them on everything. And yet 
somehow this is a community that

00:37:39.718 --> 00:37:42.165
works.
   And I think families are like

00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:47.243
that, too. And so why can't the 
nation be like that? So I had 

00:37:47.244 --> 00:37:50.098
this fantasy that poetry could 
be one of these topics that 

00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:54.387
urges us to be quiet. And all 
the adjectives that I talked 

00:37:55.411 --> 00:37:57.411
about.

00:37:58.466 --> 00:38:00.918
And I wonder if it would be 
possible to go out there and say

00:38:00.919 --> 00:38:03.775
something meaningful to each 
other through the vehicle of 

00:38:03.776 --> 00:38:05.776
this art form.

00:38:07.254 --> 00:38:09.254
And then the opportunity 
presented itself.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.290
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Why did you 
focus on rural areas?

00:38:12.141 --> 00:38:14.579
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Well, as a 
writer I spend most of my time 

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.261
going to cities or college 
towns. And then I feel like 

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:23.757
there's this tendency to divide 
our sense of what America is 

00:38:23.758 --> 00:38:26.809
into two regions. I mean, it's 
silly because it's such a big 

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:28.810
place.

00:38:30.534 --> 00:38:32.534
But we have the urban, coastal 
region, 

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:41.340
and then the require center the 
rural center. I thought I spend 

00:38:41.341 --> 00:38:43.341
a lot of time in 

00:38:46.231 --> 00:38:48.231
places where people will 
probably go.

00:38:50.718 --> 00:38:52.718
So why not see what happens if I
can cross that line.

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:55.197
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: When you went to
these towns, who came?

00:38:59.015 --> 00:39:01.015
Were they

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.952
beret-wearing hipsters?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Some of the 

00:39:03.953 --> 00:39:08.031
towns were so small it was 
people who were aware an event 

00:39:08.032 --> 00:39:09.466
was happening, and that's 
something that doesn't usually 

00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:12.118
happen. So a pretty healthy 
cross-section.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.200
When we were in South Carolina, 
the 

00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:28.028
locations that representative C 
Clyburn curated for us, were 

00:39:28.029 --> 00:39:33.919
connected historically. They had
a strong sense of participation 

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.920
in the Civil Rights Movement.

00:39:37.363 --> 00:39:40.213
And I think that meant that many
of the people who came were 

00:39:40.214 --> 00:39:42.214
members of a black church that 
we visited.

00:39:43.478 --> 00:39:46.321
And they came. There were alumni
and community members 

00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:51.609
of a school, old summerton High 
School, 

00:39:54.698 --> 00:39:57.552
one of the schools  desegregated
during the Brown V. Board of 

00:39:57.553 --> 00:40:00.609
Education. Members of that class
came. Many people came because 

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:04.897
they said there's a black woman 
doing something on this national

00:40:04.898 --> 00:40:06.898
scale, I want my kids who are 
black to see this.

00:40:12.218 --> 00:40:14.865
It a A similar thing happened 
but in opposite terms when I was

00:40:14.866 --> 00:40:17.705
in another community. It'll come
to me sometime tonight.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:18.927
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: That's the 

00:40:18.928 --> 00:40:22.602
problem with doing things so  
quickly. Where it was a white 

00:40:22.603 --> 00:40:24.632
family who said we live in a 
town that's really racially 

00:40:26.878 --> 00:40:29.759
divided and I want my kids to be
able to cross that line, so I 

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.791
want them to come here.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Just coming 

00:40:31.792 --> 00:40:34.843
was crossing a barrier. Did you 
get responses that surprised 

00:40:36.877 --> 00:40:38.101
you, that you hadn't expected?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I don't know 

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:40.102
what I was expecting.

00:40:42.568 --> 00:40:44.568
I was a little bit just curious.

00:40:45.848 --> 00:40:47.848
So anything felt useful.

00:40:50.924 --> 00:40:52.553
There were people who wrote 
poetry,, who said I'll read a 

00:40:52.554 --> 00:40:54.554
poem.

00:40:55.604 --> 00:40:57.844
We have some great recordings of
people saying here's a chance to

00:40:57.845 --> 00:41:02.338
read a poem. Someone at the air 
force base said I write poems in

00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:04.771
this secret journal that I don't
want anybody to see, but I'll 

00:41:06.371 --> 00:41:08.662
read you a couple now.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Wow.

00:41:08.663 --> 00:41:10.087
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You read a 

00:41:10.088 --> 00:41:15.180
variety of poems, not just your 
own, other people's. What kinds 

00:41:15.181 --> 00:41:16.821
of poems went over well?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Well, the two

00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:19.460
that I shared tonight are two 
that I've read before.

00:41:24.985 --> 00:41:27.015
And I felt like people listen 
and have theories about the 

00:41:27.016 --> 00:41:29.016
poem, or want to talk about what
the poems remind them of.

00:41:31.922 --> 00:41:33.811
There are two others that 
perhaps we'll hear tonight.

00:41:33.812 --> 00:41:35.443
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: We will.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: That behave 

00:41:35.444 --> 00:41:37.444
in different ways.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.374
One goes back to childhood and 
narrates a somewhat familiar 

00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:44.616
experience and then aligns it 
with a larger sense.

00:41:49.095 --> 00:41:51.939
And another that's a family 
story about addiction within a 

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.940
family. Yeah.

00:41:57.653 --> 00:42:01.319
People are -- they know I'm not 
going to test them. If they know

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.773
-- and this is something I kind 
of go out of my way to say is, 

00:42:03.774 --> 00:42:08.470
I'm just curious. This is what I
say to my students. What do you 

00:42:08.471 --> 00:42:11.518
notice? Anything that you notice
is useful and valuable to talk 

00:42:11.519 --> 00:42:15.587
about? Maybe it will activate 
somebody else's feeling of 

00:42:15.588 --> 00:42:17.588
something that they noticed.

00:42:19.248 --> 00:42:21.248
So just, let's hear it. Maybe 
it's because it's a community 

00:42:23.311 --> 00:42:26.173
where people know each other, 
but there hadn't been a sense --

00:42:26.174 --> 00:42:29.635
in some ways, most of the poems 
have gone over because people 

00:42:29.636 --> 00:42:31.059
have wanted to talk about them.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Now, you have

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.530
a new collection coming out, 
Wave in the Water, next Tuesday?

00:42:35.727 --> 00:42:37.977
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: It's out.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's a 

00:42:37.978 --> 00:42:39.608
beautiful collection.
   (Laughter)

00:42:39.609 --> 00:42:41.609
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I wonder if you 
would read the title poem.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.290
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Sure.

00:42:50.848 --> 00:42:54.764
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: So this poem 

00:42:54.765 --> 00:42:56.765
narrates an encounter.

00:42:59.239 --> 00:43:01.239
I hope it's somewhat clear, but 
I 

00:43:03.534 --> 00:43:04.957
attended something, and that's 
where the scene that occupies 

00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:06.958
most of the poem took place.

00:43:09.221 --> 00:43:11.221
Wave in the water, for the ring 
shouters.

00:43:12.693 --> 00:43:14.738
One of the women greeted me. I 
love you, she said.

00:43:18.206 --> 00:43:20.206
She didn't know me, but I 
believed her.

00:43:21.674 --> 00:43:23.674
And a terrible new ache rolled 
over in 

00:43:27.779 --> 00:43:29.779
my chest, like in a room where 
the drapes have been swept back.

00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:34.322
I love you, I love you, as she 
continued down the hall, past 

00:43:34.323 --> 00:43:36.323
other 

00:43:37.966 --> 00:43:40.205
strangers, each feeling pierced 
suddenly by pillars of heavy 

00:43:40.206 --> 00:43:42.262
light.
   I love you, throughout the 

00:43:45.724 --> 00:43:47.724
performance, in every hand-clap,
every 

00:43:48.995 --> 00:43:50.995
stomp, I love you in the rusted 
iron 

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:55.697
chains someone was made to drag 
until 

00:43:56.948 --> 00:43:59.597
love let them be unclasped and 
left empty in the center of the 

00:43:59.598 --> 00:44:01.598
ring.

00:44:03.258 --> 00:44:05.258
I love you in the water where 
they 

00:44:06.724 --> 00:44:09.367
pretended to wade, singing that 
old blood-deep song that dragged

00:44:09.368 --> 00:44:13.023
us to those banks and cast us 
in. I love you.

00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:18.311
The angles of it scraping at 
each 

00:44:20.375 --> 00:44:22.608
throat, shouldering past the 
swirling dust motes in those 

00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:24.609
beams of light that 

00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:28.267
whatever we now knew we could 
let 

00:44:29.945 --> 00:44:31.945
ourselves feel knew to clip.

00:44:32.994 --> 00:44:34.994
   Oh, woods. Oh, dogs.

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:41.428
Oh, trees. Oh, gun. Oh, girl 
run.

00:44:47.553 --> 00:44:49.553
Oh, miraculous, many gone.

00:44:54.637 --> 00:44:56.637
Oh, lord Lord, oh Lord,

00:44:57.951 --> 00:45:00.200
oh, Lord, this love the trouble 
you promiseed.

00:45:07.927 --> 00:45:09.927
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What does it 
mean to 

00:45:14.251 --> 00:45:14.852
say I love you to a stranger in 
this poem?

00:45:14.853 --> 00:45:16.853
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: That's the 
question 

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:20.173
that set that poem into motion. 
It felt like such a gift and it 

00:45:20.174 --> 00:45:22.174
hurt at 

00:45:23.452 --> 00:45:25.452
the same time and it allowed so 
much to 

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.740
come out, so many conflicting 
feelings.

00:45:31.206 --> 00:45:34.908
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Not because 
you doubted her sincerity.

00:45:36.137 --> 00:45:38.137
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I could have 
because 

00:45:39.215 --> 00:45:41.215
she said it to everyone, but it 
was a 

00:45:43.122 --> 00:45:45.765
genuine thing, vulnerable 
gesture. I wanted to go back to 

00:45:45.766 --> 00:45:49.519
that and figure out where that 
came from and what it had given 

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.975
me. I don't know what it means, 
but I have a feeling that we 

00:45:52.976 --> 00:45:54.976
kind of need to learn what it 
means.

00:45:55.214 --> 00:45:57.657
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes, indeed. 
What does it mean to be Poet 

00:45:57.658 --> 00:46:01.717
Laureate in these contentious 
times, when everything from 

00:46:01.718 --> 00:46:03.718
what's decent to what's 

00:46:05.781 --> 00:46:07.781
science is a matter of such hot 
debate?

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.546
   (Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Well, I feel 

00:46:13.547 --> 00:46:15.547
like 

00:46:17.411 --> 00:46:19.655
it's added urgency to my belief 
that we are better when we're 

00:46:19.656 --> 00:46:21.656
more attentive, 

00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:26.133
when we can sort of say I'm not 
going to 

00:46:27.186 --> 00:46:30.048
accept this, like, word package 
without parsing it and testing 

00:46:30.049 --> 00:46:32.100
its validity in whatever terms 
that are valid, like 

00:46:35.347 --> 00:46:37.347
emotional or otherwise.

00:46:40.257 --> 00:46:42.295
And I've got to move -- I'll be 
better-equipped to just be in 

00:46:42.296 --> 00:46:44.296
this world if I'm moving away 
from what I'm certain 

00:46:47.616 --> 00:46:49.616
of and say there has got to be 
something 

00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:53.358
I can stand to learn, got to be 
something I don't recognize 

00:46:53.359 --> 00:46:55.359
about myself 

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:58.413
that could somehow, if I can 
face it,  help.

00:46:59.279 --> 00:47:01.279
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Your example is 
quite 

00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:03.572
different than the role that 
many writers are playing in this

00:47:03.573 --> 00:47:08.272
era, which is to be very 
political. You're being 

00:47:08.273 --> 00:47:10.273
political in a very different 
way that I think is really 

00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:15.692
provocative. Last year you said 
in an interview, poetry helps me

00:47:15.693 --> 00:47:17.693
contend with the small 

00:47:18.743 --> 00:47:19.959
of the spirit, the greed, the 
dishonesty, the disregard for 

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.845
the lives of others at the root 
of American politics.

00:47:28.105 --> 00:47:30.105
Fortunately we've moved beyond 
all that.

00:47:30.371 --> 00:47:32.227
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In your 

00:47:32.228 --> 00:47:36.119
introduction to American 
journal, which is an anthology 

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.120
you'll be bringing out this 

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.180
fall, you say that you hope 
those poems 

00:47:42.224 --> 00:47:45.476
might make us a little less 
alien to each other. Such a 

00:47:45.477 --> 00:47:47.477
great goal.

00:47:48.752 --> 00:47:50.752
How can a poem do that?

00:47:53.264 --> 00:47:56.558
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: It does it in
a lot of small ways that add up 

00:47:56.559 --> 00:48:01.283
to something. One, it says I'm 
sitting here in this chair where

00:48:01.284 --> 00:48:03.284
I'm comfortable, and I'm reading
about something that makes me 

00:48:06.002 --> 00:48:08.238
have to, sort of, start from 
scratch and try and understand, 

00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:11.927
because I want to. I want to do 
that work. Oh, this is something

00:48:11.928 --> 00:48:13.928
that's connected 

00:48:14.988 --> 00:48:17.000
to a voice, a theoretical 
person. Somehow I'm moving away 

00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:19.001
from my own 

00:48:20.904 --> 00:48:22.945
sense of being and into another 
person's. I do believe that's 

00:48:22.946 --> 00:48:23.965
good practice.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Modeling the 

00:48:23.966 --> 00:48:25.966
way we should be as citizens  
more.

00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:29.940
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Would you 

00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:31.941
read a poem 

00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:35.809
called Refuge from your new book
on page 73?

00:48:36.096 --> 00:48:38.096
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Sure.

00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:48.994
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Can they buy 
these books?

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.860
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Product 
placement.

00:48:54.868 --> 00:48:56.984
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Refuge.

00:49:00.698 --> 00:49:02.698
Until I can understand why you 
fled, 

00:49:04.987 --> 00:49:06.987
why you are willing to bleed, 
why you 

00:49:10.494 --> 00:49:11.511
deserve what I must be willing 
to cede, let me imagine you are 

00:49:11.512 --> 00:49:13.512
my mother in 

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:17.436
Montgomery, Alabama, walking to 
Kansas rather than riding the 

00:49:17.437 --> 00:49:22.738
bus. I know what they call you. 
I know what they try to convince

00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:24.739
you you  lack.

00:49:27.628 --> 00:49:30.281
I know your tired ankles, the 
sudden thunder of your laugh, 

00:49:30.282 --> 00:49:32.282
until I want to 

00:49:34.131 --> 00:49:36.131
give you what I myself deserve, 
let me 

00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:39.224
love you by loving her.

00:49:42.949 --> 00:49:45.202
Your sister in a camp in Turkey,
16, deserving of everything.

00:49:48.044 --> 00:49:50.044
Let her be my daughter, who has 

00:49:51.709 --> 00:49:53.732
curled her neat hands into 
fists, insisting nothing is fair

00:49:53.733 --> 00:49:55.733
and I have never loved her.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.720
Naomi, lips set in a scowl, 
young heart ransacking itself.

00:50:06.624 --> 00:50:08.624
Let me lend her passion to your 
sister, 

00:50:10.089 --> 00:50:12.089
and love her for her living  
rage, her 

00:50:14.793 --> 00:50:17.648
need for more, and now, and all.
Let me leap from sleep if her 

00:50:17.649 --> 00:50:19.649
voice 

00:50:21.925 --> 00:50:23.925
sounds out afraid from down the 
hall.

00:50:25.581 --> 00:50:27.581
I've seen men like your father 
walking 

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:30.830
up Harrison Street now that the 
days are getting longer.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:35.153
Let me love them as I love my 
own father, whom I phoned once 

00:50:35.154 --> 00:50:37.154
from a valley 

00:50:39.232 --> 00:50:41.232
in my life to say what I feared 
I'd 

00:50:43.504 --> 00:50:46.144
never adequately said, voice 
choked, stalled, hearing the 

00:50:46.145 --> 00:50:48.588
silence spread around us like 
weather.

00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:54.049
What would is cost me to say it 
now 

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.510
to a stranger's father, walking 
home to 

00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:01.598
our separate lives together?

00:51:07.376 --> 00:51:11.284
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It reenacts 
the golden rule, at the center 

00:51:11.285 --> 00:51:13.285
of every 

00:51:16.375 --> 00:51:17.383
ethical system, that we should 
feel what someone else is 

00:51:17.384 --> 00:51:21.893
feeling. Until I understand you,
a pretty hopeful line, that we 

00:51:21.894 --> 00:51:25.539
will if we make the effort.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah. Or 

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.540
we'll be like those kids at the 

00:51:31.057 --> 00:51:31.267
table, like 12, with a couple 
Brussels sprouts.

00:51:31.268 --> 00:51:32.898
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: But either 

00:51:32.899 --> 00:51:39.062
way there is time.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah. It's 

00:51:39.063 --> 00:51:41.063
just such a poem for this 
moment.

00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:44.550
We've got a recording of a poem 
called Second Estrangement. Can 

00:51:44.551 --> 00:51:46.551
you set that up?

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.159
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: It's a poem by a
poet who -- it comes from her 

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.160
most recent 

00:51:55.435 --> 00:51:57.435
collection which is called Black
Mariah 

00:51:59.294 --> 00:52:00.312
thinking about the African 
diaspora in different parts of 

00:52:00.313 --> 00:52:02.345
the world. Those are the large 
thematic questions.

00:52:06.017 --> 00:52:08.017
But more urgent or salient is 
the sense 

00:52:10.902 --> 00:52:12.902
of displacement that maybe any 
person can feel access to.

00:52:15.384 --> 00:52:17.384
So this is a poem that kind of 
builds 

00:52:19.449 --> 00:52:21.449
that in these really familiar 
and very visceral terms.

00:52:23.112 --> 00:52:27.817
   &gt;&gt; Second estrangement. 
Please raise your hand, whomever

00:52:27.818 --> 00:52:29.818
else 

00:52:31.894 --> 00:52:33.894
of you has been a child, lost in
a 

00:52:35.568 --> 00:52:37.568
market or a mall, without 
knowing it at 

00:52:39.045 --> 00:52:41.045
first, following a stranger 

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.576
accidentally, thinking he is 
yours, your family or parent, 

00:52:45.577 --> 00:52:47.577
even grabbing for his 

00:52:49.029 --> 00:52:51.029
hand, even calling the word you 
said 

00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:55.109
then for "father," only to see 
the face 

00:52:57.209 --> 00:52:59.209
look strangely down, utterly 
foreign, 

00:53:00.456 --> 00:53:02.456
utterly not the one who loves 
you, you 

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:06.110
who are a bird, suddenly stunned
by the 

00:53:08.222 --> 00:53:10.222
glass partitions of rooms.

00:53:12.717 --> 00:53:14.717
How far the world you knew and 
tall, 

00:53:19.812 --> 00:53:21.812
and filled finally with 
strangers.

00:53:23.529 --> 00:53:26.383
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I love that that
poem reenacts that sense of 

00:53:26.384 --> 00:53:29.225
alienation and fear in a way 
that makes us feel like everyone

00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:31.226
else.

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.890
It overcomes the very problem it
enacts.

00:53:36.949 --> 00:53:38.785
It's incredibly clever.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I love the 

00:53:38.786 --> 00:53:40.825
way it guides you. You don't 
know that's where it's going.

00:53:43.909 --> 00:53:45.745
The title might alert you to 
something. It begins please 

00:53:45.746 --> 00:53:50.870
raise your hand. And I think 
that's the first line. And I'm a

00:53:50.871 --> 00:53:52.706
good student, I want to do it.
   (Laughter)

00:53:52.707 --> 00:53:56.602
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: And then whoever
else among you. And then we 

00:53:56.603 --> 00:53:58.647
descend step by step into this 
feeling of, you know, first 

00:53:58.648 --> 00:54:02.746
you're just alone in a mall. 
Then you're lost. And you're 

00:54:02.747 --> 00:54:04.993
without this person. And then we
realize there's a private 

00:54:09.675 --> 00:54:11.675
language, the word you used then
for father.

00:54:13.759 --> 00:54:16.219
It could almost behave like 
John's  poem. Maybe there's a 

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.682
real language barrier, or maybe 
just I'm not at home anymore.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.940
And the image of the bird. Birds
come up in poems, I guess.

00:54:26.831 --> 00:54:27.634
But it creates that feeling of 
abrupt shock.

00:54:27.635 --> 00:54:29.480
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: And so all of

00:54:29.481 --> 00:54:31.481
the, 

00:54:32.563 --> 00:54:34.188
you know, willingness that we 
have demonstrated to follow this

00:54:34.189 --> 00:54:36.189
poem leads 

00:54:37.653 --> 00:54:42.162
us to that same place of being 
lost, and scared, and stuck.

00:54:43.799 --> 00:54:46.434
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: We've all felt 
that. There is a connection.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.945
As much anxiety as there's been 
about the political contention 

00:54:51.946 --> 00:54:55.411
of our age, it's not the worst 
it's been. We've got the Civil 

00:54:55.412 --> 00:55:00.105
War. Several of your poems are 
inspired by the civil war, draw 

00:55:00.106 --> 00:55:04.173
text from the civil war, in 
fascinating ways. Can you tell 

00:55:04.174 --> 00:55:06.174
us about that and read a 

00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:09.890
poem called Declaration?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Sure.

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:17.345
The Civil War Kind of Got

00:55:20.117 --> 00:55:22.117
-- I was invited by the National
Port 

00:55:24.201 --> 00:55:26.053
Rat Portrait Gallery in the year
leading up to the 150th 

00:55:26.054 --> 00:55:29.717
anniversary of the beginning of 
the Civil War to contribute a 

00:55:29.718 --> 00:55:31.718
poem for an exhibition.

00:55:32.991 --> 00:55:34.991
There were going to be portraits
and poems.

00:55:36.037 --> 00:55:38.037
And I had to sort of say I want 
to do 

00:55:39.297 --> 00:55:40.924
this because I want to write a 
poem, but I don't know how to 

00:55:40.925 --> 00:55:45.416
make myself want to write about 
the civil war, which I've never 

00:55:45.417 --> 00:55:48.116
liked learning about. I was 
talking with another black 

00:55:48.117 --> 00:55:53.028
writer recently about how every 
time we would get to that moment

00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:55.029
in history growing up where it 
was slavery and the Civil War, 

00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.725
we as the black kids in the  
classroom were made to feel 

00:55:58.726 --> 00:56:02.996
shame, like how could this have 
happened to us.

00:56:04.827 --> 00:56:06.827
And so I was conditioned to feel
like ugh, here we go again.

00:56:09.722 --> 00:56:12.169
But I wanted to do it so I said,
what would black soldiers have 

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:15.636
experienced in this conflict? 
And I found a couple of really 

00:56:15.637 --> 00:56:20.305
great books that contain all 
these primary documents that  

00:56:20.306 --> 00:56:22.761
prevented me from doing what I 
wanted to do, which was to write

00:56:25.814 --> 00:56:28.061
something in my own voice, and 
urged me simply to listen and 

00:56:28.062 --> 00:56:29.481
bring these voices into 
conversation with each other.

00:56:29.482 --> 00:56:31.543
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What were 
these documents?

00:56:33.368 --> 00:56:35.829
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Letters that 
soldiers and their families had 

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:37.830
written to each 

00:56:39.485 --> 00:56:42.157
other and to Abraham Lincoln, 
depositions that veterans and 

00:56:42.158 --> 00:56:44.218
their bid doze and descendants 
had given after the 

00:56:47.881 --> 00:56:50.735
war, well into the 20th century 
in an attempt to get the 

00:56:50.736 --> 00:56:52.736
pensions that they as veterans 
should have been entitled to, 

00:56:54.598 --> 00:56:56.598
but that they were denied 
because having 

00:56:57.884 --> 00:56:59.528
been born into slavery, they 
didn't have birth certificates, 

00:56:59.529 --> 00:57:01.550
marriage licenses, nothing 
attesting to the fact that they 

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.038
had changed their name after 
emancipation.

00:57:08.476 --> 00:57:10.907
So that's where that came from. 
And suddenly this history felt 

00:57:10.908 --> 00:57:13.150
so alive, and active, and 
relevant.

00:57:14.175 --> 00:57:16.175
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Because you were
hearing voices that are usually 

00:57:16.831 --> 00:57:18.901
suppressed in history.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah. Or 

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.902
they're just absent.

00:57:23.179 --> 00:57:25.215
Or they get reduced to, this 
happened to these people.

00:57:28.508 --> 00:57:30.508
And so then I said I want to get
deeper into this.

00:57:33.432 --> 00:57:35.871
the Declaration of independence 
seemed like another source to 

00:57:35.872 --> 00:57:41.370
say what would it say to now if 
I could have my way with it. So 

00:57:41.371 --> 00:57:43.371
this is the poem that came from 
that. And it's an erasure.

00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:48.463
So there are what I think of as 
the 

00:57:50.184 --> 00:57:52.184
specific terms that clarify that
this 

00:57:53.656 --> 00:57:55.884
is, you know, a complaint 
against the King of England, and

00:57:55.885 --> 00:58:00.410
suddenly it felt like it was 
large enough to include other 

00:58:00.411 --> 00:58:03.260
voices.
   Declaration.

00:58:10.032 --> 00:58:12.686
He has sent hither swarms of 
officers to harass our people.

00:58:20.062 --> 00:58:22.915
He has thundered our -- ravaged 
our -- destroyed the lives of 

00:58:22.916 --> 00:58:24.916
our -- taking 

00:58:30.266 --> 00:58:32.266
away our -- abolishing our most 
valuable 

00:58:34.176 --> 00:58:36.176
and altering fundamentally the 
forms of our.

00:58:39.068 --> 00:58:41.519
In every stage of these 
oppressions, we have petitioned 

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.520
for redress in the most humble 
terms.

00:58:46.447 --> 00:58:48.447
Our repeated petitions have been

00:58:50.305 --> 00:58:52.305
answered only by repeated 
injury.

00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:55.589
We have reminded them of the 

00:58:56.657 --> 00:58:59.083
circumstances of our immigration
and settlement here.

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:05.410
Taken captive on the high seas 
to 

00:59:06.427 --> 00:59:08.728
bear.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You said very

00:59:08.729 --> 00:59:12.399
briefly as you began it was an 
erasure. Can you explain that a 

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.400
little more?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Sure.

00:59:16.457 --> 00:59:18.457
If I look at the whole document,
and 

00:59:20.135 --> 00:59:22.135
delete most of it, and tried to 
hear a 

00:59:23.603 --> 00:59:26.061
quieter voice under that 
official voice -- and I didn't 

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:28.062
set out to do that really, I 
don't think.

00:59:31.582 --> 00:59:34.006
I was reading it to see what -- 
I was trying to write a poem 

00:59:34.007 --> 00:59:36.054
about Thomas Jefferson. I was 
reading it to see what I could 

00:59:36.663 --> 00:59:39.921
get from him. And then I heard 
this other thing saying, forget 

00:59:39.922 --> 00:59:45.437
about him. Listen to this.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Would you 

00:59:45.438 --> 00:59:49.712
read a poem called I Will Tell 
You the Truth About This, and 

00:59:49.713 --> 00:59:50.921
maybe explain the background of 
that poem?

00:59:50.922 --> 00:59:54.177
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Sure. So this is
the Civil War poem that I was 

00:59:54.178 --> 00:59:56.178
talking about.

00:59:59.712 --> 01:00:01.712
And it's just a collection of 
letters, 

01:00:04.813 --> 01:00:06.857
some almost in their entirety 
written by these black soldiers 

01:00:06.858 --> 01:00:08.893
and their families. And then 
there are a couple of sections 

01:00:09.913 --> 01:00:13.603
-- it's a long poem. I'll read 
you the two sections? You want 

01:00:13.604 --> 01:00:15.633
me to read the first letter? 
Okay.

01:00:16.854 --> 01:00:19.395
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Is this a single
letter or a composite?

01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:22.263
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: This is one 
letter. All of these are actual 

01:00:22.264 --> 01:00:24.903
letters. And even the spelling.

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.611
I laughed because it seemed 
urgent. I will tell you the 

01:00:30.612 --> 01:00:32.612
truth about this.

01:00:33.867 --> 01:00:35.867
I will tell you all about it.

01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:43.037
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, November
21st, 1864.  Mr. Abraham 

01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:45.038
Lincoln, I want to know, sir, 

01:00:46.494 --> 01:00:48.935
if you please, whether I can 
have my son released from the 

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:50.966
Army. He is all the support I 
have now.

01:00:55.473 --> 01:00:58.371
His father is dead, and his 
brother, that was all the help I

01:00:58.372 --> 01:01:00.372
had, he has been wounded twice.

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.030
He has not had anything to send 
me yet.

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:08.135
Now I am old and my head is 
blossoming for the grays.

01:01:12.634 --> 01:01:15.910
And if you do, I hope the Lord 
will bless you and me. They say 

01:01:15.911 --> 01:01:17.911
that you will sympathize with 
the poor.

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:22.615
He belonged to the 8th regiment 
colored troop. He is a sergeant.

01:01:24.674 --> 01:01:27.963
Mark Welcome is his name.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Did you know 

01:01:27.964 --> 01:01:30.429
that these letters existed?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: No.

01:01:35.752 --> 01:01:39.047
I'll tell you the book that they
are collected in. I'm sure they 

01:01:39.048 --> 01:01:40.492
are probably here in this great 
building.

01:01:40.493 --> 01:01:41.914
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: But this is 

01:01:41.915 --> 01:01:43.954
how I found them.

01:01:47.607 --> 01:01:50.265
Families and freedom, a 
documentary history of African 

01:01:50.266 --> 01:01:52.266
American kinship in 

01:01:54.737 --> 01:01:56.737
the Civil War era, edited by Ira
and Leslie.

01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:00.845
And that was published in 1997. 
And then the depositions are 

01:02:00.846 --> 01:02:03.511
collected in Voices of 
Emancipation, Understanding 

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:08.809
Slavery, the Civil War, and 
Reconstruction Through the U.S. 

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:10.810
Pension Bureau Files.

01:02:12.483 --> 01:02:15.337
Edited by Elizabeth and Donald.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That's 

01:02:15.338 --> 01:02:18.413
incredibly poignant.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah. This is

01:02:18.414 --> 01:02:20.248
what we should've been reading 
in those classes where I felt so

01:02:20.249 --> 01:02:23.099
called out, you know.

01:02:26.746 --> 01:02:29.435
Because they do what so little 
does, which is to restore the 

01:02:29.436 --> 01:02:32.117
sense of sanity and actually, 
like, blood, and life, and 

01:02:36.396 --> 01:02:39.029
voices, and stories to history, 
you know. So often it's not the 

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:41.079
first version of history that 
you get as a student.

01:02:42.715 --> 01:02:45.157
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You were in 
South Carolina and Kentucky,  

01:02:45.158 --> 01:02:47.158
places where 

01:02:48.627 --> 01:02:50.038
debate about how to memorialize 
the Civil War are still running 

01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:53.302
hot. Did that subject come up?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: This poem 

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.303
came up.

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:02.271
(Chuckling) And it was something
people heard in a way that's 

01:03:02.272 --> 01:03:04.926
similar to how I heard those 
voices. It was something that 

01:03:04.927 --> 01:03:08.782
people would come up to me 
afterwards. When I'm reading my 

01:03:08.783 --> 01:03:12.274
own poems I don't always say 
what do you notice. That seems 

01:03:12.275 --> 01:03:14.275
wrong.
   (Laughter)

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:17.159
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: So if somebody 

01:03:18.622 --> 01:03:20.646
notices something, maybe they'll
say it afterward. And this is 

01:03:20.647 --> 01:03:23.498
the poem that people want to 
talk about, because it does that

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:25.748
for them, too, in some way.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.205
When we were in South Carolina, 
we were 

01:03:32.257 --> 01:03:34.074
in a place where I think the 
55th Massachusetts volunteers 

01:03:34.075 --> 01:03:38.561
had fought. And that was 
commemorated. And so there was, 

01:03:38.562 --> 01:03:40.562
you know, a sense of this is our
history.

01:03:43.456 --> 01:03:47.505
This is here, in a way.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right. Yeah. 

01:03:47.506 --> 01:03:49.506
You're going to read a poem  
called the political poem.

01:03:50.984 --> 01:03:52.984
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Okay.
   (Laughter)

01:03:53.017 --> 01:03:55.017
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What is the 
function 

01:03:56.482 --> 01:03:58.520
of a political poem in an age 
like ours? It seems different 

01:03:58.521 --> 01:04:00.521
than during the 

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.636
Vietnam War, the Civil Rights 
Era, what is a political poem 

01:04:04.637 --> 01:04:07.098
nowadays and how does this poem 
you're about to read answer that

01:04:07.099 --> 01:04:08.524
question?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Well, I think

01:04:08.525 --> 01:04:10.525
a 

01:04:15.858 --> 01:04:18.522
political poem in any age is 
valuable if it can challenge the

01:04:18.523 --> 01:04:21.991
easy sense of us versus them. So
political poems that fail don't 

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:25.055
do that. They say I'm on the us,
which is good, 

01:04:28.325 --> 01:04:30.325
and I'm going to call out these 
them.

01:04:30.764 --> 01:04:31.783
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Just propaganda,
rallying cry.

01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:33.800
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah. Even if 
you're thinking in terms of 

01:04:35.424 --> 01:04:36.628
justice you're making bad art if
that's the way you're going to 

01:04:36.629 --> 01:04:38.629
do it.

01:04:39.695 --> 01:04:41.716
A good political poem says 
perhaps this is what I as a 

01:04:41.717 --> 01:04:43.750
person believe, but I've got a 
question and I'm going to have 

01:04:43.751 --> 01:04:48.013
to explore it in ways that are 
going to put that on the line 

01:04:48.014 --> 01:04:50.281
and call it into question and 
move me toward an 

01:04:53.571 --> 01:04:56.228
uncomfortable sense of, perhaps 
complicity or implication in 

01:04:56.229 --> 01:04:58.229
part of the problem as I see it.

01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:03.569
I want to do an organic kind of 
walk 

01:05:04.642 --> 01:05:08.503
through and think about what I'm
made to acknowledge.

01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:11.998
I feel like there are lots of 
poems that do that.

01:05:16.681 --> 01:05:19.331
I like  adding the title, 
Political Poem to this poem, 

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.981
because that makes you feel 
like, God, what is going to come

01:05:21.982 --> 01:05:23.982
at me?

01:05:25.285 --> 01:05:27.285
And this is a poem that wasn't 
even 

01:05:28.365 --> 01:05:29.799
written with politics in mind.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It definitely

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.059
plays with that theme and its 
title in a very witty, conscious

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.710
way.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: No, this is a

01:05:34.711 --> 01:05:36.711
poem 

01:05:41.239 --> 01:05:43.255
that I wrote thinking about -- I
was in Vermont. I actually was 

01:05:43.256 --> 01:05:47.725
having a dream that I was in a 
room where there was a poem as a

01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:51.601
mural on a wall that I was 
reading aloud to somebody. And 

01:05:51.602 --> 01:05:53.602
then I said this is not a poem 
by somebody else.

01:05:55.474 --> 01:05:55.884
If I wake up, this can be my 
poem.

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.313
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: So I got up 

01:05:57.314 --> 01:05:59.314
and sat. I was in Vermont.

01:06:01.803 --> 01:06:03.219
So I think Robert Frost, you 
know, mowers were probably in 

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.220
the air.

01:06:06.889 --> 01:06:11.396
And I recaptureed to the extent 
that poem. And I published it. 

01:06:11.397 --> 01:06:13.397
And it was called the mowers.

01:06:16.669 --> 01:06:18.492
And later I read it and I said, 
I think this is going to make 

01:06:18.493 --> 01:06:20.493
more sense if I change the 
title.

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.550
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah. Or make 
difference sense.

01:06:23.422 --> 01:06:27.335
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Better sense.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: 54.

01:06:29.976 --> 01:06:31.976
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Political poem.

01:06:35.884 --> 01:06:37.884
If those mowers were each to 
stop at 

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:41.828
the whim, say, of a greedy 
thought, and then the one off to

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:44.688
the left were to let his arm 
float up, stirring the air with 

01:06:48.575 --> 01:06:50.575
that wide, slow, underwater 
gesture 

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.850
meaning hello, and you there, 
aimed at 

01:06:58.126 --> 01:07:00.808
the one measure more than a mile
away to the right, and if he in 

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:02.809
his work were to 

01:07:05.106 --> 01:07:07.106
pause, cash catching that call 
and send 

01:07:08.164 --> 01:07:10.164
back his own slow dance meaning 
yes, and 

01:07:14.062 --> 01:07:16.062
here, threaded to a single long 
nerve 

01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:19.157
before remembering his tool and 
shearing another message into 

01:07:19.158 --> 01:07:21.158
the Earth, letting 

01:07:23.228 --> 01:07:25.059
who can say how long graze past 
until another thought or just 

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.060
the need to know 

01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:30.312
might make him stop and look up 
again at 

01:07:31.994 --> 01:07:34.442
the other, raising his arm as if
to say something like, still, 

01:07:34.443 --> 01:07:36.443
and, oh.

01:07:37.919 --> 01:07:39.919
And then to catch the flicker of
joy 

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.630
rise up along those other legs 
and flare into another bright 

01:07:44.631 --> 01:07:49.381
yes that sways a moment in the 
darkening air. Their work would 

01:07:49.382 --> 01:07:51.382
carry them into the 

01:07:52.838 --> 01:07:54.838
better part of the evening, each
mowing 

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.700
ahead and doubling back, then 
looking up 

01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:01.770
to catch sight of his echo, 
sought and 

01:08:03.439 --> 01:08:05.439
held in that instant of common 
understanding.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.540
The speed of it coming out only 
after 

01:08:12.428 --> 01:08:14.428
both have turned back to face 
the sea of 

01:08:16.322 --> 01:08:20.177
yet, and blow.
   If they could, and if what 

01:08:20.178 --> 01:08:22.629
glimmered like a fish were to 
dart back and forth 

01:08:25.723 --> 01:08:27.545
across that wide, wordless 
distance, the day, though gone, 

01:08:27.546 --> 01:08:29.826
would never know the ache of 
being done.

01:08:33.703 --> 01:08:35.703
If they thought to, or would, or
even 

01:08:37.387 --> 01:08:39.387
half wanted, their work, the  
humming, 

01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:43.698
human engine pushed across the 
grass, and the grass blade after

01:08:43.699 --> 01:08:46.170
blade assenting, would take 
forever.

01:08:51.287 --> 01:08:53.287
But I love how long it would 
last.

01:08:54.372 --> 01:08:56.372
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: How can such 
a poem 

01:08:58.854 --> 01:09:00.870
help us rethink the political 
stand off we find ourselves in?

01:09:04.979 --> 01:09:06.979
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Well, it's kind 
of 

01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:10.678
begging one to change the scale 
upon which we're thinking and 

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.679
say, okay, it's 

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:15.942
easy to get mad at, like, a big 
group of -- a demographic.

01:09:15.967 --> 01:09:18.215
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: But if you 

01:09:18.216 --> 01:09:22.482
reduce it to one person out 
there doing his version of what 

01:09:22.483 --> 01:09:24.310
you're over here doing, maybe it
will feel different.

01:09:24.311 --> 01:09:30.005
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes. Lovely. 
Really lovely. There's a whole 

01:09:30.006 --> 01:09:32.006
bunch of people nearby 

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.080
you need to talk to.
   (Laughter)

01:09:36.151 --> 01:09:38.151
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In the 
introduction 

01:09:39.816 --> 01:09:43.083
to Wave in the Water, you write 
this is why I love poems. They 

01:09:43.084 --> 01:09:45.358
invite me to sit down and listen
to a voice speaking softly and 

01:09:46.788 --> 01:09:49.442
passionately about what it feels
like to be alive. Usually the 

01:09:49.443 --> 01:09:51.717
someone doing the talking, the 
poem's speaker, is a person I've

01:09:55.998 --> 01:09:58.234
never person I wouldn't get the 
chance to meet were it not for 

01:09:58.235 --> 01:10:02.493
this poem. More and more the way
we get our news, interact online

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:04.494
through Facebook and other 
social media, we only interact 

01:10:05.364 --> 01:10:07.364
with people who think just like 
we do.

01:10:08.618 --> 01:10:11.664
We don't see people that don't 
think like us. We silence them, 

01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:13.665
avoid them, listen to the right 
news, etc.

01:10:15.935 --> 01:10:19.613
Can we listen to a poem called 
My Brother at 3:00 A.M., and can

01:10:19.614 --> 01:10:22.057
you tell us about that?
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah. This is

01:10:22.058 --> 01:10:24.921
by Natalie Diaz. It's from a 
collection called When My 

01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:31.046
Brother Was -- there's a family 
in the center of the book. It's 

01:10:31.047 --> 01:10:33.047
on such a scale that I don't 
know 

01:10:34.316 --> 01:10:36.749
if it's a real, live family or 
an imagined family that allows a

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:40.027
certain dramatic situation to 
play out. But there's a brother 

01:10:40.028 --> 01:10:42.028
in that family 

01:10:44.951 --> 01:10:47.196
who is an addict and is, you 
know, causing all of this 

01:10:47.197 --> 01:10:49.197
upheaval, changing 

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.458
the way that the speaker of the 
poem 

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:55.365
thinks about herself, about what
she belongs to, what the threats

01:10:55.366 --> 01:10:57.366
are.

01:11:00.247 --> 01:11:03.085
But it's also a book that is 
kind of like testifying to what 

01:11:03.086 --> 01:11:05.770
it feels like to grow up as a 
native American drink in 

01:11:12.289 --> 01:11:14.289
the United States and to feel 
unseen, 

01:11:16.194 --> 01:11:18.823
unvalued, or seen through a 
caricature lens. So there are --

01:11:18.824 --> 01:11:22.723
and then it's a book that's also
got some really beautiful love 

01:11:22.724 --> 01:11:25.179
poems and poems that kind of 
play with literary history in 

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.180
beautiful, moving ways.

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:30.483
But this is a poem that is kind 
of haunting.

01:11:30.484 --> 01:11:32.484
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah. Can we 
have that now?

01:11:34.977 --> 01:11:39.043
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: My
   &gt;&gt; My Brother at 3:00 A.M.

01:11:43.105 --> 01:11:45.140
He sat cross-legged, weeping on 
the steps when mom unlocked and 

01:11:45.141 --> 01:11:49.611
opened the front door. Oh, God, 
he said. He wants to kill me, 

01:11:49.612 --> 01:11:52.883
Mom. When Mom unlocked and 
opened the front door at 3:00 

01:11:52.884 --> 01:11:54.884
a.m.

01:11:55.938 --> 01:11:58.305
, she was in her nightgown. Dad 
was  asleep.

01:12:01.363 --> 01:12:02.980
He wants to kill me, he told 
her, looking over his shoulder. 

01:12:02.981 --> 01:12:04.981
3:00 a.m.

01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:08.041
and in her nightgown, Dad 
asleep.

01:12:09.288 --> 01:12:12.133
What's going on, she asked. Who 
wants to kill you? He looked 

01:12:12.134 --> 01:12:15.172
over his shoulder. The devil 
does. Look at him. Over there.

01:12:16.013 --> 01:12:20.077
   She asked, what are you on? 
Who wants to kill you?

01:12:23.137 --> 01:12:28.028
The sky wasn't black or blue, 
but the green of a dying night. 

01:12:28.029 --> 01:12:30.673
The devil, look at him, over 
there. He pointed to the corner 

01:12:30.674 --> 01:12:32.674
house.

01:12:34.338 --> 01:12:36.338
The sky wasn't black or blue, 
but the dying green of night.

01:12:40.241 --> 01:12:43.281
Stars had closed their eyes or 
sheathed their knives. My 

01:12:43.282 --> 01:12:45.282
brother pointed to the corner 
house.

01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:49.972
His lips flickered with sores, 
stars 

01:12:51.237 --> 01:12:53.486
had closed their eyes or 
sheathed their knives. Oh, God, 

01:12:53.487 --> 01:12:56.157
I can see the tail, he said. Oh,
God, look.

01:12:58.826 --> 01:13:01.076
Mom winced at the sores on his 
lips. It's sticking out from 

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:03.077
behind the 

01:13:05.141 --> 01:13:07.141
house, oh, God, see the tail, he
said.

01:13:08.819 --> 01:13:11.285
Look at the god damned tail. He 
sat cross-legged weeping on the 

01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:13.691
front steps.

01:13:15.764 --> 01:13:18.205
Mom finally sighed, a hellish 
vision, my brother. Oh, God, oh,

01:13:18.206 --> 01:13:20.206
God, she said.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:27.376
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It doesn't 
seem like a political poem at 

01:13:27.377 --> 01:13:29.377
all, except that it 

01:13:30.453 --> 01:13:32.271
forces us to do what you hope 
poetry will make us do.

01:13:32.272 --> 01:13:33.504
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Mmhmm.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Which is to 

01:13:33.505 --> 01:13:36.366
cross over barriers, to  
sympathize, to feel 

01:13:40.022 --> 01:13:41.461
in ways we didn't, with people 
we didn't think we knew.

01:13:41.462 --> 01:13:43.462
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah.

01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:47.166
It's a poem that kind of urges 
you to say -- to stop saying 

01:13:47.167 --> 01:13:49.630
that's not my problem and to 
say, I wonder what that woman --

01:13:49.631 --> 01:13:51.631
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Mother.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Feels like.

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:56.383
Or this kid who's watching all 
of this. This is one of the 

01:13:56.384 --> 01:14:00.869
poems that -- this is the last 
poem, I think, that we read in 

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:03.928
the men's rehab center. I didn't
want to lead with it for obvious

01:14:03.929 --> 01:14:07.606
reasons. But I didn't want to 
not read it because I wanted to 

01:14:07.607 --> 01:14:09.847
know what they might make of it.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right.

01:14:11.474 --> 01:14:13.474
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: And they saw a 
lot of 

01:14:14.521 --> 01:14:16.970
the struggle, this awful monster
that's riding the brother. That 

01:14:16.971 --> 01:14:18.971
made sense to them.

01:14:21.031 --> 01:14:22.457
His inability to really be able 
to translate his experience to 

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.908
the family members, which I 
think the poem manages 

01:14:28.366 --> 01:14:30.366
interestingly by making that 
creature 

01:14:31.628 --> 01:14:33.628
real to the brother, and 
invisible to everybody else.

01:14:35.491 --> 01:14:37.491
But they also -- I think I'm not
wrong 

01:14:38.782 --> 01:14:41.224
in  connecting this to that 
afternoon. Someone there said 

01:14:41.225 --> 01:14:44.505
it's interesting, where is the 
dad? This is the mom, she's 

01:14:44.506 --> 01:14:46.506
bearing all the weight.

01:14:50.431 --> 01:14:52.263
Suddenly, it's even an 
opportunity for someone to 

01:14:52.264 --> 01:14:54.701
empathize with another figure, 
which seems really insightful to

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:57.548
me.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right. That 

01:14:57.549 --> 01:14:59.774
opportunity -- there's a great 
poem, gives us to emphasize with

01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:03.873
people we don't run into. It's a
great gift.

01:15:04.079 --> 01:15:06.079
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: Yeah. I think 
it's a great gift.

01:15:09.158 --> 01:15:11.801
And I don't think it's one to be
taken lightly. I don't think 

01:15:11.802 --> 01:15:14.448
it's enough to say yeah, 
empathy, kumbaya.

01:15:14.647 --> 01:15:16.071
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I think 

01:15:16.072 --> 01:15:18.072
that's one of the things that 
creates a sense of 

01:15:20.761 --> 01:15:22.761
toxicity that we are all kind 
of, you know, reeling from.

01:15:24.868 --> 01:15:26.868
We're producing it by writing 
off these 

01:15:28.134 --> 01:15:30.574
simple but potentially 
meaningful acts. And so I think,

01:15:30.575 --> 01:15:33.018
you know, okay, read a poem and 
try and believe in what it 

01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:37.051
causes you to feel.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right.

01:15:37.227 --> 01:15:38.687
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I think that's 
actual work.

01:15:38.688 --> 01:15:40.688
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Me, too.

01:15:43.027 --> 01:15:45.666
You told the New York New York 
Times -- that's another 

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:47.667
newspaper on the East Coast --
   (Laughter)

01:15:52.018 --> 01:15:54.456
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: There's a Deep a
deep and interesting troubling 

01:15:54.457 --> 01:15:55.690
that poems do.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: You know I 

01:15:55.691 --> 01:15:57.691
like that 

01:16:00.176 --> 01:16:01.798
word, it's kind of the anchor 
for the title poem, which comes 

01:16:01.799 --> 01:16:03.799
from the song 

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.301
and the biblical story of an 
angel troubling the water so 

01:16:07.302 --> 01:16:10.957
that it would protect the 
Israelites as they were passing 

01:16:10.958 --> 01:16:13.408
to safety. It would also heal 
them of any kind of affliction.

01:16:17.677 --> 01:16:20.337
And so troubling is a stirring 
up, but, of course, stirring up 

01:16:20.338 --> 01:16:22.338
is also trouble.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yeah.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.616
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: And I think art 
is something that asks us to do 

01:16:25.617 --> 01:16:28.488
both.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Would you 

01:16:28.489 --> 01:16:30.489
read a poem 

01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:33.998
called The United States 
Welcomes You, 41?

01:16:33.999 --> 01:16:36.219
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I want to tell 
you this poem is another poem 

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.258
that got a different title after
it was written.

01:16:45.792 --> 01:16:47.633
I was thinking about this -- 
it's pretty close on the wake of

01:16:47.634 --> 01:16:49.872
the Civil War poem. I was 
thinking about what it feels 

01:16:49.873 --> 01:16:53.964
like to be taken as a stranger 
in the country you belong to.

01:16:57.223 --> 01:16:59.662
And then this title was the 
title that I wanted to give to 

01:16:59.663 --> 01:17:01.663
the poem.

01:17:03.116 --> 01:17:05.116
The United States Welcomes  You.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Why, and by whose power were you
sent?

01:17:12.908 --> 01:17:14.947
What do you see that you may 
wish to steal? Why this dancing?

01:17:18.608 --> 01:17:20.608
Why do your dark bodies drink up
all the light?

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:25.131
What are you demanding that we 
feel? Have you stolen something?

01:17:28.999 --> 01:17:30.999
Then what is that leaping in 
your chest?

01:17:32.244 --> 01:17:34.244
What is the nature of your 
mission?

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:38.773
Do you seek to offer a 
confession? Have you anything to

01:17:38.774 --> 01:17:43.261
do with others brought by us to 
harm? Then why are you afraid?

01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:50.141
And why do you invade our night,
hands 

01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:55.458
raised, eyes wide, mute as 
ghosts?

01:17:56.345 --> 01:17:58.345
Is there something you wish to 
confess?

01:18:01.239 --> 01:18:03.914
Is this some enigmatic type of 
test? What if we fail?

01:18:07.985 --> 01:18:12.483
How and to whom do we address 
our appeal?

01:18:13.916 --> 01:18:15.916
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: For an immigrant

01:18:17.796 --> 01:18:19.796
nation, this is a really 
troubling poem.

01:18:21.454 --> 01:18:23.507
You once said you wish that more
poets were  brave, or generous 

01:18:23.508 --> 01:18:25.508
enough to risk 

01:18:26.578 --> 01:18:28.578
failing at something that 
matters.

01:18:30.879 --> 01:18:33.125
What matters most to you as a 
poet?

01:18:34.542 --> 01:18:36.376
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: I asked a 
student that once when she was 

01:18:36.377 --> 01:18:40.674
in my office. And we were 
talking about her poems. And I 

01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:42.714
was giving her feedback. She 
bristled at every suggestion I 

01:18:42.715 --> 01:18:48.831
made. I said what's going on 
here? What's at stake for you? 

01:18:48.832 --> 01:18:52.290
What's in this room with us 
right now that's causing this? 

01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:54.723
And she said I just want to 
write truth. And she burst into 

01:18:54.724 --> 01:18:56.415
tears.
   (Laughter)

01:18:56.416 --> 01:18:58.244
&gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: And I love her, 
you know.

01:18:58.245 --> 01:18:59.461
(Laughter)
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: And I feel 

01:18:59.462 --> 01:19:01.462
that way, too.

01:19:03.365 --> 01:19:05.820
I want something that's not just
a testament to me and feeling, 

01:19:05.821 --> 01:19:07.821
you know, 

01:19:10.551 --> 01:19:12.378
proud of this momentary thing I 
might be or something I feel 

01:19:12.379 --> 01:19:14.440
like I might know. I want to 
write poems that are going to 

01:19:17.106 --> 01:19:19.463
push me to kind of touch that 
big thing, you know. And you 

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:22.191
mostly won't, right. That's the 
failure that I'm kind of setting

01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:25.045
myself up for. But the wish is, 
like, I want something 

01:19:28.512 --> 01:19:32.191
that's going to make this life 
kind of bearable, you know? Or 

01:19:32.192 --> 01:19:35.709
something.
   I mean, the less, kind of, 

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:37.946
like, lofty answer is I'm 
interested in what 

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.096
we do to each other in all the 
contexts that we operate in -- 

01:19:45.097 --> 01:19:47.097
in families, in 

01:19:49.987 --> 01:19:52.041
relationships, in society, and 
what's the fallout from that and

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:55.708
what could we take from that.
   &gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's such an 

01:19:55.709 --> 01:20:00.211
honor to talk to you and hear 
you talk about poetry. Thank you

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.850
so much.
   &gt;&gt; TRACY SMITH: My honor. 

01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:03.851
Thank you.

01:20:05.069 --> 01:20:07.069
(Applause)

01:20:27.981 --> 01:20:31.074
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Tracy and Ron. I 
have just a few announcements 

01:20:31.075 --> 01:20:34.343
before I let you all go. First 
of all, a week from today the 

01:20:37.203 --> 01:20:39.203
center will kick off its 
first-ever 

01:20:41.059 --> 01:20:43.909
podcast series, featuring our 
21st Poet Laureate. I know it's 

01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:45.334
technology, but it's still worth
listening to.

01:20:45.335 --> 01:20:47.335
(Laughter)

01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:51.150
&gt;&gt; This is the website.
   (Laughter)

01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:58.466
&gt;&gt; Give into your inner techy 
self and go there, please. 

01:20:58.467 --> 01:21:00.904
Second, if you haven't already, 
please fill out the survey forms

01:21:00.905 --> 01:21:02.905
when you received when coming 
in.

01:21:05.619 --> 01:21:08.464
You can drop them off at the 
table in the foyer. Your input 

01:21:08.465 --> 01:21:10.465
helps us improve events such as 
these.

01:21:14.181 --> 01:21:16.415
And we'll have a book signing in
the pavilion next door.

01:21:19.477 --> 01:21:22.933
We hope you'll get a signed copy
and congratulate Tracy. Finally,

01:21:22.934 --> 01:21:24.959
this event concludes the 
literary season, but I would be 

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.960
remiss if I didn't tell you that
down the 

01:21:29.268 --> 01:21:31.268
street is a big poetry festival 
taking place.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.559
Splitthis

01:21:41.951 --> 01:21:43.951
This Rock has free evening 
readings.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:47.312
You can go to the website, look 
around, keep your ears open, 

01:21:47.313 --> 01:21:50.398
hear some poetry, it will be 
great. Enjoy the rest of 

01:21:50.399 --> 01:21:52.399
National Poetry 

01:21:53.419 --> 01:21:56.409
Month, and hope to see you back 
here soon. Thank you.

01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:01.470
(Applause)
