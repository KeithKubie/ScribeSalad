[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:07.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.710
BRADY BENNETT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.320
Awesome.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.220
So in celebration of
Black History Month,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.040
members of the Black
Googler Network in Ann Arbor

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.130
created a film that explores
their past experiences

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.180
as it pertains to their initial
realizations of being black.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.590
This project was inspired
by the 2017 CNN featurette,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.830
"The First Time I
Realized I Was Black,"

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.470
and the 1903 book
by W. E. B. Du Bois

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.320
entitled "The Souls
of Black Folk."

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.380
We just finished watching an
incredibly powerful film that

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.720
showcases some
poignant experiences

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.745
that black people in America
face on a daily basis.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:48.370
And I'm honored to
have the opportunity

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.150
to unpack these stories
here today with Stephanie.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.410
So let's get started.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.070
There are a few stories that
point out a specific moment

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.400
where a physical feature or a
sense of identity beyond just

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.340
the color of someone's
skin was a primary catalyst

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.930
for the interviewees'
personal experience.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.550
So we're talking about
hair, the clothes,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.860
the origin of their name even.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.230
With your focus being
on diversity, equity,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.610
and inclusion, particularly
in hierarchies of education,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.720
how would you say
these catalysts could

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.360
be potential
obstacles or pitfalls

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.940
in the black experience
in terms of education

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.290
or professional environments?

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.820
STEPHANIE HICKS: Sure.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.520
So I want to say something
first about context.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.460
I think it's really important
to be clear about the context.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.370
The interviewees weren't just
talking about their experiences

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.730
of being black within their
home communities where everyone

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.650
else identified the same way.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.120
We're talking about
the first time

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.620
mainly that folks
realized they were

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.080
black coming into contact
with those who were different

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.810
than them, what it's like to
be black in America, what it's

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.010
like to be black in the context
of racism and white supremacy.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.660
So I want to be
clear about that.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.730
And so when we're
talking about racism

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.420
or any form of oppression,
there's a dominant culture.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.400
There's the dominant
culture and there's

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.520
the culture around which
we determine what's

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.030
normal and good, and
everything outside of that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.500
can be seen as having less
value or no value at all.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.150
So these catalysts
that you mentioned,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.440
whether they're hair or
clothes, they become pitfalls

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.870
when they're put in the context
of the dominant culture,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.920
and the dominant culture
isn't OK with that.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.850
So those pitfalls aren't just
pitfalls in and of themselves.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.460
I want to make sure that we're
talking about that in context.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.290
So we see this coming up anytime
we see black folks coming

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.010
into contexts with institutions
where whiteness has been

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.313
the norm, and those catalysts
signal otherness in a way

00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:53.980
that the dominant
culture isn't OK with.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.460
So we see that when we're
interviewing for jobs,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.850
and a particular name means
we don't get a call back,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.980
or we see that when our dress
is disciplined through dress

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.310
codes, or we see that when we're
disproportionately punished

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.320
or pushed out of schools.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.140
And so those things add
up in the sort of minute,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.050
even though they're
not minute, instances.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.020
But they add up over time.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.015
And they keep us from
gaining access to places.

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:23.890
And they keep us from
advancing in the places

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.930
that we do gain access to.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.800
Yeah.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.150
BRADY BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.440
Awesome.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.770
So, additionally, we see that
many of these experiences

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.150
can stem from just a pure
misconception of a black person

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.360
as an individual or even beyond
that black people in general.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.180
So when we look
back on the film,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.790
there was this idea of
good black, bad black,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.060
ghetto, not ghetto, et cetera.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.380
But tying into that
previous question--

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.950
what could be the effects or
outcomes of the experiences

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.340
on black people and in
what ways, if any at all,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.660
can we combat clarify
these misperceptions.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.190
STEPHANIE HICKS: Yeah, so in
my field-- so in intergroup

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.890
relations we talk
a lot about how

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.120
people understand themselves as
parts of various social groups

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.810
and either belonging or
not belonging to groups.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.510
So we know that people
tend to view folks

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.900
within their own group as
more favorable than out-group.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.390
And we also know that
it's incredibly difficult

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.260
to change folks perception
of those in the out-group,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.070
even when positive images
of those in the out-group

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.293
are presented to them.

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:35.710
So that's why we
see what we see--

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.380
we-- as was noted in the film.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.280
We see people continuing
to have experiences

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.860
with either white folks or
non-black folks of color

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.320
where they're confronted with
those stereotypes coming back

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.160
to them in a negative way no
matter what they're presenting.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.493
But we need to remember that
those cognitive processes--

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.702
these processes of figuring
out who's in the in-group

00:04:55.702 --> 00:04:58.300
and who's in the out-group,
again, may happen in context.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.322
We're not just finding
out where we belong

00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:02.530
and where we don't, we're
finding out where we belong

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.470
and where we don't in
the context of racism.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.100
And so that means that our
institutions are constantly

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.900
giving us messages
about who matters

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.260
and who doesn't, who's
in and who's out.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.270
What I think is really
hopeful about that,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.853
and to answer your
question about what

00:05:17.853 --> 00:05:19.780
we can do to combat it--

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.510
it means that these
things aren't innate.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.180
These senses of who's in
and who's out, who belongs

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.640
and who doesn't, they're
not necessarily innate.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.090
They are part of the messages
that are constantly reinforced

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.860
by our various
institutions-- be they

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.320
schools, be their
corporations, be

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.620
they the criminal legal system.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.400
And so if they're not
innate, if they're learned,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.170
that means that they
can be unlearned.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.360
And so when you're talking
about what we can do,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.420
I think that we begin to learn--

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.040
when we start to create
different institutions--

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.030
different social, political,
economic structures--

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.250
that have different
messages about who matters,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.350
and who doesn't,
and so then we start

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.050
to internalize those messages
as opposed to the ones that

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.720
have been internalized.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.510
Everyone, I think, can take
part in that in different ways.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.570
But I do think that's possible.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.110
BRADY BENNETT: Awesome.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.230
So taking a look at
each of these stories,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.030
we also noticed this realization
of blackness or being different

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.080
and how it comes in
many different forms.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.310
We saw the very overt,
loud ways and even

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.160
some of the more
subtle, covert ones when

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.000
it comes to racial epithets,
being watched, or followed,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.620
even questioned.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.600
With that in mind,
what ways can you

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.230
say this can alter the
mannerisms or presentation

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.680
of black people that they
give off in order just

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.770
to validate their right to
be somewhere or even maintain

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.940
their own personal safety.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.360
STEPHANIE HICKS: Yeah.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.360
So I want to say there's a
range of ways that people react

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.320
to oppression and what we saw
in the film is representative

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.610
of that range.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.730
Sometimes we respond by trying
to educate someone else,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.190
trying to let them
know why I'm different

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.680
or we're different than
a particular stereotype.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.270
Sometimes we shut down.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.700
Sometimes we are in shock
and we're not really sure

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.260
how to respond.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.450
And sometimes our response
is fear and that's

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.220
very legitimate
given what we know

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.250
about how racist violence
shows up in spaces.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.260
But I think that
the interviewees

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.358
pointed to a dilemma that
lots of us can relate to,

00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:24.900
many black folks
can relate to having

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.020
to think about choices of
our presentation, our style,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.380
the way we dress, the way we
speak, who we interact with,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.480
or what we should do to
make others comfortable

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.320
or, at the very least,
incite less fear,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.720
if we feel like that's
what we need to do.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.260
We can definitely be made to
feel that way in the context

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.250
that we're in.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.320
And I think they--
those messages come

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.820
and they've been
internalized by us,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.310
they've internalized by
folks in our communities,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.080
and they have real impacts.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.688
I still live with folks--

00:07:53.688 --> 00:07:55.980
live amongst folks who think
that pulling up your pants

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.410
and straightening your
hair is the thing to do,

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.990
but, and to be fair,
they've probably

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.490
lived through
experiences where that

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.750
might have been true for them.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.295
But what I want to say about
that is we know there's a cost

00:08:08.295 --> 00:08:11.113
to that-- to those of
us who have to do it--

00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:13.530
for those of us who are faced
with that dilemma constantly

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.837
of having to change-- or
whether to change our hair,

00:08:15.837 --> 00:08:18.170
change our style or dress,
change the way that we speak,

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.680
change who we associate with--

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.382
that comes at a
psychological cost

00:08:21.382 --> 00:08:23.590
us, that comes at an emotional
cost to us, that comes

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.640
at an intellectual cost to us.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.490
And we know that it
doesn't necessarily work,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.770
that it doesn't actually
chip away at the systems

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:32.940
that we're living in.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.940
It doesn't do anyone any favors
in terms of restructuring

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.220
the systems that we're in.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.270
So, yes, I want to say those
impacts are definitely real

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:47.070
and we know that the ways that
we're pressured to shift--

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.080
succumbing to that
pressure-- doesn't help us

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.220
and it doesn't shift the
places that we're living in.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.410
BRADY BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.550
Now, I guess, with all of
that being said, for those

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.150
who are on the outside looking
in on these experiences

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.360
that black or minority
communities endure

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.230
on a daily basis, what would
you say the role of an ally

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.920
could be in efforts to dispel
those misconceptions and combat

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.200
moments like the ones
mentioned in the film

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.380
in a supportive
or productive way?

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.880
STEPHANIE HICKS:
So I think allies--

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.460
and in this case allies
to people of color,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.610
I'm talking about white folks
and in certain situations

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.260
other non-black folks of color.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.952
I think the most supportive
and productive work they can do

00:09:33.952 --> 00:09:35.410
is realize the work
they have to do

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.620
within themselves and
in their communities

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.760
and let that be their focus.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.155
So white and non-white
folks of color

00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:44.530
should ask themselves
how they're

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.020
implicated in a racist society.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.480
What-- how have they benefited?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.940
How have they participated
in these systems

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.440
actively or passively?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.680
It is impossible
to be in a society

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.040
that we're in without
breathing in the fog of that--

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.060
of these systems.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.120
So I think the
thing that folks can

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.610
do is really focus on
their participation,

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.355
and focus on how they've
benefited, and focus on the--

00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:10.878
on that type of work.

00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:12.420
When you're asking
yourselves those--

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.410
when you're asking
yourselves those questions,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.202
that leads you to the
places you should go,

00:10:16.202 --> 00:10:19.480
which is to other folks who
want to band up with you

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.173
and push back against
these systems.

00:10:22.173 --> 00:10:24.340
And then you can do it from
a more empathetic place.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.343
So if you're doing
your own work,

00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:28.510
if you're focused on the
internal work that you have

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.802
to do, and the work that you
have to do within your own

00:10:30.802 --> 00:10:34.360
communities-- not necessarily
about being the best ally

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.730
or being the most down person--

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.530
it puts you in a place
to be empathetic,

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.550
so when your
friend's mom says, I

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.710
don't want my child
playing with black folks,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:49.580
you can say, hey, Suzy
or whoever, I too--

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.400
I know-- we've been
in the same community,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.570
we've grown up in
the same place,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.370
I know we've gotten
those same messages,

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.828
why don't we think
about how we can

00:10:55.828 --> 00:10:58.840
unpack that as opposed to
maybe some of the other ways

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.240
that we see folks intervening,
which is much more about maybe

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.750
making sure that they
appear to be the best ally

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.820
or seen that way by others.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.390
BRADY BENNETT: Absolutely.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.900
And I guess, just as far
as my final question--

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.760
I think it would
be remiss of me not

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.720
to ask, of course, with
this being the case,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.940
but Stephanie, what
is the first time you

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.330
realized you were black?

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.247
STEPHANIE HICKS: Yeah.

00:11:29.247 --> 00:11:32.540
So I was thinking about this
and like was mentioned--

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.440
as was mentioned in
the film, I grew up

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.800
in a black space, black
community, black schools,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.760
black extracurricular
activities.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.250
And so I think I had a pretty
deep sense of being proud

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.960
of my blackness
when I was younger.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.460
When I went to
middle school, it was

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.400
the first time I'd
gone to a racially

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.660
integrated middle school--

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.790
and the thing to do was
read "Seventeen" magazine.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:01.800
But this is like the late '90s,
so I went from being obsessed

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.780
with Aaliyah and trying to
wear my hair over one eye to--

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.840
the thing was beach waves--

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.340
the girls on the
covers of magazines

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.590
was supposed have beach waves.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.750
And so I remember I had this
edition of "Seventeen" magazine

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.670
and it was all about
how to get beach waves.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.253
And so I bought all
this stuff, and it

00:12:19.253 --> 00:12:22.140
was like spray your
roots, and blow dry it.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.880
And so I tried to do
this and my mom just

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.730
watched me wear
myself out with this.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.500
And she goes-- and
I was, like, mom,

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.240
I can't do want I
want-- beach waves.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.348
And she just goes, you're
black, get over it.

00:12:33.348 --> 00:12:34.890
And it was one of
those and-- but she

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.180
said it in this way that
wasn't necessarily punishing,

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.200
it was, like, this is who you
are and that's not a thing.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.290
I'm going to let you
have your moment,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.072
but this is different
than what you have

00:12:45.072 --> 00:12:46.530
and what you have
to offer, so that

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.738
was one of the first moments.

00:12:47.738 --> 00:12:52.650
But I will say, in the context
of what I do every day--

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.670
I'm a faculty member
on a university campus.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.862
And I think I'm reminded often
of my blackness in the same way

00:12:58.862 --> 00:13:00.570
that lots of folks
mentioned in the film.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.317
I constantly-- I'm in
spaces where I may be,

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:06.650
not the only person of color,
but the only black person,

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.450
or I'm the only black woman,
or I'm definitely the youngest

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.610
person by a long shot.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.693
So I'm-- so I'm reminded
in that way as well--

00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:16.860
that those are some moments.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.540
Yeah.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.510
BRADY BENNETT: Awesome.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.540
I guess when you
point that out, I

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.220
see there's,
obviously, the very two

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.380
different distinctions
of that realization,

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.990
but going to the
former of those--

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.390
getting that initial
identification

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.510
from someone in
your familiar group,

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.960
how does that experience
vary from, like you said,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.975
the everyday experiences
that you have now.

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:40.350
STEPHANIE HICKS:
Yeah, so I think

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.620
in that instance with my mom--

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.600
I'm her child and I was her
daughter, her black daughter,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.520
who was an image
of her and someone

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.530
that she had raised to
be very proud of that.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.740
And so her reminding--

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.140
her reminder of my blackness
was one that was out of love--

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.890
this is-- these are all the
things that you should embrace,

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.838
even though you're
not maybe reflected

00:14:04.838 --> 00:14:06.630
in some of the dominant
images that we see.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.700
What you have is still
beautiful and valuable.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.790
I think, compared to the latter
instances, maybe my blackness

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.330
sometimes, or oftentimes,
depending on what is happening,

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.870
is a reminder of
those larger systems

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.840
in which folks haven't been
able to advance in the ways

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.710
that they should.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.530
I don't look around
campus and notice

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.250
that there are few black
faculty and think we just

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.310
can't do this, it's because
there are certain systems that

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.610
are set up to prevent that or--

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.220
actively or passively.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.470
And so I think the first
is different from the last

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.070
in that way.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.075
Is that helpful?

00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:47.867
BRADY BENNETT: Yes.

00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:49.032
Very much so.

00:14:49.032 --> 00:14:53.860
And I also just want to
ask being that you're here

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.060
at Google with us
today but you're

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.950
speaking to your
personal experiences

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.100
at the University of
Michigan, in what ways,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.940
or if there are any,
are these misconceptions

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.330
or are these structures
being combated

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.850
on the university from not
only a student perspective,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.990
but also from that
of a faculty member?

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.060
STEPHANIE HICKS: Yeah.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.900
So Michigan has been
a couple of years

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.570
into its diversity,
equity, and inclusion plan.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.720
And those are things that
we see across the nation

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.130
in various places.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.650
And I think a lot about
that in my research.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.740
I think particularly about
how social justice education

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.480
programs-- which
I'm a part of one--

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.840
how they fare in this
space of diversity, equity,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.370
and inclusion These spaces that
were built to teach students

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.690
how to think about--

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.310
or actually, to
push them to think

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.990
critically about these systems
that we live in and do it

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.240
through peer-to-peer learning.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.780
I think a lot about how
educational spaces like that,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.970
that were built
within the university

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.353
but built to push
back against some

00:15:55.353 --> 00:15:57.020
of the institutional
racism that we see,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.470
how they actually do under
diversity and equity inclusion

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.190
plans.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.510
And interestingly, what we see
is that sometimes, the edge

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.830
sort of gets blunted off.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:12.200
When we bring in some diversity,
equity, and inclusion programs,

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.990
we sometimes start to
see an incorporation

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.890
of the things that were
maybe most radical or most

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.190
challenging sort of get
swept up into that in a way

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.870
that some folks wouldn't
be comfortable with.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.700
But I will say amongst
faculty at all times

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.590
and amongst staff at
all times, there's

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:36.290
always a contestation to that
type of institutional racism

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.190
that we see.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.610
Whether it is by simply being
a part of the institution

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.040
and trying to create a way
for others to come into it

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.950
and thereby make it
different, or it's

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.568
trying to be supportive of
what students are doing.

00:16:49.568 --> 00:16:51.860
Trying to be supportive of
policies and procedures that

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.470
are going to shift what
our campus looks like.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.780
And not only what our campus
looks like but the ways

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.750
that we're participating
in our campus.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.250
Or whether it's folks who are
questioning what's going on.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.670
Whether they're questioning
policing on our campus,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.880
or questioning who comes to
campus, or questioning what

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.500
is taught in our classrooms.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.900
That's an incredibly
powerful tool

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.060
that faculty always have
at their disposal-- what

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.040
is taught in their classrooms.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.970
So people are always
pushing back in those ways.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.280
And I think it's important
to think about the ways

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.230
that we see that in an
institutionalized way

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.160
and the ways that we just see
it popping up from various folks

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.960
here and there and everywhere.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.120
BRADY BENNETT: And then
also, being that many of us

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.520
here in the Ann Arbor
office at Google

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.370
are members of that
very community,

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.280
whether we be sprinkled
within or on the outskirts

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.720
of the university's campus.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.780
With that in mind,
what ways, if any,

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.560
will we be able to find
a way to assist or lend

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.100
our services in any way in order
to build a greater cohesion

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.460
amongst our two communities?

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.380
STEPHANIE HICKS: Yeah.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.540
I would say keep conversations
like this going is

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.400
the first one.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.580
But also, I would be
interested to know what

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.980
Google is doing in terms of DI.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.110
But also off on
the sides of that,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.710
what are the interactions
like between people?

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.200
Are you making time to
think about difference

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.250
and how it shows up in your
community, in your workspace?

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.070
And again, focusing
on what you're doing,

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.970
and then finding the natural
ways to bond with others.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.480
So if Google is partnered up
with Michigan in some ways--

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.460
I don't know what
those ways might

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.920
be-- but if Google is
partnered up in those ways,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.120
thinking about how to
make that partnership

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.240
one that benefits the
most marginalized folks

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.850
within Michigan's community.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.000
And thinking about how to
further that at every turn,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.170
and making that the
focus of your program.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.680
So one, what are
you already doing?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.110
And then how do you
shift that so it's

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.010
the most just way that you
can connect with the Michigan

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.520
community?

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.180
Those who are coming in.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:03.680
Yeah.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.110
So again, doing a lot
of the internal work,

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.702
and then transferring
that outward.

00:19:08.702 --> 00:19:10.041
Does that make sense?

00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:13.270
BRADY BENNETT: It does, it does.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.670
Well, that is it for my
portion of the questions,

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.210
but I do want to
open the floor up

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.180
to anyone in the
audience who may just

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.750
have some questions pertaining
to the film in general or any

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.720
questions specifically
for Stephanie

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.370
that we can try to address.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.162
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Dr. Hicks, for coming.

00:19:31.162 --> 00:19:32.530
I really appreciated the talk.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.850
The questions that I have
is, often, black individuals

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.450
who are considered successful
and often navigate white spaces

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.360
are often called terms
like Oreo or accused

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.340
of talking white
by both individuals

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.470
in the dominant group, but also
by people in their own group

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.330
as well.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.480
And so sometimes,
these terms will

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.830
be used by white individual
as terms of acceptance.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.330
Like oh, no.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.150
You're one of us.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.100
You're an Oreo.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.960
But often, if you really dissect
what the term Oreo means,

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.860
it really is associating
blackness with mediocrity

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.990
and whiteness with success.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.052
And so how do we
reshape this narrative

00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:11.260
where that is often the case?

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.490
STEPHANIE HICKS: Yeah.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.760
So again, this makes me think
about intergroup relations.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.862
And right now, I'm actually
teaching foundations

00:20:17.862 --> 00:20:19.570
of intergroup relations,
and our students

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.030
are thinking about
this very thing, right?

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.090
It's the moment where--

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.990
we've just past the
moment where we're

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.240
thinking about stereotypes,
and how they're activated,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.500
and how they're formed.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.470
And the students are, they're
hitting a wall, as we all do.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.700
Because they're like, wait.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.000
So you mean I've been learning
this from a very young age?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.780
What is going on?

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.070
What does this mean?

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.962
And so we start to talk
about socialization-- the way

00:20:39.962 --> 00:20:41.920
that we move through
those various institutions

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.753
that I talked about.

00:20:42.753 --> 00:20:44.600
The legal system, our
educational system,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.070
our religious institutions,
media, what have you.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.945
And we realize that
we're getting--

00:20:50.945 --> 00:20:52.570
much of our message
that we're getting,

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.750
we're getting from there.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.180
And we're getting
them from people

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.513
that we know and respect, right?

00:20:56.513 --> 00:20:58.540
So it's not just
someone's yelling

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.710
at you horrible things
about an out-group

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.202
and you're just taking them.

00:21:03.202 --> 00:21:04.660
These things are
coming from spaces

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.840
that we know and trust, which
is what helps them continue.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.320
So I think what we really
need to think about again

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.240
is socialization.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.310
Who are we coming into
contact with at our earliest,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.350
most formative stages, and
throughout our progression?

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.462
And how do we're not necessarily
shift who those people are--

00:21:23.462 --> 00:21:25.420
we still want to be a
part of our communities--

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.490
but shift how we're
sharing those messages

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.890
and shift how we're combating
those messages at every turn?

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.560
So what that means,
though, is that we

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.170
have to change structures so
that those interactions are

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.130
different.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.000
It's really hard to
have these interactions

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.920
with others that
help us see or get

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.530
a window into a
different perspective

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.550
if it's still couched in
the same larger system.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.568
You're seeking out
information that

00:21:49.568 --> 00:21:50.860
confirms what you already know.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.160
So you just get this new
example and it's a one-off.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.918
So we have to change schools.

00:21:57.918 --> 00:21:59.710
We have to change what's
going on in homes.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.770
We have to change how
we're consuming media.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.308
But that means that we
have to first notice what

00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:06.600
we're coming into contact with.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.590
We have to notice
that it's a problem.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.785
If we're not necessarily
thinking about the messages

00:22:11.785 --> 00:22:13.660
that we receive through
media or the messages

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.640
that we receive through
school as being problematic,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.120
we don't really have an
impetus to change them, right?

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.750
So we have to do a lot
of consciousness-raising.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.720
But I think again that
comes from people--

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.050
that can come from these moments
of dissonance that we have.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.285
But that can also just come
from starting to do the work.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.140
Those of us who know that
we need something different

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.410
start the process of creating
those structures however

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:42.010
we see fit.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.740
And that can be
one-by-one and two-by-two.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.170
But even in a space like Google.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.060
How are you impacting what
messages people get about what

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.050
it means to be black, and
the value of being black,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.810
and what that means in
the context of whiteness?

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.090
How are you all
shaping those messages,

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.690
and how can you be a part of
how people are being socialized

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.650
around those things?

00:23:08.308 --> 00:23:10.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:14.300
[INAUDIBLE] has
[INAUDIBLE] in the office.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.535
Some of us in this
room are parents.

00:23:16.535 --> 00:23:19.050
And maybe you answered a
little bit of this question

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.870
in your last
response, but we would

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.818
love to hear what are the one,
two things that we can do--

00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:28.100
sorry, I'm cutting in and out--
to really raise our children

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.523
to be more accepting of others?

00:23:29.523 --> 00:23:30.440
STEPHANIE HICKS: Yeah.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.320
So I'll say first, I'm
speaking as a non-parent.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.620
So I just want to
name that, because I

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.267
want to be clear that I
don't know exactly what it's

00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:40.100
like to be a parent.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.895
But what I do think--

00:23:41.895 --> 00:23:43.770
and this is something
that goes for everyone.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.437
But I think in the
context of parenting,

00:23:45.437 --> 00:23:46.490
it makes a lot of sense.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.820
Talk to other parents.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.320
Right?

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.320
So I think we often
have this perception,

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.650
or this understanding--
and I think it comes from

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.990
a well-intentioned place--

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.420
that the second we learn
all this new information,

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.720
we have to find the
biggest, boldest way

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.240
to shout it from the rooftops
and change everything

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.890
overnight.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.610
Being a parent is an
incredibly powerful role.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.255
So both because
of the interaction

00:24:15.255 --> 00:24:16.630
that you have with
your children,

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.660
but because of the
interaction that you

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.703
have with other parents.

00:24:18.703 --> 00:24:20.870
So I think one of the most
important things that you

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.690
can do is start to
talk to other parents

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.790
about what it is you're seeing.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.740
What is it that you're
coming to understand?

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.210
What do you still
not understand?

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.850
What is still complex
and confusing?

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.560
And building power
within yourselves,

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.040
what might you do then to start
to unlearn some of the things

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.750
that you've learned?

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.590
I think it's a really
powerful question

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.090
when people start
to ask themselves,

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.610
How did we get here?

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.000
How did we find ourselves in
the situation that we're in?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.200
Because that then helps you
identify both what's missing

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.000
and other folks who
share that same concern.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.820
And then you can think
about, as parents,

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.650
what are your next best steps?

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.233
What are the ways that you're--
what are your parenting styles

00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:00.733
like?

00:25:00.733 --> 00:25:02.330
What are you doing
with your children?

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.260
And how could that
be in the service

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.810
of shifting some of these
messages that come around you?

00:25:11.588 --> 00:25:12.130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.760
Thank you very much for coming.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.612
My question is in the
height of the era where--

00:25:16.612 --> 00:25:19.070
I'm sure you've heard this,
but racists aren't really scary

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.800
anymore, and they're kind of out
and showing themselves to us.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.125
As an educator, do you come
across a lot of frustration

00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:26.750
when it comes to
being the person who's

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.480
trying to teach people,
and does it feel like we're

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.755
kind of reverting back to
all of the work that was done

00:25:32.755 --> 00:25:35.005
under the civil rights
movement or all the people that

00:25:35.005 --> 00:25:36.410
kind of cleared the way for us?

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.910
Do you feel like
this radicalization

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.317
is making you take
huge steps back,

00:25:40.317 --> 00:25:42.400
or do you feel like it's
opening the space for you

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.210
to have conversations
more freely?

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.530
STEPHANIE HICKS: Mm-hmm.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.700
So I think the answer
is D, all the above.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:57.050
So in terms of what it makes
me think of as an educator--

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.670
well, I should say this.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.472
Before I was at the
University of Michigan,

00:26:01.472 --> 00:26:02.930
I was at the
University of Illinois

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.970
at Chicago, which is a different
context and a different city.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.680
I'm from Chicago.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.710
I'm from the south
side of Chicago.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.487
Yeah, Chicago!

00:26:09.487 --> 00:26:12.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:17.030
So I was in that space, and my
student body looked different.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.610
Because was it just a different
space and a different type

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.650
of institution.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.060
So a lot of what's
happening-- or not what's

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.358
happening in my classroom, but a
lot of the classes that I teach

00:26:29.358 --> 00:26:31.400
or the courses that I
teach, my student body just

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.067
looks different.

00:26:32.067 --> 00:26:35.830
I look out into
classrooms that are filled

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.330
with more white students, filled
with more wealthy students,

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.770
and that is the nature of those
two different institutions.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.520
And so I think that, sure.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.760
I'm confronted with
different things.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.700
But I also-- and I
do think that there

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.390
is a sense in which some
folks are more emboldened.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.210
But I think we have to think
about the ways in which

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.150
white supremacy and all of
these various institutions

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.640
that we're talking about
show themselves every day,

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.210
and have shown themselves every
day before the current moment.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.230
And they showed themselves in
sort of really nuanced ways

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:20.010
that come up even out of the
most sort of well-meaning ways.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:21.990
So in my classroom,
actually, because I'm

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.780
teaching a lot of classes
that are around intergroup

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.892
relations, a lot of
students opt into them

00:27:26.892 --> 00:27:28.350
and they want to
be a part of them.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.370
I actually don't have
regular experiences

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.637
with my classroom with students
who hold those types of views,

00:27:35.637 --> 00:27:37.470
though they do present
themselves definitely

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.040
around campus and in
the greater context.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.420
But what I do see is the ways
that we are all implicated

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.490
in these systems every day.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.120
And so sometimes,
actually, that can

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.490
be challenging and difficult to
work with in a different way.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.280
Because we're all
working on the assumption

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.810
that we're really good people.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.450
And we're really good people
who don't hold particular ideas.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.330
And we want to stop the
bad thing over there.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.100
Racism is the bad
thing over there,

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.840
and racists are the
bad people over there

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.520
that we want to stop.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.250
And when we're working
from that place,

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:20.970
we can sort of fail to see
how we allow these messages

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.160
that the dominant culture
gives to impact all that we do,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:29.370
whether we are actively
doing it or not.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.240
So yes.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.212
I do see some things that
make me think, one, I'm tired

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:36.420
and I don't want to get up
in front of this classroom

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.350
and teach this again.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.620
Some days I definitely
have that struggle.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:46.380
But I also think that my
job provides a lot of hope.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.488
Because what I do
see often, too,

00:28:48.488 --> 00:28:51.030
are a lot of folks who are part
of a dominant culture who are

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.610
trying to think differently.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.620
So it's a mixed bag.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.110
It really, really is.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.470
So I see both.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.670
Yeah.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.560
BRADY BENNETT: Well, it
looks like we're just

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.670
coming up on time.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.850
So again, thank you
so much, Stephanie,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.620
for joining us today.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.420
This discussion was very
helpful, very powerful.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.530
I hope that it is of some
service to you and the audience

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.650
today.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.270
But again, thank
you all for coming,

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.970
and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:21.320
