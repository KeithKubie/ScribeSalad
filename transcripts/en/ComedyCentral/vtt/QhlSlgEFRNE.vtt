00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:03.604
TALL-TALE GOLD MEDALIST
RYAN LOCHTE

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:05.405
HAS STARTED HIS FORGIVENESS TOUR
WITH AN APPEARANCE

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.574
ON THE NEW SEASON
OF <i>DANCING WITH THE STARS.</i>

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.710
IF EVERYONE'S DANCING,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.546
AND THIS TIME,
HE WAS REALLY ALMOST MUGGED.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.082
-LIAR! -GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOUS:
THERE IT IS.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.584
PROTESTERS COME ON TO THE STAGE.
THEY'RE GRABBED BY SECURITY.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.720
SECURITY TAKES HIM DOWN
RIGHT THERE.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.154
-WHOA.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:23.757
-YEAH, MAMBO NUMBER FIVE-O.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.560
UH, I WONDER IF THAT PROTESTER
IS GONNA TELL EVERYONE

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.962
THAT HE WAS ALMOST ROBBED. UH...

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:30.964
-(LAUGHTER)
-COMEDIANS, IT'S BEEN

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.567
NEARLY A WHOLE MONTH SINCE RYAN
LOCHTE'S CONTROVERSIAL RUN-IN

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.537
WITH A BRAZILIAN GAS STATION,
AND NOW HE'S DANCING ON THE TV.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.472
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO FEEL ABOUT HIM.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.707
IS IT TIME TO FORGIVE HIM?
DO WE FORGIVE HIM?

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.042
ARE WE NOT OKAY WITH HIM?

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.844
-NO. -NO.
-WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.078
-WHOA! -DUDE.
-(LOUD AUDIENCE CHATTER)

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.747
THE AUDIENCE HAS
SOME VERY STRONG OPINIONS.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.015
VERY STRONG OPINIONS.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.384
A LOT OF SWEARING IN PORTUGUESE
FROM THE AUDIENCE. UH...

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.552
MOSHE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:52.986
YEAH, I'M TIRED OF THE ATTITUDE.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.155
I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANYTHING
TO BE FORGIVEN FOR.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.890
HE'S A HERO.
HE'S AN AMERICAN.

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.725
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.862
WE GO TO YOUR COUNTRY,
WIN A GOLD MEDAL, PISS ON IT,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.764
AND THEN GO DO THE FOXTROT
BACK HOME.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.132
-HARDWICK: ALL RIGHT.
-(LAUGHTER)

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.935
STRAIGHT UP, I'M TIRED
OF BRAZIL. I'M TIRED OF BRAZIL

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:10.838
WITH YOUR PERFECT-ASSED WOMEN
AND YOUR PERFECT BEACHES.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.206
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.141
I GREW UP IN THE BAY AREA.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.809
CAPOEIRA CIRCLES
I HAD TO PRETEND

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.778
TO BE INTERESTED IN GROWING UP?

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.346
-HARDWICK: YEAH.
-(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE &amp; CHEERING)

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.647
GET BIT, BRAZIL.

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.016
POINTS. YEAH. CHRIS D'ELIA.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.252
I THINK HE'S BETTER
AT DANCING AROUND THE TRUTH.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.788
-YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HEY.
-WHOA! -WHOA!

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.625
BUT, NO. BUT HE DID GO TO BRAZIL
AND PEE ON THEIR THINGS.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.961
I MEAN, IF I...

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:36.063
HE WENT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY
AND DID THAT.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:39.066
IF I MISS THE TOILET BOWL AT MY
MOM'S HOUSE, I GET IN TROUBLE.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.634
OKAY? DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.669
SO, LET'S, UH...

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:43.971
THIS GUY PISSED

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:47.341
ON ONE OF BRAZIL'S
MOST IMPORTANT LANDMARKS--

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:50.878
A GAS STATION DOOR, OKAY?

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.412
-(LAUGHTER)
-YEAH.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.014
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, INSTEAD OF

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.884
FOCUSING ON MAKING AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN,

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.853
LET'S MAKE BRAZIL GREAT
FOR ONCE.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:01.488
HARDWICK:
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.056
-(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE &amp; CHEERING)
-YEAH.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.225
SO MUCH
FOR FORGIVING HIM OR NOT.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.693
I'LL GIVE YOU POINTS FOR THAT.

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.395
-AISLING.
-WELL, AMERICA,

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.531
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM
DANCE OFF A CLIFF.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:12.199
THIS IS SO INTERESTING--

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:15.469
THE WAY AMERICA PUNISHES
ITS WHITE MEN. ON A...

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:18.272
"WHAT'S THAT, BILL CLINTON?
YOU LIED UNDER OATH.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.274
"WELL, YOU CAN BE DAMN SURE
YOU'LL CONTINUE

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.442
TO BE PRESIDENT
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS."

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.444
-(LAUGHTER) -HARDWICK: YEAH.
-"WHAT'S THAT, RYAN LOCHTE?

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:28.115
"YOU VANDALIZE A TOILET, AND
THEN BLAME THE POOR BRAZILIANS.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.185
"WELL, YOU CAN BE DAMN SURE
WE ARE GOING TO PUT YOU STERNLY

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:33.887
"ON ONE OF THE MOST
HIGHEST-GROSSING TV SHOWS

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.489
"IN THE WHOLE OF EARTH.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.958
-NOW DON'T YOU DO IT AGAIN!"
-HARDWICK: LISTEN.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.058
-(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
-"DO NOT DO IT AGAIN!"
