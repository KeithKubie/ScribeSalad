00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.630
At the heart of every experiment there's a good question. And these questions

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.540
come from observation. I've been observing my co-workers here at Audacity,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.790
drink coffee every single morning right when they come in. I want to know why.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.560
So, I think there might be a good experiment there. I'm going to wait here

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.187
until somebody comes, so that I can figure out what's going on. We've got

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:21.843
someone. Good morning, Andy.

00:00:21.843 --> 00:00:24.668
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good morning, Lauren.

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:26.165
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How are you?

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:27.163
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; fine.

00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:31.902
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I see you're making coffee. You drink a lot of coffee. Why is that?

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:36.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; it makes me more effective in the morning, I work better and faster I guess.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:40.564
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Are you saying that it decreases your reaction time?

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:45.580
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, I didn't say that, but I guess yeah, I guess it probably increases my

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.266
reaction time.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:50.420
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You mean decreases. Do you want me to stop asking questions this early in the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.878
morning?

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:52.650
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That would be, that would be fine.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.252
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, thank you, Andy. I think I have an idea for a good experiment. I'll see

00:00:56.252 --> 00:00:57.282
you later.
