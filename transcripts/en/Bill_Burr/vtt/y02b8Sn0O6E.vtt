00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.611
Hey,

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:06.270
what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:10.200
Monday, May 1st, 2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.210
How do you like that echo?

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:19.110
I am in my garage. This is what it's come down to.

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.840
It's like fucking a quarter to seven or 10. Seven in the morning.

7
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:25.860
I got to go to the airport. My lovely daughter is sleeping,

8
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:29.820
my wife is sleeping. There is no place in the house for me to scream and yell.

9
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.040
So I'm out here in the garage and oh by the way,

10
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:36.960
in less mild but an hour around eight o'clock.

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.300
There's people coming to my house cause um, well, you know the gas line is,

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:46.110
I dunno, 96 years fucking old.

13
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:51.111
So that thing needs to be replaced because it's leaking all over the goddamn

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.540
place. Um, that's always fun to have a baby in your hands.

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.400
You set it down towards the floor and you'd have to say things to your wife like

16
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.120
, um, do you smell gas? So, um,

17
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.480
getting that taken care of today and uh, this is it.

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.910
This is where my life is at. So I'm sitting here

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.060
on my workout bench that uh,

20
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.840
I can't use cause I fucked up my shoulder gradually getting better.

21
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:20.700
This is the longest, most nagging fucking injury ever to try to heal.

22
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:24.420
But I'm almost there and um, this is how I'm going to do what people,

23
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.220
this is how I'm going to celebrate.

24
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:29.160
This is the 10 year anniversary of the Monday morning podcast.

25
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:33.900
Can you believe that for 10 years I have been yapping to myself,

26
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.330
you know, 10 years. I have not been reading 10 years.

27
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:41.820
I been making up shit for 10 years.

28
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.510
I've been saying shit that I thought was true cause I heard somebody say it in

29
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.290
an airport. I've been doing that for 10 years. Um,

30
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.110
I want to thank everybody who's been listening. Um,

31
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.190
and I'm going to put a link to a post,

32
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.460
whatever the fuck you guys say. It's,

33
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.060
it's a thing that you click on and then it goes to the video that you want to

34
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:04.860
watch, which will be the, um, the first Monday morning podcast ever,

35
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:08.970
which I believe was about 90 seconds long. I'll give you a little history.

36
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.320
I was over a Robert Kelly's apartment back.

37
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.000
We still live right around the corner of each other.

38
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.260
When I was still living in New York City and I was over his house and he was

39
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.970
just, you know, it was typical Bob. He was just like, kid. Yeah,

40
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.280
you should do a podcast.

41
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.110
This isn't to May of 2007 one of the few things I've ever been at the beginning

42
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:34.920
of podcasting and getting a special on Netflix.

43
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.900
Those are the two things I was at the front. Like I remember, you know,

44
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.540
for my intro and comedy clubs, I would say a, they look,

45
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.120
what do you want to say? Oh, let's say he's been on this. He's been on that.

46
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:49.920
And you can see he might've seen his specials on Netflix and the host would say

47
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.790
it and people would snicker. They'd laugh in the crowd.

48
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.230
They'd laugh at that credit. Well, now look at it. Huh? Look at the, the,

49
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.670
the fucking world dominating behemoth.

50
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.883
<v 1>You know,</v>

51
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.040
<v 0>there's oil companies now that look at Netflix like, God damn,</v>

52
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:08.370
how the fuck did you do that without firing a shot?

53
00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.340
How the fuck did you do that? Right. So Netflix,

54
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.360
Netflix, and podcasting know if I was, if I was in an oil company,

55
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:20.700
I would, uh, I said I would do,

56
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.030
I would start coming up with some original content, you know what I mean?

57
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.790
And just make the show so amazing, you know,

58
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:29.970
that the stars would then go over to those countries and while everybody was

59
00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:33.390
fighting over the cast of the reboot of friends,

60
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.810
I would then run around the corner and I would start stealing their oil. That's,

61
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:41.190
that's how I would do it. You know, it's a lot less messy, you know,

62
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.900
there's excitement. Am I going to get caught? Right? Um, anyways,

63
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.870
back in the day, so I'm over Robert Kelly's apartment. He's like, dude,

64
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.950
you should do a podcast. And I was like, what is a a,

65
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:59.570
what is a podcast? [inaudible] it's like a Jib recording.

66
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.510
It's another way to connect with your face. You, who knows?

67
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.310
Now people listen to it and you're singing, Yo,

68
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.020
you doing the stretch factory Tuesday to Sunday, dude.

69
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.440
And I'm literally just fucking around on it. And I actually, I called it,

70
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.560
if you listen to my first podcast, you listened to the link. I actually,

71
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.430
<v 2>he said, I said, uh, this is my podcast.</v>

72
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.700
I was basically repeating everything that Bobby was kind of yelling to me in the

73
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:30.870
background. And um, and I called it,

74
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.220
I said a and who knows,

75
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.080
maybe this might lead to something mediocre and you know what it took might have

76
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:41.070
taken me 10 years, but God damn it, I got there. Here I am

77
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.490
sitting here and my fucking garage.

78
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.120
This is not some sort of cool reverb that you listening to.

79
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.260
This is me and my garage.

80
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.723
<v 1>Um,</v>

81
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.510
<v 0>you know what's amazing though is I gotta tell you something.</v>

82
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.210
I don't know what it is. It's, I'm such a cliched guy.

83
00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:59.970
I fucking love the garage. The garage is the shit.

84
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.300
<v 2>You know what I mean?</v>

85
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.560
It takes you back to being a single man when you barely had anything.

86
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.810
Cause I have one of those fucking garages. By the way,

87
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.000
I was not going to be the person that had the garage, right. That like, Yup,

88
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.760
<v 0>my shit. And there's no more room for this shit in your house.</v>

89
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.420
So then you take some other shit that you used to like and you stick it in a box

90
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:22.550
and then you stick it in the garage, right.

91
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.180
And gradually it starts encroaching on the car and next thing you know,

92
00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:29.420
the car can't be in there and it just fucking fills all the way up.

93
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.240
But you know what you're doing. You're slowly becoming a fucking hoarder.

94
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.400
<v 2>That's one of the saddest things I, yeah. Actually, you know,</v>

96
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:42.480
I came at and understand whether it's sad or whether it's, um,

97
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.380
you just taken responsibility for,

98
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.220
for all this shit that you buy in your life. You know,

99
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.440
I guess anybody could take it down to goodwill.

100
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.160
Anybody can throw it in the trash, take it to the dump.

101
00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.430
<v 2>It takes a real caring,</v>

103
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.360
you human being a real caring human being to just sit there

104
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.620
and in, in, in all the fucking shit you bought your entire life.

105
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.470
Every fucking newspaper, every tube of toothpaste,

106
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.600
just sitting there suffocating in your own fucking carbon footprint.

107
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.560
<v 2>You know, I just realized, you know, we shouldn't be looking down at orders.</v>

109
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:30.880
We should be looking at these people going like, Holy Shit. One human being,

110
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.380
what human being can buy all of that shit and alive.

111
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.320
It's not even a lifetime. They still live in, you know,

112
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:42.890
you can have that many pets, fucking fish tags,

113
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.420
newspapers and all of that crap. Um, I dunno,

114
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:51.080
I would happen. I'm sitting there looking over right now. You know,

115
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:55.580
my neat little fucking garage. I got like two different brooms.

116
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.580
I got this old fucking mop. I don't even know where that thing came from.

117
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.670
I think it came with the house, you know,

118
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.900
and I've been meaning to throw that thing up or where does it end up?

119
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.660
Fuck it in some beavers house,

120
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.560
some stupid mop handles sticking through his little fucking fetch of a roof.

121
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.020
All those things fast, by the way. I get those giant Goddamn teeth.

122
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.920
Fucking horse teeth, dude. It's so they can cut through the back dude. Anyway,

123
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:27.610
so it's been 10 years and, um, I'm actually, you know,

124
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:31.360
I had people on Twitter send in some of their favorite moments,

125
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.140
which I'll be reading later if I could somehow get this fucking computer to work

126
00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:39.760
while I'm out here. Um, yeah. So anyways,

127
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:42.620
let's get on with the podcast. So I, I didn't know if I even said it.

128
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.430
Thank you guys for listening, uh, throughout the years.

129
00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:49.540
Thank you to everybody who's booth advertised on the podcast,

130
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.970
whether you liked the read or you didn't,

131
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.500
whether you got upset and said that, I'm never going to advertise again.

132
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:59.500
Whatever it was, it was fun. A lot of fun.

133
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:04.030
So here's to the next 10 years, I'm still not going to read,

134
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.590
right. I don't know, whatever.

135
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.470
You know what I liked though? I'm a buck 76 right now.

136
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.180
I do like Dat away 176 pounds on roughly the fucking way that was,

137
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.560
that's probably a few pounds later, but I got to get down to it.

138
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:20.320
I got to get down the end of the month. Next month, my birthday,

139
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:24.720
I want to be like one 71 71 right? You know what? I get down to that weight.

140
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.660
I get down to that way. Guess what Dan? I'll be happy. Aha.

141
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.730
Then it'll fill the void. You know when I go on,

142
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:35.320
I put my little fucking tiger woods golf shirt on even though I don't fucking

143
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:36.154
golf.

144
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.393
<v 1>Okay.</v>

145
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.780
<v 2>Anyways. Is that fucking guy ever going to win another tournament?</v>

146
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:41.710
It really bugs me.

147
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.670
Really fucking bothers me that there's a bunch of broads out there that think

148
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:48.160
the reason why he never won another fucking tournament was because of the

149
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:51.220
bullshit of his personal life. Give me a fucking break.

150
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.980
His body broke down. That's what the fuck happened. This guy's a

151
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.140
<v 0>champion. Do you understand what the champion could do?</v>

152
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.000
A champion can block anything out.

153
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.940
If you see these guys going up trying to hit the fucking free throws,

154
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.550
everybody just waving their hands,

155
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.320
screaming a bunch of shit about the guy's wife. What did he tell? Do?

156
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.190
Nothing but net. Nothing but fucking net. You know, sky can't handle.

157
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.430
A little spat gets hit with a golf club.

158
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.280
He jumps in his escalate and he hits a fucking Rose Bush and all of a sudden,

159
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.120
all of that talent goes away. I don't know. I don't buy it.

160
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.180
I think, and I think the reason why some women,

161
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.930
some women look at me being a little measured in the next 10 years,

162
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.340
some women, the reason why I think they attributed to that is because I,

163
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.174
you know,

164
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.670
I think that they want to buy into that whole fucking thing is behind the Ivy

165
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.930
League man is a good woman. You know what I mean?

166
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.290
Which is so fucking stupid, right?

167
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.890
Obviously if you have a happy fucking marriage, your life's going to be alright,

168
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.940
but that's just another fucking, you know, everybody's always stealing credit.

169
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.880
Are we set up as a Hollywood thing and you get into a relationship. It's,

170
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.930
everybody's fucking sits there. Oh, now I'm laying down. There you go.

171
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:03.330
Now the back's better. Now the fucking back's better.

172
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.690
I don't even want to talk about, um, tell anybody.

173
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:11.400
Watch the Formula One race from soul cheek in a, in Russia.

174
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.780
It's such a weird name. So cheap. That sounds like a more like a,

175
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.710
like a Chinese or Japanese, Vietnamese Sochi.

176
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.560
That does not sound like Russian de Edo. A store of VA.

177
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.070
So Ci, that sounds too happy to be Russian,

178
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.360
but I have to tell you it was a fucking, that's a what? A gorgeous city that is.

179
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.630
Huh? You know what I mean? I mean, Russia scares the shit out of me.

180
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.120
I grew up during the, the end of the Cold War,

181
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:42.030
so I just figured you're going to go over there in a second if you have any sort

182
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:46.170
of, uh, I dunno. American shit on, it's just, you know,

183
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.570
I remember being in Finland being in this cap and it blew my mind how close I

184
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:54.240
was to Russia. It's like,

185
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.990
why I can't believe I'm this Far East in the Europe.

186
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.930
And I asked the guy if he'd ever been there and he started telling me about

187
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:05.910
Moscow, how it was, you know, a little dangerous after five, you know,

188
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.240
and I'm disliking. I just did the math in my head. It's like, alright,

189
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.460
this guy's saying it's a little dangerous. Finland beat Russia,

190
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.660
Finland defeated fucking style. Okay?

191
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.240
Stallon whose those fucking people ran over the Goddamn Nazi army with their

192
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:28.350
Mercedes-Benz fucking tanks right there.

193
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.723
Portia jeeps.

194
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.800
I can't name one fucking Russian car.

195
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.610
Alright. Just the sheer will and toughness of those people, you know?

196
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.530
Yeah. We hear those stories of them fucking,

197
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.340
they're running around in their socks in the middle of a Russian winter.

198
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:52.080
Just run in the fucking German army. Right back to Germany. You know?

199
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.460
Where else would the German army people go back to? Well,

200
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:57.340
I got to retreat back to Poland. God knows they fucking took that over. Right.

201
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.680
So I'm thinking, you know, take a beat. These guys, Jesus Christ,

202
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.890
what, how the fuck would they lose to Finland? You know,

203
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.560
that's the championship match right there.

204
00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:13.790
That's Cleveland verse the Warriors Finland. I mean, I was looking at them like,

205
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:17.870
all right, that's the fucking warriors verse. I Dunno the Phoenix Suns,

206
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.740
but the uh,

207
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.353
<v 1>yes,</v>

208
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.460
<v 0>I dunno, they fucking be, they fucking kick their ass.</v>

209
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.730
But what sucked for them was at the end of the war when Germany lost Italy fell

210
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.850
and all that shit, when the axis powers lost,

211
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.560
they were on the wrong side of the fucking table. So they went down with them.

212
00:12:39.561 --> 00:12:41.270
It was like a co op, you know what I mean?

213
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.000
Like if you pay off your shares in the building, you're like, all right, oh,

214
00:12:44.001 --> 00:12:46.970
my apartment. It's like, no, you don't, you own shares in this building.

215
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.630
But if everybody else goes belly up, the whole fucking thing is done.

216
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.460
And then you lose your shares.

217
00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:55.460
You have to go back to renting your apartment or you have to fucking leave.

218
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.610
That's what it was like. And that's what happened to them.

219
00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.660
They paid off their shares in the building in Italy.

220
00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:03.620
Germany went fucking bankrupt. And uh, next thing you know, that was it.

221
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.513
And they had the giveaway,

222
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.010
like the southern part of their fucking country or some shit.

223
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.630
They had giveaway basically the stadium in which they won the game.

224
00:13:11.631 --> 00:13:14.330
They had to give that to them. I'm pretty sure that's what the fuck happens.

225
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:15.970
So anyways, subset and they go, this is,

226
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.880
this is the DNA that this guy comes from. And he's telling me that after five,

227
00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:24.830
it gets a little fucking scary. These are people that fucking, you know,

228
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:30.380
looked old Yosef Stalad in the fucking eyes, you know,

229
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.400
fucking kicked his ass. They were like, we're on fucking cross country skis,

230
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.190
cross country ski CPT sons of bitches and this guy's nervous.

231
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.073
So I was just like, wow,

232
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.550
<v 1>okay.</v>

233
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.170
<v 0>It's gotta be a scary fucking place over there.</v>

234
00:13:42.171 --> 00:13:44.570
And then I'm watching the f one race on so cheap.

235
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.683
<v 1>Right.</v>

236
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.840
<v 0>And, uh,</v>

237
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.140
it was fucking beautiful and look like a Ron Howard film starring Tom Hanks.

238
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.480
You know, you had a beautiful city in the background.

239
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:02.220
You had went into a forest and he had mountains and little snow caps on top of

240
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:06.150
it. It looked like a postcard. Like when they take a postcard of Los Angeles,

241
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:07.860
you know,

242
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.860
like once a year it's clear enough where you can take a picture of the downtown

243
00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:17.460
La Skyline and then see snowcap mountains in the background. Right?

244
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.420
Cause they always say that, you know,

245
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:22.170
you can snowboard in the morning and be surfing in the afternoon.

246
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.500
And if you're in La, you looking around going, where the fuck can you snowboard?

247
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.160
It's cause you can't see, you can't see through all the fucking pollution. Um,

248
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.850
so anyways, so I'm watching this goddamn race from south cheese,

249
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.123
<v 1>right?</v>

250
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.823
<v 0>And um,</v>

251
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.480
I gotta tell you f one f one figured it out so far,

252
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.110
four races in another really exciting race.

253
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.760
I Dunno what happened.

254
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:51.040
They made the tires 30% bigger and all of a sudden there's more fucking grip.

255
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.460
But the downward force, all this shit that they talk about,

256
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.640
and before every frigging race, I dunno what happened,

257
00:14:55.641 --> 00:15:00.460
but all I know and Ferrari made better cars. Now all of a sudden it's a,

258
00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:04.330
at least you got two teams race and Ford is supposed to last year or was just a

259
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.340
Nico and uh, Lewis Hamilton. So anyways,

260
00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:14.110
congratulations. I hope I say, speaking of Finland, Ope, I say this guy's name,

261
00:15:14.111 --> 00:15:18.550
right? Mercedes-Benz, a tier two driver, the upstart,

262
00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:22.510
the Tom Cruise of days of thunder, right. Uh,

263
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.410
vault Valtteri bought us out by said that, right?

264
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:31.490
And he's like one of like nine finished drivers to ever win a Formula One race

265
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.400
in congratulations to him. Joe of great race. Uh, Sebastian Vettel from Ferrari,

266
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.540
second place, Kimi row.

267
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.990
Raycon in broken in Sydney is raking in Kimmy. So Ci, Kimmy,

268
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.820
Kimchi, Kimmy Reagan in for Ferrari came in third,

269
00:15:47.821 --> 00:15:50.580
and then Lewis Hamilton came in fourth. And I can tell you right now,

270
00:15:50.581 --> 00:15:53.040
he wasn't happy. You know, he wasn't happy.

271
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.980
That guy doesn't give a fuck if his car doesn't work. He doesn't get,

272
00:15:55.981 --> 00:15:58.290
he'll fucking run his own teammate off the fucking track.

273
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.270
That's what I, a little I know about that race.

274
00:16:03.271 --> 00:16:06.240
All I know is if he's not winning and his teammate can win,

275
00:16:06.241 --> 00:16:09.800
he doesn't give a fuck. He's not getting out of the way. You know, he,

276
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.670
he just doesn't give a shit. Um, but then he also wins.

277
00:16:14.671 --> 00:16:18.270
So whatever. Uh, so I guess that puts a,

278
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.770
the fuck's his name. I always fucking up Sebastian Vettel is in first place.

279
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.500
He's got, I think he's got two wins in two second places. So you get 25,

280
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.880
25, 18 and 18. So that's 50 and 36. You got 86 points

281
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.480
and I think, uh, you know, I'm in the garage, dude.

282
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:39.950
I don't have the fucking internet as far as I remember.

283
00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:43.550
I think Lewis Hamilton has one victory two second places in a fourth.

284
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.340
So that's 25, 18 and 18 and Jesus Christ, what's that?

285
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:54.341
61 36 and 25 set 61 I'm going to say it's 61 and he's got a fourth place where

286
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:00.850
he give her fourth place, like 15. I don't know. He's got like,

287
00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:03.490
I don't know if we'll say 76 or some shit. I don't fucking know.

288
00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:06.970
All I know is it's shaping up to be a great year and for whatever reason,

289
00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:10.480
even though I have German blood in me and no Italian blood,

290
00:17:10.481 --> 00:17:12.090
I actually am rooting for the Ferrari.

291
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.550
It's just because last year was it got boring. Mercedes won every fucking race.

292
00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:20.490
So it's good to see Ferrari back. Um, and by, by the way,

293
00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:22.380
shout out to force India.

294
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.910
I think they came in eighth and ninth of sixth and seventh.

295
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:30.260
My fault for having the balls, they have pink cars out there or Fuchsia,

296
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.180
whatever you want to call them. You know, they've been Mike, my, uh,

297
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.660
my other team, like I want to see one of them win a race this year.

298
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:41.330
I want to see a pink car when a fucking race.

299
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.680
It's just funny to me. Um, so anyways,

300
00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:51.510
I don't even know where the next race is. I would look it up usually, you know,

301
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:54.270
if I'm not fucking laying on the floor of my goddamn garage,

302
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:56.880
I would know where the next, uh, the next race was.

303
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:58.140
I know there's probably a lot of you going like bell,

304
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:00.840
why the fuck you getting into is first of all, it's a great fucking sport.

305
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:05.640
Second of all, it doesn't take a lot of time to watch. There was 52 laps.

306
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:11.340
It said, you can very easily add that, you know,

307
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.850
to whatever sports you watch. And I'm telling you even during the NBA,

308
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.330
in the NHL playoffs, cause I fucking watched everything. You know,

309
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.390
I want you to St Louis Blues Right this weekend.

310
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.860
Watch them winning over time. Getting to believe was game two.

311
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.740
I watched so much shit this weekend. I watched a the last two games,

312
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.460
Anaheim versus Edmonton. Um,

313
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.480
amazing to see Edmonton like all of a sudden looking like, wait a minute,

314
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:39.690
these guys are going to be the western conference champions,

315
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:42.150
the way they're applying and all of a sudden they get the old right there.

316
00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:44.790
Fred from the fucking ducks in Edmonton,

317
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.030
one of those weird series where they're three games in and the home team has yet

318
00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:52.680
to win. Let it children going home crying during that series so far,

319
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.330
and I'm, I hate to say this is a Bruin fair, but fucking Lou Cheech,

320
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.920
he looks right in that uniform and I get a feel and he's going to stay there for

321
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.330
awhile. I don't know what kind of contract he signed up there,

322
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.730
but, um, Jesus Christ, he's looking like the old Luke cheese,

323
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:13.140
just a fucking force in nature.

324
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.130
I remember when he would like fucking bring it over the Blue Line and he thought

325
00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:17.670
he had control of it, but he didn't.

326
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.760
And he'd sort of just be kicking it in and she wants somebody else's trying to

327
00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:23.310
like fucking stop them. You just give him a little fucking forearm.

328
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.360
The guy would fall down,

329
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.990
he'd pass it over version run and he'd score out and she's,

330
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:31.140
I missed those days anyways. And then watching that,

331
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:33.290
of course I watched the Celtics fucking

332
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.983
<v 2>since</v>

333
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.010
the old sports rivalry that most of the sports world does not realize is a

334
00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:43.920
fucking rivalry. These two teams hate each other.

335
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.020
But you know the deal, it's all about the fucking golden state warriors.

336
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.790
It's all about the Cleveland Cavaliers. And um,

337
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.950
so no one's really paying attention, right?

338
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.980
No one's paying attention to these two fucking people. They know. It'd be like,

339
00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:02.130
you know, you got the rolling stones and the Beatles and everybody's so,

340
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.770
oh my God, they're fucking amazing. And then meanwhile,

341
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.250
Herman in the hermits doesn't get along with the fucking partridge family.

342
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.450
I don't think were that bad.

343
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.290
<v 0>I'd like to think that we're not that bad. But, um,</v>

344
00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:14.890
<v 2>anyways, so the first game,</v>

345
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.040
like it give you a little bit of a background for a stupid reason.

346
00:20:18.041 --> 00:20:21.130
Earlier this season, the wizards were like,

347
00:20:21.131 --> 00:20:25.210
we're going to dress all in black when we play you guys codes. It's going to be,

348
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.090
it's going to be like a funeral. I was like, oh,

349
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.830
Gigi h is that what you're going to do? And then what are we going to do?

350
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.660
<v 0>Try, are you going to try extra?</v>

351
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.010
And that extra hard tonight fucking wizards. Right?

352
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.100
So even with that stupid little fashion statement that they made,

353
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.790
<v 2>they still beat us. So, but not because they wore black,</v>

354
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.290
they beat us because they scored more points. So anyways,

355
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:59.590
so we're getting ready to go see them. Uh, we're getting ready to play them.

356
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.483
And um,

357
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.180
my buddy Josh at a Mys from the Goddamn comedy gym and from the Comedy Jam,

358
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.250
they had to clean it up on a comedy central.

359
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.460
We decided that we're gonna go down to a cigar bar and we're going to watch the

360
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:16.450
fucking game together. He's a big wizards fan and uh, and he's a,

361
00:21:16.451 --> 00:21:20.620
she's a Shit Talker, right? Three's been talking shit, you know,

362
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.090
cause I think they won this. Uh,

363
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.340
I think we beat him like once and they beat us like three times.

364
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.370
I can't even remember. And he was talking all this shit.

365
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.770
And at one point they were ahead of us in like the rankings.

366
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:32.320
They were number two, we went up to three or something like that.

367
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.350
He was just talking all of this fucking shit.

368
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.600
So the game starts to Gar bar doesn't open till 11 game comes on at 10.

369
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.210
<v 0>So I'm sitting there watching the fucking first quarter.</v>

370
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.170
They go up two to nothing. It's five to nothing. Seven and nothing.

371
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.940
Nine to nothing. Fucking 1216 and nothing case. You missed the game.

372
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:55.930
You don't have fucking sports center or whatever. 16 to fucking nothing

373
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.070
to start the game. Annual. The game is, it's over.

374
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.690
If it's any sort of illegitimates I will, legitimate sport.

375
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.390
This game is over and I gotta be, I gotta be honest with you,

376
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.480
I will never like 100% be able to believe that that basketball is not fixed.

377
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.550
I don't understand it.

378
00:22:16.551 --> 00:22:21.260
I don't understand how one team can spot another team's 16 points.

379
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.940
You end the first quarter,

380
00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:27.941
one team's on pace to score 120 points or some shit and the other team's on pace

381
00:22:28.101 --> 00:22:31.670
to score 20, like 75 or some shit, right?

382
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.140
<v 2>Well, whatever, 80 points or something. And somehow it just, it's always,</v>

383
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:39.390
it's a gable runs.

384
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.620
Then out of nowhere they started like 16 to nothing.

385
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.860
And then we go on like a fucking 25 to eight run and somehow the scores tied or

386
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.650
we're up by like two with the half. I don't know. I went,

387
00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:56.260
I drove to pick him up and then we, you know, went over to the cigar bar.

388
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:59.800
So there's a lot of Chit chat going on. And um,

389
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.190
by the end of the third quarter, we were up by 50.

390
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.020
We were down 16 nothing, 36 minutes of basketball later,

391
00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:12.450
we're up by 15 a 31 point fucking turnaround.

392
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.060
Like, do you ever, when the bills came back against the Houston Oilers,

393
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.240
this basically that that happens just about every other game in the NBA.

394
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.240
I don't fucking get it. Oh, it's a game of runs. It's a game. Is it?

395
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.530
How does one team come out? Ice fucking cold. The other team can't miss.

396
00:23:33.531 --> 00:23:34.364
And then like,

397
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.590
<v 0>like I've never had a set where I go on stage and it's just like I'm on and then</v>

398
00:23:39.591 --> 00:23:43.100
all of a sudden I'm off and then I'm on again and then I'm off.

399
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.470
<v 2>That's what happens. Basketball.</v>

400
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:49.160
So we're up by 50 Josh is losing his fucking mind.

401
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.680
He's standing up, he's pacing,

402
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:54.560
which is hilarious because it's a garbart supposed to be like totally Chili's

403
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:56.240
fucking pacing back and forth.

404
00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:02.660
He's slamming down fucking slices of pizza, you know,

405
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.530
like doing like stress eating and I'm just laughing. I was just going like,

406
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:10.260
Josh, it's the fucking NBA. This game's going to be like,

407
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.550
now we're going to do the fourth quarter. And because the third quarter ended,

408
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.130
the switch gets shut off and the other one gets flipped on.

409
00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:17.960
And what this is going to be at fucking tie game.

410
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.440
So what happens fourth quarter starts,

411
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.700
the fucking Celtics can't score a bucket for like the first four minutes.

412
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.721
And next thing you know,

413
00:24:26.721 --> 00:24:30.650
like the wizards at down by three and is sitting down again.

414
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:31.550
And I'm just laughing. It's like,

415
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:33.500
how many fucking NBA Games do you have to watch?

416
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.240
Which you really do if you just want to,

417
00:24:37.241 --> 00:24:41.230
if you really get into the games and you feel like you're gonna fucking die a

418
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.080
thousand deaths, what you should really do is just watch the last two minutes.

419
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:49.150
God knows that takes as much time as the first fucking 46 minutes.

420
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.750
Just watched the last two minutes because it's going to be like a fucking three

421
00:24:52.751 --> 00:24:54.620
point game anyways. And um,

422
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.320
whatever the ebb and flow and then some other Celtics pulled away again. But,

423
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.270
um, I gotta tell you it's gonna be a fucking brutal series, brutal series.

424
00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:07.600
And I think a Jake Rado might get kicked out for one game.

425
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.940
This can be some sort of physical altercation.

426
00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:11.050
I don't know what's going to happen.

427
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.840
I've been looking into my fucking crystal ball. I don't know who it's gonna be,

428
00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.840
but somebody's going to get fucking kicked out of the game. Uh,

429
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.970
gets suspended for a game cause he's fucking teams hate each other. And uh,

430
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.820
you already started to see it happen a little bit in the first game. I just,

431
00:25:24.821 --> 00:25:26.650
they just don't like each other, but I gotta tell you some,

432
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:30.640
I actually love that John Wall guy. I love when, uh, uh,

433
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.710
Josh showed me this fucking, uh,

434
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.680
whatever the fucking Instagram picture or something like that.

435
00:25:35.681 --> 00:25:39.670
I guess a couple of years ago they lost to the, uh, Atlanta, um,

436
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.210
the fuck are they at the hawks? The Atlanta Hawks? Yeah.

437
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.540
Saint Louis Hawks to the Atlanta hawks. Right. They lose to them.

438
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.340
And one of the guys on Atlanta, you know,

439
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.100
they had a picture of them in the final seconds of winning.

440
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.610
<v 0>And John Wall has a real sad look on his face to do the posts if it's real</v>

441
00:25:58.611 --> 00:26:02.120
happy. And then there's another Lana Hawk looking at John Wall laughing at him

442
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.150
<v 2>and uh,</v>

443
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.340
<v 0>I guess John Wall didn't forget about this. So when they beat Atlanta,</v>

444
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.360
he posted a picture of him, you know,

445
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.890
doing a crossover in the gal posted the picture, fell on his fucking ass.

446
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.400
I love people that hold grudges like that. I think that to be great,

447
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:22.320
you have to be like that, which is why Eli Manning is such a fucking enigma.

448
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:27.520
<v 2>You know what I mean? I swear to God, like if you saw that guy in the most,</v>

449
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.270
<v 0>in the final two, two minute offense of a Superbowl, his heart rate, yeah.</v>

450
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.303
<v 2>Is the same.</v>

451
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.600
Is somebody at a fucking bake sale right outside of church.

452
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:38.463
You know what I mean?

453
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.520
<v 0>Oh, he, thanks for coming out. Oh look how big your kids are getting.</v>

454
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.890
That's his heart rate is,

455
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.410
<v 2>you know, I swear to God, they,</v>

456
00:26:46.411 --> 00:26:49.490
she just seen all those dockers he's always wearing with the fucking sweater

457
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.333
tucked into them.

458
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:54.630
They should just make a uniform just to completely psych out the other team.

459
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.970
If I was the giants side, he'd have like a special pair of football pants. They,

460
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.040
they'd be the same color as dockers. He'd still have the pads and shit in it,

461
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:04.620
but you know, some sort of dad jeans.

462
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.890
So anyways, I think the Celtics Wizards is going to go, uh,

463
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.420
I think that's going to go seven and I think it's going to be fucking brutal.

464
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.870
I think a, the wizards when the next one and then I think we split down in DC.

465
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.890
I think it's just going to go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth,

466
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.090
um, that, that evenly matched. And um, I don't know what I was,

467
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:29.940
forget the guys name, that fucking Polish Transylvanian dude,

468
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.780
the white dude with the shape tant whose entire body is his fucking heart as the

469
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:35.850
top of his goddamn head. I mean,

470
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:39.180
that guy looks like he could have played like fucking professionally,

471
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.160
could have played like at least three different sports.

472
00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:42.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

473
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.870
<v 2>[inaudible] fucking plates, some gigantic fucking tight end. You know,</v>

474
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.510
he's there. His body, he's like fucking white. Lebron. I know, I know.

475
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.160
Go on a limb there, but I'm telling you that guy, he's a fucking beast.

476
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.120
I was joking with Josh Cohen, his dad fucking grew up in eastern Europe.

477
00:27:59.121 --> 00:28:03.260
His Dad probably fucking beat him with one of those fireplace. Pokers all right,

478
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.710
we're all laughing. I was sitting there going like that. That can't be the name.

479
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.450
There's gotta be a different name for the four fire fire, police, poker.

480
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.050
I'm just saying what it does that can't be the name.

481
00:28:15.051 --> 00:28:17.360
And I looked it up and that's exactly what it's called.

482
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:18.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

483
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.490
<v 2>Fireplace poker. That's the best they could come up with.</v>

484
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.240
They couldn't come up with some widget name, you know,

485
00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.970
even with like the ladies, they got that thing they put in their hair.

486
00:28:27.971 --> 00:28:32.560
Somebody came up, what's it called? As called a Flowbee. Oh, what? Yeah.

487
00:28:32.561 --> 00:28:33.394
Flowbee

488
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.750
the fuck is a Flowbee at something you stick in your hair.

489
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.800
That makes it do a couple of woopty dues. I don't when I'm talking about,

490
00:28:41.801 --> 00:28:44.540
let me do, um, let me, uh,

491
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.470
let me read a little advertising here and then I'll talk about what a sad time

492
00:28:47.471 --> 00:28:51.160
it is to be a Washington DC fucking sports fan. Jesus Christ.

493
00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:53.500
All the fucking crying these Cleveland fans did.

494
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.680
Did you ever see a city cry as much as they did? Oh,

495
00:28:56.681 --> 00:28:59.170
we should fucking miserable. I mean,

496
00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:01.060
maybe they did that in Boston back when we were, weren't,

497
00:29:01.061 --> 00:29:03.490
weren't fucking winning, but I always hated that shit ever. A long time ago,

498
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.970
ESPN did this hope they wouldn't have some trial.

499
00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.930
Like who has the more miserable fucking sports fans?

500
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.650
Cubs fans are red sox fans. I remember sitting at home laughing going, dude,

501
00:29:14.651 --> 00:29:17.290
I don't want them. I don't want to win this. You want to be more,

502
00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:18.880
who fuck wants to be the most miserable?

503
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.223
<v 1>Um,</v>

504
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.310
<v 2>you know who those fuck the kind of person you'd want to run into when a goddamn</v>

505
00:29:25.311 --> 00:29:29.660
bar. You know, going to sit there and just talk about how life fucked him over.

506
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.040
Sorry. Anyways, let me read some of the, some of this advertising here.

507
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.630
Oh my God. It's that time.

508
00:29:35.631 --> 00:29:39.320
It's that time of year when you can say,

509
00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:42.220
I got to get something for mother

510
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.630
<v 0>pro flowers.</v>

511
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:47.780
Everybody talk about how being a mom is often, uh,

512
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.720
often a thankless job and mother's Day is a chance to show your appreciation.

513
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:58.300
Um, I think that's talked about enough, isn't it? It's always, you know,

514
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.620
I want to see if they have that copy for father's day that it's a fucking

515
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:05.540
thankless job. Let me tell you something right now. All right. Is,

516
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.560
is difficult a job is being a mother is you fucking babies are obsessed with

517
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:15.880
you. My daughter barely looks at me. She just looking at me, she smiles like,

518
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:19.540
Hey, there's that guy that I kind of know, but my wife walks in a room,

519
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:22.820
she just like, she just follows her all around. She says looking at her,

520
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:27.100
I'm like, Hey, hey other parent, other parent over here, Yo Yo.

521
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:28.530
You know what I mean? You know like when you're at the,

522
00:30:28.531 --> 00:30:32.170
at the game and they're thrown free tee shirts into the crowd, right?

523
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.780
And you're standing up and then there's a group of fucking hop.

524
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.450
They caught chicks and shit like, like you're getting a tee shirt.

525
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.620
Does it stop you though? You still stand up fucking flailing.

526
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:45.590
Your arms never happens. Um,

527
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.510
so evidently for some reason being a mom is a thankless job.

528
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.810
Even though everybody always talks about how important the job is.

529
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.800
There's not one presidential election that doesn't go by where they don't talk

530
00:30:56.801 --> 00:30:59.350
about it. Everybody's always saying, you know,

531
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.950
mothers are saints and all of this type of shit. You know,

532
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.590
what do they say about their, they, they say nothing.

533
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.330
It's like put both on the same record label, but only their album gets hyped.

534
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.420
You know, when our fucking do, nothing manager's going like, yeah,

535
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:15.820
you promised us at least one billboard

536
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.710
east of fucking vine. You know, you can't even give us that. Um,

537
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.250
but evidently I have to do it again. Oh Jesus. You know,

538
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.550
you just can't fucking thank these divas enough.

539
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.030
These mothers out there.

540
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.380
Is there anything worse than we listen to a woman say she lost herself in the

541
00:31:37.381 --> 00:31:39.690
relationship. You know, and then you find that, you know,

542
00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:43.570
it's one thing if you just, you know, if you don't have kids,

543
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:46.630
but if a woman says that and they have kids right there,

544
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:49.810
you know what a terrible mother, she deserves no flowers.

545
00:31:49.811 --> 00:31:51.760
But the rest of you ladies listen to this.

546
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:56.860
When you send the 100 blooms for mom boke, bouquet, bouquet,

547
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.340
whatever from pro flowers, this mother's Day,

548
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.090
you will make a real impression. Oh yeah. Now your mother's going to love you.

549
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:07.570
Look, Susan, how they work in the sibling rivalry into this. He's fucking,

550
00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:09.790
people have no shame over their pro flowers.

551
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:15.030
It comes with a free glass vase for just 1999 piece of shit plus shipping and

552
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:19.420
handling. And if you really want to make a statement,

553
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.600
you can upgrade a premium to a premium vase and include gourmet chocolates for

554
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:29.350
just $10 more gourmet chocolates for 10 bucks. Okay?

555
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.030
Uh, choose to deliver. You want to buy this f one car for fucking $11?

556
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.430
Is this the wheel of fortune?

557
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:40.220
Back in the day for $26 I'll take the brass bed frayed.

558
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.390
I'll take the cuckoo clock for 18 I'll put the restaurant a gift certificate.

559
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.030
You know what a year supply of Trident Gum.

562
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.830

they act like this is the one thing you need to get your mom. It isn't.

569
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.540
This is like at least the thing you got to get few months.

570
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:31.730
This is a great [inaudible] to something else. Um, I do it every single year.

571
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.420
It's nice and fucking easy. And you know what? Your mother loves flowers.

572
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.650
You know why? Cause moms are dreamers. They believe.

573
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.560
They believe that their husband's not gonna come home hammered.

574
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.670
<v 2>This is the time Angela's ashes. He's not going right to the pub.</v>

575

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:53.420
eye infection is. You guys ever read that book? Angela? Disastrous.

577
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.150
Jesus Christ. You know,

578
00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.990
you thought Charlie Brown had a bad trying to kick the football.

579
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.740
Fucking poor bastards waiting for their dad to come home with the money.

580
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.110
Never came home. Went to the ghost. You know,

581
00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:10.010
spoiler alert goes to the pub every fucking time.

586
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.470

<v 2>Mother's Day is coming up and Sherry's berries.</v>

588
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.290
Was that like some politically correct thing?

589
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:37.480
<v 0>Like talk about your mom. Well,</v>

590
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.710

598
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:13.050
and that was not one of them. I don't even know what they look like.

599
00:35:13.051 --> 00:35:17.430
I don't even understand why they taste so good. We'll go fuck figured that out.

Sherry's berries are an unexpected gift that will put a smile on mom's face.

608
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:47.670
Holy Shit. Did you drop 20 bucks on me? That was unexpected surprise.

You've perfected your wardrobe, but what about this stuff?

645
00:38:05.541 --> 00:38:09.770
Not everybody gets to see if you've been settling for store bought underwear,

646
00:38:09.771 --> 00:38:12.200
five packs. If you've been settling for,

647
00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:15.530
go to those prepackaged priests sound together. Fucking underwears.

648
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.670

Velvety fucking underwear. Badu do to me and these Mandy's,

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.370
take your balls out and everyone stares. Look at this as a 10 year anniversary.

652
00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.030
You're getting two songs. Rob Nuts up against the modal.

653
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.710
Grabbed your dog by the fucking throat.

654
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.640
I'll throw it outside because it took us shit right next to your underwear

655
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:50.070
drawer and then go to jail for animal cruelty. Narrate me.

656
00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:55.120
UNDIES are designed in La, La, Louisiana. Los Angeles,

657
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:58.270
who knows and made from sustainably sourced micro modal,

658
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.660
bought out of fabric three times softer than cotton.

659
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.750
Beyond the softer than soft luxury.

660
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:09.370
Unders come in and ever changing selection of classic colors,

661
00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:14.371
bold shades and adventurous patterns so you can tailor your Andries to your own

662
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:19.210
personal style. I think this is why Richard Simmons actually disappeared once.

663
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:20.920
He could start ordering fucking velvety,

664
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:24.490
soft different underwear every fucking day. You know what I mean?

665
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.341
He probably is like, well,

666
00:39:26.341 --> 00:39:29.170
I can't wear these Kandy stripe fucking shorts anymore. And that's my look.

667
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:31.930
You know what? I've made enough fucking money. I'm out. All right,

668
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.640
and guess what? You can save time and money there.

669
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.560
Frog in my throat all of a sudden. And guess what?

670
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:41.680
You could say time and money each month with a monthly subscription.

671
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.040
And if you're not ready for scription but then go fuck yourself.

672
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.700
Stay with your regular goddamn underwear, you piece of shit. No, I'm sorry.

673
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.670
That's, that's not the copy. If the, I'm sorry, if you're not ready,

674
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:55.750

hometown and for some reason thinks that their success because they didn't.

715

You know you don't, it makes you a success not leaving your hometown.

716
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.790
It's how you treat people and you know something that's wanting to grow on.

717
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.210
All right. Before I get into the questions here, let's talk about, uh,

718
00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.560
the Washington sad sack. Washington DC sports fan. You know what I mean?

719
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.160
After all this fucking shit about cubs fans, red sox fans,

720
00:42:38.161 --> 00:42:43.140
fans of Cleveland Sports. Meanwhile look at fucking Washington DC.

721

Oh, they have nothing national thing when it's shit.

722
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.920
The Redskins have been a fucking joke,

723
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.670
a fucking joke for 25 fucking years. I know what you think. We'll build.

724
00:42:55.671 --> 00:42:59.090
They went three fucking super bowls and the previous basically 10, 11 years.

725
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:02.690
Yeah, but she knows something. They got some racist logo on the side.

726
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:05.540
There was always something to take it away. You know what I mean?

727
00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:07.131
Where this thing ever,

728
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:10.460
they had some black guy dressed up on the fucking native American head dress,

729
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.850
maybe had some Indian blood in him. I have no idea. Native American blood,

730
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.170
whatever the fuck you supposed to say.

731
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.700
You know the capital's how many times they go on the president's trophy get

732
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:21.320
bounced out in the second round. They've won the,

733
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.260
they won the president's trophy three times since 2009.

734
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.570
And every time they'd lost in the second round.

735
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.370
And they've dropped the first two fucking games and I was watching the end of

736
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:34.820
this series at home against the Pittsburgh Penguins,

737
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.830
the reptilian ice water in their veins. Pittsburgh Penguins,

738
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:42.590
who I'm telling you right now going on and they're going to win this second

739
00:43:42.591 --> 00:43:45.890
Stanley Cup in a row. You heard it here. You heard it.

740
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:50.550
Now you play it later and you will agree with me or you don't have a combat

741
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.720
fucking podcast again. No, no. I think they're just going to repeat.

742
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.340
That's what it is. They're all dialed in. They got filled castle.

743
00:43:58.341 --> 00:44:02.840
They got Crosby, they get the fucking, they got a fucking mocker,

744
00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.440
Andre Flower, whatever his fucking name is Theo fucking flurry.

745
00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:08.570
Whatever the goaltender's name is, he doesn't give a shit.

746
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:12.440
He's out there fucking doing the old fucking jazz hands stop and everything.

747
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:15.590
That's common, right? Mark Andre Flurry,

748
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.880
they got Gido. I mean it's they this, they're just going to overpower you.

749
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.910
It's it or

750
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.860
does Washington DC with their capitalist.

751
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:32.861
They rise up from the ashes in somehow figure out a fucking way to win game

752
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:36.390
three. I was watching the NHL network. This guy was going off going,

753
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:41.070
this is the biggest fucking game in Washington capital's history.

754
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:46.350
And I agree they got to do this, they got to this. And if they don't do this,

755
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.840
they're gonna blow up the whole fucking team. It's going to be sad.

756
00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:52.910
They have to start all over again. Jesus Christ.

757
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:56.810
How do you not root for the capital's and game three? You got to do it.

758
00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.710
I'm going to be rooting for them to Sidney Crosby.

759
00:45:00.711 --> 00:45:02.900
I tell I've been saying this for your Sydney prize. We use backhand.

760
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:05.960
It has more fucking velocity than most guys. Foreheads.

761
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.200
Most guys riskers in the league. It's fucking insane.

762
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.760
Thank God you know something. God bless his mother for raising him, right?

763
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.530
Cause I'll tell you right now with his backhand,

764
00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.710
thank God he knows how to treat a woman. Cause if he didn't Jesus Christ,

765
00:45:18.711 --> 00:45:21.710
he would make OJ look like a fucking cub scout. All right,

766
00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:25.880
so game three is coming up. Definitely check that out.

767
00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.010
And a, and with that,

768
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.810
here's some of the people's favorite Monday morning podcasts, moments,

769
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.960
MMP moments. That's what Andrew wrote. Oh,

770
00:45:35.961 --> 00:45:39.800
we should have like the little big eyed smiling kids here. Um,

771
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.570
douchebag of the week, Brad, remember that? Um,

772
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.310
don't care enough to find the link.

773
00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:50.750
But when Nia gave white people credit for creating the jug instrument,

774
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:55.100
it was incredible. Uh, that was funny.

775
00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:00.220
Oh then the classic member Granny fucking water at poor best,

776
00:46:00.741 --> 00:46:04.070
it's probably still getting weird looks for those who don't know what granny

777
00:46:04.071 --> 00:46:06.470
water was, this guy was playing some fucking game.

778
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.010
It's kind of seemed like it was old maid but a you didn't want it.

779
00:46:10.011 --> 00:46:13.460
Like if you played the granny water card, you fucked everybody else in the game.

780
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.780
So it came as time to play it and he's with his girlfriend and they're playing

781
00:46:17.781 --> 00:46:19.730
with the parents and out of nowhere,

782
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.580
for whatever reason he decides to give him the Monday morning podcast and throw

783
00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:28.050
in the f word. And when he played the car, he just went granny flood in war

784
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.710
and there was just dead silence. And then he tried,

785
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.830
tried to have to sit there and explain it to everybody.

786
00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.400
The it's grantee fucking water listener story from last year.

787
00:46:40.401 --> 00:46:43.340
I think another one, grainy fucking water.

788
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:47.510
The infamous Rosebowl story had me in stitches at work. That was the time when,

789
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.870
uh, we got to put together a greatest hits.

790
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.270
We really got to do that.

791
00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:58.100
That was the first rose bowl that we went to when we stumbled in there.

792
00:46:58.101 --> 00:47:00.980
And I fucking lost my balance.

793
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.320
And there was an old woman in front of me and I had to like,

794
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.810
and my forum was in her back and she was kind of leaning forward and I was just

795
00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.490
sitting here going, I'm sorry.

796
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.910
And no one helped me up cause he was so horrified by the condition I was in.

797
00:47:13.911 --> 00:47:18.770
The only way for me to get up was I had to push off of her, folded her in half.

798
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.380
Oh God. I'd always get this weird feeling in my stomach whenever I don't have,

799
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:28.070
I, I hate that I did that, but I, I did, I apologize.

800
00:47:28.071 --> 00:47:30.100
Whoever's grandmother that was, but I made whatever. She's

801
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.710
<v 2>a little more flexible, you know, enjoy the last, you know,</v>

802
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.120
third of her life maybe. Um,

803
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:40.030
another person rose bowl story with Joe Barnick and the old lady who kept

804
00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:43.660
getting angry and calling her husband to threaten you, mark. No,

805
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:48.020
she wasn't an old lady. She was younger and that was the time she made fun of,

806
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:51.910
she made fun of Joe Barton x knows Janie had a big nose and he just looked to

807
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:55.030
her and said, you need to lose about 30 pounds before you talk to me bitch.

808
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:58.030
And I was just like, Oh God, all right, we're getting kicked out.

809
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.700
And then she said, she's like, mark, did you hear what he said? Right.

810
00:48:03.701 --> 00:48:06.650
So the guy turns around to square off with Barnick Barton.

811
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.330
He just looks at him and use his big as a fucking Pittsburgh linebacker.

812
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.690
So the guy takes one look at Bart Nick and then starts fucking yelling at me and

813
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.410
started threatening to throw me down in the field. Yeah, you fucking pussy.

814
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.490
Yeah, you go right past bar nick and you go to old fucking balls. Care Top.

815
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.820
All right. I'm a new listener. Eisa his, his favorite moment.

816
00:48:24.821 --> 00:48:29.821
You asking Nia how she's so loud wearing slippers and she's saying that's why

817
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:34.960
she's angry with you. That's love. And you go, I'm all right. Another one,

818
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:38.200
you answered a question about a parrot like three years ago that it had me

819
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:41.620
crying, laughing at my job. I got in trouble. I'll try to find it.

820
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:46.660
I love how vague these are. This is just as vague. Um, oh, this person like the,

821
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:51.620
for me, I just feel the Kardashians. They,

822
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.180
the Kardashians could literally watch a baby starve to death and then then they

823
00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:59.170
would be crying, you know, fanning their fucking eyeliner so it doesn't,

824
00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:01.240
you know, smear going. Like for me,

825
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:05.100
I just felt so sad because for me, um,

826
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.550
it has to be that or the Colby 11. Oh God,

827
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.080
Kelly Olynyk in those fucking Colby eleven's was the worst thing I ever saw.

828
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:19.360
A when you said Corey Felman was the Lee Harvey Oswald of the robot.

829
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:23.580
Oh, I had to pull over. I was laughing so hard. I didn't even,

830
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.700
it doesn't even make sense to me anymore. Um, anyways,

831
00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:31.990
let's see. Don't blow it. Keep it simple. Count your money.

832
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.790
I don't even know what that is. Uh, when you did the ad for draft kings,

833
00:49:36.791 --> 00:49:38.560
one guy won $1,000.

834
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:43.030
One guy's given hand jobs for rent money or something like that. Oh yeah,

835
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:46.390
that's right. I called that thing out for fucking being legalized gambling.

836
00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:53.520
Um, what else? TCU. Come on. Frogs,

837
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.510
dude. I called it barefoot bitches. There's too many to remember.

838
00:49:58.511 --> 00:50:00.520
I'm still working my way through the older ones. I,

839
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.160
this isn't really making me feel good that you guys remember all this shit.

840
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:04.331
All right. Here's another one.

841
00:50:04.331 --> 00:50:08.260
One of the best moments was when you told the story of going to the basketball

842
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:12.490
game and they kept playing that everybody clap your hands.

843
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:16.900
That's right. And it was all that crazy shit going on. Al. Everybody loves this.

844
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:18.160
Read old zip

845
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:26.560
a nature's box. Yeah, I fucked that one up.

846
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.160
I called it,

847
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.840
it was nature box was the name of it and I thought it was like possessive

848
00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:37.730
nature's box. And I was like, you going down on Mother Nature? Needless to say,

849
00:50:37.731 --> 00:50:41.180
that was one and done read and are full refund.

850
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.710
Um, at some point we should put,

851
00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:50.120
I want to put together all the fucking one and done reads that I've had, um,

852
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:55.540
under the clip. Didn't make a dime off those counts. All right. Um, oh,

853
00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.110
the Monday morning podcasts. Nia,

854
00:50:57.111 --> 00:51:01.300
did you money or did you hear about Paula Abdul? She was like, what?

855
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:05.930
I was like, she's a former backup dancer for the Lakers and now a big pop star.

856
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.560
She thought she'd died. I did it better the first time. Anyways. Uh,

857
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:15.170
when you told Nia about not checking out, funniest thing ever.

858
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.400
Oh yeah. When I don't check out at hotels, um, I just walk out. I'm done.

859
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.320
Done with you fucking people. Uh,

860
00:51:21.321 --> 00:51:24.710
when you compare it Harry Truman to the guy from Shawshank.

861
00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.360
Am I being up two or your last draftkings read. All right.

862
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.140
The Charlie Murphy one. No. Yeah. Yeah. That was a,

863
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:39.530
that was a sad one. But a happy, the happy memories. Uh, the Yoko Ono rant,

864
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:44.300
strawberry pubes. That's from the a, the Joe Rogan on it. Read.

865
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.240
Uh, anytime you talk about cool cars,

866
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:51.800
anytime you lean away from the Mike and yell like a, we're all human.

867
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:56.510
Some of us are good. Most of us are cons. Oh, the big tears. Big Tears.

868
00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:02.100
When Nia cried in, um, where were we? Italy. I didn't know how to comfort her.

869
00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.280
I just kept going. I was hugging her and she was crying.

870
00:52:04.281 --> 00:52:07.160
She had like the biggest tears coming out of her eyes,

871
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.180
like just fallen on my hands, like rain dropped. I was like her from behind,

872
00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:13.100
you know, she, she hit her head.

873
00:52:13.101 --> 00:52:16.040
That's why she bent down to pick something up and it was a shelf and she hit her

874
00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:18.920
head so fucking hard. My, my, even my eyes like,

875
00:52:18.921 --> 00:52:21.840
just watered like holy shit and I didn't know how to comfort it.

876
00:52:21.841 --> 00:52:25.700
So she was crying. I just, I just started reporting. But what was going on,

877
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:28.820
I was just going, ah, was just going big tears. Tears.

878
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.690
Uh, all right. As a stoner, I find your anti weed rants hilarious.

879
00:52:35.691 --> 00:52:40.670
I get so mad that I start hyperventilating. A, the lovely Nia. Everybody.

880
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:45.210
Eds, n not m, it's not me. It's near like Nancy, uh,

881
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:49.010
Nia story about hitting her head in her big tears, big tears. All right.

882
00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:51.980
We said that one. Okay. Uh,

883
00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.650
you said Rick Flare wouldn't have come up that fast.

884
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.240
I don't even know what that is. Colby.

885
00:52:56.241 --> 00:52:58.400
Eleven's why are you going to Indianapolis,

886
00:52:58.401 --> 00:53:03.140
Bill all that fucking freak from the plane. Um,

887
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.271
let me see. Friends,

888
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:10.271
trying to get the rat out of your new house story is an all time favorite.

889
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:13.520
Anytime there's a zip. Oh yeah. When we were renting that house,

890
00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:16.970
when I got the fucking kitchen redone, um,

891
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.750
another fucking zillion dollars I put in this house and never going to get back.

892
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:21.120
Uh,

893
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.680
the one time you were talking about those two guys eating shit while riding this

894
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.450
<v 0>and motorcycle,</v>

895
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.930
the skateboard crashing is the funniest story you've ever told that needs to be

896
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:33.780
an ana. Oh my God. They, we should animate that. Yes.

897
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:38.781
So right at time I saw that fucking guy in Griffith park coming down and he

898
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:42.900
wasn't dressed like a skateboarder and it was like seven 30 in the morning.

899
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:47.610
You know, when I was walking my old dog Cleo, Oh, I missed that dog.

900
00:53:47.611 --> 00:53:50.790
I'm going to see her again next month. I just view with like,

901
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:52.880
she's in college and I still always got to visit her. I'm, look,

902
00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:55.230
I love that dog and I'm fucking going to be there someday.

903
00:53:55.530 --> 00:54:00.300
When she takes her final breaths, I'm going to fucking be there. Um, anyways.

904
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:00.551
Yeah.

905
00:54:00.551 --> 00:54:05.040
So I was walking my dog and this fucking guy came by like the biggest hill in

906
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:08.790
Griffith park and he was just dressed in street clothes and it started wobbling.

907
00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.370
Oh my God. A new fucking reference here.

908
00:54:11.371 --> 00:54:16.371
Like in a MotoGP the tank slap when it starts fucking oscillate and you know,

909
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.530
and all of a sudden they, they can't get it to stop.

910
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.530
He started doing that shit and just like, I don't know,

911
00:54:22.531 --> 00:54:25.530
I'll try and find the clip because I was more vivid when I just saw it.

912
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:28.630
It was one of the fucking most insane wipeouts.

913
00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:33.090
It easily could have taken over the agony of defeat, um,

914
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.740
in wide world of sports. Um, anyways. Um,

915
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:41.700
what else? How many six year olds could you kill before they took you down?

916
00:54:41.701 --> 00:54:43.740
You know, I was actually thinking about animating that recently,

917
00:54:43.741 --> 00:54:46.770
but after all the fucking psycho horrible shit that's happened in the world

918
00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:49.740
since I did that used to be funny, you know?

919
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.590
And that's the world we're living in. It's not funny anymore to me.

920
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:57.390
All right Doug Flutie heckling story about a friend who takes things too far,

921
00:54:57.391 --> 00:55:01.770
may be cry laughing at the gym. No idea which episode that was. Oh yeah,

922
00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.260
that was a buddy of mine who didn't know how to talk shit.

923
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.140
I'll tell you that one quickly.

924
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:11.160
Doug Flutie came back playing for the bills and we're sitting in the end zone

925
00:55:11.161 --> 00:55:16.140
seats and I'm, everybody's like, heckling Doug.

926
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.640
Flutie gone a kill the midget eight. Doug, you're too small, blah blah, blah,

927
00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:23.730
blah, blah. And my buddy wanted to get in and all this shit talk and Ah,

928
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:25.440
you know, go back to the CFL.

929
00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:30.690
Everybody's just trash and him and my buddy doesn't know where the line is.

930
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.040
And he also studiers starters and out of nowhere he just goes, hey, hey, hey,

931
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.380
hey Flutie.

932
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.600
I hope your kid dies in everybody in the end zone who was hammered immediately

933
00:55:41.851 --> 00:55:46.440
sobered up just from like ugh. And everybody just sat just like, dude,

934
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:50.580
what the fuck? Fucking brutal.

935
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.753
All right.

936
00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:54.840
Which also used to kind of be amusing to me until now I have a kid now I'm just

937
00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:58.170
kind of like, yeah, that really wasn't really funny that I Jason Marks,

938
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:03.540
I don't know what that one is. Draftkings final read. And lastly,

939
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:06.210
but not leastly don't wear diff. No nowhere to find the link.

940
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:09.120
But the one that introduced the great Pohlad add,

941
00:56:09.121 --> 00:56:12.930
Paul Versey where you guys debated time travel. Oh, that was a good one.

942
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.230
That was a good one, man. Alright, let me read,

943
00:56:16.231 --> 00:56:18.280
I got time here to read a couple of, ah,

944
00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.440
a couple of questions here for the week. All right. Military, Virgin,

945
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.900
uh, dear bill of the boar. B U. O. R. E.

946
00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:31.360
I don't know what that means unless you podcasts all the time.

947
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:35.230
I also from time to time, uh, appreciate your standup comedy.

948
00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:41.070
Okay. Oh, that was a nice back here to compliment.

949
00:56:41.071 --> 00:56:42.930
I listened to your podcast all the time.

950
00:56:42.931 --> 00:56:46.790
And also from time to time appreciate your standup comedy. You know,

951
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:48.990
it's all right from time to time he makes me smile.

952
00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:53.550
I am from New Hampshire and your video tour of Hampton beach was right on the

953
00:56:53.551 --> 00:56:57.510
money. I am writing to you about my best buddy in the military.

954
00:56:57.511 --> 00:57:01.830
We are both in the service as we became friends. He confessed,

955
00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:06.360
he confessed that he's a virgin at the age of 32 over the past two years since

956
00:57:06.361 --> 00:57:11.361
I've known the guy who refers to play video games and eat dunkaroos than going

957
00:57:12.101 --> 00:57:16.450
out in public tonka ruse. What the fuck are those? Um,

958
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:20.560
he's an exceptionally funny kid and has no problem making good impression on

959
00:57:20.561 --> 00:57:22.210
strangers or even a lady.

960
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:25.840
He just cannot reach women in a sexual way right now.

961
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.810
He stationed in Europe in good shape, has a Badass job,

962
00:57:28.811 --> 00:57:31.300
speaks French and is generally charismatic guy.

963
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:36.520
He has every reason to be doubt drowning and ladies and can even use the foreign

964
00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:38.800
card. But as I check in with them,

965
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:43.060
he still hasn't gotten out from behind the 60 inch plasma TV.

966
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:46.240
I don't know what his problem is because he would always be bitching about

967
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:49.900
wanting a girlfriend and think he may be whacking it too much. Uh,

968
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:51.520
the new echo epidemic.

969
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.210
And another tidbit is that he will turn to heavy drinking,

970
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:58.180
which actually helps to open him up.

971
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.740
I can tell he's not satisfied being sig single and using alcohol,

972
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.230
but will not take the initiative to break the cycle.

973
00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:09.940
I'm pissed because he's not using the golden opportunity to slay over there and

974
00:58:09.941 --> 00:58:14.230
he's just disrespecting and it's just disrespectful to the rest of us.

975
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:17.740
That's fucking hilarious. Um, yeah man, he seems,

976
00:58:17.741 --> 00:58:20.830
I would say that he should probably go to therapy and work out whatever is his

977
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:22.320
hang up is because um,

978
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:27.280
there could be a lot of shit that he's sitting on and um,

979
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.000
yeah, that's sad. I feel bad for that guy. You know what I mean?

980
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:34.390
Would be one thing. Like some people are just naturally like loners and asexual,

981
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.650
whatever and they don't want to be out there, but whatever his deal is,

982
00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.690
you know, be a sad thing.

983
00:58:39.691 --> 00:58:42.120
If somebody wanted to find love and they couldn't find love,

984
00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:44.340
that guy should be crushing it.

985
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:49.080
If he could speak French and he can speak English like that. France,

986
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:51.360
that's your whole fucking world over there.

987
00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:54.710
Even if you went to England and they don't give a fuck that you can speak

988
00:58:54.711 --> 00:58:57.950
English cause so today, but if you go, so bust out some French, Bam.

989
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:03.950
You crushed the that. Yes. And he's a man in uniform. Dude, this guy,

990
00:59:03.951 --> 00:59:07.220
he's like fucking like three different porno fantasies for women.

991
00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.480
Um, he's got a, what is he going to do next?

992
00:59:10.481 --> 00:59:15.250
Start clean and poles delivering pizzas. Yeah. There's no reason for it.

993
00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:19.270
I would tell you buddy, that he should go talk to somebody, um, about it.

994
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:22.040
But it's kind of difficult if he's drowning himself in

995
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:26.780
<v 2>booze and dot's a delicate thing and it's very difficult to get somebody to go</v>

996
00:59:26.781 --> 00:59:29.510
get help and B, they have to want to do it themselves. So, um,

997
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:30.300
<v 1>okay.</v>

998
00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.630
<v 2>But you're a good Fred back cause you actually give a shit. All right.</v>

999
00:59:33.631 --> 00:59:35.490
Conspiracy theory. Sorry, I'm rushing through this.

1000
00:59:35.491 --> 00:59:38.260
I'm coming up on an hour in these fucking gas line.

1001
00:59:38.261 --> 00:59:42.390
People are going to be showing up soon. Conspiracy theory. A bill.

1002
00:59:42.391 --> 00:59:44.250
What do you think of the flat earthers?

1003
00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.960
It's a growing movement of people who think we're being lied to about the shape

1004
00:59:48.961 --> 00:59:49.794
of the earth.

1005
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:54.600
Do you think this is something you would have bought into in your earlier more

1006
00:59:54.601 --> 00:59:57.450
intense conspiracy days? No, I wouldn't.

1007
00:59:57.451 --> 01:00:02.430
You fucking cunt all you guys. This is what I hate about conspiracy theory.

1008
01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:07.010
Conspiracy theory is, is everybody gets lumped into the,

1009
01:00:07.011 --> 01:00:10.400
people think the moon is made out of cheese and that there's shapeshifters and

1010
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:11.960
lizard people. Okay.

1011
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.670
All I was saying is that the fucking Federal Reserve is a privately owned

1012
01:00:16.671 --> 01:00:20.030
corporation, which is a fucking fact.

1013
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.180
Okay. I'll say things like,

1014
01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:26.780
I don't think that the government or the corporations give a shit about the

1015
01:00:26.781 --> 01:00:30.050
people in Iraq because I saw the way they treated the people in New Orleans.

1016
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:31.400
They don't give a fuck about them.

1017
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:35.150
They don't give a shit about those people over there. Okay. So I don't buy that.

1018
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:40.040
That's, that's the level that I go to. Alright. I don't take it to this.

1019
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:43.550
This is what I would say to those fucking flat earth people. Okay, okay.

1020
01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:46.550
Let's just say the earth is flat, then.

1021
01:00:46.551 --> 01:00:49.880
Wouldn't all the ocean waters just run off the end of it?

1022
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.390
Why isn't that happening? How do you explain that?

1023
01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.080
I would love to talk to a flat earth person. You don't want to be like, well,

1024
01:00:57.081 --> 01:01:01.520
why don't you guys do a startup and get yourself a little fucking rocket?

1025
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.660
Go up in the fucking air. It's like, have you ever fucking flown in a jet?

1026
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:08.220
You Jackass. You can look out the window and Oh,

1027
01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:09.980
you'd see the roundness of the earth.

1028
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:13.543
<v 1>Um,</v>

1029
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:17.030
<v 2>I dunno, but you know what? I want to fucking watch videos of it.</v>

1030
01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:21.140
I want to hear what they think flat earthers are actually more ridiculous than

1031
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:22.910
people trying to explain.

1032
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.410
Believe in like a a creationism or whatever. I believe in Adam and eve,

1033
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:28.850
you know,

1034
01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:32.810
Adam and Eve to white people that somehow created Asians and black people and

1035
01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:34.850
all that type of shit. I don't fucking get all that. Well actually,

1036
01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:38.170
you know something. Yeah, I don't, you know what? I think I actually believe,

1037
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.900
believe what that type of shit. I actually think that, uh,

1038
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:44.660
I watched one of those Neil degrasse Tyson things and he said, you know,

1039
01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:48.080
we actually came out of trees and I was just like, you know,

1040
01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:51.170
what is fucked up is that is at least I can look at a tree and be like,

1041
01:01:51.171 --> 01:01:55.130
there it is. That is a tree. Get Walk over, I can touch it,

1042
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.350
I can climb on it. Um, it actually made more sense to me than um,

1043
01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.713
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1044
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:06.330
<v 2>Then Adam and eve, I mean it's just, I don't know, maybe if you put like Adam,</v>

1045
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.040
if Adam and eve was a movie and then the tooth fairy was a movie,

1046
01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:11.920
I mean I'd put them in the exact same category and I don't think that that's

1047
01:02:11.921 --> 01:02:14.240
right. All right. Conspiracy theory. Oh, I every right.

1048
01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.380
I already read that one in India. Taking cash out of circulation. Oh,

1049
01:02:17.381 --> 01:02:18.250
Jesus Christ.

1050
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.280
Bill just read an article about India and it freaked me out a little bit.

1051
01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:27.780
Last November, India removed 86% of the country's cash from circulation.

1052
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:30.840
Most people are now using mobile payment options.

1053
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:35.310
And the artists. See, I don't know what that means.

1054
01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:39.240
Also goes on to say the article, sorry.

1055
01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:43.830
You got the laptop on the floor that there was ATR c I the article also goes on

1056
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:48.831
to say that ATM machines and Bank cars would be obsolete as early as 2020 in

1057
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:50.190
India.

1058
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:53.880
Not having physical money and only using a phone for buying stuff really makes

1059
01:02:53.881 --> 01:02:55.470
me uncomfortable. Any thoughts yet?

1060
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:59.510
They're on their way to microchipping all of us and once again everybody's going

1061
01:02:59.511 --> 01:03:01.320
to think that's fucking crazy and you'd go on the Internet.

1062
01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:04.080
You look at shitheads who work for corporations that are like proud of their

1063
01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:07.890
fucking microchip in their level of security clearance that they have. No,

1064
01:03:07.891 --> 01:03:10.320
they're going to phase out fucking everything.

1065
01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.240
There's going to be cameras everywhere.

1066
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.580
You're going to be fucking microchipped and this is the thing.

1067
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:19.050
It's still not going to be enough control for them.

1068
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.720
They still won't feel comfortable that they had.

1069
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.770
That's how bad their fucking you over that.

1070
01:03:22.771 --> 01:03:25.620
They need to have that level of fucking surveillance on you.

1071
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.640
That's how fucking weird they are. And they want to see what you talk about,

1072
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:33.480
what you jerk off to and all this shit that if it's fucking beyond creepy.

1073
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:38.060
And I hate when something like that gets brought up on like the fucking news and

1074
01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:41.910
all in the best the news anchor could do is kind of widen their eyes like okay,

1075
01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:45.330
that's kind of a, that's going to be interesting.

1076
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:48.720
And then they immediately go to talk to us about some fucking old lady that,

1077
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:52.290
you know, just, you know, made her own jam or some shit.

1078
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.030
That's the feel good story to get out of it. No,

1079
01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:57.630
it's unbelievably fucking creepy. And um,

1080
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.200
I don't know. I have no idea how to stop it.

1081
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:04.500
I have no idea how to fucking stop it because no matter what you do,

1082
01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:06.810
people just sit there. Like I watched this thing on,

1083
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.960
on the news and they showed a robot talking to a little five-year-old kid and

1084
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:13.320
the robot was going like, if you put me in the closet,

1085
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:15.030
that would make me sad.

1086
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.540
And like the robot is preying on the fucking emotions of a five year old kid

1087
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.280
like that thinks should be illegal.

1088
01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.940
Like do you realize how fucked up dairy,

1089
01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:28.780
I mean I guess they've always done that with products,

1090
01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:30.190
preying on the emotions of kids,

1091
01:04:30.191 --> 01:04:34.690
but to just see it in that level of raw form and just sit there and having this

1092
01:04:34.691 --> 01:04:39.250
robot lying to a five year old, like it has fucking feelings. Um,

1093
01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:41.741
I don't know. Does it mean it was,

1094
01:04:41.741 --> 01:04:44.590
everything seemed like it's just really sped up and we are just heading right

1095
01:04:44.591 --> 01:04:47.440
over the fucking waterfall. That's, that's what I thinks going to, I don't know.

1096
01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.090
That's what I believe anyways. Um, I actually, this is my theory.

1097
01:04:51.091 --> 01:04:53.920
I believe that this is the upper 1% and that they are going to get us all

1098
01:04:53.921 --> 01:04:57.910
microchipped and when they get sick of that shit that they're going to dig in a

1099
01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.140
sick, the robots on us,

1100
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.900
they're going to take us all out and eventually the robots will take over the

1101
01:05:01.901 --> 01:05:05.770
upper 1% and um, and not in the way you think. They're not going to kill them.

1102
01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:09.460
They just going to be like all looking like supermodels and human beings won't

1103
01:05:09.461 --> 01:05:12.760
bang each other anymore cause it's going to be, this can be way more difficult.

1104
01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.073
You know what I mean?

1105
01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.080
Be Way more fucking difficult than banging a real fucking human being,

1106
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:21.940
then that will just become extinct. Um, all right. Overrated versus underrated.

1107
01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.910
Uh, overrating giving a shit bill. I just turned 35,

1108
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:29.680
six months ago and I realized how great life can be when you start to only care

1109
01:05:29.681 --> 01:05:32.980
about shit that pertains to you. Oh,

1110
01:05:32.981 --> 01:05:35.950
I thought that that's going to be like give a shit caring about your fellow man.

1111
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.530
This is completely for me. This is the other way I'm,

1112
01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.040
I don't care about anything anymore.

1113
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.690
And my friends and family say they really enjoy my company more these days.

1114
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.890
I wasn't yoga or Tony Robbins. It wasn't yoga. Tony Robbins,

1115
01:05:50.891 --> 01:05:55.540
no disrespect to either of them. It was apathy. Uh, alright.

1116
01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.320
Maybe that's what that fucking 32 year old virgin needs underrated.

1117
01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.280
Waking up early.

1118
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:03.040
I've been waking up early for the last two years of my life has changed

1119
01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:06.370
drastically. Everything I talk about doing, I actually do now,

1120
01:06:06.371 --> 01:06:10.090
and I'm in better shape than ever because of that. A, you know what,

1121
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:13.690
I'll throw another one. I'll throw a good fucking underrated out there. Sausage.

1122
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.180
I got this great fucking butcher, you know,

1123
01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:22.480
a couple towns over and I make the drive. I make the drive.

1124
01:06:22.481 --> 01:06:24.840
That's how good this fucking butcher is. And when I go in

1125
01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:28.970
<v 0>there, all I ever looked at was the steaks. I looked at the chops, you know,</v>

1126
01:06:28.971 --> 01:06:30.800
the fucking pork chops, the chicken.

1127
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:35.060
And occasionally I would fuck with the fish, but I blew right by the sausage.

1128
01:06:35.061 --> 01:06:38.570
I was just, I don't know, I didn't just never was into it. You know, it's weird.

1129
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.910
I'll have sausage on pizza, I'll have it in an Omelette,

1130
01:06:40.911 --> 01:06:42.530
but I never gave a fuck about it.

1131
01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:46.760
So I was on the phone with the lovely Nia and you know,

1132
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.280
we've been going there a lot and we were kind of running out of options.

1133
01:06:49.281 --> 01:06:52.070
We'd done all the steak shit, we'd done the fucking pork chops.

1134
01:06:52.071 --> 01:06:54.680
I don't fuck with veal though. There's no need.

1135
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.540
There's no need to do that to an animal, you know what I mean?

1136
01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.590
Just let the thing run around and give it the old fucking right there, Fred. Um,

1137
01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.100
anyways, so I was just like, I don't know, what do you want to get?

1138
01:07:04.101 --> 01:07:06.390
And I was just, and I was just sort of as I was talking to,

1139
01:07:06.391 --> 01:07:07.610
I looked over at the sausages

1140
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.930
<v 2>right? And there was one that looked like this fucking giant,</v>

1141
01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:15.250
like a black Porno Dick. Right? So I look at, I go, what the fuck is that?

1142
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:18.010
And it said it was short ribs, sausage with cheese.

1143
01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.390
So I said, I go Nia to these, got these fucking

1144
01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.270
Porno Black Dick looking sausages here that say the short rib with cheese.

1145
01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.910
She goes ghettos. Right?

1146
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.770
And I don't know if that sounded delicious or just, she's sick of being with me.

1147
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.410
But anyways, I got two of them. Right.

1148
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:42.860
<v 0>And this is really just become some big sexual thing. No,</v>

1149
01:07:42.861 --> 01:07:45.980
my wife did not have a threesome with them. We actually had them for dinner.

1150
01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:51.530
So anyways, uh, we came home, cooked those fucking things up in the skillet,

1151
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.910
made some pasta and a little bit of fucking sauce for it.

1152
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:58.370
And uh, it was fucking delicious.

1153
01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:01.940
And now I'm now I'm all about it.

1154
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.120
Now I'm just thinking once again, I want to on the big green egg,

1155
01:08:05.121 --> 01:08:09.730
I want to learn how to fucking make a pizza, right? Maybe just cheat.

1156
01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:12.080
Get the fucking pizza dog and make a good enough sauce.

1157
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:16.280
I get some fresh cheese and I'll go down the street. Get the fucking Pono Dick

1158
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.200
<v 2>fucking sausage, right? Pull a [inaudible] Lorena Bobbitt, chop it up,</v>

1159
01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:24.080
put it on the fucking damn. Sorry. You know, an underrated, you know,
