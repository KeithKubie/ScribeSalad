00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:01.312
Ok, it's Destin.

00:00:01.312 --> 00:00:02.600
- Deh, it's Dustin..

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.006
- Destin, Destin.

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:05.236
- Destin.

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:05.992
- You got it.

00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:07.169
- OK, I've got it.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.402
- [laughs] Alright here's the deal.

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:09.536
We are with Don Pettit.

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:11.850
- Have you thought of changing your name to something that's easier to pronounce?

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.277
- Just think of the module, there's a Destiny module right over there.

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:16.556
- OK, hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:18.785
Now a lot of the pictures you see from the International Space Station

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.043
come from the cupola,

00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:21.978
on the inside here, right?

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:23.879
So the the cupola's on node 3? Is that correct?

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:24.680
- Node 3.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.927
- Node 3. Alright, so this is astronaut Don Pettit.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:27.998
You may know this guy.

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:31.194
You've done all the, like, city tracking, and things like..

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:32.493
- Yeah I did a lot of cities at night,

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:37.560
and then the night time aurora and time lapse sequences of earth,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.574
many of those you see have been done in this module

00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:47.534
when I was at the helm of the camera.

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:48.913
- He's the junk, let me just say it that way.

00:00:48.913 --> 00:00:50.963
You're the junk when it comes to space photography, right?

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.314
Can you say that? Say I'm the junk?

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:56.052
- No I can't say that cause I just.. I get too embarrassed.

00:00:56.052 --> 00:00:59.182
- I'm gonna meet you on the other side, Ok? So, seriously he's the junk.

00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:02.056
Like all the really cool aurora stuff, Don's the guy that took it.

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.233
[music]

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:45.361
- Now this is a cover. [knocks on it]

00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:51.577
- So we call it a shutter and it protects the windows from micro meteorites when the shutters are closed,

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:52.823
the windows are protected.

00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:58.544
And also thermally insulates the windows from the radiation environment of space.

00:01:58.544 --> 00:02:00.053
- So can you shut these things from the outside?

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.594
- No, you can open and close it from the inside.

00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:07.112
- OK wait. On the inside you're throwing a lever or something, and it..

00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:07.988
- Yeah you're turning a knob.

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:08.985
- And it's..

00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:09.866
- Opens.

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:10.735
- On the outside.

00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:11.603
- On the outside.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.965
- How do you do that and maintain a pressure seal between them?

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:16.231
- O-ring type seals.

00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:17.264
- No you don't!

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:18.384
- With a rotating check.

00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:20.401
All our hatch seals are O-ring type seals.

00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.219
- Yeah but how.. Ahh my brain's..

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.301
- Let's go inside, we can see it.

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:28.049
Watch your head.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.594
- Oops thunk.

00:02:30.594 --> 00:02:32.747
- So you have a whole series of O-rings in here

00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:35.780
and a shaft that you rotate.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.520
- So, I mean on the space station how many of these would you have?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.427
- Seven, because we have seven windows.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.880
- What happens if you get a leak on that?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.059
- Um, then you have a leak.

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.270
- You just have a leak. and you lose air.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.803
- And what you would do is you would probably seal the whole cupola off

00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:58.365
and then there's probably a plan I don't know off the top of my head

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:02.590
but there's probably a plan for replacing the mechanism,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.211
it might require a space walk.

00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:12.517
- So my question is how can you operate a lid on the outside of the space station by manipulating something mechanical

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:15.592
on the inside of the space station, without losing air pressure.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:19.269
- It's called real good engineering.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.466
- OK you heard Don Pettit.

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.936
He said that it takes a really good engineer to design this sort of thing.

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:26.200
I'm told the guy quit working on the space program

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.505
and now owns his own motorcycle parts business.

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:32.913
Is Charlie here? Is he upstairs?

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:33.939
- You're doing the interview right?

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.023
- I'm doing the interview.

00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:36.008
What is the name of this place?

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:37.281
- Pit bull products.

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:38.484
- Pit bull products?

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.063
- Yeah.

00:03:39.063 --> 00:03:39.984
- Are you Charlie?

00:03:39.984 --> 00:03:40.630
- Yeah

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.318
- Hey I'm Destin.

00:03:41.318 --> 00:03:43.091
This guy is Charlie VanValkenburgh.

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.570
He went to Auburn University as an industrial engineer

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.692
and he's got like well over a dozen patents.

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:51.205
20 years ago he was the lead engineer over the cupola shutter design

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:54.780
but after the project finished he stopped and went and built his own business.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.067
Now he's building this.

00:03:56.067 --> 00:04:00.535
It's a special stand that uses leverage to pick up a motorcycle so people can work on it.

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:05.806
He's so humble about his skills though that even the people that work with him had no idea what he did for the space station.

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:09.077
When Charlie's team was working on this they called it Space Station Freedom.

00:04:09.077 --> 00:04:10.482
Which is a really cool name by the way.

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:17.126
This program morphed into the International Space Station program and Charlie's drawing package was handed over to the Italian space agency

00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:18.898
so the italians could fabricate it.

00:04:18.898 --> 00:04:21.321
Charlie however kept an entire drawing package,

00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:24.824
cause every good engineer knows you might have to go back and look at what you did.

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:27.296
We talked about the handles, we looked at the bevel gears,

00:04:27.296 --> 00:04:28.991
we talked about the cartridge assembly.

00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:32.794
OK we found what might be the most critical part of the entire drawing package.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:34.702
This is the inner shaft,

00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:37.305
and you can see right here there are two grooves,

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:41.212
and those grooves are held to within 2000ths of an inch.

00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:44.675
The reason that's important is because the interface between the inside of that groove

00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:47.087
and the outer wall that compresses the O-ring

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:51.668
you have to control that, because you're taking a circular O-ring and you're gonna squish it to an oval.

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:52.408
Is that right Charlie?

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:53.054
- That's correct.

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:55.033
- There's another detail of those O-ring grooves right?

00:04:55.603 --> 00:04:57.363
- Right. These are the dynamic grooves.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.626
Those two are the ones that actually are turning.

00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:00.626
- Did you hear what he just said?

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.196
He said they're dynamic O-rings.

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:04.020
That means there's a shaft running through it.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.760
Actually rubbing on the O-ring.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.228
So you've got the air that you're breathing as an astronaut right?

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:13.345
And it's being held back from the vacuum of space by two little bitty O-rings.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:15.014
That's incredible!

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:20.563
So this design that you made 20 years ago is still being operated today flawlessly.

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:21.321
How does that make you feel?

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:24.120
- I hope it's flawless. [laughs]

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.126
- A couple of months ago I was sitting here and I tweeted something

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:29.016
and I noticed it was favorited from an astronaut on orbit.

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:30.868
[Pffshhh] Blew my mind, right?

00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:32.618
But if you think about it it makes sense.

00:05:32.618 --> 00:05:36.933
These astronauts are getting smarter every day by doing science off the earth for us here on the earth.

00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:37.934
Pretty amazing.

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:42.373
Anyway, turns out it was real so I decided to seize the opportunity.

00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:48.178
- You're sure that Italy built from our design right? I never really knew.

00:05:48.178 --> 00:05:48.955
- You don't know?

00:05:48.955 --> 00:05:50.482
- I didn't follow up on it, no.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:55.341
- Well um.. The Italian astronaut said that was how it was built.

00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:01.857
- Hello.

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:04.902
And welcome to the cupola on the International Space Station.

00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:07.496
In the cupola we have seven windows

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:10.157
and every window has its own shutter.

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:13.462
And Smarter Every Day, with whom I have connected via twitter

00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:17.774
asked me to give you a demonstration of how we open and close the shutters.

00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:21.932
I guess it's because I'm Italian and the cupola you know was built in Italy.

00:06:21.932 --> 00:06:23.582
So here we go, it's pretty easy.

00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:26.615
Each window has a handle that looks like this.

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:31.293
And you just turn it, obviously in the closed direction if you want to close the window,

00:06:31.293 --> 00:06:33.955
and here you can see the window coming closed,

00:06:33.955 --> 00:06:36.132
or the shutter.

00:06:36.132 --> 00:06:42.102
And when you get close to the end, to the closed position,

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:44.143
you kind of want to be careful because there is no bumper

00:06:44.143 --> 00:06:46.001
so you don't want to hit the structure real hard.

00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:48.679
It's a direct mechanical connection.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:50.846
Shutters can only be operated manually.

00:06:50.846 --> 00:06:57.678
And it's kind of cool to think that there is this shaft that goes sort of through

00:06:57.678 --> 00:06:59.959
the structure, the other side is in outer space.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:04.018
It feels cold but the regular metal cold, not really really cold.

00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:09.148
And again, when you get close to structure you want to be careful not to hit real hard.

00:07:09.148 --> 00:07:10.760
So this is it.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.169
It's pretty simple.

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.205
I'm European astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti on the International Space Station,

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.565
and you are getting Smarter Every Day.

00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:19.533
Have a good one.

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:25.372
- She just did the Smarter Every Day outro from space.

00:07:25.372 --> 00:07:27.244
[Pshhhheww] That's crazy!

00:07:27.244 --> 00:07:29.110
Follow these guys on twitter.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.702
Follow all the astronauts on twitter.

00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:34.276
They're taking pictures out of the cupola every day and tweeting it to your phone.

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:36.021
Why would you not do that?

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:37.400
And what was the astronaut's name?

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.288
- Samantha.

00:07:38.288 --> 00:07:40.966
- That's right. So, go follow them on twitter.

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.323
Awesome stuff happens when you follow them on twitter.

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:44.886
Would you like to add anything?

00:07:46.026 --> 00:07:48.462
- Smarter Every Day! [laughs]

00:07:48.582 --> 00:07:49.228
- [distant] Dad.

00:07:49.228 --> 00:07:50.001
- What?

00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:50.928
- [distant] I love you.

00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:52.867
- I love you too. Have a good one.

00:07:54.157 --> 00:07:55.704
They already did the outro from space.

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:56.608
We don't have to do that.

00:07:56.608 --> 00:08:01.430
If you feel like we've earned your subscription please consider clicking on one of these O-rings to subscribe.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.548
Thank you very much.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:03.555
Are you excited about space?

00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:04.315
- Yeah.

00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:05.358
- What are these called? Do you know?

00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:06.791
- O-rings.

00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:08.348
- O-rings, that's right.
