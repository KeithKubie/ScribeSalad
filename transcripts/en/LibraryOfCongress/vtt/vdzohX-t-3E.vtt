00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.700
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Hi.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.700
My name is Larry Appelbaum
from the Music Division here

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.430
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.560
It is with great pleasure that I'm
joined by one of the great singers

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.710
of our time, Grammy award winning
vocal artist, Dianne Reeves.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.010
Dianne --

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.310
&gt;&gt; Diane Reeves: Hi.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Great to see you again.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.910
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Glad to be here.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.210
Thank you.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.510
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.810
You're here in Washington
and here at the Library

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.390 position:56%
to give a performance tonight that's
sort of focused on Ella Fitzgerald

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.940
because it's her centenary year.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.450
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Right.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.750
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Let's start --

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.600
why don't you talk to us about
how you pay tribute to Ella

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.740
and still stay true to yourself.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.330
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well, that's
the only thing that you can do

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.800
because Ella did it in a certain
way that is uniquely here,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.060
and the greatest lesson
that I learned

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.650
from here was to beat yourself.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.290
So the thing that I love about her

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.570
and people always say it is
the whole joy of singing,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.310 position:56%
and I think tonight's performance
will celebrate her joy, her courage,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.320
her ability to just jump off the
edge and create in the moment

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.740
and be a co-creator
with her musicians.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.200
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Are you going
to delve into her repertoire?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.500
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yes.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.800
A lot.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And is
there an aspect of her career

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.400
that you're particularly drawn to
because she had different stages?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.700
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.140 position:56%
I think -- when I was in high school
is when I really had the opportunity

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.790
to listen to her, and
that was in the 70's.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.730
I was working at this club
that she came and performed at.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.280
And all my life, I had heard Ella.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.950
Of course -- played -- everybody
was playing their favorite songs

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.810
and favorite eras of Ella.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.410
But the thing that I
loved was when I saw her,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.580
she was swinging the Beatles tunes.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.370
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: And I thought
that was the most incredible thing

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.910
because now that meant
that it's open.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.920
That said to me you know, the
music that you love is the music

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.910
that you can bring a
jazz sensibility to.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.580
And that's exactly what she did.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.520 position:56%
And so for me, that Ella, that thing

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.810
about Ella was the
greatest discovery

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.170
and the thing that ignited me.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.890
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You
actually subbed for her.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.190
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: For at least
a few days at The Warehouse.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.810
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: The one
day, it was just one day.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.110
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: One day?

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.410
Okay. Tell that story.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.710
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.010 position:56%
Well, this is that same performance.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.710
The Warehouse was a club in Denver

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.430
that upstairs was the
big club, The Warehouse.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.430
And then downstairs
was The Tool Shed.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.530
And I ended up getting this gig
because Jean Harris had come

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.640
through Denver along
with Blue Mitchell.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.670 position:56%
They were all hanging out in Denver,
and he found a home at this club,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.790
and he would have a
jam session on Sunday.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.660
So I would go to the jam session
and ended up getting a gig there.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.960
I'm in high school.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.780
My parents are chaperoning.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.890
I'm seeing all the
big acts upstairs,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.120
and then they tell
me Ella is coming.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.860
So they made arrangements so
that I could go up and see her.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.600 position:56%
So I'm watching her show and once
again, she was swinging the Beatles.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.820
And it was just unbelievable,
and went backstage and hung

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.730
out in her dressing room,
and people were coming back.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.490
And she was very gracious, and
every time I would get up to leave,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.290
she'd tell me to just sit there.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.380
And finally when everybody left

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.980
and she asked me how
did I like the show?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.480
And I told her, that it
was absolutely wonderful,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.110
but I was so star struck and in awe
because while she was being nice

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.030
to all of these people, I'm looking
at all this wardrobe and gowns

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.550
and shoes laid out and going
my God, it was just a lot.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.630
All these colors and the
tone of her speaking voice.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.010
And so the next night she
was to come, but as you know,

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.550
Denver has got a --
we have thin air,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.100
and the air took its toll on her.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.150
And she wasn't able to perform.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.510
So they put a group of musicians.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.660
My uncle is bass assistant.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.710
He was one of them, and he
said we want you go to upstairs

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.120
and sing a few songs with the band.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.640
And I remember they hadn't
cleared out her dressing room,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.110
and I was sitting in
her dressing room,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.460
and she had these cute little
periwinkle blue pumps just

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.760
sitting there.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.820
They were patent leather, and
I just stuck my feet in them.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.630
They were narrow, but I got my
feet in them, and I remember going

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.430
and I performed three songs.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.020
I vaguely remember that because
the entire time I was looking

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.320
down at the shoes.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: That's hip.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.810
Do you have a sense
from watching her --

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.990
I mean, we all know what
a great artist she was

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.940
as a singer, as an improviser.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.360
Do you have a sense
of her personality?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.450
What kind of person she was?

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.500
Like off the band stand?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.800
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: No.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.960
I mean, only the little
bit that I was able to peep

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:52.410
and I found her speaking voice to
be as I remember it was very small

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:59.880
and like I said, it was kind
of on breath and just gracious

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.710
and thank you and da,
da, da, like that.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.690
And I look back, I think knowing
what I know about singing now,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.530
I know that the stage is a
sacred place, and it is a place

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.960
that when you walk onto it,
there's an immediate change.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.790
And there is no inhibition.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.190
There is no editing.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.140
There is no fear.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.680
But right before you go on,
you feel all of those things.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.270
You feel -- at least I do -- and
I had heard that she was very,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.510
very nervous a lot of times
before going on stage,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.570
and I thought I understand that.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:59.130
So the ability becomes a
kind of armor and a shield,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:06.200 position:56%
and people see you in a certain way,
and that's how they think of you,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.460
but they don't really know
you, and I know that's true.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.460
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
So much of what you do

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.170
on stage requires being
in the moment.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.840
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yes.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.710
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Can you
prepare to be in the moment?

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.120
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: The
preparing comes from the doing.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.500
That this is a landscape that
you understand and you know how

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.640
to navigate and that
you are familiar

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.720
with in every fiber of your being.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.020
You know how to hear.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.790
You know what certain harmonies
sound like and how they move

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.490
and where you want to go in that,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.980
and so those things
become second nature,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.650
and then the next thing is
what does the moment say

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.430
that I should do right now?

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.630
It's like this conversation you
could ask me the same question

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.430
tomorrow and I will probably
describe the same thing

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.400
in a different way.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.700
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
We talked about Ella,

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.980
but I want to focus a bit on you.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.280
You're born in Detroit.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.670 position:56%
When did your family move to Denver?

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.970
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: When I was two.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.270
I was very young.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.570
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So no
memories of Detroit really?

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: No, other than
that's where I spent all my summers,

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.330
but basically I did not
attend school there.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.650
I didn't really grow up there.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.490
I grew up in Denver, Colorado.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Music around the house?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.110
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Oh my God, yes.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.410
I mean --

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.710
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Was
there a piano in the home?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.010
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Piano
in the house.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.830
I had my grandmother's sister
-- two sisters and an uncle,

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.910
they were all performers,
and the oldest brother

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.950
and sister I never met, but
always heard stories about them.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.740
But my one Aunt Kay, that was
when we'd have holiday dinners

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:56.300
at her house, she played and she
would sing all of those Ma Rainey,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:03.300 position:56%
Bessie Smith blues with a dual
meaning and adults would be laughing

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.080
and we didn't know why
they were laughing,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.050 position:56%
but I would learn the songs
because it sounded like [crosstalk].

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:16.210 position:56%
And I remember my uncle would play
bass and so that was one side of it.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.790
Then my uncle was with the symphony
so we would go and hear him.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.090
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
This is Charles Burrell.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.380
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Charles Burrell
and then my mother had her music.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.450
My father loved jazz music so he
-- there were records everywhere

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.700
and I think the first cuss word
that I could really say out loud

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.430
without a problem was Bitches Brew.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:43.540
And then of course George Duke and
my sister's ten years older than me

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.270
so I'm listening to the
music that she listened to.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.570
Everybody loved music.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.870
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
George Duke is your cousin?

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.170
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.150
George Duke is my cousin,
was my cousin.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do you
remember the first record you bought

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.570
with your own money?

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.910
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: No because
they were always just --

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.380
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I mean, what
kind of music were you listening

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.550
to when you were preteens?

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.850
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Preteen
-- you know what?

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.150
I actually do.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.530
The first record that I bought

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:15.140
with my own money was Marvin
Gaye's What's Going On?

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.440
Yeah.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Oh really?

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.590
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah
because that was different.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:25.390
But as a kid, here we are, we're
listening now black radio has come

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:31.100
into view in Denver, and I remember
it was a station called KDKO,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:37.570 position:56%
Dr. Daddyo, and that's when we
started hearing the music of Motown.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.090
And my nextdoor neighbor
was also from Detroit.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.840
She spent a lot of time like I
would sometimes would go together

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.400
to Detroit in the summertime, and
learn all the dances, learn --

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.910
and then we'd have -- we had
45's like -- I think my mother,

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.840
I'd say I want this 45, and
she would go and she had her --

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.360
and my friend, Regina, had her
brother who would bring the 45's

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.570
and so we would just listen
to them over and over.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.290
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did you
ever sing into your hairbrush?

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.590
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: No.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.890
We didn't sing into a hairbrush.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.250
We actually watched -- and this
is a really interesting thing --

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.820
we would watch on television
like The Temptations

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.160
or when they did the show
TCB with the Supremes,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.230
and I mean we could take all that
in and actually turn back around

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.650
and basically do just what they
did, the moves and everybody, yeah.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.950
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Slick stuff.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.500
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah, and so we
would have our own little dances

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.570
and stuff, but we sang out
loud, didn't have a hairbrush.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:47.350
But just had a broom, did all the
different things, could turn around

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.750
and grab the broom and
all that kind of stuff.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.070
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Were you also
listening to like Stacks records

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.500
or was it strictly Motown?

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.870
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: No, it
was really everything.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.690
James Brown was very
much a part of my life.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.550
Stacks was a part of my
life because of my sister.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.470
So it was everything.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:11.020
And it was an interesting
time because in the 60's

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:17.640
and 70's music was very message,
early 70's very message oriented.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:23.010
So it really could easily be the
background music or the sound track

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:29.070
of your life because all of these
musicians we're talking about,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.990
how we have to come together and
get along and he's not heavy,

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.480
he's my brother and
all of these things.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.370
And I remember going to the
record store with my Dad.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:47.740
The music was in alphabetical
order so that was really cool.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.660
And I think back, there were no
boundaries and wasn't categorized.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.380
I'd never heard the
word genre at that time.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.130
My world music experience before
that word was even coined came

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:08.370
from jazz musicians, listening
to Dizzy Gillespie and the music

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.940
of [inaudible] or listen
to Wayne Shorter

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:16.740
and hearing this amazing sound
from Brazil with Milton [inaudible]

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:22.330
and all of this introducing
us to this world of music

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.790
and my sister going to concerts
and saying who was there

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.440
and it would be all -- you
could be miles [inaudible],

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.400
it was just music to people.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.600
So it was really big
and broad at that time.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.060
So what happened when you
first encountered Betty Carter?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.820
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Oh my God.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.170
I had my own group by this time.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:54.220
I had moved to Los Angeles, and we
were performing and trying to --

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.320
our group was a group
that you wrote a range,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.630
you improvised and
tried to go so far.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.620
We didn't care about coming back,

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.060
just see where we could
take the music.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: What
was the name of that group?

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.880
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: It
was called Night Flight.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.630
And I remember we would always
go and hear different people

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.090
that were coming in
town at the time.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.510
I was living way out in Glendale.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.850
My drummer called me and
said, "Dianne, you got to get

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.610
down here and hear this lady.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.090
Her name is Betty Carter.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.500
You got to come here.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.800
We just heard the first set.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.170
Come so you can be
here for the next set."

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.200
So then you just did that.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.130
Jumped up, made the 45 minute
trek, got there in enough time

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:45.600
to hear her, and I was mesmerized.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.490
I was -- I almost lost my mind.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:56.480
I'd never ever heard anyone
stand in a band like that.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.580
And really co-create in a way
that the movement of the music,

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.410
the musicians would play and she
would pull so far back on the time

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.860
and you would think oh my
God, something's going on,

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.050
but you knew it wasn't wrong.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.350
It was all right.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:18.200
And she's telling these
stories with broad strokes

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.020
and there was something
about her that --

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.090 position:56%
and I think this happens with every
young artist, that you see a glimpse

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.080
of something, that you
actually recognize.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:37.180
And it's like a fleeting
light, but it's enough

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.760
to not only change your
heart and your mind,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.650
but really make you
feel things physically.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:50.870
And I remember that when I drove
home, I was basically in a trance

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:56.640
because it was like a
God experience for me.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.270 position:56%
So at the time, I had two roommates.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.910
One was a hairdresser and
one was a flight attendant.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.480
And they were both gone
for the weekend now,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.080
every night now from now on.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.560
That was the first time
she was doing six nights.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.130
So I'm going every
single night to hear her.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.540
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
What club was it?

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.840
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Hop
Sings out on Lincoln.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:26.550
And so I go and I look up
her records at Tower Records.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.240
They are records on Betty Carter,

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.580
and I'm going wow,
that's her own level.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.010
And buy a whole new
turn table and set it

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:42.340
up with speakers underneath
it, and this whole weekend,

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.380
this whole time my roommates were
gone, when I wasn't at the club,

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.530
I'm listening to her with flowers
on either side of the turn table.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.260
I mean, it was like an altar.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.240
And they came home and
they said, "What is wrong?"

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.360
I'm like you don't understand.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.790
So I remember the whole band, we
were all there every single night.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.270
And it was -- I believe it was
Curtis Lundy was on -- almost --

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.570
I think that [inaudible].

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:12.870
I'm thinking it was [inaudible].

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.170
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Yeah, that was a trio.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.470
That was one of our great trios.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.910
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah,
was on piano.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:23.080
But anyway, I remember I thought
okay, I want to try this thing

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:29.550
with these long strokes and
pull back on the time and I said

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.280
so I'm going to count off this
slow temple for the man I love,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.490
and you guys just play it.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.540
I'm going to try it.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.400
One, two, three, four.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.700
By the end of the song, I
couldn't find the man I love.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.730
He couldn't find me,
but what an experience.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.120
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It's
harder than it looks.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.620
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well,
but the thing was,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.730
I had a place where I could try.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:03.470 position:56%
And so I just kept trying until I
found this place that I liked for me

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:08.930
that worked for me, and I've been
pulling back on time ever since.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.340
The next person I heard do that
in a totally different way was

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.940
Shirley Horn.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.240
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.540
Her -- very creative use of space.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.840
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yes.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Yeah, here in Washington.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.920
Now when you have these kind of
experiences that open the doors

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.400
for you in your mind, do
you talk to the artist?

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.700
Did you talk to Betty?

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.170
Do you talk to Shirley?

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.470
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.910 position:56%
As a matter of fact, Betty from that
point on anytime she came to L.A.,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.760
I was there, but I
hadn't talked to her yet,

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:48.380
and she [inaudible]
know I was there.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.340
And her assistant told
me one time she said --

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.870
Betty would say that
girl is out there.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.170
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah, stalking.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.620
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah, just
listening because it was just --

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.000
because from there she went to the
[inaudible] and she also did --

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.380
there was another little place,
Vine Street where I saw her.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.440
And it was really an amazing thing.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.840
It was like school.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:19.580 position:56%
I call these living schools because
I really got to really sit up under,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:25.650
listen and break things
down or go oh wow.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.540
I never would have thought to
make a choice like that or playing

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.310
with time and making time your
own and being able to take a lyric

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:39.610
and paint a picture with a
lyric and all of these things.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:46.110
And so I went to the University of
Colorado but I never had schooling

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.370
like when I would go and sit
in front of people like her.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:55.320
I'd go and see Carmen McCray
would be at the Parisian Room.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.620
They're right there.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.920
Big Joe Turner.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.730
I had just broken up
with my boyfriend.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.080
Big Joe Turner was sitting
on stage, and the whole --

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.910
my friend took me and I weeped
[phonetic] the whole time

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.780
and the whole time he
looked at me and sang.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.970
And it just was this amazing thing.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:20.050
So those for me -- and being
able to work with a lot

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.500
of the architects of the music.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.680
For me, the living school was
the best because you realize

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.690
that there was this
intimate exchange that goes

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.480
on between musicians, sometimes
jokes but always conversation.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.870
Always taking a conversation
to different levels

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:45.180
and making statements within
the music that audience hears

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.710
but doesn't really,
really know where it came

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.100
from because the statement
really came

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.610
from what just happened backstage

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.300
when everybody was
laughing and talking.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.960
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You can
learn a lot from reading books.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.260
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves:

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.560
Yes.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.990
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You can
learn a lot from studying scores.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.630
But it's still -- so much of this
music is still an oral tradition.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.670
It's passed on from master to
student or apprentice or whatever.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.000
So when you finally gathered
the courage to talk to Betty

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.430
or to Shirley or to
any of the other greats

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.850
who inspired you, what
would you ask them?

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.240
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well, I'd
just go there, sit and talk.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.540
I wouldn't really talk about
the music, just listen to --

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.130
because Betty was the one
that took over a conversation.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.920
So it was cool with me.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.390
It's like oh, okay.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.570
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Was
she curious about you?

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.870
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Later on.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:41.760
I did this record called Art and
Survival, and Javon Jackson right

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.480
after that was doing a record

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.700
and he had asked Betty
to produce his record.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.160
And he asked me to be on
it, and I loved Javon.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.860
He's from Denver, and I was
like absolutely and absolutely

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.410
because Betty was producing it.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.140
And I think one of the songs
was I Waited for You, whatever.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.410
So I made sure -- I
mean, I knew everything.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:10.510
I sang it down, and I
remember after the first take

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.230
because I just wanted it to be
right and I really thought it out

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:20.650
and really rehearsed, I mean really
rehearsed in a way that it was part

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.060
of my show so that it felt like
I could do anything with it,

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.910
and then it was just silence.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.290
And I was like oh, God.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.500
She said, "When you
do the second verse,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.020
just be a little more inventive,
just do something else."

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.590
I was like, oh, okay.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.920
And I did that.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.560
And our conversation was
really, really short.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.860
I did the song.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.230
She said, cool, cool.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.700
So a couple of weeks later,

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.000
I was talking to Bruce
Ludball [assumed spelling],

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.570
and I was like I have this idea
for this record, and I wanted --

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:04.290
because I liked the idea of
a woman producing jazz music

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.430
because it's a whole different
way of looking at things.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:14.510
And at the time, I was thinking her
and early on Terry, Lynn Carrington

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.590
because she produced
one of the songs

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.720
on the Art and Survival record.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.500
And myself, and I thought maybe not
the whole thing but some things.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.570
So Bruce went and told her Dianne
wants you to produce her record.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.930 position:56%
I was like, Bruce I didn't say that.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.230
So anyway, we ended up talking.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:39.710 position:56%
And I said well, I told her my idea.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.400
And she said, "Well if I
don't produce the whole thing,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.710
I don't produce."

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.100
I said I'm really sorry
to hear that.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:53.740
And so we got into this
really deep conversation.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.620
Betty was hard.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.960
And she said, "And
then I heard your -- ."

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.840
So I knew she was listening
to my music

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.290
because she was calling off tunes.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:10.750
"I heard you sing Body and Soul,
and I never put anger in my music.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:16.020
It felt angry and you can't
bring that to audience."

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:20.750
I said, "Well, that's how
I feel about the song.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.250
It was more -- it was
not so much anger

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:27.090
as it was I was stating the
fact that this was where I was.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.580
And I was shouting it.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.120
And I got the courage to do
that from listening to you."

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.650
Totally flipped the conversation.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.790
So she said to me, "Look, I have a
run to make and I'll be right back,

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.870
and I'm going to call you again."

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.170
And I said okay.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.950
And she called me back and
then we started to talk.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:54.230
And it was -- it was incredible
and after she was diagnosed

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.870
with pancreatic cancer,
I remember she was

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.190
at the [inaudible] Jazz Festival,
and I went to go see her there,

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:07.710
and we hugged, and I told her that
I really respected and loved her

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.100
and thank you for the
performance that evening.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.430
And she gave me this really
wonderful hug and told me

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.650
to just be strong out there.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.210
She said stick to who you are.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.170
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I'm not
sure there was anybody stronger

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.470
than Betty Carter.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.770
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I don't think so.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.070
Well --

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.370
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Especially
when you think of when she came up.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.670
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah,
but you know [crosstalk].

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.100
But Sarah was.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:34.760
They all had -- they all went
through some -- and Carmen McCray.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.650
They all -- they're all from the
-- cut from the same cloth I think.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.470
Just a different way of dealing
with it, pushing through because --

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.530
and I realize that
-- I'll never forget.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.320
I had this gig out at USC once.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:54.030
And it was with my band, all
my music, and Billy Childs was

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:58.550
in the band at that time,
and we were performing

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.160
and this big radio
disc jockey was there

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.250
because it was a live
performance on air.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:13.390
And he decided he would
interview Billy, which was cool.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.800
And so he's like I'm
listening to music.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.040
He's talking about the
music, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.250
And he said so who's
the chick singer?

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.570
And Billy said, "Oh,
that's Dianne Reeves."

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.740
And we've been working together
and da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.410
Disc jockey says, "Well,
who's the leader of the band?"

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.550
And Billy looks at him and
says, "The chick singer."

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:45.540
So this kind of thing -- the --

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.930
what I got from having to
push through was nothing --

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:55.490 position:56%
I realized was nothing like how
Sarah and Carmen and Ella and all --

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:00.350
Billy and all of them pushed
through in a way that allowed --

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.920
for them, it was black
and white, and I got to be

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.130
in a gray area if I needed to be.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.010
They created that for me.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:18.220
But it was still very
male dominated art form.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.310
However, they were really, really
good people like Clark Terry

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.270
and Lou Belson [assumed spelling].

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:30.870
Of course, Fat Jones
and Mel Lewis who --

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.160 position:56%
that was the first time I even heard
Dee Dee Bridgewater was with them.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:40.750
They were open and broad and
hearing music for what it was.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:46.270
So I had this opportunity
to come through all of that.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.890
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You led
your own groups for many years.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.890
But you've also worked
for other leaders.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.990
What do you think makes
a good leader?

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.670
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Just being
very, very clear about what it is

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:59.410
that you want and also being
respectful of who you're bringing

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:05.330 position:56%
to the table because everybody has
a way -- has something to contribute

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.620
and they want to make your
thing happen but they do it

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.190
in their own voice, and I like
when people are like that.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.270
I learned that Ellington
was like that.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.030
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: How
did you learn to improvise?

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.670
Did it just come naturally?

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.970
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: No.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.270
Yes and no.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:28.850
I mean, the desire of course was
natural but then I had to go --

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:33.890
I ha to learn how to sing
through chord changes

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.760
and what to hear and how to hear.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.560
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did you do that
just by listening to great singers?

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.920
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Listening
-- yeah, mostly listening.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.740 position:56%
Listening to mostly instrumentalists

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.990
because there was more
instrumentalists

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.310
who were improvising
than there were singers.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:56.260
I mean other than Ella who
was an instrumentalist.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.010
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And which
specific instrumentalist would have

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.310
inspired you?

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:03.470
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well, for
different reasons, different ones

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:11.310
like for instance, I loved
Miles because I equated Miles

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:16.220
with after I discovered Milton
[inaudible] with the same kind

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.380
of thing with tone, being able to
sing these really beautiful notes

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.610
that are on the edge
without bravado.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:34.680 position:56%
Just straight and there's a kind of
innocence to the sound or it just --

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.590
it cuts through but it --
you want it to penetrate.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.620
Then I'd listen to someone

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:47.210
like Cannon Ball Adderly
[assumed spelling]

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:51.690
who I could hear the
stories in what he played.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.630
So you're listening to Country
Preacher which I recorded,

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:02.930
and you could hear this whole
story of what was going on.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:09.140
And I love the sound of his
horn and I love what he did

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.800
with Nancy Wilson, how well and
how beautifully that went together.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.770
So it would be like that.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.340
Those were the first two.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:23.770
And then later on when I
discovered the Sarah Vaughn

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:28.180
and Clifford Brown album,
then it was like oh, okay.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.410
This is something --
something else that is --

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.420
so I started to realize
that I had to define --

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.880
through musicians I
started to realize

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.770 position:56%
that improvisation was one thing but
defining and refining your own sound

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.310
and tone was quite another.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.570
And so I went about doing
that because I noticed

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:54.760
that with Sara she really
understood her entire instrument.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:01.280 position:56%
Ella created a language to improvise
with, that was strictly for her.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.230
I always tell people that was a
language to be able to articulate

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.850
and say what -- reach the
things that she needed to say.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.250
Everybody's different.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:15.520
Depending on where you
come from, you have to --

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.410
somebody who is learning to do
that and they're from Brazil

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:27.370
or something, they're going to
use different kinds of sound.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.060
So you have to find your own place.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:34.290
And then I found that improvisation
was steeped in phrasing.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:40.440
While Betty was a great
improviser in terms of with melody

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.280
without lyric, but she
also phrased in a way

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.070
that was very, very powerful.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.090
Same thing with Billie Holiday.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.070
So how do you want
-- these things began

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.200
to help me understand well how
-- what do you want to say,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.250
how do you want to say it and
how will you go about saying it?

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.770
So tearing down the songs and
looking at the lyrics and say oh,

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.560
I want to say it like this because
this song reminds me of whatever

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.540
in my life, and that
would be the subtext.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:19.100
And then from that point on, just
hearing how the harmonies fall

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.740
and knowing where you want to
start and where you want to get to

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:29.370
and you get -- you think farther
than where you are so you know

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.960
where you want to get
to at all times.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Interesting
to hear you talk about sound.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:41.510
And I'm always curious how much
of either an instrumentalist

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:45.870
or a vocalist sound is conscious
and how much of it is --

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.110
for example, when we were
just using our speaking voice,

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:53.800
if you're an actor or actress,
yes, you've trained your voice

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.180
to sound in a certain way.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.480
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Right.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Most people
just speak because they learn

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.230
from their parents or
they learn somehow.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.590
It's not necessarily conscious.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.890
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Right.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So as a singer,
how much of your sound is conscious?

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.830
Something that you've
trained yourself to do?

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.310
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well,
for instance,

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:16.400
speaking because my
instrument is something I have

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.590
to use every day on the phone.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:25.330
I consciously do not
holler into other rooms.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:29.190
I consciously stay supported
to the point where it's --

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.010
keep my voice lifted to the point
where it's just second nature

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.910
because I know I have to.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:43.020
When I have to project -- like
if I have to say something loud

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:49.150
so somebody hears or even in anger,
I'm really conscious about all

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.000
of that because I still
know that I have to work.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.450
And also I know the
limitations of my instrument.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.240
I know that my instrument
needs sleep.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.070
I know my instrument needs water.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.500
I know that my instrument
sometimes needs silence.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.560
Needs a smoke-free environment.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.820
But I know singers that
can do all of that,

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.500
and they don't have a problem.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.930
But that's their instrument.

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:19.160
So -- and then after that, when I
look at different songs that I sing

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:28.120 position:56%
because I sing all kinds of music,
different music has a different kind

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.780
of atmosphere or sound
scape or landscape.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.080
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Give me an example.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:40.010
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Like if I sing
say Love for Sale and I do it

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.250
in this Brazilian kind of
way, there's a certain way

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.800
that I would use my voice.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.680
But if I were to take Love
for Sale and say, you know,

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.840
I'm going to bring it down, and
it's really up tempo and fast pace

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.450
and it's a lot of fun,
what if I want to do it

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.210
in a different kind of way?

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:03.840
I might change the key to bring it
-- if I want to do it as a ballad.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.540
I decide what it is that
I want to say with it.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.460
Might change harmonies that give
my voice a whole another kind

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.760
of feeling.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:23.620 position:56%
All of these kinds of things to set
up the sound to give the lyric life.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.780
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Of course it
helps that you've been working

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.250
with certain musicians for
a long time in your band,

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.560
whether it's Peter or Romero --

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.560
because they're right
there with you.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.860
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So you
can change in the moment.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.030
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah, and
that's the thing that I love

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.250
because they come from
a period of time

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.410
where they're real open to that.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:47.300
So that conversation
thing can happen.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:53.830 position:56%
If I'm doing something with Romero
which I'm excited tonight to perform

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:58.010
with just the two of them
because things change and Romero,

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:01.180
if I do something with
just him, I just never know

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.140
where he's going to
go, and I love it.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.270
It's the same thing
with my bass player.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.720
I'll turn around with him
sometimes and say okay,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.560
we're going to do all blues.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.310
That's like you pick the groove.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.080
We're not going to
do the traditional.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:20.100
And every night, but he comes out
of this tradition in New Orleans.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: That's Reginald.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.700
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yes.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.000
Reginald Veal [assumed spelling].

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.090
He comes out of this tradition
from New Orleans that is that,

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.290
that in the moment
creates and is comfortable

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.710
with the creation they make.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:37.400
So this goes on all
the time, written --

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.210
I wrote this song called Tango just

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.910
so that we just have
this opportunity

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.890
that every night this
song just changes.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:50.160
I tell the audience that
it'll never be tomorrow night

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.740
or any other night.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:58.730
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So when you're
thinking about a recording project,

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.850
you can see where you're
drawn to certain songs.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.600
By the way, what does
draw you to certain songs?

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.520
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: It's
mostly the lyric.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.150
Yeah. It's mostly the lyric.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:08.760
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Is
that a matter of the story?

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.550
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah,
and something --

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:15.530
even if I've never experienced
it, there's something about it

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:20.560
that speaks to me so that's --
or something I want to talk about

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.990
or that I've seen that
I'm inspired by.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.930
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So let's
say you develop a set list

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:33.230
or a program list say ten songs.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.730
Do you then go out on the
road before you record just

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.230
to see how the song
sort of takes shape?

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.880
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah,
yeah absolutely.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And how does it
change from your original conception

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.470
to what you end up recording?

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.630
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: It just does.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:56.800
That's a really -- it's a
kind of -- it's a funny thing.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.040
Say I'll take for instance
he's doing --

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.670
there's this Annie
Defranco song that I do

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.860
for my record that never was that.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.410
The way that we recorded
was not how it started out,

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:17.000
and Annie Defranco --
it's called 32 Flavors --

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.680
Annie Defranco writes poetry.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.740
So you can interpret it
and she wrote the song

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.260
that there's not much of a melody.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.480 position:56%
So it's really -- it gives itself --

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.300
lends itself beautifully
to improvising.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:41.540
So I learned the lyric, learned
her melody and then I would go

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.000
out on the road say like
when I was doing Two Guitars

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.050
with Russell Malone and
Romero and I say okay,

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.220
we're going to come
up with this groove.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.400
And they'd start this groove.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.810
And then I start putting this
lyrics in certain rhythm on top

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.820
of it, and they would respond.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.130 position:56%
So okay, now we got this thing that
has this kind of middle eastern kind

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.360
of drone to it, and it's working.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.700
Okay, we did that.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.880
Then another night it just kept
changing to something else.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.040
And then it turned into a blues and
then it -- I just let it -- I --

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.150
going back to what I said earlier

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:25.460
about you know what certain
people bring to the table.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.900
In my band, I know
how all of them are.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.830
So I can look at my drummer
and say okay, do this,

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.460
and he will play certain
things that I know

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.560 position:56%
that this is going to work out over.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.310
So it just keeps -- I
just keep trying things.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.320
And that's with a lot of songs.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:49.780
Keep trying things until we
settle and find a place for it.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Are you
self-critical as an artist?

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.060
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: After I've
done it, after I go and listen

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.700
to the end product,
then I'm like oh.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I mean,
when you're listening to takes.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.780
What goes through your mind?

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.040
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I
have to really --

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.800
the biggest thing is
I have to really --

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.660
one thing that George taught me is

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.330
when we first started
working together, George Duke,

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:21.230
on my first Blue Note album,
he realized that I was very,

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.520
very critical and was like no.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.930
He said you can't -- there comes
a point where you just have

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:32.120
to just walk away because you
are going to be so critical

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:37.070
that the initial spirit, the
initial idea that you just sang

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:42.070
without thinking which is
the real thing will be gone.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.360
And I thought okay.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:50.210
So I would go in and I would
listen to a take and say okay,

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:54.640
okay and then walk away from it
and come back and hear it in --

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.200
and the next day it would hear --

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.970
I'd hear it in a totally
different way.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.430
And it's like yeah, keep that.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.240
So I started to really
enjoy my choices,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.470
but sometimes it's
really, really hard.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.090
And then at the very
end, I'm like oh.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.420
I have a hard time
listening to myself.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:17.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: As a producer,
was George a first take kind of guy/

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: First three takes.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: First three?

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.530
Because after that you might get
perfection but it's [crosstalk].

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.120
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: And
because he knew who I was,

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.490 position:56%
he knew that she's a live performer.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.490
He understood that.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:35.230
And someone who is a studio
performer it's a totally

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.530
different thing.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.880
But he understood that we have to
get this when she comes in here,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.300
and she's ready and can't
wait to get it down, bam!

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.650
And generally, it would be the
first or second take of a song.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
As a live performer,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.560
do you enjoy having
people in the studio

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.320
with you, like friends and -- ?

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.710
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah,
I really, really do.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.010
I need it.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.840
Just -- and not for
applause, just for energy.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.350
I like having that.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.570
The first live record that I did,

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:09.470
we did it at SIR Studios
in Los Angeles.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:10.940
It was really incredible.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.980
We did it for two nights,
just invited people to come in

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:25.620
and that was just a larger
experience of what I experienced

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:29.500
when I'm doing my records, yeah.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Let's take a
step back [inaudible] a little bit.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.810
I want you to think
about all the songs

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:40.310
that you recorded,
all your recordings.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:44.760
And you think about the
trajectory of your career.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.860
What is the story of your
career in those songs?

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:57.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I think the
biggest story is that I've never had

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.240
to compromise and that in the
very beginning I kind of decided

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.830
that that's what success was
for me because I was asked --

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:16.780
told that you need to define
what success means to you.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:21.130 position:56%
And so for me, music is interesting.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.950
Music saved my life.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.250
And --

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.550
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
What makes you say that?

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.210
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: It
literally saved my life.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:31.870
Coming up in junior high school,

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:36.190
I was a very depressed
kid, very, very depressed.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: In Denver?

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.790
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: In Denver.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:43.080
And just for a lot of reasons that
I won't go into but extremely.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.380
And --

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.850
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Were you a loner?

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:49.820
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I've never
been not so much a loner,

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.480
but I've never been one
to have lots of people,

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.440
only people that I really knew
and it was a small group of people

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.290
that to this day we're
still friends.

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.970
And I was tall for my age.

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.720
I always got criticized about that.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:14.870
My mother would say oh no, you're
statuesque, and I loved that word.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:21.320
And just saw things and felt
things in a different kind of way

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.260
that was different than my peers.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:34.950
And I had a situation where
-- when I was 12 years old,

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.620
I was found under the steps and
never really talked about this.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.500
I was found under the steps
because I tried to commit suicide.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:48.420
And I remember I was
out for three days.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.370
The only time that
I looked up was once

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:54.090 position:56%
to see my mother looking down at me.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:45:00.250
And then through the whole process
of they put you with therapists

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:08.250
and stuff, and I wouldn't -- I
would -- I could not talk to them.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.640
And I guess they said we
have to find another way.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.610
But at the same time, had
this really great teacher,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:19.770
Benny Williams, who was the
choral teacher at our school.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.050
And the other thing was we were
the first kids to be bussed

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:27.410 position:56%
to the school, Hamilton Junior High.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:28.710
And --

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:32.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
this is like early 70's?

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.580
Yeah.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.880
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Late
60's, early 70's.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.620
And I remember she -- to
bring the students together

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.220
because she was the music
teacher, she said I'm going

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:46.610
to bring all this contemporary
music that is happening together

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:51.940
and these kids are going
to sing each other's songs.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.000 position:56%
So we're singing Bob Dillon's songs.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.950
Black kids were singing
Bob Dillon songs.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.790
White kids were singing
Ball of Confusion.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.120
It was just like she mixed
us up and gave us poetry,

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.930
and we wrote our own show.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.670
And it was very empowering.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:15.870
And I had two songs that I
was singing, one with a group,

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:20.130
another song that came out
on the Edwin Hawkins album

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.430
that was Oh Happy Day.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.750
There was a song called Joy.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:29.940
And that song was my
first song that I sang

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:36.970
that I felt something pull my
heart, and when I closed my eyes,

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:42.200
I started to sing it, and something
that connected with people.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.060
And it was really, really powerful.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.910
And it saved my life.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.110 position:56%
And I remember walking down the hall

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:52.550
because my grandmother would
always say don't put all your eggs

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.500
in one basket, but
this felt so right.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.390
I remember saying out loud,
"I'm putting all my eggs

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:02.920
in one basket" walking
past the science room.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:09.350
I can see it as vividly
as when it happened.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:10.950
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
that basket is the world

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.670
of music and creativity?

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.970
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: That
basket was creativity,

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:20.400
the way that I saw what it would
do for me, how it would help me

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.980
and its really, really
served in a lot of ways

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.610
to change a lot of
things in my life.

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.870
People looked at me in
a different kind of way.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:39.900
And then it became a
place to hide behind.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.160
And I started to realize that
there was Dianne Reeves the artist,

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.630
Dianne Reeves the person, and they
really needed to come together

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:51.070
and that's when I did the
Art and Survival album.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:55.280
And that album was when
everything changed,

00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:01.700 position:56%
and it was like it was very
cathartic for me and it was a record

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.230
that wasn't very well received
but those who hear it get it.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:09.860
It was controversial.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:16.200
There were a lot of things, and
it was at a crossroads in my life

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.350
when I was not with Blue
Note, and I was with --

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:24.700
on the other side of the label
trying to get back to Blue Note

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.160
and Bruce -- it's like
a whole bunch of --

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.140
there's a whole big story there.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:35.450
But basically it was the thing that
pushed me through, and it pushed me

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:42.820 position:56%
through because it was what I wanted
to do no matter what happened.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.830
I would suffer whatever
the consequences.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:49.990
And I came up on the other
side still there and still able

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:55.430
and still being able to sing
the music I wanted to sing.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.710
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Have
your feelings about music

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:03.910
and creativity changed
over the years since then?

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.110
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I think
there are certain things.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.830
I think --

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.100
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: For
example, do you ever get jaded

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.500
by the business of music?

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:20.370
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well, yes but
I kind of -- while I was in it,

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.140
I never really was of it.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:26.260
I don't know how to describe that.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:33.960
I always marched to my own
drum, and figured people --

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.200
I didn't sell a lot of records,
but people come to my concerts.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.730
And nobody could really touch that.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:45.450
I know people sign deals now
where all that's included.

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:46.820
But that's mine.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.440
I built that.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:56.090
And so that part was the thing
that allowed me to say well,

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.510
I've seen people feel like
they've been thrown --

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:01.480
that they were thrown
away by record companies

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:06.090
because they weren't selling enough
records and I thought to myself,

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:08.540
I never sell enough records.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.940
But I'm still here.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.930
And I'm still doing
what I love to do

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:16.320
and it still takes
care of my life now.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:22.760
The other side of it is that
I still love to do what I do,

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.590
but I know that it's taken away.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.290
I'm not married.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.410
I have no children.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:32.800
I think about that sometimes,
but I also know about me

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:37.120
that if that's what I chose
to do, I would have done it.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.750
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: There's
a world outside of music.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.050
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Oh yeah.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:42.350
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Maybe
not outside of creativity

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.700
because that's in everything.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.270
What do you like to
do outside of music?

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:54.540
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well, I really
love improvising with food.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.840
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Really?

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.140
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Oh yeah.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.440
I love to cook.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You're a foodie.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.040
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.340
We travel.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.870
People are always introducing
us to new things

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.790
and there are flavors
that I haven't had.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.080
I'll try it and I'll
say what is that?

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.240
Why does it taste this
way or whatever?

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.290
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: What's
your latest obsession?

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:20.060
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well, lately
actually I've just been home

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:24.770
and just eating very,
very, very clean.

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:31.950
I like this whole idea of making
breads out of cauliflower,

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:35.200
figuring out all of
those kinds of things.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.970
But we've been traveling
a great deal.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:43.240
So I will be in the kitchen
this summer because I'm off.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.530
But basically it's like these
really clean kind of dishes

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:50.960
that there's a place at home
called The True Food Kitchen.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.630
I think they have them
different places.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:58.880
And it's a pretty cool place.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.280
The way they make the
food taste is good,

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.260
but I'm like I can make it better.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.560
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
You can [inaudible].

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.860
I know you can.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.620
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: But I like
the idea of having tthis food

00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.470
that is really, really clean
and done in a certain way

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:18.920
that you eat it and you actually
feel energized and good about it.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.610
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I know
you travel all over the world.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:21.910
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:24.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Is there part of
the world you haven't been to yet?

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.090
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I've
never been to India.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.060
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do
you like Indian food?

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.360
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yes.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.450
As a matter of fact, I'm
going tomorrow tonight.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:34.370
A friend of mine was telling me
about a restaurant so we'll go.

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:37.160
But I love Indian food.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:42.620 position:56%
I've never been -- I've been to
lots of places, few places in Africa

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.220
but I've never been to Ghana.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.680
We are going to Kenya next year.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.250
And I've never been to Egypt.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:54.310
So there are a lot of -- and
I've really explored a lot

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:56.250
of South America.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:00.090
So there are a lot of places.

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:03.160
And the odd thing about
that is there's a lot

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.880
of influence in my music from --

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.220
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Oh, very much so.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.560
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: So I've never --
and that's just from the musicians

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.780
that brought the flavor to me.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.730
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: You and I
are basically same generation,

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.810
and I think when we were
coming up and forming some

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:22.530
of our musical taste,
there was a term,

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:24.680 position:56%
a marketing term called world music.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.130
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah.

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And
so is that still a thing?

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.640
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I don't know.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.940
I think now it's global.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.080
Now it's just global.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:38.250
Everybody works with everybody
and goes -- it's just --

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.020
the internet has allowed us

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.830
to make the world smaller
and more accessible.

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:45.140
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do
you stream yourself?

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.930
Do you look at Youtube?

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:48.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah, all of that.

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:49.890
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Is there --

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:56.960
what do you think of the newer
generation of neo soul singers?

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.270
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well,
I don't know.

00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:59.850
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Because you
could do that if you wanted.

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:02.700
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I don't think
they even call themselves neo soul.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:10.160
But they -- it's like all
of these Indie musicians

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.830
and there's this whole
-- and a lot of them come

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.610
out of the hip hop generation.

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:19.630
And that's a whole another way
of listening to things that --

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:21.880 position:56%
I'm still on the outside looking in.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.670
I still -- I love it.

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:27.150
I don't know how they
get to it, some of it.

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:34.210
But I really, really love that it's
new and it's fresh and it's musical

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:38.530
and it's rhythmic and
it expresses poetry

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:42.920
in a totally different kind of way.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I would
imagine that when you were coming up

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.380
and started to make your records
people felt the same way about you.

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.680
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Probably.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.980
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
there's a continuum?

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.280
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Oh
yeah, absolutely.

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.580
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Each
generation discovers.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.880
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Oh God, I'm out.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:03.880
But it's cool because I appreciate
it and I'm surrounded by people

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.080 position:56%
and musicians that appreciated that.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.160
Always still, you look
at people like Herbie

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.800
and Wayne always still
pushing to be --

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:20.370
to understand and be
in the relevant flow.

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Is
recognition important to you?

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:24.710
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: It's cool.

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:30.970
I like that I'm -- in terms of
being able to go out and perform

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:37.910
and other people understand
my work and love it, yeah.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:39.210
It's very important.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:40.540
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do you
work as much as you want?

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.200
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yes, and
I'm off as much as I want.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.500
So that's good.

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:45.800
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
That's a nice balance.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.400
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: And
that's what it is right now.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.780
It's all about balance.

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.700
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: What's --
oh I should probably ask you.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.760
Your last recording won a Grammy.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.060
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Right, right.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
what's the next one?

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.320
How do you follow up on a Grammy?

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.980
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: A Grammy is
something that happens then

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.300
and you're thankful for
it, and you move forward.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:12.750
And not everything gets
a Grammy or a nomination,

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:15.650
but that's not why you do it.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:19.070
I have a project that I
just did in [inaudible].

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:24.110
It's a live record which I'm really
excited about that I produced,

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:29.810
and I love it because it is
really just one performance.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:33.200
It's no mixing of other
performances.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.500
We went in.

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:41.030
We hit it and we have special
guest, [inaudible] on the recording

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:45.390
with my band, Peter Martin,
Reginald Veal, [inaudible]

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:47.410
and [inaudible] on drums.

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:54.830
And we add some new things,
and some things from --

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:59.820
a couple of things from Beautiful
Life, but it's a whole other kind

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:04.130
of feeling and it's very
joyous, and I'm excited about it.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:07.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So speaking
of balance, how do you --

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:12.330
how do you balance being the
artist and also being the producer

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:15.490
where you have to sort of be
detached and make decisions?

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.740
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Well, I
had to do a lot of thinking

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.100
about how I wanted
it to be presented.

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.510
And presented in a way that
my musicians didn't feel

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:29.260 position:56%
like they were really being recorded
and that I didn't feel like --

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:34.570
that I had to tell myself this
is a live recording and you know

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:37.860
that this is the only one
we're going to do so --

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:40.670
but I just had to spend
time and say you know,

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.590 position:56%
I'm not going to over sing, I'm just
going to do my thing and the way

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:50.300
that I did that was did several
group gigs ahead of time on the way

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:55.760
to doing this last gig and
basically it's just all the work,

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.040
the prep work before and it came

00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:04.410
out just the way I wanted
it to or actually better.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:05.710
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: We're
looking forward to it.

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:07.010
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Thank you.

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:08.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Is there a
dream project you have in mind

00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.320
that you haven't done yet?

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.280
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I found a lot
of my dreams have come true.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.780
Some haven't.

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.790
But I found that the things that
I could never even think about --

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.420
never even thought
about that have come

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.930
into my life have been
extraordinary.

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.910
So I'm just open.

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:30.090
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: How about
somebody you haven't worked with

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:32.170
yet that you've always wanted to.

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:34.840
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Some of
those people have passed

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:39.860
on so that's not going
to happen, but no.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:43.350
I'm just open.

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:48.410
When we did the Sing the
Truth project with [inaudible]

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:54.760
and Liz Wright, it was something
that came up, that's a good idea.

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.820
Now we fill in the blanks and make
it and we celebrated Nina Simone,

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.650
and it was an extraordinary
experience

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:04.140 position:56%
with Nina Simone's daughter, Simone.

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.620
And it was really, really great.

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.730
And it wasn't anything
I thought of doing.

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:10.840
But I'm glad that we did.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:15.450
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I would
bet that there are musicians

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:18.000
out there whose dream is
to do something with you.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.300
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: I'm open.

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.030
Yeah, and they call me.

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:25.280
I just did this think
with [inaudible].

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:31.780
He has this new project [inaudible]
coming out, and it was really kind

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.280
of cool because he had me singing.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.580
He called me up.

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.760
He says, "Do you think
you would sing --

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.940
learn the lyrics in [inaudible]?"

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.700
I was like really?

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:47.530
And so right when I know
that I'm going to say no,

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:50.010
I grit my teeth and say yes.

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:51.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Because just pushing on.

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:53.840
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah because
it's going to be interesting.

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.140
I have the time.

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.860
I can -- I said look, I need you
to do this, this, this and this.

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.660
He said okay, and it
was extraordinary.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.960
Had so much fun.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.960
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did you
listen to him teach you the lyric

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.540 position:56%
or did he write it out phonetically?

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: He wrote it for me
phonetically -- no, he wrote it out.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:16.510 position:56%
Just like I wrote it phonetically, I
had him speak the words and send it

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:21.860
to me and then I just
went line by line.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:28.440
It wasn't a whole lot but
it's tonal and rhythmic.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.460
And some of the rhythm I was not --

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.480
I was like I don't
even know where one is.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.360
Still don't, but I realize
learn it like a kindergartner

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.910 position:56%
like you just don't care about that.

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:47.890
It just is, and I did, and
I had so much fun with it.

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:49.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
It's also connecting

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.720
to the real source of music.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.020
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yes.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And that's
where it all comes fromj.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.620
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.220
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: So cool.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.520
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Dianne, it's
always a pleasure to talk to you.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.820
We're looking forward to
your performance tonight.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.120
Continued success.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.420
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Thank
you very much.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.720
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
And all that's to come.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: Thank you so much.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Thank you.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.620
&gt;&gt; Dianne Reeves: All right.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.920
This was good.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.220

of the Library of Congress.
