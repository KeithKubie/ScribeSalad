that's kind of what we do is look at
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.049
that's kind of what we do is look at
data and see what's interesting and this

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
data and see what's interesting and this
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880
data and see what's interesting and this
one was more you know we weren't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
one was more you know we weren't
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580
one was more you know we weren't
searching for this before the question

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
searching for this before the question
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950

are most the the most common day is
Friday which I guess people make sense

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
Friday which I guess people make sense
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.220
Friday which I guess people make sense
because people think it's payday and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
because people think it's payday and
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.660
because people think it's payday and
there's a lot a lot of money coming in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
there's a lot a lot of money coming in
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.920
there's a lot a lot of money coming in
going out but that doesn't necessarily

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
going out but that doesn't necessarily
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.450
going out but that doesn't necessarily
mean you'll be more likely to be

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
mean you'll be more likely to be
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.479
mean you'll be more likely to be
successful on Friday there's really no

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

maybe they just can't get up in the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
maybe they just can't get up in the
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760
maybe they just can't get up in the
morning go to work bank robbery bank

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
morning go to work bank robbery bank
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710
morning go to work bank robbery bank
robbing which means that maybe they

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
robbing which means that maybe they
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.330
robbing which means that maybe they
could get up in the morning early in the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
could get up in the morning early in the
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.560
could get up in the morning early in the
first place they wouldn't have to resort

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
first place they wouldn't have to resort
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.890

never is the right answer because the
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330
never is the right answer because the
ROI or the return on investment on bank

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

to become a criminal bank robbery is a

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
to become a criminal bank robbery is a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
robbery in the in the UK it's
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240
robbery in the in the UK it's
substantially more so you could consider

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250
substantially more so you could consider
 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580
substantially more so you could consider
that and you're likely to get arrested

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
that and you're likely to get arrested
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.639
that and you're likely to get arrested
after just three bank robberies and sent

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
after just three bank robberies and sent
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.170
after just three bank robberies and sent

dreadful and then one other tangent that
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770
dreadful and then one other tangent that
we got involved with on this and looking

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.940
know internal inside jobs and when the
most interesting ones we came across was

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
most interesting ones we came across was
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.610
most interesting ones we came across was
a woman in Iowa who for years

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
a woman in Iowa who for years
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.020
a woman in Iowa who for years
years and years had been embezzling

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030

money from a bank about two million
 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.979
money from a bank about two million
dollars worth and it was actually the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989

bank was actually owned the president of

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
bank was actually owned the president of
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.729
bank was actually owned the president of
Bank was her father interestingly so I

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
Bank was her father interestingly so I
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.530
Bank was her father interestingly so I
don't know what the dynamics were there

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540
don't know what the dynamics were there
 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.229
don't know what the dynamics were there
she was finally caught and it turns out

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239
she was finally caught and it turns out
 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.580
she was finally caught and it turns out
that she had kept two sets of books

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
that she had kept two sets of books
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.380
that she had kept two sets of books
which is kind of how you want to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
which is kind of how you want to
 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.380
which is kind of how you want to
embezzle and she was exhausted when she

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390
embezzle and she was exhausted when she
 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.640
embezzle and she was exhausted when she
was caught the reason she was exhausted

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650
was caught the reason she was exhausted
 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.830
was caught the reason she was exhausted
because she'd worked so hard she'd never

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
because she'd worked so hard she'd never
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.289
because she'd worked so hard she'd never
taken a vacation over all those years

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299
taken a vacation over all those years
 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.960
taken a vacation over all those years
and the reason was that she was scared

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
and the reason was that she was scared
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.000
and the reason was that she was scared
too so she took a vacation someone would

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
too so she took a vacation someone would
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.009
too so she took a vacation someone would
find that she'd been keeping two sets of

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019
find that she'd been keeping two sets of
 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.630
find that she'd been keeping two sets of
books and she would have been found out

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
books and she would have been found out
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.800
books and she would have been found out
so it was interesting as she went to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
