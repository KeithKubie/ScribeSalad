00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
 

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:08.960
We have the equation negative 5x
plus 4y is equal to 20, and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.820
we're told to find the
intercepts of this equation.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.500
So we have to find the
intercepts and then use the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.310
intercepts to graph this line
on the coordinate plane.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.850
So then graph the line.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.120
So whenever someone talks about
intercepts, they're

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.330
talking about where you're
intersecting

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.970
the x and the y-axes.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.880
So let me label my axes here, so
this is the x-axis and that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.120
is the y-axis there.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.290
And when I intersect the x-axis,
what's going on?

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.010
What is my y value when
I'm at the x-axis?

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.660
Well, my y value is 0, I'm not
above or below the x-axis.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.100
Let me write this down.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.600
The x-intercept is when y
is equal to 0, right?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.300
And then by that same
argument, what's the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.550
y-intercept?

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.570
 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.860
Well, if I'm somewhere along the
y-axis, what's my x value?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.390
Well, I'm not to the right or
the left, so my x value has to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.990
be 0, so the y-intercept occurs
when x is equal to 0.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.680
So to figure out the intercepts,
let's set y equal

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.800
to 0 in this equation and solve
for x, and then let's

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.670
set x is equal to 0 and
then solve for y.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.780
So when y is equal to 0, what
does this equation become?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.900
I'll do it in orange.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.710
You get negative 5x plus 4y.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.840
Well we're saying y is 0, so
4 times 0 is equal to 20.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.000
4 times 0 is just 0, so we
can just not write that.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.800
So let me just rewrite it.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.480
So we have negative
5x is equal to 20.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.740
We can divide both sides of this
equation by negative 5.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.510
 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.780
The negative 5 cancel out,
that was the whole point

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.360
behind dividing by negative 5,
and we get x is equal to 20

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.970
divided by negative
5 is negative 4.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.510
So when y is equal to 0, we
saw that right there, x is

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.920
equal to negative 4.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.685
Or if we wanted to plot that
point, we always put the x

00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:21.050
coordinate first, so that
would be the point

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.650
negative 4 comma 0.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.580
So let me graph that.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.330
So if we go 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.950
That's a negative 4.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.260
And then the y value is
just 0, so that point

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.130
is right over there.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.270
That is the x-intercept, y
is 0, x is negative 4.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.200
Notice we're intersecting
the x-axis.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.470
Now let's do the exact same
thing for the y-intercept.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.015
Let's set x equal to 0, so if
we set x is equal to 0, we

00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:54.830
have negative 5 times 0 plus
4y is equal to 20.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.730
Well, anything times 0 is
0, so we can just put

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.560
that out of the way.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.760
And remember, this was setting
x is equal to 0, we're doing

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.290
the y-intercept now.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.610
So this just simplifies
to 4y is equal to 20.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.610
We can divide both sides of this
equation by 4 to get rid

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.730
of this 4 right there, and you
get y is equal to 20 over 4,

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.670
which is 5.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.550
So when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 5.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.410
So the point 0, 5 is on the
graph for this line.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.840
So 0, 5.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.550
x is 0 and y is 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, right over there.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.090
And notice, when x is 0, we're
right on the y-axis, this is

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.440
our y-intercept right
over there.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.090
And if we graph the line, all
you need is two points to

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.120
graph any line, so we just have
to connect the dots and

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.160
that is our line.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.700
So let me connect the dots,
trying my best to draw as

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.890
straight of a line is I can--
well, I can do a better job

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.860
than that-- to draw as straight
of a line as I can.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.500
And that's the graph of this
equation using the x-intercept

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.920
and the y-intercept.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.733
