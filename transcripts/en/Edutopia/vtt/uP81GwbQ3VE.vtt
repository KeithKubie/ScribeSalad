00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:21.806
[Engine starting].

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:23.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Look at
the thing roll, baby.

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:25.956
Smooth as a baby's bottom.

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:29.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For the past five
years, high schools from the islands

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:32.586
of Hawaii have designed and
built exotic electric vehicles,

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:35.136
and raced them in the
Electron Marathon.

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:38.526
The team from the West
Hawaii Explorations Academy

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:41.956
on the Big Island, has won the
race twice, and was gunning

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:44.976
for another title in 2001.

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:48.346
&gt;&gt;I'm driving it on our test
road, and to give you an idea

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:51.926
of what it's like,
bumpy, it's a little warm,

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:54.846
it's like a greenhouse in here.

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:57.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each team
receives a kit with parts

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.006
like electric motors,
chains and sprockets.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:03.456
They have to supply their own
batteries and other parts,

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:07.626
and can only spend 2,500 dollars
to design and build their car.

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:11.326
&gt;&gt;Quinn: This wheel is
mostly made by WHEA students.

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:12.446
We didn't make the spokes,

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:17.246
the nipples which are the little
spoke nuts, or the rim, however,

00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:23.356
we did make the hub out of billet
aluminum rod, and then I assembled--

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:27.936
I put the spokes onto the rim and
tightened it all and trued it,

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:30.326
so it's all balanced,
so it won't wobble.

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:32.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The electric
car project is one

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:35.856
of five different projects
Quinn is involved with at WHEA.

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:38.256
&gt;&gt;Quinn: I enjoy having
a choice in what I do.

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:41.886
It's not just work sheets every
day, or something like that,

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:46.206
it's hands on, and it's fun stuff,
and it's good skills to have, also.

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:49.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One of WHEA's
secret weapons is Bill McKown,

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:53.526
a retired food executive who came up
with the idea for the granola bar.

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:55.166
&gt;&gt;Quinn: Why is it
sparking like that?

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.366
&gt;&gt;Bill: The capacitor is filling up.

00:01:57.636 --> 00:02:01.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: McKown now serves as
a mentor on several WHEA projects.

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:04.626
&gt;&gt;Bill: I got into helping out
the students with some projects,

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:10.216
and the main one that we do right
now, is an electric car project,

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:14.016
which sort of fits my background,
so it's very enjoyable for me,

00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:17.716
to be able to give back some
of the skills that I have.

00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:19.196
&gt;&gt;Quinn: This isn't really warm, so--

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:21.806
&gt;&gt;Bill: Yeah, right, but it
shouldn't be warm back here.

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:26.266
&gt;&gt;It's a very enjoyable thing to
be of service to other people,

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.926
and I find it hard to
imagine anything else

00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:30.756
that could be more
enjoyable, frankly.

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:33.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to
designing and building their cars,

00:02:34.056 --> 00:02:37.986
each team must design and build a
website which accounts for 30 percent

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:39.346
of the team's total score.

00:02:41.076 --> 00:02:43.306
They also have to give
an oral presentation

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:44.706
of the car building project.

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:48.716
Team members must answer one of three
questions they've drawn at random.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.816
&gt;&gt;Student: There's three questions.

00:02:50.876 --> 00:02:54.066
The first one is, what was the most
difficult problem, how was it solved?

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:55.786
The second one is, explain how math,

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:58.516
science and language arts
were integrated, and lastly,

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:00.726
what was the good and
bad of working together

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:07.266
and how did it help or hurt the team?

00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:10.856
&gt;&gt;Announcer: The drivers are
psyched, the cars are ready,

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.496
so let's take a look at the field.

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:15.616
Car 911 is Castle High School.

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:17.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The race,
which featured 20 entrants,

00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:21.076
is an energy efficiency
competition, rewarding the car

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.186
that completes the most laps.

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:26.876
&gt;&gt;Announcer: And Car Number Three,
is West Hawaii Explorations Academy.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:30.986
The drivers are ready, the green
flag is out, and the race is on.

00:03:31.286 --> 00:03:34.276
Waialua pulls out immediately
and leaves everyone in the dust.

00:03:34.706 --> 00:03:38.976
Here comes Mid Pac, Car 11, and
Waiakea, Car 10, Castle in yellow,

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:41.356
then Kahuku, and finally, Kohala.

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:43.746
Amazing difference in body design.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the middle of
the race, it began to rain,

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:49.966
but the weather didn't
deter the WHEA car,

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:54.826
or the little green
machine from Kohala.

00:03:56.306 --> 00:03:59.966
When the WHEA car pulled into the
pits for the mandatory driver change,

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.416
they discovered they
had some brake problems.

00:04:02.916 --> 00:04:03.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Brake pod.

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:05.406
No, it's--

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:09.316
&gt;&gt;Student: Take the outside
curve like you taught us, okay?

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.916
Russell, watch this turn.

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:13.706
Go way to the outside.

00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:15.026
&gt;&gt;Announcer: At the 40 minute mark,

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:18.216
Sacred Heart has abandoned its
body and left it in the pit.

00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:22.386
They thought their body was rubbing
on something and slowing them down.

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:25.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the end, West Hawaii's
sleek red machine fell four laps

00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:28.336
short of the green
bug from Kohala High,

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:32.116
but the WHEA team will
be back next year

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:34.976
on a mission to recapture the cup.

00:04:35.146 --> 00:04:36.106
&gt;&gt;Quinn: I feel that we've learned

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:38.186
from our mistakes from
last year's race.

00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:40.056
We're going to work
on the car a lot more,

00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:42.196
do the documentation a lot more,

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:43.956
and we're really raring
to get first place.

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:47.976
I really think we can do it.
