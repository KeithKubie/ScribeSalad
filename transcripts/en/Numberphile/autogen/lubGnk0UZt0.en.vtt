now let's draw three circles and generic

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070
now let's draw three circles and generic
 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.100
now let's draw three circles and generic
circles that are separated like this in

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110
circles that are separated like this in
 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.740
circles that are separated like this in
space given a pair of circles for

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
space given a pair of circles for
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.980
space given a pair of circles for
example large and middle you can draw a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
example large and middle you can draw a
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.839
example large and middle you can draw a
common tangent to those two circles like

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
common tangent to those two circles like
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.599
common tangent to those two circles like
so and like so to be precise we are

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
so and like so to be precise we are
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.849
so and like so to be precise we are
drawing two outer tangents because you

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
drawing two outer tangents because you
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.279
drawing two outer tangents because you
can cross these like this a tangent and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
can cross these like this a tangent and
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.320
can cross these like this a tangent and
tangent to the inner tangents that cross

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
tangent to the inner tangents that cross
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210
tangent to the inner tangents that cross
but let's talk about the outer tangents

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
but let's talk about the outer tangents
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130
but let's talk about the outer tangents
and those two other tangents be these

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
and those two other tangents be these
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.290
and those two other tangents be these

surface like this which sort of expands
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.960
surface like this which sort of expands
and which so the shrink shrink shrink to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
and which so the shrink shrink shrink to
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.720
and which so the shrink shrink shrink to
a tip and if you look at that picture

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
a tip and if you look at that picture
 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.300
a tip and if you look at that picture
from above you see what we saw before

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310
from above you see what we saw before
 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.520
from above you see what we saw before
that is two circles and pair of common

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530
that is two circles and pair of common
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.250
that is two circles and pair of common
tangent lines and the tip so you can

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
tangent lines and the tip so you can
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.400
tangent lines and the tip so you can
interpret that picture as actually a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
interpret that picture as actually a
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.990
interpret that picture as actually a
three-dimensional picture but see in two

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000
three-dimensional picture but see in two
 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
three-dimensional picture but see in two
dimensional appearance okay and because

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010
dimensional appearance okay and because
 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.460
dimensional appearance okay and because
there are three balls large and middle

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470
there are three balls large and middle
 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.620

will have a cone and the tip middle and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630
will have a cone and the tip middle and
 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.230
will have a cone and the tip middle and
small will have a cone and tip and small

small will have a cone and tip and small
 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.140
small will have a cone and tip and small
and large cone on tip you have three

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
and large cone on tip you have three
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.500
and large cone on tip you have three
tips of those three cones on the other

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
tips of those three cones on the other
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.990
tips of those three cones on the other
hand please imagine again those three

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000
hand please imagine again those three
 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.390
hand please imagine again those three
spheres sitting on a common floor and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400
spheres sitting on a common floor and
 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.740
spheres sitting on a common floor and
now if you please take a transparent

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
now if you please take a transparent
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.590
now if you please take a transparent
ceiling from above and just tilt it tilt

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600
ceiling from above and just tilt it tilt
 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.770
ceiling from above and just tilt it tilt
it and just lower it so that it touches

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780
it and just lower it so that it touches
 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.990
it and just lower it so that it touches
those three spheres at the same time

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000
those three spheres at the same time
 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.030
those three spheres at the same time
from above you have to tilt it yeah it's

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040
from above you have to tilt it yeah it's
 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.110
from above you have to tilt it yeah it's
not you can't be horizontal you have

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
not you can't be horizontal you have
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.300
not you can't be horizontal you have
thetan it touches those three spheres at

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310
thetan it touches those three spheres at
 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.580
thetan it touches those three spheres at
the same time so you have now a ceiling

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
the same time so you have now a ceiling
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.190
the same time so you have now a ceiling
which touches those three spheres from

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200
which touches those three spheres from
 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.410
which touches those three spheres from
above and the flow which touches those

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420
above and the flow which touches those
 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.540
above and the flow which touches those
three spheres from below each of those

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550
three spheres from below each of those
 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.550
three spheres from below each of those
cones that we talked about for example

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560
cones that we talked about for example
 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.949
cones that we talked about for example
this cone between large and middle fear

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959
this cone between large and middle fear
 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.820
this cone between large and middle fear
well it's touching this ceiling and the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830
well it's touching this ceiling and the
 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.250
well it's touching this ceiling and the
floor at the same time this cone so the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260
floor at the same time this cone so the
 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.610
floor at the same time this cone so the
tip of this cone is inside the ceiling

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
tip of this cone is inside the ceiling
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.560
tip of this cone is inside the ceiling
and inside the floor at the same time

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570
and inside the floor at the same time
 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.500
and inside the floor at the same time
okay and the same goes for the other two

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510
okay and the same goes for the other two
 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.610
okay and the same goes for the other two
tips so all those tips of the cones in

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620
tips so all those tips of the cones in
 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.800
tips so all those tips of the cones in
the top plane that is the ceiling and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810
the top plane that is the ceiling and
 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.600
the top plane that is the ceiling and
the bottom plane that is floor at the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610
the bottom plane that is floor at the
 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.220
the bottom plane that is floor at the
same time but you know those two planes

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
same time but you know those two planes
 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.340
same time but you know those two planes
in space intersect along a straight line

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350
in space intersect along a straight line
 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.280
in space intersect along a straight line
so we have just shown that those tips of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290
so we have just shown that those tips of
 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.710
so we have just shown that those tips of
cones along a straight line and which

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720
cones along a straight line and which
 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.120
cones along a straight line and which
what is that straight line it's the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130
what is that straight line it's the
 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.560
what is that straight line it's the
intersection of the ceiling that we put

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570
intersection of the ceiling that we put
 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.500
intersection of the ceiling that we put
from above and the flow on which you put

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510
from above and the flow on which you put
 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.790
from above and the flow on which you put
the bolts and if you look at that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800
the bolts and if you look at that
 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.040
the bolts and if you look at that
picture from above you see this picture

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050
picture from above you see this picture
 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.010
picture from above you see this picture
so that dotted line is the intersection

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020
so that dotted line is the intersection
 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.440
so that dotted line is the intersection
of the seedings which is tipping like

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450
of the seedings which is tipping like
 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.450
of the seedings which is tipping like
that and then the flow which is

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460
that and then the flow which is
 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.580
that and then the flow which is
supporting the thing

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590
supporting the thing
 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.340
supporting the thing
you know you can also see a cartoon you

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350
you know you can also see a cartoon you
 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.050
you know you can also see a cartoon you
just lift this and and that's the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060
just lift this and and that's the
 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.300
just lift this and and that's the
seeding pie primetime you know then the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310
seeding pie primetime you know then the
 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.860
seeding pie primetime you know then the
flow is pie and then the common cone

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870
flow is pie and then the common cone
 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.300
flow is pie and then the common cone
tangent cone to these two spheres is

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310
tangent cone to these two spheres is
 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.700
tangent cone to these two spheres is
like that and tip is lying in the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710
like that and tip is lying in the
 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.290
like that and tip is lying in the
intersection intersecting line between

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300
intersection intersecting line between
 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.890
intersection intersecting line between
the ceiling and the floor okay so by

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900
the ceiling and the floor okay so by
 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.409
the ceiling and the floor okay so by
lifting the this complicated problem to

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419
lifting the this complicated problem to
 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.450
lifting the this complicated problem to
the third dimension the problem goes

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460
the third dimension the problem goes
 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.730
the third dimension the problem goes
away in fact if you look at it the right

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740
away in fact if you look at it the right
 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.620
away in fact if you look at it the right
way you know there used to be one of

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630
way you know there used to be one of
 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.780
way you know there used to be one of
those interesting pictures where you

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790
those interesting pictures where you
 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.810
those interesting pictures where you
look at it with some out-of-focus sight

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820
look at it with some out-of-focus sight
 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.420
look at it with some out-of-focus sight
suddenly it jumps out to you into a 3d

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430
suddenly it jumps out to you into a 3d
 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.129
suddenly it jumps out to you into a 3d
and it's a bit reckless if you look at

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139
and it's a bit reckless if you look at
 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.379
and it's a bit reckless if you look at
it the right way you can start seeing it

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389
it the right way you can start seeing it
 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.640
it the right way you can start seeing it
like a three-dimensional picture and

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650
like a three-dimensional picture and
 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.860
like a three-dimensional picture and
then the theorem is clear there is no

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870
then the theorem is clear there is no
 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.960
then the theorem is clear there is no
problem I mean of course these three

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970
problem I mean of course these three
 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.340
problem I mean of course these three
points must be on the same line because

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350
points must be on the same line because
 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.999
points must be on the same line because
that's how I see

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009
 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.489
this is actually a sequel to a previous
