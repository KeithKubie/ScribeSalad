00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.115
So we learned something really cool

00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:08.551
and we ask ourselves, shall we fake or not fake our data?

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:10.536
I'm not so sure.

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:16.040
When the data is scarse, I believe faking it gives you a better result.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.695
It is unreasonable to assume that after a single coin flip

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:22.758
you know the exact probability and it's either 0 or 1.

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:25.388
It's much more reasonable to say we don't know yet

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:29.083
and take a more caution 2/3 or 1/3 as a probability.

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:35.678
So obvioulsy I've shown to you that even under very very very simple methods

00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:40.884
faking it might be justified and in fact give you better results.

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:44.884
That blows my mind.
