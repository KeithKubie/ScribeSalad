00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.489
 I think games are a powerful medium in others. 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.680
 Their impact becomes more powerful when events revolve around reality 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.790
 And about the events of our daily lives. 

00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:17.018
 This is what we tried to do in Bury me, my Love. 

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:25.835
 I worked as a journalist for 10 years and I was passionate about video games all my life 

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.045
 One day, I had an idea 

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:31.646
 It's about creating video games about real life. 

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:36.226
 From this idea, she specialized in video game development. 

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:41.368
 One day, I read an article in <i>Le Monde</i> 

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:44.108
 The article was written by a French journalist called "Lucy Solier" 

00:00:44.108 --> 00:00:47.838
 It was about a young Syrian immigrant named "Dana" 

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:52.438
 And continued contact with family members thanks to her smartphone. 

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:57.248
 Nowadays, most migrants acquire smart phones 

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:59.778
 This is not for the sake of luxury, but for communication with 

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.568
 Friends and family in the same way 

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:05.098
 Which I communicate with my friends or my mother. 

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.548
 I was very touched by this article, so I saw 

00:01:07.548 --> 00:01:10.738
 They fit a lot as an idea for a realistic game. 

00:01:13.587 --> 00:01:15.897
 So I met the journalist who helped us 

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:18.517
 To communicate with Dana, which we reported 

00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:22.517
 Much in developing a realistic game involves an impressive message. 

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.927
 Did you see the boat inside 

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:26.837
 Or were there too many people inside? 

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:30.837
 There were so many people, but the smugglers organized our way of sitting 

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:34.837
 We could not stand. Only managed to see people and sky 

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:38.577
 And how far we are from Turkey. 

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:41.477
 This must have been terrible. 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.410
 After Lucy and Dana collaborated with us, I realized we would have it 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.140
 Valuable information that enables us to correctly recount the events of this story. 

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.103
 The story of Bury me, my Love about the couple "Nour" and "glory" 

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:57.223
 Who split because Noor wanted to leave Syria 

00:01:57.223 --> 00:02:00.563
 And access to safety in Europe, while Majd could not take her. 

00:02:00.563 --> 00:02:03.643
 Mobile phone is their only way to communicate with each other. 

00:02:03.643 --> 00:02:08.093
 Will begin to play the role of "glory" to provide help and advice to "Nour" 

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.093
 In the best possible way so that it can reach its destination safely. 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.359
 We took great advantage of what Dana told us and drew inspiration from her 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.299
 We wanted to tell thousands of stories 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.099
 And the reference to thousands of places where thousands of people migrate 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.699
 From different places to reach safety. 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.569
 I was also very impressed when I visited the refugee center 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.609
 To learn the details of the lives of these refugees. 

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:40.862
 No doubt, we were thrilled when we won the Google Play Independent Gaming Contest 

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:43.882
 I felt the gratitude to all the members of the team and everyone 

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:46.102
 Participate in the development of the game. 

00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:52.292
 The most important reason for my happiness is that the game carries a message. 

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:56.292
 If you create a game that simulates real life on highly sensitive subjects 

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:59.927
 You will inevitably find out who is appreciated by experienced experts 

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:05.057
 Who will tell you that they are dazzled by your new idea. 

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:12.046
 I hope that other developers will know that and follow the same path. 

00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:17.145
 I do not know whether the game has contributed to changing the attitude of others toward immigrants. 

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:21.115
 I am not a humanitarian activist, but I hope that immigrants will receive the sympathy and care of everyone. 

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:28.525
 My first goal is to create a game, tell a story, and not change people's attitudes towards certain topics.
