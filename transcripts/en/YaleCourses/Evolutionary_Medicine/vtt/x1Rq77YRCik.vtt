WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.550
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.240
<v 1>As we saw in the last lectures is human spread out across the planet,</v>

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.590
the encountered different diseases and that resulted in genetic variation for

4
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:10.490
disease resistance,

5
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:14.750
but they also encountered different diets that contain different nutrients and

6
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:17.120
different toxins is a result,

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.800
patients very genetically in their ability to metabolize drugs because of their

8
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.420
recent evolutionary history.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.080
The area of science that studies this is pharmacogenomics and it's idea

10
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.840
basically is to analyze how much does individual human genetic variation affect

11
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.210
our ability to metabolize drugs.

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.450
It arose because we got a very serious signal in the late 1950s and

13
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:51.521
antidiarrheal drug called Cleo all was tested and found safe on Europeans and

14
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.700
then without testing it on Japanese,

15
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.450
it was released in Japan and it killed some hospitalized,

16
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:04.451
many possibly an interaction with environmental problems in that post World War

17
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.390
II environment,

18
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.590
but very likely primarily because the Japanese different genetically from the

19
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:10.424
Europeans.

20
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.040
<v 1>Individual and Inter ethnic variation and Cytochrome p four fifties these are</v>

22
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:21.041
called sips and in an asset deal transfer races in 1977 and 1953 in both cases,

23
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:26.870
that was initially found through adverse drug reactions.

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.160
So patients suffered and people wondered why and did detective work,

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.370
<v 0>okay,</v>

26
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.550
<v 1>no,
we have information on human genomes and that's being used to find the legals</v>

27
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.650
and to predict variation in drug response using more sophisticated computer

28
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:42.730
modeling techniques.

29
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.670
<v 1>The same gene products that metabolize drugs are also involved in processing</v>

31
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.010
toxins in food.
In fact,
that's why they initially evolved.

32
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.500
<v 1>And they process smoke and all the byproducts of other carcinogenic substances</v>

34
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.930
and are thus involved in the mechanisms that elicit cancer and shape the

35
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.150
evolution of its resistance to drugs.

36
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.610
So this is not just about how well the patient's process drugs,

37
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:18.320
it's also about how likely are they to get cancer and if they get it,

38
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.630
how likely are we to be able to treat it?

39
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.570
<v 1>Now patients vary in their drug response for many reasons.</v>

41
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.410
And only some of those reasons are genetics.

42
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:32.780
So they vary in drug response because they are different ages,

43
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:37.340
genders,
ethnic background,
weight,
family history,

44
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.870
what the time of day affects it.
Uh,

45
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.430
their microbiota affected.
And also there can be placebo effects.

46
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.640
Those are clinical reasons.
And then in the environment,

47
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:51.680
it depends on how well nourished they are,

48
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.700
what other drugs they might be taking because there are drug drug interactions,

49
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.000
there are chemical exposures,
their lifestyle,

50
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.210
they are a drinker or a smoker,
uh,
and how compliant they are.

51
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.240
All of these feed together to produce a particular dynamic or kinetic of the

52
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:15.391
drug in the body and that leads to a particular intensity and duration of drug

53
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:22.261
response which can have a therapeutic effect and can also produce an adverse

54
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.710
reaction or toxicity.

55
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
There are two main classes of enzymes that are involved in drug response,

56
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.820
the first of which are the cytochrome p four 15 these are heme file late

57
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.821
proteins and their significance in processing toxins and now drugs is indicated

58
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:49.591
by the fact that these are families of genes that exist in many copies and the

59
00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:53.770
they evolve by repeated duplication.

60
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.000
They are proteins that are bound to a heme group and their color and their

61
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.620
absorption peak,
which is about 450 nanometers.
Give them their name.

62
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:07.090
That's why they're called cytochromes
and humans.

63
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.790
We have 57 of these chains.

64
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.200
They are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and to the inner mitochondrial

65
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:15.034
membrane.

66
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.490
They mediate our response to toxins and to steroids as well as other reactions.

67
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.850
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

68
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.850
<v 1>there were 23 genes in the first three families and they account for about 75%</v>

69
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.980
of human drug metabolism.

70
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.700
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

71
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.350
<v 1>we're going to focus just on one of them.</v>

72
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:40.090
It's called sip two d six cytochrome p four 52 d six.

73
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.200
This is what a representative cytochrome looks like.

74
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:49.201
It has to heme groups here in here and life is using these heme groups to

75
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:51.880
manipulate oxygen precisely.

76
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.480
So you can think of Cytochrome p four 50s as being surgical specialists in

77
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:00.520
dealing with oxygenation reactions,

78
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.460
which in chemical formula will look like this.

79
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:09.780
You'll have some molecule and you can add in the presence of a cofactor,

80
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.940
uh,
an oxygen to it.

81
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.480
You can then produce a hydroxyl radical and water.

82
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.890
Now cytochrome p Two d six is clinically important because of its variation.

83
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.690
It was discovered in a case in London in 1977 there was a volunteer who had a

84
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:39.110
hypotensive response.
So low blood pressure,
too deep,
too deep.

85
00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:41.580
Brisa Queen.
That's an antihypertensive.

86
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.080
And then another evolve volunteer in Bonn had increased side effects,

87
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.920
uh,
taking spartina which is anti arrhythmic.

88
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.910
So both of these were related to variation and sip two D six.

89
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.810
It is now known to be involved in adverse or decreased drug effects for many

90
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.030
drugs.
Antiarrhythmics,
antidepressants,
Dura,
elliptics,

91
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.390
anti and journals,

92
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.860
opioids and Pheta means and anticancer drugs like Tamoxifen.

93
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.800
So this is an extremely important mediator of the patient's ability to respond

94
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.420
constructively to drug therapy.

95
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.830
The percentage of poor metabolizers,
you know,
the jargon in,

96
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:26.450
in this area of science as a PM for poor metabolizer,

97
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.940
very strikingly among ethnic groups.

98
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.580
So here's some ethnic variation and sip two d six the ones here in this gray

99
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.020
region are not functional.

100
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.620
Basically what you can see here is that people who are of African American

101
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:47.711
ethnicity or most of them have a much higher frequency of uh,

102
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.011
Elio,

103
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:54.011
one then do people of East Asian ethnicity and American whites also share that

104
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.620
with Africans.

105
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.100
However other Europeans have lower frequencies of that then do east Asians.

106
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.720
So there's quite a bit of ethnic variation.

107
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:13.721
And and the the point here really is individual humans differ tremendously in

108
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:19.970
the probability that you'll have a variant of this particular enzyme.

109
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.770
Now why is that important?
Well,

110
00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:26.440
it can vary from two to three copies per individual.

111
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.580
In metabolizes about a quarter of all of the drugs on the market,

112
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.660
it's polymorphisms influence about 12 to 14% of all drug metabolism and that

113
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:42.100
includes antidepressants,
antiarrhythmics,
anticancer drugs and analgesics.

114
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.860
Duplications reduce the efficacy of drugs that treat a rhythmia,

115
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.780
Alzheimer's and heroin addiction,

116
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:52.330
but they improved Tomoxifen and treatment of breast cancer.

117
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.100
As a result of those facts.

118
00:07:57.101 --> 00:08:01.840
The drug industry now tries to avoid developing drugs that are metabolized by

119
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:06.100
this enzyme because they cannot predict how individuals will react to it.

120
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.530
It has a direct impact on drug rehabilitation to other cytochrome p four 53 a

121
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:20.701
four and two B six o have variants that cause great very individual variation in

122
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:26.110
how much methadone you need to give a patient to achieve a given blood

123
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:31.111
concentration of that drug to obtain up methadone plasma concentration of 250

124
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:34.240
nanograms per milliliter.

125
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.020
A dose of Methadone is low as 55 milligrams per day or as high as 921 milligrams

126
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:44.380
per day can be required in a 70 kilogram patient.

127
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.980
That's more than 16 fold variation in dose and it's caused by variation in these

128
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:51.940
genetic polymorphisms.

129
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:55.060
It depends on which of those genes that particular patient has.

130
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.400
There is a another very important set of enzymes that are involved in drug

131
00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:05.530
metabolism and those are the NSF.
He'll transfer races.

132
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:10.770
There are two of them in a t one and an 82 they activate and deactivate both

133
00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:16.921
drugs and carcinogens and they are active mostly in the liver site is all,

134
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.000
so they are part of the metabolic machinery that makes the liver is such an

135
00:09:22.001 --> 00:09:24.640
important part of cleansing our body.

136
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

137
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.310
<v 1>Different Elios combined to produce rapid intermediate or slow acetylator</v>

138
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.184
phenotypes.

139
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.590
They were discovered in 1953 in patients who are being treated for tuberculosis

140
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.330
with a drug called ISO Niacin.

141
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.760
The drugs that they metabolize include sulfonamides many other drugs and the

142
00:09:45.761 --> 00:09:47.200
metabolites of caffeine,

143
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.260
so people vary in their reactivity to coffee and tea because of genetic

144
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:55.360
variation.
In an NSF deal.
Transfer races.

145
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

146
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:01.230
<v 1>Europeans and North Americans are about 22 to 26% fast to settle.</v>

147
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:06.231
Laters and East Asians are 67 to 74% fastest subtle layers.

148
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.150
So ethnicity is giving an indication,

149
00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:15.151
but not a precise read on the probability that a patient will be either a fast

150
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.190
or a slow acetylator.

151
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

152
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.080
<v 1>This is what the molecule looks like.</v>

153
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.680
It's movable parts are in red.

154
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:30.681
That indicates the the part of the molecule which is going to be adjusting to

155
00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:31.824
the substrate.

156
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

157
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.500
<v 1>There is important genetic variation associated with cancer susceptibility.</v>

158
00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:40.180
There are two major associations.

159
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.990
One is that the impact of an environmental toxin on cancer risk depends on which

160
00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:51.631
genetic variant one has for an asset transfer race and the other is that the

161
00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:57.001
ability of a cancer cone to resist chemotherapy depends both on the genetic

162
00:10:58.151 --> 00:11:02.020
variant it inherited from the germ line and shares with the other cells of the

163
00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:02.854
body,

164
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.570
but also on what somatic mutations it has acquired during the development and

165
00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:09.280
the clonal evolution of the cancer.

166
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:11.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

167
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.850
<v 1>Here are a few examples of how an asset he'll transfer races interact with the</v>

168
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:22.920
environment to determine cancer risk for bladder cancer.

169
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.130
The Nat two slow acetylator acetylators are about one and a half times more

170
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:30.030
likely to get bladder cancer.

171
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:35.031
And those that have a combination of any two slow with nat fast and current or

172
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:41.751
ever cigarette smoking are nearly three times 2.73 times more likely to get

173
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:43.314
bladder cancer.

174
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.580
So here are the interaction effects between the genes and between the genes and

175
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:52.170
the environment are both important
for colorectal cancer.

176
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.200
One of the most important cancers that hits people as they age and a t one fast

177
00:11:58.881 --> 00:12:02.890
acetylators have significantly higher risk of colorectal cancer than did the

178
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:07.891
slowest scintillators and smoking intensity increased colorectal cancer risk

179
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:12.850
among carriers have both in 81 and eight and an 82 fastest laters

180
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:14.763
<v 0>yeah.</v>

181
00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.200
<v 1>For pancreatic cancer,
one of the Nastiest,
uh,</v>

182
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.060
cancers and one that can produce devastating metastasis.

183
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.440
And 81 polymorphism interacts with dietary Mutagen in intake and increases the

184
00:12:29.781 --> 00:12:32.630
risk of about 2.2 to 2.5 times.

185
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.940
And it does so in men but not in women.

186
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.310
So you can see that the genetic variation is interacting both with environment

187
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.990
and with gender to produce different profiles of cancer risk,

188
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.860
both because these molecules are involved in detoxification of things that could

189
00:12:53.211 --> 00:12:54.110
induce cancer,

190
00:12:54.111 --> 00:12:58.550
but also because these molecules are involved in how well the cancer cells

191
00:12:58.551 --> 00:13:00.980
themselves can resist chemotherapy.

192
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.370
There is also genetic variation as I've mentioned to chemotherapy,

193
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.430
so all cells in the cancer share the genetic capacity to process drugs with the

194
00:13:18.211 --> 00:13:20.550
abilities that the healthy cells in the body have.

195
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.400
And so patients can begin life with different potential responses down the line

196
00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:30.450
to chemotherapy for reasons they inherit from the germ line.
However,

197
00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:33.900
cancer cells also accumulate many somatic mutations,

198
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.520
some of which may affect their ability to metabolize drugs and thus to resist

199
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.450
chemotherapy.

200
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.160
Chemotherapy applies very strong selection to competing clones and it rapidly so

201
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.000
selects resistant clones.

202
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.580
Some of that resistance is probably attributable to mutations in the genes that

203
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:58.170
are coding for Cytochrome p four 50s and in sotl transfer races.

204
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:00.230
<v 0>Okay,</v>

205
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.260
<v 1>we can use genome wide association studies.</v>

206
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.340
G was to discover genetic variation for adverse drug responses.

207
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.270
Here it seems to work pretty well and it seems to explain a bit more than we can

208
00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:15.950
when we use g was to explain disease resistance.

209
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.930
The reasons for that are not yet well known.

210
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:19.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

211
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.690
<v 1>And what we can see is that if you have a clinical problem like mio toxicity and</v>

212
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:31.351
the drug involved is a Staton in this case Sinvastatin then g was his found they

213
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:37.981
particular gene where variation is influencing that particular reaction.

214
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:44.670
This is also true for efficacy of treatment to a viral infection,

215
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:47.680
uh,

216
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.250
for treatment with Anacor and Adeq anticoagulants and for others.

217
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.970
So the point is that we now have fairly good high tech means of identifying

218
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:05.600
particular genes whose variation is associated with adverse drug response.

219
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.710
And that gives us hope that in this particular part of medicine,

220
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.850
identifying individual variants is going to bring a clinical payoff.

221
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.490
So to summarize,

222
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.990
individuals vary in the illegals that process drugs and environmental chemicals.

223
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.740
If they cannot process a molecule rapidly enough,

224
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.900
it will build up and can act as a poison.

225
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.200
Cancer cells also very,

226
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:34.220
and their susceptibility to chemicals is a cost for some of the evolution of

227
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:35.690
resistance to chemotherapy.

228
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:42.070
Knowing the genetic constitution of an individual and have individual cancer

229
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:47.150
clones can improve treatment outcomes and can reduce treatment risks.
