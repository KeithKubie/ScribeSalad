I've ripped the lighting out of the drinking bird scene so that you can set it

00:00:02.564 --> 00:00:06.770

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.310
the light from the origin passes through the point negative 200, 200, 400. Make

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.953
the light white with an intensity of 1.5. When you're done, the scene should

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:15.730
look like this.
