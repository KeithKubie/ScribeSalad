actually not one of my favorite things I
I had an original like you know CGA

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:00.550
I had an original like you know CGA
 

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.270
I had an original like you know CGA
adapter for my PC and most people didn't

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:03.280
adapter for my PC and most people didn't
 

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.350
adapter for my PC and most people didn't
realize if you actually hooked it up to

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360
realize if you actually hooked it up to
 

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.240
realize if you actually hooked it up to
a composite monitor and you had the

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.250
a composite monitor and you had the
 

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.920
a composite monitor and you had the
right games it could actually display 16

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:07.930
right games it could actually display 16
 

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.270
right games it could actually display 16
colors at one so that's how the original

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:09.280
colors at one so that's how the original
 

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.320
colors at one so that's how the original
King's Quest worked and I used the same

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:13.330
King's Quest worked and I used the same
 

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.570
King's Quest worked and I used the same
right right because it yeah it does it

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:15.580
right right because it yeah it does it
 

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.820
right right because it yeah it does it
was like a with a scanline or was it

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:17.830
was like a with a scanline or was it
 

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.490
was like a with a scanline or was it
block it was block yeah block pellet

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:20.500
block it was block yeah block pellet
 

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.860
block it was block yeah block pellet
right yeah so and basically you would

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:22.870
right yeah so and basically you would
 

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.300
right yeah so and basically you would
you would you you have two lines you put

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:24.310
you would you you have two lines you put
 

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.440
you would you you have two lines you put
them right next to each other

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:25.450
them right next to each other
 

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.210
them right next to each other
horizontally and then you end up getting

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:27.220
horizontally and then you end up getting
 

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.330
horizontally and then you end up getting
the color on composite because of the

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.340
the color on composite because of the
 

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.250

did not occur without the HDMI connector

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:34.040
did not occur without the HDMI connector
 

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.100
did not occur without the HDMI connector
plugged in so this is something that

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.110
plugged in so this is something that
 

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.040
plugged in so this is something that
we're actually starting to learn is it's

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.050
we're actually starting to learn is it's
 

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.500
we're actually starting to learn is it's
really really important to go in and

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:41.510
really really important to go in and
 

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.820
really really important to go in and
test your game at really bizarre

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:42.830

even in terms of last year when you know
 

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.460
even in terms of last year when you know
I was kind of amazed that we actually

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:06.470
I was kind of amazed that we actually
 

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.080
I was kind of amazed that we actually
had a device wish that was shipping out

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.090
had a device wish that was shipping out
 

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.180
had a device wish that was shipping out
on a phone form factor with 720p that

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:10.190
on a phone form factor with 720p that
 

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.940
on a phone form factor with 720p that
was last year oh yeah god only knows

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:12.950

what's really crazy is 735 P well yeah
which is actually that we were because

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:28.730
which is actually that we were because
 

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.170
which is actually that we were because
we were actually are actually at on this

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:32.180
we were actually are actually at on this
 

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.510
we were actually are actually at on this
device we're actually running at true

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520
device we're actually running at true
 

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.940
device we're actually running at true
720p when you're in HDMI but you're not

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:36.950
720p when you're in HDMI but you're not
 

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.400
720p when you're in HDMI but you're not
an HDMI were in this kind of weird funky

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:39.410
an HDMI were in this kind of weird funky
 

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.720
an HDMI were in this kind of weird funky
thing where we're actually right you

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:40.730
thing where we're actually right you
 

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.610
thing where we're actually right you
know 35 or 40 pixels short of that I

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:42.620
know 35 or 40 pixels short of that I
 

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.030
know 35 or 40 pixels short of that I
think so exactly and so yeah that can

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:46.040
think so exactly and so yeah that can
 

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.850
think so exactly and so yeah that can
mess up some some sprite sheet

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:48.860
mess up some some sprite sheet
 

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.510
mess up some some sprite sheet
calculation

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520
calculation
 

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.310
calculation
yeah absolutely so anyways who's inching

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320
yeah absolutely so anyways who's inching
 

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.450
yeah absolutely so anyways who's inching
also the thing is that simpering when

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:52.460
also the thing is that simpering when
 

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.520
also the thing is that simpering when
you plug HDMI in you actually you

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:54.530
you plug HDMI in you actually you
 

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.630
you plug HDMI in you actually you
actually get one of those rare things

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640
actually get one of those rare things
 

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.940
actually get one of those rare things
where it actually gets your tells you're

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:57.950
where it actually gets your tells you're
 

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.400
where it actually gets your tells you're
apt to change the size and so your app

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:00.410
apt to change the size and so your app
 

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.450
apt to change the size and so your app
needs to know how to respond to that we

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:01.460
needs to know how to respond to that we
 

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.920
needs to know how to respond to that we
actually had one app earlier that had a

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:02.930
actually had one app earlier that had a
 

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.920
actually had one app earlier that had a
giant purple or green fringe on it and

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:05.930
giant purple or green fringe on it and
 

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.360
giant purple or green fringe on it and
that actually was because oh we just

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:07.370
that actually was because oh we just
 

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.250
that actually was because oh we just
never realized that the size change can

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:09.260
never realized that the size change can
 

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.470
never realized that the size change can
come in as late as it did so if you do I

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480
come in as late as it did so if you do I
 

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.760
come in as late as it did so if you do I
said you have to watch out oh wait don't

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:12.770
said you have to watch out oh wait don't
 

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.650
said you have to watch out oh wait don't
chain it can come in any time you're

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:14.660
chain it can come in any time you're
 

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.940

gonna come in anytime you got to be
ready for it so yeah I mean we've said

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:19.040
ready for it so yeah I mean we've said
 

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.110

fun it's it's yet another another in a
long line of words games but it's done

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:55.370
long line of words games but it's done

very very well I would say that the the

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:58.370
very very well I would say that the the

very very well I would say that the the
excessive use of rounded rectangles is a

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:00.770
excessive use of rounded rectangles is a
 

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.040
excessive use of rounded rectangles is a
little unnecessary on Android but

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.050
little unnecessary on Android but
 

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.510
little unnecessary on Android but

where you're trying to draw things in a
sort of a boggle esque fashion there's a

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:29.570
sort of a boggle esque fashion there's a
 

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.090
sort of a boggle esque fashion there's a
lot of power-ups a lot of really

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:31.100
lot of power-ups a lot of really
 

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.590
lot of power-ups a lot of really
well-thought-out stuff I was a really

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600
well-thought-out stuff I was a really
 

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.660
well-thought-out stuff I was a really
fun game on a tablet it works it works

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:34.670
fun game on a tablet it works it works
 

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.880
fun game on a tablet it works it works
great you know because it just scales to

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:36.890
great you know because it just scales to
 

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.530
great you know because it just scales to
fill the screen the only thing on a

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:38.540
fill the screen the only thing on a
 

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.200
fill the screen the only thing on a
tablet is the obviously you can see the

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.210
tablet is the obviously you can see the
 

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.120
tablet is the obviously you can see the
area with the ad is kind of awkward

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.130
area with the ad is kind of awkward
 

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.710
area with the ad is kind of awkward
looking and takes up a very small

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720
looking and takes up a very small
 

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.230
looking and takes up a very small
portion of that top inner so I probably

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240
portion of that top inner so I probably
 

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.760
portion of that top inner so I probably
could adjust for that especially games

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:48.770
could adjust for that especially games
 

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.230
could adjust for that especially games
like this you there's there's really not

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240
like this you there's there's really not
 

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.390
like this you there's there's really not
much of an excuse for for not trying it

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400
much of an excuse for for not trying it
 

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.760
much of an excuse for for not trying it
on an emulator yeah right some different

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:54.770
on an emulator yeah right some different
 

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.860
on an emulator yeah right some different
sizes it's a little bit of a pain

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:56.870
sizes it's a little bit of a pain
 

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.410
sizes it's a little bit of a pain
because honestly it we don't switch as

00:21:59.410 --> 00:21:59.420
because honestly it we don't switch as
 

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:04.090
because honestly it we don't switch as
fast as we could between different sizes

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.100
fast as we could between different sizes
 

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.850
fast as we could between different sizes
and different layouts on the on the

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:06.860
and different layouts on the on the
 

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.360
and different layouts on the on the
emulator or on the dev tools but it's

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:10.370
emulator or on the dev tools but it's
 

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.640
emulator or on the dev tools but it's
well worth it

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:12.650
well worth it
 

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.760
well worth it
and it turns out that for games nowadays

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:15.770
and it turns out that for games nowadays
 

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.260
and it turns out that for games nowadays
I mean I think we used to see some

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:17.270
I mean I think we used to see some
 

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.000
I mean I think we used to see some
really bizarre things yeah absolutely

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.010
really bizarre things yeah absolutely
 

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.900
really bizarre things yeah absolutely
and and we still do on some devices but

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:21.910
and and we still do on some devices but
 

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.700
and and we still do on some devices but
if as we're you know for instance as

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:24.710
if as we're you know for instance as
 

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.200
if as we're you know for instance as
we're looking at devices that haven't

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:26.210
we're looking at devices that haven't
 

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.570
we're looking at devices that haven't
shipped yet which we sometimes do there

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:28.580
shipped yet which we sometimes do there
 

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.580
shipped yet which we sometimes do there
can be some crazy stuff well yeah but

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:30.590
can be some crazy stuff well yeah but
 

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.440
can be some crazy stuff well yeah but
it's interesting we you know we we

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:32.450
it's interesting we you know we we
 

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.350
it's interesting we you know we we
sometimes do it to ourselves and I think

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360
sometimes do it to ourselves and I think
 

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.310
sometimes do it to ourselves and I think
one of things we're gonna cover in

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320
one of things we're gonna cover in
 

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.610
one of things we're gonna cover in
future sessions or is is ways in which

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:39.620
future sessions or is is ways in which
 

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.580
future sessions or is is ways in which
we you have to be careful you know and

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:42.590
we you have to be careful you know and
 

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.280
we you have to be careful you know and
and so sometimes people make assumptions

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.290
and so sometimes people make assumptions
 

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.440
and so sometimes people make assumptions
about the way the memory and devices are

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:47.450
about the way the memory and devices are
 

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.210
about the way the memory and devices are
laid out sometimes they're actually some

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:49.220
laid out sometimes they're actually some
 

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.770
laid out sometimes they're actually some
bugs and avec it turns out that we're

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:50.780
bugs and avec it turns out that we're
 

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.990
bugs and avec it turns out that we're
affecting the way that one could

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000
affecting the way that one could
 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.760
affecting the way that one could
subclass various classes that people

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:54.770
subclass various classes that people
 

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.440
subclass various classes that people
were accidentally taking advantage of

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:56.450
were accidentally taking advantage of
 

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.060
were accidentally taking advantage of
yeah that's actually one thing you'll

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:58.070
yeah that's actually one thing you'll
 

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:03.160
yeah that's actually one thing you'll
notice is that the the original Android

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.170
notice is that the the original Android
 

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.350
notice is that the the original Android
source base you know was obviously not

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360
source base you know was obviously not
 

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.380
source base you know was obviously not
100% perfect and there were a few things

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:08.390
100% perfect and there were a few things
 

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.540
100% perfect and there were a few things
that either were under specified or were

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:10.550
that either were under specified or were
 

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.090
that either were under specified or were
just done wrong that tend to get cleaned

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:13.100
just done wrong that tend to get cleaned
 

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.150
just done wrong that tend to get cleaned
up over time by AOSP contributors so for

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.160
up over time by AOSP contributors so for
 

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.549
up over time by AOSP contributors so for
and by us and by us yeah

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559
and by us and by us yeah
 

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:22.840
and by us and by us yeah
so for instance we made for jellybean

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:22.850
so for instance we made for jellybean
 

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.690
so for instance we made for jellybean
yeah we made P thread POSIX compliant it

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:25.700
yeah we made P thread POSIX compliant it
 

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.669
yeah we made P thread POSIX compliant it
was supposed to return an error if it

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679
was supposed to return an error if it
 

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:28.990
was supposed to return an error if it
couldn't give you the thread you you

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000
couldn't give you the thread you you
 

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.049
couldn't give you the thread you you
wanted you know with the scheduling

00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:32.059
wanted you know with the scheduling
 

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:34.580
wanted you know with the scheduling
and it used to just fall back and you

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:34.590
and it used to just fall back and you
 

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.930
and it used to just fall back and you
know still create a thread but it wasn't

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940
know still create a thread but it wasn't
 

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.799
know still create a thread but it wasn't
what you asked for

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:36.809
what you asked for
 

00:23:36.809 --> 00:23:38.899
what you asked for
yeah and we made it do the right thing

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:38.909
yeah and we made it do the right thing
 

00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:40.460
yeah and we made it do the right thing
which is return an error and that broke

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:40.470
which is return an error and that broke
 

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.070
which is return an error and that broke
everybody everything because it turns

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080
everybody everything because it turns
 

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.749
everybody everything because it turns
out nobody was checking why would you

00:23:44.749 --> 00:23:44.759
out nobody was checking why would you
 

00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:46.820
out nobody was checking why would you
check for errors on P thread because in

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:46.830
check for errors on P thread because in
 

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.519
check for errors on P thread because in
there yeah exactly so we had a ton of

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:49.529
there yeah exactly so we had a ton of
 

00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:52.100
there yeah exactly so we had a ton of
games and other apps that would spin up

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.110
games and other apps that would spin up
 

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.600
games and other apps that would spin up
threads and then sit there waiting like

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:53.610
threads and then sit there waiting like
 

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.830
threads and then sit there waiting like
hey all right just waiting for that

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840
hey all right just waiting for that
 

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.519
hey all right just waiting for that
thread to spin up of the thread to spend

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:57.529
thread to spin up of the thread to spend
 

00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:00.769
thread to spin up of the thread to spend
exactly yeah Bodo boom boom and nothing

00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:00.779
exactly yeah Bodo boom boom and nothing
 

00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:03.680
exactly yeah Bodo boom boom and nothing
would happen so so yeah so you have to

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:03.690
would happen so so yeah so you have to
 

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.029
would happen so so yeah so you have to
be used to be a little bit cautious on

00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039
be used to be a little bit cautious on
 

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:07.099
be used to be a little bit cautious on
that sometimes reading our docs actually

00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:07.109
that sometimes reading our docs actually
 

00:24:07.109 --> 00:24:09.349
that sometimes reading our docs actually
is a good thing and and also just you

00:24:09.349 --> 00:24:09.359
is a good thing and and also just you
 

00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:11.690
is a good thing and and also just you
know adhering to standards even even

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700
know adhering to standards even even
 

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.220
know adhering to standards even even
when it doesn't break you you know the

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.230
when it doesn't break you you know the
 

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.289
when it doesn't break you you know the
other thing that happened I believe is

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299
other thing that happened I believe is
 

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:18.320
other thing that happened I believe is
the Ice Cream Sandwich time frame was we

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:18.330
the Ice Cream Sandwich time frame was we
 

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.899
the Ice Cream Sandwich time frame was we
tightened up the j'ni referencing

00:24:20.899 --> 00:24:20.909
tightened up the j'ni referencing
 

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:22.399
tightened up the j'ni referencing
restrictions oh we've done that several

00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:22.409
restrictions oh we've done that several
 

00:24:22.409 --> 00:24:25.310
restrictions oh we've done that several
times because we you know and this is

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320
times because we you know and this is
 

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.419
times because we you know and this is
usually to to make things faster well

00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:29.429
usually to to make things faster well
 

00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:30.710
usually to to make things faster well
some of the things that happen to you

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720
some of the things that happen to you
 

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.450
some of the things that happen to you
but when we had single threaded you know

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460
but when we had single threaded you know
 

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.970
but when we had single threaded you know
everywhere mm-hmm

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980
everywhere mm-hmm
 

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.499
everywhere mm-hmm
they're kind of two things we did it

00:24:36.499 --> 00:24:36.509
they're kind of two things we did it
 

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:40.159
they're kind of two things we did it
once we went we went Multi CPU and at

00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:40.169
once we went we went Multi CPU and at
 

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:43.220
once we went we went Multi CPU and at
the same time we also tightened up J and

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:43.230
the same time we also tightened up J and
 

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.960
the same time we also tightened up J and
I and I think there they sort of what

I and I think there they sort of what
 

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.789

hand-in-hand but for a long time

00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799
hand-in-hand but for a long time

we weren't cleaning up j'ni very

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200
we weren't cleaning up j'ni very
 

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.019
we weren't cleaning up j'ni very
effectively so you could you could

00:24:51.019 --> 00:24:51.029
effectively so you could you could
 

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:52.249
effectively so you could you could
pretty much guarantee that if you

00:24:52.249 --> 00:24:52.259
pretty much guarantee that if you
 

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:54.950
pretty much guarantee that if you
referenced something from the JVM that

referenced something from the JVM that
 

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.720
referenced something from the JVM that
reference would always exist in J and I

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:56.730
reference would always exist in J and I
 

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.879

because because at some point we

make this GC any faster yeah unless we

know you don't know how those pre-built

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:37.529
know you don't know how those pre-built
 

00:25:37.529 --> 00:25:38.960

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:38.970
libraries were compiled maybe they were
 

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.159

with but with binary libraries be very
 

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.549
with but with binary libraries be very
very cautious yeah this is um the reason

00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559
very cautious yeah this is um the reason
 

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:50.470
very cautious yeah this is um the reason
we're talking about this is because

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480
we're talking about this is because
 

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.149
we're talking about this is because

as we do more address layout address
space layout randomization and and just

00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:58.830
space layout randomization and and just
 

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.320
space layout randomization and and just
screw with the address space in

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:00.330
screw with the address space in
 

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.519
screw with the address space in
different ways I old code that was

00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:04.529
different ways I old code that was
 

00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:06.830
different ways I old code that was
compiled with very old NDK is not

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840
compiled with very old NDK is not
 

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.619
compiled with very old NDK is not
relocatable in the same way that the

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:09.629
relocatable in the same way that the
 

00:26:09.629 --> 00:26:13.299
relocatable in the same way that the
newer code is and this also goes for

00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:13.309
newer code is and this also goes for
 

00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:15.560

the different tool chains so if you're

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:16.950
the different tool chains so if you're
 

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.710
the different tool chains so if you're
using some other random tool chain to

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720
using some other random tool chain to
 

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.139
using some other random tool chain to

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:21.149
generate Android code be aware that we
 

00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:24.259
generate Android code be aware that we
only test against the NDK yeah so

00:26:24.259 --> 00:26:24.269
only test against the NDK yeah so
 

00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:25.430

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.000
will announce it on Google+
yes but basically we just have to get

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.010
yes but basically we just have to get
 

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:24.319
yes but basically we just have to get
through this month and then we take some

00:38:24.319 --> 00:38:24.329
through this month and then we take some
 

00:38:24.329 --> 00:38:26.690
through this month and then we take some
water drink some water we get through

water drink some water we get through
 

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.819
water drink some water we get through
this month and we are going to change

00:38:28.819 --> 00:38:28.829
this month and we are going to change

the comments coming now let's see what

00:38:34.789 --> 00:38:34.799
the comments coming now let's see what
 

00:38:34.799 --> 00:38:38.900
the comments coming now let's see what
people are saying on the comment stream

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:38.910
 

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.420
yeah we actually we actually have

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:41.430
yeah we actually we actually have
 

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:47.210
yeah we actually we actually have
typical typical YouTube comments really

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220
typical typical YouTube comments really
 

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.309
typical typical YouTube comments really
are there people being like okay so

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319
are there people being like okay so
 

00:38:49.319 --> 00:38:50.749
are there people being like okay so
here's a question about the transformer

00:38:50.749 --> 00:38:50.759
here's a question about the transformer
 

00:38:50.759 --> 00:38:52.849
here's a question about the transformer
prime is the transformer the best

00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859
prime is the transformer the best
 

00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:54.620
prime is the transformer the best
Android tablet or do you guys just use

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:54.630
Android tablet or do you guys just use
 

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:58.309
Android tablet or do you guys just use
it see well the transformer prime has

00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319
it see well the transformer prime has
 

00:38:58.319 --> 00:39:02.150
it see well the transformer prime has
some some advantages it is not

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160
some some advantages it is not
 

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.920
some some advantages it is not
definitely not a bad Android tablet I

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:03.930
definitely not a bad Android tablet I
 

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:05.359
definitely not a bad Android tablet I
don't know if I'd go so far as to say

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:05.369
don't know if I'd go so far as to say
 

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:08.269
don't know if I'd go so far as to say
it's the best fourth as far as things

00:39:08.269 --> 00:39:08.279
it's the best fourth as far as things
 

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.620
it's the best fourth as far as things
that are shipping now that we can get

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:09.630
that are shipping now that we can get
 

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.019
that are shipping now that we can get
our hands on and reliable reliably get

00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:12.029
our hands on and reliable reliably get
 

00:39:12.029 --> 00:39:15.799
our hands on and reliable reliably get
several backup units it is the very best

00:39:15.799 --> 00:39:15.809
several backup units it is the very best
 

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:19.910
several backup units it is the very best
at providing HDMI out it's got really

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920
at providing HDMI out it's got really
 

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.880
at providing HDMI out it's got really
good HDMI out options Asus added some

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:22.890
good HDMI out options Asus added some
 

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.920
good HDMI out options Asus added some
things to the base Android system that

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:24.930
things to the base Android system that
 

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.539
things to the base Android system that
allow it to do things like rotate into

00:39:26.539 --> 00:39:26.549
allow it to do things like rotate into
 

00:39:26.549 --> 00:39:29.509
allow it to do things like rotate into
portrait mode so that makes our show a

00:39:29.509 --> 00:39:29.519
portrait mode so that makes our show a
 

00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:31.220
portrait mode so that makes our show a
lot easier yeah that's I think that's

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:31.230
lot easier yeah that's I think that's
 

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.109
lot easier yeah that's I think that's
the primary reason we're using on the

00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119
the primary reason we're using on the
 

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.880
the primary reason we're using on the
show we have them and they have this

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:34.890
show we have them and they have this
 

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.039
show we have them and they have this
really cool feature you know we don't

00:39:37.039 --> 00:39:37.049
really cool feature you know we don't
 

00:39:37.049 --> 00:39:38.990
really cool feature you know we don't
have HDMI on our own tablets had to say

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000
have HDMI on our own tablets had to say
 

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.240
have HDMI on our own tablets had to say
you know the on the Nexus 7 so if we had

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:41.250
you know the on the Nexus 7 so if we had
 

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.190
you know the on the Nexus 7 so if we had
an X except Nexus tablet HDMI out we

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200
an X except Nexus tablet HDMI out we
 

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.450
an X except Nexus tablet HDMI out we
might use it I mean if you think about

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460
might use it I mean if you think about
 

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.339
might use it I mean if you think about
it the Nexus 7 in a lot of ways is a

00:39:46.339 --> 00:39:46.349
it the Nexus 7 in a lot of ways is a
 

00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:49.220
it the Nexus 7 in a lot of ways is a
stripped down transformer price it's you

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.230
stripped down transformer price it's you
 

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.749
stripped down transformer price it's you
know it's got the essentially the same

00:39:50.749 --> 00:39:50.759
know it's got the essentially the same
 

00:39:50.759 --> 00:39:53.509
know it's got the essentially the same
processing power but a smaller screen no

00:39:53.509 --> 00:39:53.519
processing power but a smaller screen no
 

00:39:53.519 --> 00:39:55.880
processing power but a smaller screen no
rear camera you know just a yeah and all

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:55.890
rear camera you know just a yeah and all
 

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.569
rear camera you know just a yeah and all
the options are taken off yeah so

00:39:58.569 --> 00:39:58.579
the options are taken off yeah so
 

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:00.740
the options are taken off yeah so
fortunately we have a lot of experience

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:00.750
fortunately we have a lot of experience
 

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.630
fortunately we have a lot of experience
with that chipset and that piece of

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640
with that chipset and that piece of
 

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.240
with that chipset and that piece of
hardware so it's a lot easier to show

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:05.250
hardware so it's a lot easier to show
 

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.829
hardware so it's a lot easier to show
now there are some disadvantages to the

00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839
now there are some disadvantages to the
 

00:40:06.839 --> 00:40:09.799
now there are some disadvantages to the
transformer prime it's out of all of the

00:40:09.799 --> 00:40:09.809
transformer prime it's out of all of the
 

00:40:09.809 --> 00:40:11.680
transformer prime it's out of all of the
it's sort of the odd man out on

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:11.690
it's sort of the odd man out on
 

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:16.400
it's sort of the odd man out on
rendering unlike almost all mobile chips

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:16.410
rendering unlike almost all mobile chips
 

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.930
rendering unlike almost all mobile chips
it's not a tiled renderer it's a forward

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940
it's not a tiled renderer it's a forward
 

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.779
it's not a tiled renderer it's a forward
ruler and that means that it's very very

00:40:20.779 --> 00:40:20.789
ruler and that means that it's very very
 

00:40:20.789 --> 00:40:24.650
ruler and that means that it's very very
sensitive to performance characteristics

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660
sensitive to performance characteristics
 

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.839
sensitive to performance characteristics
that that the tiler can handle very

00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:26.849
that that the tiler can handle very
 

00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:29.029
that that the tiler can handle very
easily and vice versa yeah so like you

00:40:29.029 --> 00:40:29.039
easily and vice versa yeah so like you
 

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:30.200
easily and vice versa yeah so like you
know for example you know there's

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:30.210
know for example you know there's
 

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.160
know for example you know there's
there's there's there's three different

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:31.170
there's there's there's three different
 

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.410
there's there's there's three different
renderers essentially on Android there

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420
renderers essentially on Android there
 

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.890
renderers essentially on Android there
we have a tile based deferred tile based

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900
we have a tile based deferred tile based
 

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.010
we have a tile based deferred tile based
and we have immediate mode or

this and this tablet is if this chip
said it's really cool if you need to do

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760
said it's really cool if you need to do
 

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.360
said it's really cool if you need to do
some really clever effects that involve

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:46.370
some really clever effects that involve
 

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.100
some really clever effects that involve
reading stuff back out of the buffer

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.110
reading stuff back out of the buffer
 

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:50.230
reading stuff back out of the buffer
because the buffer is updated in the you

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240
because the buffer is updated in the you
 

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.550
because the buffer is updated in the you
know the in this tasty the screen

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560
know the in this tasty the screen
 

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.500
know the in this tasty the screen
rappers updated in real time so it's

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:53.510
rappers updated in real time so it's
 

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.700
rappers updated in real time so it's
actually really fast to go and read

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:54.710
actually really fast to go and read
 

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.530
actually really fast to go and read
stuff out with a tile-based renderer or

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:56.540
stuff out with a tile-based renderer or
 

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.060
stuff out with a tile-based renderer or
a deferred renderer it means that it has

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:58.070
a deferred renderer it means that it has
 

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.860
a deferred renderer it means that it has
to reconstruct that piece of the buffer

00:40:59.860 --> 00:40:59.870
to reconstruct that piece of the buffer
 

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.240
to reconstruct that piece of the buffer
when you want it in the middle of

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:01.250
when you want it in the middle of
 

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.580
when you want it in the middle of
rendering and that can slow you down an

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:03.590
rendering and that can slow you down an
 

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.380
rendering and that can slow you down an
immense amount so there are certain

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:05.390
immense amount so there are certain
 

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.420
immense amount so there are certain
kinds of full-screen effects that this

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:07.430
kinds of full-screen effects that this
 

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.130
kinds of full-screen effects that this
kind of chips that can do that are very

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:09.140
kind of chips that can do that are very
 

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.260
kind of chips that can do that are very
difficult to do on a tile-based renderer

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:11.270
difficult to do on a tile-based renderer
 

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.940
difficult to do on a tile-based renderer
yeah it's you know when you think about

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:12.950
yeah it's you know when you think about
 

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.350
yeah it's you know when you think about
the way the hardware's put together it's

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:14.360
the way the hardware's put together it's
 

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.910
the way the hardware's put together it's
not so much that the tile-based renderer

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920
not so much that the tile-based renderer
 

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.850
not so much that the tile-based renderer
is bad at it is that it's significantly

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:18.860
is bad at it is that it's significantly
 

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.200
is bad at it is that it's significantly
better at not doing that yeah so in

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:23.210
better at not doing that yeah so in
 

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.490
better at not doing that yeah so in
other words you're not you're not

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:24.500
other words you're not you're not
 

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.170
other words you're not you're not
actually doing something that yeah that

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:26.180
actually doing something that yeah that
 

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.300
actually doing something that yeah that
the hardware is bad at it's just that it

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:28.310
the hardware is bad at it's just that it
 

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.830
the hardware is bad at it's just that it
has to forego a whole set of

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:29.840
has to forego a whole set of
 

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.050
has to forego a whole set of
optimization right and the problem is

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.060
optimization right and the problem is
 

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.070
optimization right and the problem is
this you know this hardware is designed

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:33.080
this you know this hardware is designed
 

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.920
this you know this hardware is designed
to work the other way and so what this

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:35.930
to work the other way and so what this
 

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.990
to work the other way and so what this
so the tile-based renderers tend to

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000
so the tile-based renderers tend to
 

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.240
so the tile-based renderers tend to
actually have performance problems when

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:40.250
actually have performance problems when
 

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.250
actually have performance problems when
you start having to force them into sort

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:42.260
you start having to force them into sort
 

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.540
you start having to force them into sort
of direct mode rendering because they

and some moving eye but also it takes up

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:17.570
and some moving eye but also it takes up
 

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.870
and some moving eye but also it takes up
a lot of CPU resources so yeah now that

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880
a lot of CPU resources so yeah now that
 

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.880
a lot of CPU resources so yeah now that
being said a lot of the drivers for

being said a lot of the drivers for
 

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.010
being said a lot of the drivers for
tile-based renderers also do some of

tile-based renderers also do some of
 

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.540
tile-based renderers also do some of

the you know but but but basically but

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:43.490
the you know but but but basically but
 

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:47.200
the you know but but but basically but
yes so in theory also in a theory is

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:47.210
yes so in theory also in a theory is
 

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.880
yes so in theory also in a theory is
that and this isn't really proven maybe

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:48.890
that and this isn't really proven maybe
 

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.360
that and this isn't really proven maybe
that

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:49.370

immediate mode guys would say when you

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:50.810
immediate mode guys would say when you
 

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.810
immediate mode guys would say when you
get into really really huge amounts of

get into really really huge amounts of
 

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.360
get into really really huge amounts of

like having procedural geometry

00:42:59.890 --> 00:42:59.900
like having procedural geometry
 

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.690
like having procedural geometry
basically that you start running into

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:01.700
basically that you start running into
 

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.610
basically that you start running into

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:03.620
things that immediate Miller renderers
 

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.770
things that immediate Miller renderers
do better than tile-based renderers and

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:05.780
do better than tile-based renderers and
 

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.540
do better than tile-based renderers and
I think the jury is still out we'll have

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:07.550
I think the jury is still out we'll have
 

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.700
I think the jury is still out we'll have
to wait to see what happens with well

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:09.710

OpenGL 3 is starting to add these kinds

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920
OpenGL 3 is starting to add these kinds
 

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.020
OpenGL 3 is starting to add these kinds
of features in so I think you know I

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:17.030

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.580
years down the line we're gonna
definitely have api's and chips that'll

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:23.810
support you know doing that kind of job
 

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.660
support you know doing that kind of job
well but but the thing is it's not it's

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:25.670
well but but the thing is it's not it's
 

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:29.770
well but but the thing is it's not it's
not so much that this your amount of

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:29.780
not so much that this your amount of
 

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.330
not so much that this your amount of

no you're right you know on a tiler

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:34.580
no you're right you know on a tiler
 

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.280
no you're right you know on a tiler
you're you're really dealing with just a

you're you're really dealing with just a
 

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:40.180
you're you're really dealing with just a
very large number of frustra basically

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.190
very large number of frustra basically
 

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.570
very large number of frustra basically
so you've you've already pre clipped a

so you've you've already pre clipped a
 

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.820
so you've you've already pre clipped a
lot of your trials so the chances of

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:45.830
lot of your trials so the chances of
 

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.790
lot of your trials so the chances of
getting interpenetration is very low now

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800
getting interpenetration is very low now
 

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.360

usually thinking about sorting it on the
 

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.290
usually thinking about sorting it on the
object level right because will will

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:02.300
object level right because will will
 

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.200
object level right because will will
draw entire videos at a time exactly so

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:05.210
draw entire videos at a time exactly so
 

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.730
draw entire videos at a time exactly so
that's actually that's a difficult

00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:06.740
that's actually that's a difficult
 

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.540
that's actually that's a difficult
problem because you get these

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:07.550

because you also have certain geometry

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:13.340
because you also have certain geometry
 

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.750
because you also have certain geometry
that is translucent and so you actually

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760
that is translucent and so you actually
 

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.340
that is translucent and so you actually
have to maintain to that in proper you

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:21.350
have to maintain to that in proper you
 

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.250
have to maintain to that in proper you
know front to back order right while you

know front to back order right while you
 

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.480
know front to back order right while you
actually want to maintain all of your

back to front order and so you have to
 

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.350

you have to watch out for all those

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:29.360
you have to watch out for all those
 

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.700
you have to watch out for all those
inter dependencies as well so it's not

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:30.710
inter dependencies as well so it's not
 

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.050

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240
reason about what the GPU is doing yeah
 

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.910
reason about what the GPU is doing yeah
it's easier to do multi pass effects but

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920
it's easier to do multi pass effects but
 

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.740
it's easier to do multi pass effects but
and and it's easier to take advantage of

00:44:59.740 --> 00:44:59.750
and and it's easier to take advantage of
 

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:01.600
and and it's easier to take advantage of
these you know super long shaders that

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:01.610
these you know super long shaders that
 

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.420
these you know super long shaders that
you've got

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:03.430
you've got
 

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:08.170
you've got
but it does mean that it went when

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:08.180
but it does mean that it went when
 

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.640
but it does mean that it went when
you're a much more resource constrained

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:09.650
you're a much more resource constrained
 

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:10.630
you're a much more resource constrained
environment

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.089
environment
yeah it's no shine they don't try

00:45:13.089 --> 00:45:13.099
yeah it's no shine they don't try
 

00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:15.040
yeah it's no shine they don't try
exactly and so I think that um so it is

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:15.050
exactly and so I think that um so it is
 

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:16.120
exactly and so I think that um so it is
interesting so want to think one of

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:16.130
interesting so want to think one of
 

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:17.650
interesting so want to think one of
things that's nice about this is one to

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:17.660
things that's nice about this is one to
 

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.910
things that's nice about this is one to
see that most the games aren't really

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920
see that most the games aren't really
 

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.560
see that most the games aren't really
well on it I mean honestly you know the

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:20.570
well on it I mean honestly you know the
 

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:22.780
well on it I mean honestly you know the
vast majority of games on Android do

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:22.790
vast majority of games on Android do
 

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:25.270
vast majority of games on Android do
great on the transformer prime and it's

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280
great on the transformer prime and it's
 

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.589
great on the transformer prime and it's
really exciting also for us the other

00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599
really exciting also for us the other
 

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:27.490
really exciting also for us the other
thing that's nice about transformer

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:27.500
thing that's nice about transformer
 

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.099
thing that's nice about transformer
prime is they did get jellybean and it's

00:45:30.099 --> 00:45:30.109
prime is they did get jellybean and it's
 

00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:31.630
prime is they did get jellybean and it's
really really nice like the difference

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.640
really really nice like the difference
 

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.880
really really nice like the difference
is smoothness when this guy going to

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:33.890
is smoothness when this guy going to
 

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:36.099
is smoothness when this guy going to
jellybean was huge because it felt fast

00:45:36.099 --> 00:45:36.109
jellybean was huge because it felt fast
 

00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:37.960
jellybean was huge because it felt fast
to begin with but yeah I never had a

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:37.970
to begin with but yeah I never had a
 

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.640
to begin with but yeah I never had a
real problem with it but yeah when you

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:39.650
real problem with it but yeah when you
 

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:41.380
real problem with it but yeah when you
see jelly it's the same way like my

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:41.390
see jelly it's the same way like my
 

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.420
see jelly it's the same way like my
Galaxy Nexus when I upgraded to

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:43.430
Galaxy Nexus when I upgraded to
 

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.190
Galaxy Nexus when I upgraded to
jellybean I'm like wow I feel like I

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200
jellybean I'm like wow I feel like I
 

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.990
jellybean I'm like wow I feel like I
just got a new phone yeah and it's

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000
just got a new phone yeah and it's
 

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.730
just got a new phone yeah and it's
because that you know we did a lot of

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:48.740
because that you know we did a lot of
 

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.260
because that you know we did a lot of
work which we're actually really hoping

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:50.270
work which we're actually really hoping
 

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.470
work which we're actually really hoping
to bring to you over the next few months

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480
to bring to you over the next few months
 

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.359
to bring to you over the next few months
talk about how you can dj''q your

00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:55.369
talk about how you can dj''q your
 

00:45:55.369 --> 00:45:56.740
talk about how you can dj''q your
applications the same way we need to

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:56.750
applications the same way we need to
 

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:59.109
applications the same way we need to
make the operating system mostly cuz all

00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119
make the operating system mostly cuz all
 

00:45:59.119 --> 00:46:01.390

the guys that did the DJ King sit like

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400
the guys that did the DJ King sit like
 

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.339
the guys that did the DJ King sit like
two cubes away from us and when are you

00:46:03.339 --> 00:46:03.349
two cubes away from us and when are you
 

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:04.900
two cubes away from us and when are you
gonna do this on they actually hate us

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:04.910
gonna do this on they actually hate us
 

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.180
gonna do this on they actually hate us
and they're like would you go away but

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:07.190
and they're like would you go away but
 

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:11.410
and they're like would you go away but
yeah yeah yeah and when we say we bugged

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:11.420
yeah yeah yeah and when we say we bugged
 

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.839
yeah yeah yeah and when we say we bugged
them we mean actually microphones in

00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:13.849
them we mean actually microphones in
 

00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:15.640
them we mean actually microphones in
their office so we need all their

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:15.650
their office so we need all their
 

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:17.380
their office so we need all their
secrets the important thing that we

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:17.390
secrets the important thing that we
 

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.390
secrets the important thing that we
added this tool called systrace and

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400
added this tool called systrace and
 

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.800
added this tool called systrace and
systrace is really really awesome server

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:20.810
systrace is really really awesome server
 

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:22.960
systrace is really really awesome server
i'll show you an example so on one GPU

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:22.970
i'll show you an example so on one GPU
 

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.060
i'll show you an example so on one GPU
we could actually look at systrace and

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:25.070
we could actually look at systrace and
 

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.560
we could actually look at systrace and
say alright the GPU is rendering here

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:26.570
say alright the GPU is rendering here
 

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.120
say alright the GPU is rendering here
and then the thread went to sleep for

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:28.130
and then the thread went to sleep for
 

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.710
and then the thread went to sleep for
this period of time and then the GP was

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720
this period of time and then the GP was
 

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.480
this period of time and then the GP was
rendering here why did the thread go to

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:31.490
rendering here why did the thread go to
 

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:32.589
rendering here why did the thread go to
sleep well this ride went to sleep

00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599
sleep well this ride went to sleep
 

00:46:32.599 --> 00:46:33.790
sleep well this ride went to sleep
because that point we didn't read back

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:33.800
because that point we didn't read back
 

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.890
because that point we didn't read back
from the GPU and we could say and that

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:35.900
from the GPU and we could say and that
 

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.210
from the GPU and we could say and that
was the intent entire chunk of time

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:37.220
was the intent entire chunk of time
 

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.099
was the intent entire chunk of time
which we could actually measure and you

00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:39.109
which we could actually measure and you
 

00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:40.630
which we could actually measure and you
can see that and systrace was actually

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640
can see that and systrace was actually
 

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.609
can see that and systrace was actually
the GPU going hey well I'm gonna do a

00:46:42.609 --> 00:46:42.619
the GPU going hey well I'm gonna do a
 

00:46:42.619 --> 00:46:44.470
the GPU going hey well I'm gonna do a
bunch of calculation now this sucks so

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480
bunch of calculation now this sucks so
 

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.510
bunch of calculation now this sucks so
well now remember of course that there's

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520
well now remember of course that there's
 

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.339
well now remember of course that there's
two components to any read-back right

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:48.349
two components to any read-back right
 

00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:49.720
two components to any read-back right
there's the there's the fact that you're

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:49.730
there's the there's the fact that you're
 

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:53.200
there's the there's the fact that you're
you know you have to install out the the

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:53.210
you know you have to install out the the
 

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.770
you know you have to install out the the
GPU writing inside but you also have to

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:55.780
GPU writing inside but you also have to
 

00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:00.670
GPU writing inside but you also have to
make sure that the resource isn't in use

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680
make sure that the resource isn't in use
 

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.859
make sure that the resource isn't in use
on either side right yeah so it's not

00:47:02.859 --> 00:47:02.869
on either side right yeah so it's not
 

00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:06.250
on either side right yeah so it's not
just sorry so you need to collect the

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:06.260
just sorry so you need to collect the
 

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.290
just sorry so you need to collect the
tiles yes do all of you know collapse

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:08.300
tiles yes do all of you know collapse
 

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.810
tiles yes do all of you know collapse
your deferred render yes and you also

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:10.820
your deferred render yes and you also
 

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.940
your deferred render yes and you also
need to do a synchronization between the

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:12.950
need to do a synchronization between the
 

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:14.680
need to do a synchronization between the
CPU and GPU and that's what really kills

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:14.690
CPU and GPU and that's what really kills
 

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:15.520
CPU and GPU and that's what really kills
you

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:15.530
you
 

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.020
you
and one one thing that we've noticed

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:17.030
and one one thing that we've noticed
 

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:21.100
and one one thing that we've noticed
with video is that no matter how fast

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.110
with video is that no matter how fast
 

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.950
with video is that no matter how fast
you are coherent CPUs and GPUs are kind

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960
you are coherent CPUs and GPUs are kind
 

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.590
you are coherent CPUs and GPUs are kind
of kick-ass no you know because because

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:29.600
of kick-ass no you know because because
 

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.420
of kick-ass no you know because because
here's the problem yeah it's not

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:31.430
here's the problem yeah it's not
 

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.610
here's the problem yeah it's not
actually it's not actually a

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:33.620
actually it's not actually a
 

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.130
actually it's not actually a
synchronization problem it's it's more a

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:36.140
synchronization problem it's it's more a
 

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.960
synchronization problem it's it's more a
sequencing problem I know I was kidding

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:37.970
sequencing problem I know I was kidding
 

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:43.450
sequencing problem I know I was kidding
that is but anyway the the problem is or

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:43.460
that is but anyway the the problem is or
 

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.670
that is but anyway the the problem is or
the solution I should say is that you

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680
the solution I should say is that you
 

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.060
the solution I should say is that you
just never want to have the GPU and CPU

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:48.070
just never want to have the GPU and CPU
 

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.440
just never want to have the GPU and CPU
holding on to the same resource once and

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:50.450
holding on to the same resource once and
 

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.750
holding on to the same resource once and
and so and you know if you're working on

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760
and so and you know if you're working on
 

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.610
and so and you know if you're working on
a desktop part you you already know how

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:54.620
a desktop part you you already know how
 

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.780
a desktop part you you already know how
this works because you have to deal with

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:55.790
this works because you have to deal with
 

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.690
this works because you have to deal with
PCI synchronization and the solution is

00:47:58.690 --> 00:47:58.700
PCI synchronization and the solution is
 

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.140
PCI synchronization and the solution is
staging buffers so you don't do a read

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.150
staging buffers so you don't do a read
 

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:06.610
staging buffers so you don't do a read
back into a texture and then immediately

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:06.620
back into a texture and then immediately
 

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.520
back into a texture and then immediately
use it you do a read back this frame

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:09.530
use it you do a read back this frame
 

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.950
use it you do a read back this frame
while you're reading the read back that

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:11.960
while you're reading the read back that
 

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.540
while you're reading the read back that
you did three frames ago yeah and it

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:13.550
you did three frames ago yeah and it
 

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:14.680
you did three frames ago yeah and it
actually it's actually one of the things

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:14.690
actually it's actually one of the things
 

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.060
actually it's actually one of the things
people do actually for reflection is

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:16.070
people do actually for reflection is
 

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.260
people do actually for reflection is
that you actually don't calculate a

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:17.270
that you actually don't calculate a
 

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.060
that you actually don't calculate a
reflection every frame but you're using

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.070
reflection every frame but you're using
 

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.070
reflection every frame but you're using
every other frame you know maybe every

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:21.080
every other frame you know maybe every
 

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.270
every other frame you know maybe every
two frames you know depending on how

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280
two frames you know depending on how
 

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.890
two frames you know depending on how
much you're allowed okay all right well

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:23.900
much you're allowed okay all right well
 

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.540
much you're allowed okay all right well
now let's calculate a reflection now

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:25.550
now let's calculate a reflection now
 

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:26.710
now let's calculate a reflection now
we'll apply that and that's for two

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720
we'll apply that and that's for two
 

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.000
we'll apply that and that's for two
frames ago but that's okay because

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.010
frames ago but that's okay because
 

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.740
frames ago but that's okay because
actually the user can't really tell

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:29.750
actually the user can't really tell
 

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.330
actually the user can't really tell
that's on top of some other wavy mushy

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:31.340
that's on top of some other wavy mushy
 

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.630
that's on top of some other wavy mushy
thing right right and yeah and a lot of

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640
thing right right and yeah and a lot of
 

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.460
thing right right and yeah and a lot of
it depends of course on on who's doing

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:36.470
it depends of course on on who's doing
 

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.310
it depends of course on on who's doing
the read bag the problem is that the the

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:39.320
the read bag the problem is that the the
 

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.230
the read bag the problem is that the the
GPU is considered to be a user of that

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240
GPU is considered to be a user of that
 

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.840
GPU is considered to be a user of that
texture from the point that a draw call

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:43.850
texture from the point that a draw call
 

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:45.670
texture from the point that a draw call
involving it is submitted to the point

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680
involving it is submitted to the point
 

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.580
involving it is submitted to the point
where it retires yeah so that's actually

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:48.590
where it retires yeah so that's actually
 

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.070
where it retires yeah so that's actually
a huge length of time that the GPU is

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:51.080
a huge length of time that the GPU is
 

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.560
a huge length of time that the GPU is
not in fact using the texture absolutely

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:53.570
not in fact using the texture absolutely
 

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:58.810
not in fact using the texture absolutely
and in fact most of these GPUs are are

00:48:58.810 --> 00:48:58.820
and in fact most of these GPUs are are
 

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:02.950
and in fact most of these GPUs are are
executing completely serially so for

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960
executing completely serially so for
 

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.990
executing completely serially so for
instance it's it's no problem for the

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000
instance it's it's no problem for the
 

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.330
instance it's it's no problem for the
GPU to read back a texture as long as

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:07.340
GPU to read back a texture as long as
 

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.250
GPU to read back a texture as long as
it's not actually writing to it right

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:09.260
it's not actually writing to it right
 

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.490
it's not actually writing to it right
now but having the CPU read it back or

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:12.500
now but having the CPU read it back or
 

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.660
now but having the CPU read it back or
if you need to do any kind of processing

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:13.670
if you need to do any kind of processing
 

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.840
if you need to do any kind of processing
that involves the CPU which as you noted

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:16.850
that involves the CPU which as you noted
 

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:19.660
that involves the CPU which as you noted
before you don't really know because a

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:19.670
before you don't really know because a
 

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:21.460
before you don't really know because a
lot of this the magic happens there is

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:21.470
lot of this the magic happens there is
 

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.380
lot of this the magic happens there is
right driver each each one of these

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:23.390
right driver each each one of these
 

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.810
right driver each each one of these
chips is not just a self-contained

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:25.820
chips is not just a self-contained
 

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.790
chips is not just a self-contained
magical graphics now value

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:27.800
magical graphics now value
 

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.310
magical graphics now value
yeah it's it's part of an ecosystem of

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:30.320
yeah it's it's part of an ecosystem of
 

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.750
yeah it's it's part of an ecosystem of
software that lives in multiple places

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760
software that lives in multiple places
 

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.850
software that lives in multiple places
and yeah so it's interesting and

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:33.860
and yeah so it's interesting and
 

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:35.170
and yeah so it's interesting and
sometimes you actually for some of these

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:35.180
sometimes you actually for some of these
 

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.220
sometimes you actually for some of these
effects you actually can do them

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:36.230
effects you actually can do them
 

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.480
effects you actually can do them
entirely on the CPU

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:37.490
entirely on the CPU
 

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:38.530
entirely on the CPU
you know like thing and some of their

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:38.540
you know like thing and some of their
 

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.520
you know like thing and some of their
guys some of the guys you just fake it

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:39.530
guys some of the guys you just fake it
 

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.080
guys some of the guys you just fake it
out you're like all right I know I've

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:41.090
out you're like all right I know I've
 

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:42.490
out you're like all right I know I've
got approximate this geometry let's

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:42.500
got approximate this geometry let's
 

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.870
got approximate this geometry let's
calculate it on the CPU let's not even

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880
calculate it on the CPU let's not even
 

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.430
calculate it on the CPU let's not even
get the GPU involved and sometimes like

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440
get the GPU involved and sometimes like
 

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.570
get the GPU involved and sometimes like
you that's your best choice right

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:46.580
you that's your best choice right
 

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.400
you that's your best choice right
because especially if you've if you've

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:48.410
because especially if you've if you've
 

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:54.270
because especially if you've if you've
got things where you've got a lot of

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280
 

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.830
recursion and your other version yeah at

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:56.840
recursion and your other version yeah at
 

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.290
recursion and your other version yeah at
work looks like yeah yeah yeah

00:49:59.290 --> 00:49:59.300
work looks like yeah yeah yeah
 

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.570
work looks like yeah yeah yeah
feedback great feedback yeah so so let's

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:01.580
feedback great feedback yeah so so let's
 

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.420
feedback great feedback yeah so so let's
say you're doing an IIR filter which

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:04.430
say you're doing an IIR filter which
 

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:07.450
say you're doing an IIR filter which
which depends on feeding back the

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:07.460
which depends on feeding back the
 

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.150
which depends on feeding back the
results of previous calculations well

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160
results of previous calculations well
 

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.850
results of previous calculations well
nuts that's incredibly difficult for a

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:12.860
nuts that's incredibly difficult for a
 

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:18.190
nuts that's incredibly difficult for a
GPU to do well because unless you're

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200
GPU to do well because unless you're
 

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.070
GPU to do well because unless you're
doing doing entire frame buffers at a

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:21.080
doing doing entire frame buffers at a
 

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.260
doing doing entire frame buffers at a
time right so but CPUs for well you know

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.270
time right so but CPUs for well you know
 

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.220
time right so but CPUs for well you know
and that's one of they goes great on

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:24.230
and that's one of they goes great on
 

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:25.510
and that's one of they goes great on
these on these newer devices we have

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520
these on these newer devices we have
 

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.480
these on these newer devices we have
some very very powerful GPUs with you

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:28.490
some very very powerful GPUs with you
 

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.010
some very very powerful GPUs with you
know vector processing built into them

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:30.020
know vector processing built into them
 

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.450
know vector processing built into them
you know neons can do a lot of really

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:31.460
you know neons can do a lot of really
 

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.280
you know neons can do a lot of really
cool stuff so it definitely is an

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:33.290
cool stuff so it definitely is an
 

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:35.470
cool stuff so it definitely is an
opportunity to actually go and balance

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480
opportunity to actually go and balance
 

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.790
opportunity to actually go and balance
some of the load between the CPU and GPU

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800
some of the load between the CPU and GPU
 

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.560
some of the load between the CPU and GPU
and and especially when you get into

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:38.570
and and especially when you get into
 

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.330
and and especially when you get into
these tyler's you can really you can

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:40.340
these tyler's you can really you can
 

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.650
these tyler's you can really you can
start to guess at what they're gonna do

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:41.660
start to guess at what they're gonna do
 

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.440
start to guess at what they're gonna do
badly and you'll usually be right all

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:44.450
badly and you'll usually be right all
 

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:44.890
badly and you'll usually be right all
right

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:44.900
right
 

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.260
right
I think and then that's it the world's

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:47.270
I think and then that's it the world's
 

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:49.030
I think and then that's it the world's
world record for longest answer to

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040
world record for longest answer to
 

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.030
world record for longest answer to
complete yeah question yeah is there

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040
complete yeah question yeah is there
 

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.500
complete yeah question yeah is there
anything else on this stream that's an

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:53.510
anything else on this stream that's an
 

00:50:53.510 --> 00:51:07.900
anything else on this stream that's an
interesting at all well I guess at some

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:07.910
interesting at all well I guess at some
 

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.120
interesting at all well I guess at some
point way way in the distant future the

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:10.130
point way way in the distant future the
 

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.820
point way way in the distant future the
thing is we keep pushing kind of two

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:12.830
thing is we keep pushing kind of two
 

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:14.710
thing is we keep pushing kind of two
things one is the is the expectations

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720
things one is the is the expectations
 

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.090
things one is the is the expectations
for quality so you know well you know

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:16.100
for quality so you know well you know
 

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.560
for quality so you know well you know
we're we're pushing more geometry or

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:17.570
we're we're pushing more geometry or
 

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.030
we're we're pushing more geometry or
pushing more textures or pushing more

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040
pushing more textures or pushing more
 

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.010
pushing more textures or pushing more
layering and so we're keeping up with

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:21.020
layering and so we're keeping up with
 

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.210
layering and so we're keeping up with
the hardware the second thing is we're

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:22.220
the hardware the second thing is we're
 

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.710
the hardware the second thing is we're
going a higher resolution you know I

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720
going a higher resolution you know I
 

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.090
going a higher resolution you know I
mean and every time we go higher

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:25.100
mean and every time we go higher
 

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.470
mean and every time we go higher
resolution it's kind of funny we sort of

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480
resolution it's kind of funny we sort of
 

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.390
resolution it's kind of funny we sort of
take a step forward and a step back step

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400
take a step forward and a step back step
 

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.190
take a step forward and a step back step
forward in the step yeah exactly

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200
forward in the step yeah exactly
 

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.230
forward in the step yeah exactly
well and so I have my own personal

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240
well and so I have my own personal
 

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.720
well and so I have my own personal
answer for you and of course the answer

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:34.730
answer for you and of course the answer
 

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:35.380
answer for you and of course the answer
is yes

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:35.390
is yes
 

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:40.300
is yes
see JavaScript right yeah because I mean

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:40.310
see JavaScript right yeah because I mean
 

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.690
see JavaScript right yeah because I mean
that's why we have the

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.700
that's why we have the
 

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.010
that's why we have the
is because this incredibly inefficient

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:45.020
is because this incredibly inefficient
 

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.290
is because this incredibly inefficient
mode of programming that that grew out

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300
mode of programming that that grew out
 

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.320
mode of programming that that grew out
of a markup language and and an

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:51.330
of a markup language and and an
 

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.160
of a markup language and and an
experiment in computer science yeah as

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:54.170
experiment in computer science yeah as
 

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:56.930
experiment in computer science yeah as
now become capable of running almost

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940
now become capable of running almost
 

00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.240
now become capable of running almost
anything as long as you're on a

00:51:59.240 --> 00:51:59.250
anything as long as you're on a
 

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.100
anything as long as you're on a
massively multi-core computer with

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:01.110
massively multi-core computer with
 

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:05.420
massively multi-core computer with
gigabytes of RAM exactly but on moat and

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:05.430
gigabytes of RAM exactly but on moat and
 

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.550
gigabytes of RAM exactly but on moat and
and so I think that that trend will

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:07.560
and so I think that that trend will
 

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.350
and so I think that that trend will
probably continue especially now that

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:09.360
probably continue especially now that
 

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.920
probably continue especially now that
we've really gotten for multi-core into

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:12.930
we've really gotten for multi-core into
 

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.600
we've really gotten for multi-core into
the desktops but here's the problem

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:14.610
the desktops but here's the problem
 

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.040
the desktops but here's the problem
for a certain class of games I think

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:16.050
for a certain class of games I think
 

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.900
for a certain class of games I think
well won't have to optimize here's a

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:17.910
well won't have to optimize here's a
 

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.640
well won't have to optimize here's a
problem for mobile the little thing I

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:19.650
problem for mobile the little thing I
 

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.560

transatlantic ocean liners can produce
 

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:40.820
transatlantic ocean liners can produce
huge amounts of horsepower so I guess we

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:40.830
huge amounts of horsepower so I guess we
 

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.500
huge amounts of horsepower so I guess we
don't have to worry about designing cars

sometimes the reason why people stop
playing mobile games like this game is

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:00.870
playing mobile games like this game is
 

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.990
playing mobile games like this game is
sucking away all of my battery and you

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000
sucking away all of my battery and you
 

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.310
sucking away all of my battery and you
know you're being more efficient is

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:04.320
know you're being more efficient is
 

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.020
know you're being more efficient is
always better you know that being said

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:06.030
always better you know that being said
 

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:07.460

you know what we are getting to a point
in which certain kinds of optimizations

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.090
in which certain kinds of optimizations
 

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.150
in which certain kinds of optimizations
aren't as important yes and for a lot of

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160
aren't as important yes and for a lot of
 

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.350
aren't as important yes and for a lot of
games I mean there's research there's a

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:12.360
games I mean there's research there's a
 

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.030
games I mean there's research there's a
lot of there's a whole series of games

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040
lot of there's a whole series of games
 

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.140
lot of there's a whole series of games
it just doesn't have to care about

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:15.150
it just doesn't have to care about
 

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:17.810
it just doesn't have to care about
certain things but memory is always an

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:17.820
certain things but memory is always an
 

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.400
certain things but memory is always an
important resource we have a lot of

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:19.410
important resource we have a lot of
 

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:20.960
important resource we have a lot of
devices that have you know different

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:20.970
devices that have you know different
 

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.060
devices that have you know different
sciences of vm's different sizes of

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:23.070
sciences of vm's different sizes of
 

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:25.400
sciences of vm's different sizes of
actual physical memory different amounts

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:25.410
actual physical memory different amounts
 

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:26.780
actual physical memory different amounts
of stuff that's running on top of them

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:26.790
of stuff that's running on top of them
 

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:28.340
of stuff that's running on top of them
so it's always good to be resource

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:28.350
so it's always good to be resource
 

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:29.990
so it's always good to be resource
sensitive on you know all these resource

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000
sensitive on you know all these resource
 

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.130
sensitive on you know all these resource
constrains but there are trade-offs you

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:31.140
constrains but there are trade-offs you
 

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.780
constrains but there are trade-offs you
know I mean yeah sometimes you can you

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:32.790
know I mean yeah sometimes you can you
 

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.670
know I mean yeah sometimes you can you
can trade memory for greater CPU

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680
can trade memory for greater CPU
 

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.710
can trade memory for greater CPU
absolutely that's less the case in it

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720
absolutely that's less the case in it
 

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.660
absolutely that's less the case in it
than it used to be and CPUs have really

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:38.670
than it used to be and CPUs have really
 

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:40.790
than it used to be and CPUs have really
gotten fast in memory buses have like I

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800
gotten fast in memory buses have like I
 

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.900
gotten fast in memory buses have like I
mean we you know we could we could make

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:41.910
mean we you know we could we could make
 

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.250
mean we you know we could we could make
cars more efficient today we could build

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260
cars more efficient today we could build
 

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.560
cars more efficient today we could build
them out of titanium but the problem is

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:45.570
them out of titanium but the problem is
 

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.690
them out of titanium but the problem is
they really really really expensive and

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700
they really really really expensive and
 

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:48.440
they really really really expensive and
no one would buy them

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:48.450
no one would buy them
 

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:50.240
no one would buy them
so you December you I think don't you

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:50.250
so you December you I think don't you
 

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.700
so you December you I think don't you
have a titanium car no don't but that

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:52.710
have a titanium car no don't but that
 

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:55.370
have a titanium car no don't but that
sounds like a brilliant circuit exactly

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380
sounds like a brilliant circuit exactly
 

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.470
sounds like a brilliant circuit exactly
yeah I know people do that it's a beard

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480
yeah I know people do that it's a beard
 

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:04.130
yeah I know people do that it's a beard
that's so any case you know so so I mean

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140
that's so any case you know so so I mean
 

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.150
that's so any case you know so so I mean
there's a point in which obviously

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160
there's a point in which obviously
 

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.620
there's a point in which obviously
you're what I'm saying is that in terms

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:06.630
you're what I'm saying is that in terms
 

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:08.060
you're what I'm saying is that in terms
of efficiency there's a point in what

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:08.070
of efficiency there's a point in what
 

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:09.530
of efficiency there's a point in what
you want to say you have to stop and say

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540
you want to say you have to stop and say
 

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.790
you want to say you have to stop and say
look it's just not worth it we've hit

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800
look it's just not worth it we've hit
 

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.040
look it's just not worth it we've hit
the 90-95 percentile of what you know

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:13.050
the 90-95 percentile of what you know
 

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:15.410
the 90-95 percentile of what you know
what we're going to get but I think that

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420
what we're going to get but I think that
 

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:17.120
what we're going to get but I think that
that you know especially in mobile it's

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:17.130
that you know especially in mobile it's
 

00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:19.250
that you know especially in mobile it's
it's it's force us to relook at

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260
it's it's force us to relook at
 

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:20.720
it's it's force us to relook at
efficiency and say you know this is

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:20.730
efficiency and say you know this is
 

00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:21.830
efficiency and say you know this is
really important stuff which is fun

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:21.840
really important stuff which is fun
 

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.940
really important stuff which is fun
because we love it but we're computer

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:22.950
because we love it but we're computer
 

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.130
because we love it but we're computer
scientists oh yeah and we love actually

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:25.140
scientists oh yeah and we love actually
 

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.330
scientists oh yeah and we love actually
looking at those kinds of problems

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:26.340
looking at those kinds of problems
 

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.360
looking at those kinds of problems
remember though that actually speed is

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:29.370
remember though that actually speed is
 

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.090
remember though that actually speed is
not as important as it once was but

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:32.100
not as important as it once was but
 

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.910
not as important as it once was but
smoothness is so a lot of times we're

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920
smoothness is so a lot of times we're
 

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:37.930
smoothness is so a lot of times we're
doing things that don't actually

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:37.940
doing things that don't actually
 

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.460
doing things that don't actually
increase the speed of the application

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:40.470
increase the speed of the application
 

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.360
increase the speed of the application
what they do is increase the

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:41.370
what they do is increase the
 

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.970
what they do is increase the
responsiveness and make certain that the

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980
responsiveness and make certain that the
 

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.710
responsiveness and make certain that the
animations can play at 60 frames per

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720
animations can play at 60 frames per
 

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.140
animations can play at 60 frames per
second so making something twice as fast

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:48.150
second so making something twice as fast
 

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.380
second so making something twice as fast
isn't hard making it consistently 60 FPS

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:51.390
isn't hard making it consistently 60 FPS
 

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.290
isn't hard making it consistently 60 FPS
when you start it out at 15 FPS or 30

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300
when you start it out at 15 FPS or 30
 

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.530
when you start it out at 15 FPS or 30
FPS is often extremely difficult because

00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540
FPS is often extremely difficult because
 

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.570
FPS is often extremely difficult because
especially if you're trying to make it

00:55:59.570 --> 00:55:59.580
especially if you're trying to make it
 

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.850
especially if you're trying to make it
consistent consistent yeah and and if

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:01.860
consistent consistent yeah and and if
 

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.410
consistent consistent yeah and and if
you're trying to you know one of the one

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420
you're trying to you know one of the one
 

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.850
you're trying to you know one of the one
of the real challenges on Android is

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:04.860
of the real challenges on Android is
 

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.500
of the real challenges on Android is
you're trying to use a very small amount

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:06.510
you're trying to use a very small amount
 

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:07.109
you're trying to use a very small amount
of memory

00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119
of memory
 

00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:08.999
of memory
targeting a very high-resolution screen

00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:09.009
targeting a very high-resolution screen
 

00:56:09.009 --> 00:56:12.120
targeting a very high-resolution screen
and and you are fighting the fact that

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:12.130
and and you are fighting the fact that
 

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:13.319
and and you are fighting the fact that
you thought you also have garbage

00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:13.329
you thought you also have garbage
 

00:56:13.329 --> 00:56:14.880
you thought you also have garbage
collection going on that's every once in

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:14.890
collection going on that's every once in
 

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:15.930
collection going on that's every once in
a while that's gonna take 20 30

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:15.940
a while that's gonna take 20 30
 

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.450
a while that's gonna take 20 30
milliseconds I love how a very small

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:18.460
milliseconds I love how a very small
 

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.960
milliseconds I love how a very small
amount of memory yeah I know and is yeah

00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:21.970
amount of memory yeah I know and is yeah
 

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:23.970
amount of memory yeah I know and is yeah
like 64 megabytes of memory you know is

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:23.980
like 64 megabytes of memory you know is
 

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.789
like 64 megabytes of memory you know is
well you know right or you know I mean

00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799
well you know right or you know I mean
 

00:56:26.799 --> 00:56:28.920
well you know right or you know I mean
if we have a gig or two gigs and in a

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:28.930
if we have a gig or two gigs and in a
 

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.870
if we have a gig or two gigs and in a
new device I mean that's like I used to

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880
new device I mean that's like I used to
 

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.150
new device I mean that's like I used to
dream of that well exactly I mean I

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160
dream of that well exactly I mean I
 

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.920
dream of that well exactly I mean I
actually I actually remember that 16

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:34.930
actually I actually remember that 16
 

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.039
actually I actually remember that 16
megabytes of memory for Michigan for a

00:56:38.039 --> 00:56:38.049
megabytes of memory for Michigan for a
 

00:56:38.049 --> 00:56:39.930
megabytes of memory for Michigan for a
computer was just something beyond like

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:39.940
computer was just something beyond like
 

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.609
computer was just something beyond like
that was what professional photo

00:56:41.609 --> 00:56:41.619
that was what professional photo
 

00:56:41.619 --> 00:56:43.589
that was what professional photo
workstations had and that was like five

00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599
workstations had and that was like five
 

00:56:43.599 --> 00:56:45.059
workstations had and that was like five
thousand dollars were their memories

00:56:45.059 --> 00:56:45.069
thousand dollars were their memories
 

00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:46.200
thousand dollars were their memories
it's the fact that we have that for a

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:46.210
it's the fact that we have that for a
 

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.819
it's the fact that we have that for a
process so you know it's always good to

00:56:47.819 --> 00:56:47.829
process so you know it's always good to
 

00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:49.410
process so you know it's always good to
take these things into consideration but

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:49.420
take these things into consideration but
 

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.029
take these things into consideration but
that's when I when I talk about quality

00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039
that's when I when I talk about quality
 

00:56:51.039 --> 00:56:52.769
that's when I when I talk about quality
you know the quality keeps going up we

00:56:52.769 --> 00:56:52.779
you know the quality keeps going up we
 

00:56:52.779 --> 00:56:54.029
you know the quality keeps going up we
keep finding ways of using this

00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039
keep finding ways of using this
 

00:56:54.039 --> 00:56:55.739
keep finding ways of using this
computing resource so I think that we're

00:56:55.739 --> 00:56:55.749
computing resource so I think that we're
 

00:56:55.749 --> 00:56:57.089
computing resource so I think that we're
not gonna be at a time anytime soon

00:56:57.089 --> 00:56:57.099
not gonna be at a time anytime soon
 

00:56:57.099 --> 00:56:58.859
not gonna be at a time anytime soon
maybe 20 30 years out we're gonna be

00:56:58.859 --> 00:56:58.869
maybe 20 30 years out we're gonna be
 

00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:00.989
maybe 20 30 years out we're gonna be
saying yeah you know we don't need to

00:57:00.989 --> 00:57:00.999
saying yeah you know we don't need to
 

00:57:00.999 --> 00:57:03.420
saying yeah you know we don't need to
worry about this but I think that for we

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:03.430
worry about this but I think that for we
 

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.220
worry about this but I think that for we
still have a pretty long cycle before

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:05.230
still have a pretty long cycle before
 

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:09.239
still have a pretty long cycle before
that stuff becomes unimportant yep all

00:57:09.239 --> 00:57:09.249
that stuff becomes unimportant yep all
 

00:57:09.249 --> 00:57:10.559
that stuff becomes unimportant yep all
right I think I think is there anything

00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:10.569
right I think I think is there anything
 

00:57:10.569 --> 00:57:13.220
right I think I think is there anything
