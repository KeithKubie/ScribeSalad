this episode of fun science is brought
to you by brilliant oh wait where is the

F who who's got the f okay everyone
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.900
F who who's got the f okay everyone
makes mistakes in this episode oh it's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
makes mistakes in this episode oh it's
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.269
makes mistakes in this episode oh it's
fun yeah now although we all mess up

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
fun yeah now although we all mess up
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.099
fun yeah now although we all mess up
from time to time when we do make

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
from time to time when we do make
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.630
from time to time when we do make
mistakes we tend to blame ourselves

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
mistakes we tend to blame ourselves
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.080
mistakes we tend to blame ourselves
which seems logical right but to what

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
which seems logical right but to what
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.850
which seems logical right but to what
extent are we really at fault for the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
extent are we really at fault for the
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010
extent are we really at fault for the
errors we make for example take some of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
errors we make for example take some of
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.950
errors we make for example take some of
the past scientific mistakes we've made

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960
the past scientific mistakes we've made
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.540
the past scientific mistakes we've made
some people used to believe that the Sun

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
some people used to believe that the Sun
 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030
some people used to believe that the Sun
revolved around the earth today we know

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
revolved around the earth today we know
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.979
revolved around the earth today we know
that this isn't true from a celestial

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
that this isn't true from a celestial
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.869
that this isn't true from a celestial
perspective it's obvious to us that the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
perspective it's obvious to us that the
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.430
perspective it's obvious to us that the
earth and the other planets revolve

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
earth and the other planets revolve
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560
earth and the other planets revolve
around the Sun however based on our

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
around the Sun however based on our
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.229
around the Sun however based on our
day-to-day sensory experience it kind of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
day-to-day sensory experience it kind of
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.910
day-to-day sensory experience it kind of
makes sense why people might have made

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
makes sense why people might have made
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040
makes sense why people might have made
this mistake as from here on earth we

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
this mistake as from here on earth we
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810
this mistake as from here on earth we
experience the Sun as being the object

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
experience the Sun as being the object
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.170
experience the Sun as being the object
that moves through the sky

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
that moves through the sky
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.969
 
from an evolutionary point of view we

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
from an evolutionary point of view we
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.980
from an evolutionary point of view we
use our senses to gather knowledge about

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990
use our senses to gather knowledge about
 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.540
use our senses to gather knowledge about
the world in order to survive but can we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550
the world in order to survive but can we
 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.280
the world in order to survive but can we
always trust our senses to give us an

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290
always trust our senses to give us an
 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.550
always trust our senses to give us an
accurate picture of reality where I love

we'd be able to see way more of the
 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.999
we'd be able to see way more of the
stuff that is actually all around us

stuff that is actually all around us
 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.080

okay

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090
okay
 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.690
okay
so maybe we don't see everything but we

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700
so maybe we don't see everything but we
 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.880
so maybe we don't see everything but we
at least notice the obvious stuff right

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890
at least notice the obvious stuff right
 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.370

participants were asked to watch a video
 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
participants were asked to watch a video
of people passing balls and count how

wearing white however what Harvard the
participants failed to notice was the

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929
participants failed to notice was the
 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.469

to see the obvious stuff when our
attention is elsewhere however even if

how certain we might believe we are and
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.960
how certain we might believe we are and
in terms of science that actually means

in terms of science that actually means
 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.630
in terms of science that actually means
that technically no scientific theories

so the reason I was taught about the Big

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960
so the reason I was taught about the Big
 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.590
so the reason I was taught about the Big
Bang in school is because nobody's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600
Bang in school is because nobody's

proven that very wrong oh thank God I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740
proven that very wrong oh thank God I

suck for the scientists who find out

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
suck for the scientists who find out

their theories are wrong

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
their theories are wrong
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.490
their theories are wrong
well while there might be the case for

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500
well while there might be the case for
 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.320
well while there might be the case for
the individual scientist on the whole

when mistakes are discovered in science

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170

it's actually as valuable to the process

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300
it's actually as valuable to the process
 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.950
it's actually as valuable to the process
as any other scientific discovery

as any other scientific discovery
so yes everyone makes mistakes but the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420
so yes everyone makes mistakes but the
 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.880
so yes everyone makes mistakes but the
next time you mess up why not try

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890
next time you mess up why not try
 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.770
next time you mess up why not try
treating your failure like science does

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780
treating your failure like science does
 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.840
treating your failure like science does
as something you can learn from making

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850
as something you can learn from making

of course if you do just want to make

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170
of course if you do just want to make
 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.110
of course if you do just want to make
less mistakes the best way to avoid them

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120
less mistakes the best way to avoid them
 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.090
less mistakes the best way to avoid them
is by practicing and if you want a great

why not check out brilliant the neat

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090
why not check out brilliant the neat
 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.730
why not check out brilliant the neat
thing about brilliant is that because it

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740
thing about brilliant is that because it
 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.440
