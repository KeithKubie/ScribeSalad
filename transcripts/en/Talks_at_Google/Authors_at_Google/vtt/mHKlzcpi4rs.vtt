00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.510
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Hi. [clapping] Alright. Well,
thank you, um, thanks a lot, Kate. It's great

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.059
to be here. It's always fun to be at Google.
Um. And I kind of was thinking uh as I as

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.510
I headed down here, that, uh, it was particularly
right to be talking about this book at Google,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.289
given Google's own mission, um, to organize
all the world's information and and make it

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:10.470
universally accessible. Um, I think the the
topic of transparency ought to be and probably

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.480
is, ah, quite close to the hearts of of lots
of people who who support that mission. Um,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.860
so I'm hoping that, ah, we'll get a chance
to to um sort of engage in a little bit of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.320
a dialog about how you think about WikiLeaks
and how you think about the larger transparency

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.100
movement as it relates also to what Google
does. Um, 'cause I think, uh, um, you know,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.530
we live in in a rapidly changing world and
a big piece of that change is is ah ah being

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.409
fostered at places like this.
Um, I'm gonna start by actually talking about

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.350
just two quick episodes that have nothing
to do with WikiLeaks. Um, and just to say

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.990
I wrote this book, ah, very quickly, it's
not a big book. It's a little book. It's meant

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:12.560
to be, uh, in some ways, a connect, a connect-the-dots
kind of book. Because when WikiLeaks happened,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.019
I thought while all this attention is going
to Julian Assange and Bradley Manning and

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.550
there are all kinds of important questions
raised by ah what they've done, but um there's

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.150
a danger that, you know, our media will just
obsess on, you know, the celebrity aspect

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.980
of this and miss the larger picture. And the
larger picture is that what WikiLeaks represents

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:45.319
is a symptom of a of a larger trend. Um, and
if Julian Assange and WikiLeaks didn't exist,

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.510
um, sooner or later somebody would have done
this. The technology to do this, build the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.310
state list platform or multi-state platform
that's relatively free from state intervention

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.939
to enable whistle blowers to post internal
documents, that this has been coming. Um,

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.431
and I suspect a year from now we may not be
talking about Julian Assange anymore, but

00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:16.920
we will certainly be talking about this larger
phenomenon of user-generated transparency.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.659
Um, so I wanted to just start by by with two
quick episodes.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.079
The first one is, ah, is there anybody here
from Croatia? OK, so you've probably not heard

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.549
of this story, um, so ah, one of the people
I profile in the book in the section about

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.709
the international transparency movement is
a guy named Marko Rakar, who several years

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:47.239
ago he had a printing business, um, and ah,
a tax auditor came to him and basically demanded

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:54.980
a bribe, ah, in order to get a clean tax bill.
And Marko refused to pay the bribe and as

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.340
a result this guy basically hounded his hounded
him out of business, drove his printing business

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.760
into bankruptcy. And this was early in the
days of blogging and he decided to start a

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.200
blog called Pollitika, which is sort of like
the Daily Kos. Uh, is it's one of these sites

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.630
where you have uh anybody can create an account
and um participate, not just the blogger who

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.630
started it, and it's evolved into the leading
political blog in Croatia, a country of about

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.700
ah eight, seven, eight million people. Um,
it's probably got ah you know five or six

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.010
thousand core contributors, um, and, you know
it's one of the top-read sites in the country.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.400
Um, and Marko is, is, uh, part of a generation
of people in Croatia who are trying to move

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.660
that country from being very much an authoritarian
system to something that's more open and democratic.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:02.860
Um, two years ago somebody leaked him a database
of the entire, uh, voter file for Croatia.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.970
Um, Croatia has this weird circumstance which
is that it has more registered voters than

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:19.340
it has citizens. Um, and that's partly a relic
of being part of Yugoslavia and that you know

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.850
people you know the boundaries of Croatia
include people who, like, probably lived across

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.800
the road from where the boundary was put,
OK, but ah the fact is is that they don't

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.180
police registration very well and there's
a ton of corruption around voter registration

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:44.210
because if you're, ah, well first of all you
get some benefits, ah, but more importantly

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.750
local officials use it to cement their power.
So he got this database and he um had the

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.240
uh wisdom to put it online in a searchable
way so that you could look up any village

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.830
and any address and see how many people were
registered to vote at that address and people

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.600
started swarming into this, on his site, and
discovered towns where like there'd be an

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.870
address like ah you know the town of Dusina,
there'd be an address the equivalent of 0

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.880
Broadway, OK, and it has 400 people registered
at it, OK? And what was quickly exposed is

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.470
the fact that local mayors or local police
were letting people register at fake addresses,

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.660
using their votes to stay in office in local
elections, right? So this is about keeping

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.530
local power structures intact. Um, by posting
this database Marko set off a firestorm in

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.450
the country. It was top headlines, in every
paper, on the evening news and it set off

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:52.810
ah a debate which is now culminating in a
constitutional change that will prevent it

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.790
anyone from being registered to vote in more
than one country. [laughter] Right, you're

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.160
in Croatia, you can only be registered to
vote in Croatia. Um, so they're starting to

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:08.650
fix their process.
More recently, um, I need to be careful about

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.812
how I describe this, somebody posted a database,
and this one was not posted in in Croatia,

00:07:15.812 --> 00:07:22.570
it was posted in the United States, but in
Croatian of all the veterans in Croatia receiving

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:29.250
veterans' benefits. [audience member chuckles]
OK? Um and there were something like 500,000

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.381
names on the list. And to be a veteran means
you get like subsided health care, you can

00:07:34.381 --> 00:07:40.370
get, uh, you can buy imports without paying
high tariffs, ah you get cheap loans to buy

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.530
a house. And there were more than 500,000
names on the list. The problem is, is that

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:52.750
when the war, when the Balkan war ended, there
were only 300,000 veterans. The ruling party

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.240
had been adding names to the list of whoever
they wanted to do a favor for and so they

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:04.150
discovered when this list was posted that
there were politicians who had maybe, quote,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:10.000
"served a week" ah who were being listed as
veterans and getting these benefits. Um, when

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.250
this happened Marko was arrested. He was briefly
held, uh, by the police. They searched all

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.840
his computers. Uh, they couldn't find anything,
luckily for him. Um and if you say to Marco,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:30.139
well ah nobody, you know, if you ask him who
leaked the databases, you know, nobody knows.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:34.640
If you say to him, well, nobody really knows
how the data was leaked, he'll say, "Well,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:45.900
actually it was on CDs" um, with a wink. OK?
I think of Marko as a data transparency revolutionary.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.700
Um, and I think there are lots of people like
him around the world. But I think it's important

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:57.480
to ask a question about him. So the second
database, the one with the veterans benefits,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.580
that was posted on servers in the United States,
it actually, like, was hit millions of times

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.590
in the first few weeks uh that it came out,
the demand from inside Croatia was so big.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:14.940
But what if, I don't know, let's say Croatia
was like a really close ally of the United

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:22.180
States and some senator, you know, called
on the company that was hosting the servers

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:29.080
to take it down because it was stolen material,
right, and then that company took it down,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.760
kicked them off their servers, what would
we think?

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:41.430
Um, the second story I want to tell you is
about um the problem of, I guess, I guess,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:47.290
I would call this the problem of illegitimate
secrecy of when governments try to hide information

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:54.350
that citizens know should also be let loose
into the world to, uh, expose and deal with

00:09:54.350 --> 00:10:01.790
corruption. Um it's the case of the British
Parliament, uh, expense records, people familiar

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:09.640
with this story? Um, I mean for years uh,
a couple of journalists have been like foyering

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:16.070
the British Parliament to release the expense
records and they've been just you know deny,

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:22.370
deny, deny, drag their feet, um, after about
five years the Parliament, and exposure in

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:28.800
other ways, the Parliament finally set up
a committee, ah, to start to release the records.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.410
Um, what they were really doing is they set
up a internal secret redaction unit to clean

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:42.800
up the records before they were released so
nothing embarrassing would come out. So, ah,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.450
in May of 2009 the Telegraph, the British
newspaper the Telegraph, actually started

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:52.830
publishing the unexpurgated records and they
were leaked to them by a a guy named John

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:58.190
Wick who is a former SAS officer who is actually
the intermediary for an anonymous source.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.180
We don't know who that person was, we believe
it's somebody who was actually on the staff

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:09.960
of this redaction unit. Um, and Heather Brooke,
who was the journalist who was doing all these

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.210
foyer requests writes about this, she says,
"Some of the people on the staff of that unit

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.970
were so disgusted by what they saw and by
the lies being told about the delays in releasing

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:25.390
the information that they made a copy of the
data, a mole inside the redaction room made

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:31.100
a copy, later passed it to John Wick." Wick
says that he also was told that critical information

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.560
was being removed from the files that would
prevent many of the expense scandals from

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.290
being revealed and he said to the, to the
Telegraph at the time, "The ultimate source

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:45.451
was adamant that the key thing was that both
the information and the way in which it was

00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:49.490
handled should be in the public domain and
that its release was in the public interest."

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.149
Wick also told the press he was personally
dismayed at how much information the government

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:59.160
was collecting on the public and how poorly
it was keeping that information private, saying,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.020
"We've reached the stage in society where
they want to know everything about us, I think

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:11.310
we're entitled to know about them." Now as
a result of this leak, again, it set off a

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:18.990
huge bi-partisan or tri-partisan, uh, political
scandal in England. Uh, various people lost

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:25.910
their jobs including the Speaker of the Parliament,
who's more of a functionary than he is a political

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:32.529
figure but he was covering everybody else's
asses. Um, it also put, lit a fire under the

00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:37.810
open data movement in British government and
it's why a guy like Tim Berners-Lee has actually

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.970
been able to get in and work with both first
the Labor Government and now more recently

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:48.041
the Conservative Government on all the open
data stuff that the Brits have been doing

00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:53.040
which is actually uh at least as good if not
better than what the Obama administration

00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:00.330
has been doing. So here's a case where a leak
by a conscientious insider, uh, has really,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.960
um, had dramatically positive effects even
though it was extremely disruptive and embarrassing,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:12.190
um, to people in power.
So I, I wanted to open with both of those

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:19.899
stories because I think they, uh, point to
the larger promise of the transparency movement.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:29.390
Um, which I think is both a top down and a
bottom up ah kind of thing. Um, the top down

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.830
is from enlightened insiders who recognize
the power of open data and open information

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:42.770
to make institutions work better and to enable
us, the citizens, to do things together and

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:49.400
with government to make, ah, the whole civic
sector work better. Um, and it's also gonna

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.860
happen from the bottom up with people doing
it to the powers that be.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:03.399
Um, how many people here know why Bradley
Manning said he, uh, leaked the stuff that

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:08.589
he leaked, assuming he did indeed do it to
give it to WikiLeaks, which is alleged at

00:14:08.589 --> 00:14:15.010
this point, right? Anybody here know what
he, what the reasons are? So all we have right

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:21.720
now are the chat logs that Adrian Lamo, uh,
leaked to Wired magazine and which uh have

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:28.399
been posted, but in those, um and we also
have the back and forth between uh Bradley

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:32.480
Manning and his lawyer, uh, and he has one
friend who's been allowed to visit him in

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.820
prison. So there's been little bits of data
that have come out from that and so far there's

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.500
been nothing to contradict, uh, what's in
those chat logs. And in the chat logs what

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:51.331
he says is he was serving in Iraq on a military
base, um, and he was given the assignment,

00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:57.470
he was in a low-level intelligence job, and
he was given the assignment of looking into

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:05.839
the case of 15 Iraqi insurgents who'd been
arrested by the Iraqi National Police. Um,

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:11.240
and what he discovered, he says, is that they
had been distributing a leaflet critical of

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:17.410
the Prime Minister Maliki. And the leaflet
essentially, after he got it translated, was

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:23.430
titled something like Where Did The Money
Go? It was an anti-corruption pamphlet and

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:29.019
it was dealing with publicly available information
raising questions about corruption inside

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:37.420
the government. And, uh, he got upset because
he thought that we were in Iraq to actually,

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:43.920
uh, help them develop a real democracy including
one that would ferret out corruption and wouldn't

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:51.220
arrest people for spreading that information
and, um, so he went to his superior and his

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:58.060
superior told him to shut up, do his job and,
if anything, find ways to help the Iraqi police

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:07.050
arrest more people like this. That's when
he says he had an epiphany or crisis of conscience.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.480
I mean his words, I'm not using his exact
words, I did quote some of them in the book,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:18.430
but he says at that point he started seeing
things differently. Um, now I'm not gonna

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:23.830
say whether or not it was the right thing
for him to leak everything, or you know, take

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:29.660
a huge data dump, we could debate that, I
suppose. But I do really want people to understand,

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:38.500
at heart, what Bradley Manning is, is a transparency
activist. OK? Um, and right now he has been

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:45.019
in a U.S. prison, military prison in Virginia
going on nine months, more or less solitary

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:49.720
confinement. The latest thing they've come
up with is to make him strip naked every night

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.720
and show up each morning in front of his cell
naked because he apparently joked about the

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:03.740
possibility that he could use the elastic
band in his underwear to cause himself harm.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:11.709
Um, that's happening right now in our country.
And I think he deserves his day in court.

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:19.910
He may well have to spend a long time in jail
for violating the military code, but you know,

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:25.170
don't we have a system here, rule of law,
people are supposed to get charged at some

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.040
point and have a chance to defend themselves?
It's been nine months. So.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:36.650
Uh, that's it, that's my opening remarks,
um, I'm happy to take questions uh or just

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:43.240
dive into the questions that are here. How
do you want to do this? Come to the mic. I

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.840
really believe that the people in the room
should get precedence over the folks here

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.920
unless you're one of the people who asked
one of these questions. Uh, but since there

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.140
don't seem to be that many votes on the questions
anyway unless you have to refresh the page.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.410
You want to put them up on the screen behind
so people can see? Go ahead.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.790
&gt;&gt;Male audience member#1: Isn't openness and
power, isn't openness always a threat to those

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:07.790
in power? I mean even like policemen they're
arresting people in wiretap for, for, um,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.760
recording the fact that they've stopped them
and they've, they've said outrageous things

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:18.860
to them. Um, you know, what can we do to make
it so that that you know low-level flunkies

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.950
even can use closedness to keep themselves
from getting in trouble, for being, for breaking

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.950
the law?

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.370
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Well, I look I mean I think
what's interesting about the time that we

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:35.490
live in is that the ability to share, uh,
information that matters is now in everybody's

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:41.330
hands. Um, you know, we're only a few years
into this phenomenon of everyone carrying

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:48.120
a networked printing press in their pocket.
Um, so the the old way of doing things, which

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.760
is still dominant, which is about control
of information and secrecy and lack of accountability,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:01.299
is being fundamentally threatened. Um, I mean
what Google does is fundamentally threatening

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:10.360
to the ability of people to, uh, you know,
to lie in your face. Right? Because if if

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.010
I'm talking to my member of congress at a,
in a public hearing and they, public event

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.480
or something, and they say something and I'm
like that's exactly the opposite of what you

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.670
said two years ago. I can actually look it
up, pull it up, play it back to them. Um,

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:31.890
what what happens after that? Right? That's
the moment that we're in now, um, and my argument

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:38.210
is is that we're we're in this like a paradigm
shift. It's gonna be messy and upsetting to

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:43.290
the people in power. And they're gonna say
things like, "You can't have that information.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:51.010
You stole it." Right? Um, but we now have
it. Uh, not every, in not every case because

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.910
somebody leaked it either. Right? It's just
because it's been well organized and put at

00:19:54.910 --> 00:20:01.500
our fingertips. Um, and I think that's gonna
be really really disruptive to the current

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.710
generation and profoundly positive for the
next generation. 'Cause I also think we're

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:12.630
gonna get new leaders, we're gonna get new
folks in all kinds of positions of authority

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:18.460
who are gonna go, "Well, I actually can do
a better job if I'm open." My, my constituency,

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:25.140
my audience, my patients, you know, whoever
the people are that I work with, um, my community

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.610
that I'm supposed to protect and serve can
actually make me smarter and better at what

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:37.890
I do. Right? They can be eyes and ears too.
So the issue is, ah, we have to spread that

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.480
idea, we have to, we have to advocate for
it, we have to explain to people not to be

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.960
scared, I mean a lot of the reason why I wrote
this book is not to educate folks in this

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.929
room, I think you guys live and breathe this,
in many ways you take it for granted. Um,

00:20:53.929 --> 00:21:01.280
but it's for you to be able to say to your,
you know, family, what, what is all this stuff

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:07.710
and why is it so good or bad? You know a lot
of people are scared by this big change that

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.820
we're living through. They just don't get
it. They don't see how the pieces connect

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:17.090
up. And so they're saying things like with
WikiLeaks coming out they're like, "well,

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:22.179
it would be terrible if my all my e-mails
were published or if every business transaction

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:26.930
that I ever do was splashed across the web."
And I think it's important to say to people,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:34.480
well the issue about user-generated transparency
making its way into the public arena is that

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.650
a lot of it is not going to be about your
laundry list or your shopping list, it's gonna

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:47.200
be about some powerful figure or some powerful
institution. The more powerful, the more the

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.799
transparency matters. The less powerful, I'd
argue, we need to worry about people with

00:21:53.799 --> 00:22:01.030
little power, how do we help protect legitimately,
their privacy? Right? That's a tricky balance.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.820
Um, and sometimes when somebody goes from
having very little power to having a lot,

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.940
all of a sudden, like Julian Assange I think
ought to be acting in a much more transparent

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:16.190
way than he is and a lot of the reasons why
I think he's lost credibility is because of

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:23.150
the way he behaves. He is to even the people
in his own core group much too controlling,

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.799
much too authoritarian, much too arbitrary
about his decisions. And that's why WikiLeaks

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:36.250
itself, as an organization, is some somewhat
falling apart.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.250
Other questions? Yeah.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:42.410
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #2: What do you think
about Bill Keller's um actions and the New

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:48.049
York Times' actions with regards to WikiLeaks,
uh, recently and how with the exposé and

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:50.550
basically them dropping a lot of the WikiLeaks
content?

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:56.200
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Yeah. Oh, well, I'm, uh you
know, I'm glad the New York Times decided

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.950
to participate and and you know is publishing
some stories. I think it’s a really good

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:08.299
question because of the role the New York
Times plays in the American media system.

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:14.130
Um, to sort of focus a little more closely
on what they are and not what they are doing

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.210
and what they're not doing. Um, people may
not realize it, but the New York Times has

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:25.730
the entire State Department archive, uh so
does the Guardian. Um, it's not just WikiLeaks

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.370
anymore. I don't know, there may be others.
I think there's a paper in Norway that claims

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:34.860
to have the whole thing. So when the New York
Times doesn't do a story, like right now for

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:41.880
example, Reuters had a story recently going
into detail on corruption in Saudi Arabia.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.580
There's a cable from 1996 which hasn't been
released that they refer to that specifically

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.940
describes how the Saudi royal family, uh,
sort of spreads the patronage around. Now

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.100
you might say, if you're the editor of the
New York Times, Bill Keller, that there's

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:04.740
no news in that cable because we already know
that there's a lot of, you know, patronaging

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:10.161
and corruption. But the fact that the State
Department you know that an ambassador put

00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:14.870
it in writing and there's detail and there
are names, to me that's news. Why are they

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:22.140
holding back on that cable? Um, and the only
plausible answer you can give is that the

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:29.050
New York Times is too close to the U.S. government.
Um, and that we have put a little bit too

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:36.610
much power in the hands of the Times' editor's
judgment. They have admitted, I mean, I've

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:42.080
talked to David Sanger, who's, ah, their chief
Washington correspondent, I've been on panels

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:50.190
with him, that they did not know the importance
of the cables on Tunisia. They have admitted

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:56.710
that when they got their hands on the full
cable set, that no one could possibly read

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:04.549
250,000 cables, so what did they do? They
searched on keywords. Um, you know, they did

00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:08.289
enterprise journalism the way you would, which
is, you know, they let different reporters

00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:16.000
who know different beats sort of look for
patterns. But they've never read them all.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.760
Um, no one has. Which astounds me, because
it its that could be the Rosetta stone in

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:30.780
some ways or a partial Rosetta stone to unraveling
how the world has been run for the last 10

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:37.540
or 15 years and um, you know, I think we would
agree that a lot of that information, yeah,

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:43.789
sure, redact out the names of individuals
who might be harmed because there are human

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:48.770
rights activists or they're informants and
you need to protect them. But all the other

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:54.472
stuff, why are they holding it back? Now,
they say, they send every time they do a story

00:25:54.472 --> 00:26:00.000
they check with the State Department. Which
is effectively saying we check with the government,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.660
um, and then we'll hold some things back.
Uh, um, I mean I think, you know, there ought

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.090
to be a demand put to the Times or you know
that we, I mean I've talked to a few people.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:17.720
It's a matter of figuring out whether there's
a way to press this, uh, more forcefully,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:24.240
um, to open up that archive. Uh, you know
or open it up responsibly, like turn it in

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.610
to something that you know people can check
in and do research and check out or you know

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:34.840
I'm not saying dump the whole thing on the
web indiscriminately. So I, I think there

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.679
are real questions about the Times. Um, on
the other hand, I thought Bill Keller was

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:44.860
eloquent in defending the principle of the
freedom of the press to publish this and he

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:50.730
has sort of reluctantly said that yeah, you
know, he would even defend Julian Assange's

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:57.680
right to publish. I mean it's kind of gross
the way, uh, Keller kind of wants to treat

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:04.270
Assange as this, you know, he's, I mean, I,
you know, he really has gone out of his way,

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:10.539
you know, he smells, he doesn't wash. I mean
to point those things out is is a real form

00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:15.190
of "he's not one of us, we're we're responsible
and he's not". And you know there are plenty

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:20.690
of investigative journalists who are not pleasant
people. I don't know if you know any. They,

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:26.260
they tend to be really driven, uh, somewhat
secretive, pain in the asses. I've edited

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:31.190
a few of them over the years. And, but they're
the ones who you know often do the digging

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:38.330
to expose the stuff that needs to be exposed.
Um, and I just thought Keller, at one point,

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:44.630
he did this event at Columbia and he said,
uh, something about how Assange changed his

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:51.020
mind about redacting information after Amnesty
International complained. And and Keller said

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.490
I'm sure Assange, you know his constituency
probably leans more toward the Amnesty International

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.500
crowd. And that was a defense. I mean, it
was like, why does Bill Keller think he has

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:07.659
to insult Amnesty International? They do incredibly
vital work on behalf of political, you know,

00:28:07.659 --> 00:28:12.929
I mean who else does this? You know? And they
just write letters to, you know, governments,

00:28:12.929 --> 00:28:18.549
to get them to treat their political prisoners
slightly better. So. Very troubling. The New

00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:26.490
York Times it’s a very powerful and not
very transparent institution that, uh, I think

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.030
we have to pay close attention to and try
and get them to open up.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.460
On this side.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:39.590
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #3: So your opening
stories were very fascinating and the one

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.670
involved the Croatian blogger
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Hmm

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:47.050
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #3: you asked at the
end a question whether what would we think

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:52.330
if the U.S. government shut down his website
that is currently hosted in the U.S.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.820
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Right
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #3: and I don't know

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:00.120
the answer, but I will think about it. So
instead of giving the answer that I don't

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.320
know, I ask you a similar question.
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: OK

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.910
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #3: And a similar story.
The, uh, my native country is Hungary, so

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:17.890
I, I still follow politics there and uh, there,
there was, there is, an infamous website,

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:28.020
extremely anti-Semitic website and it was
so extreme that even the Hungarian government

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:37.210
found it too extreme and it was sued and eventually
they shut it down. So among other things it

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:42.809
listed every journalist who was Jewish, his
home home address and phone number.

00:29:42.809 --> 00:29:46.120
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Umhum
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #3They were very careful

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:52.090
not say 'hey, go and kill them' right because
this would be hate speech. Only a list. Objective

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:56.549
list. Information. So what they did after
they shut down, they moved the web server

00:29:56.549 --> 00:30:04.380
to New Jersey and the and this is the end
of the story. So right now they operate it

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.910
from New Jersey and so what do you think we
should do?

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:16.520
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: It's a good question. So in
general it's a great hard question. Um. So

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:25.770
my, my personal feeling is uh that we don't
want to create a system of of you know shutting

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:35.940
down speech. Uh, as long as it's speech. OK?
Um, and so the question is, if it's direct

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:45.309
incitement of violence or not. Um, and I would
err very much on, in the direction of leave

00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:52.169
it up as long as it is not direct incitement
of violence and take other measures to protect

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:58.840
people if they need to be protected. The the
thing about posting people's personal information,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:09.340
it's offensive to do it. Um, but if you create
a system that says it can't, you know, in

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:15.370
other words that polices and can shut places
down simply for posting somebody's personal

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:22.740
information, what I worry is how that's gonna
get used when it's not something as offensive

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:30.270
as the kind of speech you're talking about,
but it's just critical of somebody in power.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:37.600
OK? Um, and you know, like, there was a recent,
uh, this came up about a year or two ago,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:45.890
uh, uh, Michael Arrington at Face, at TechCrunch
went after Facebook for leaving up groups

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:54.730
that, uh, deny the holocaust. Right? Um, and
Facebook, you know it's a messy situation

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.659
because they also don't have the manpower
to like monitor every new group as soon as

00:31:59.659 --> 00:32:07.330
it's put up so you know these groups get on
to the site and people join them and um and

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:12.580
you know so some people were just hammering
at Facebook for allowing holocaust deniers

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:19.710
to create groups on the site. And you know
Facebook's policy is as long as these groups

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:30.289
are not directly advocating violence against
others, we're gonna let them exist. It's speech.

00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:37.200
Um, and you know we have a tradition of allowing
robust free speech in the United States, uh

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:43.240
and that we generally believe the way to combat
bad speech isn't by suppressing it, but by

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:49.030
with better speech, with more speech. Um,
personally I think it's kind of a good thing

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:54.789
if you, you know, if this happens on Facebook
'cause even there, if they're enforcing their

00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:58.779
rules about you know people having to use
their real name and picture, you can kind

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:03.350
of go on these groups and go 'that person's
a holocaust denier'. You know, I mean he's

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:11.740
made himself public in a way. Um, we're not
gonna get rid of holocaust denial by hiding

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:17.860
it. We're not gonna get rid of anti-Semitism
by suppressing it. We have to, you know, we

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:24.220
have to deal with it. The way you deal with
it is by exposing it and arguing with it and

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:31.310
marginalizing it. That that's my view. The
place where it crosses over is are people

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:38.010
using these sites to organize acts of violence
against other people? That's where law, you

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:42.201
know, other laws come into play. I don't know
if that's a perfect answer. I mean, you're

00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:48.059
asking like absolutely one of the hardest
edge questions. And it's the one where those

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:54.340
of us who are civil libertarians about speech
run into trouble. You know the ACLU defended

00:33:54.340 --> 00:34:00.029
the right of the Nazis to march in a Jewish
neighborhood in Skokie, Illinois. And they

00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:05.190
lost like a quarter of their members, who
were Jewish probably, who were so offended

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:11.110
by that. But you know the point of free speech
is we have to protect unpopular speech. I

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:18.070
mean my argument about defending WikiLeaks
in part is that, it's not that I endorse every

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:24.940
single thing that they do, I just don't like
the idea that a, a, all it takes is a threatening

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:33.210
phone call from Joe Lieberman's senate office
to somebody at Amazon for Amazon to completely

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:40.940
cave in and and kick WikiLeaks off their servers.
There's no criminal case. And it's not like

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.720
WikiLeaks is posting copywrited material,
which was another one of the reasons which

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:53.089
Amazon gave for kicking WikiLeaks off their
servers. You can't copywrite government documents.

00:34:53.089 --> 00:35:01.040
They're born uncopywrited. OK? So you know
Amazon's reasons were just completely bogus.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.420
And, you know, they used to say that you should
put your stuff in the cloud because that's

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.960
a, you know, it will be more secure there.
Well now you have to worry whether the company

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:14.900
that's hosting your stuff in their cloud is
gonna, you know, uh, crumble under the tiniest

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:21.300
bit of government pressure. I mean I have
to say that I was very happy that when the

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:28.080
question was posed to Eric Schmidt, what did
you guys think about you know indexing links

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:34.410
to WikiLeaks' disclosures? He says, yeah we
had a conversation about it and we decided

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:40.920
to keep doing it 'cause it's legal. Like that's
the right answer. Later, you can, you know,

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.349
well, if there's a criminal case and fine,
we'll abide by the law. But noth-, none, none

00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:49.450
of that's happened.
Other questions? Yeah.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:54.119
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #4 Uh, do you think
the uh the way they're treating Private Manning

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:58.730
is more to get him to implicate Assange as
a co-conspirator or is it more to have a chilling

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:03.150
effect on any potential like future whistle
blowers? And do you think it will achieve

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.150
either one of those?

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.680
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: It's definitely to intimidate
other potential whistle blowers. I think they

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:15.589
really want to send a message to other people
in the Army um that you know this is worse

00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:21.530
than you know torturing people in Abu Ghraib.
You know, we're gonna, we're gonna treat you

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:26.859
worse. I mean I think it's despicable, but
that's their, you know, they this is about

00:36:26.859 --> 00:36:35.050
enforcing their chain of command. Um, and,
you know, the fact that General Petraeus could

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:44.010
leak his highly-classified proposal for expanding
the war in Afghanistan to Bob Woodward, which

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:50.460
then made front-page news on the Washington
Post and was used to undermine Obama's own

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:57.859
planning process. Right? Like nobody's, ah,
prosecuting him or or putting him in solitary.

00:36:57.859 --> 00:37:02.500
Um, so they're definitely trying to send a
message. I mean there's a theory that they're

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:10.599
also trying to break him and, and, um, somehow
get him to implicate, ah, WikiLeaks, um, I,

00:37:10.599 --> 00:37:15.660
I don't know, I don't know whether they're
that willful or its more just this is the

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:21.839
military discipline system. I mean, you know,
I recently wrote a blog post where I said

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:29.859
you know I mean if this is meant to be mental
torture, what's so troubling about it is,

00:37:29.859 --> 00:37:35.160
what it could do is that at the point of when
he does finally get his day in court he won't

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:46.720
be sane. Um, he won't be able to help present
his own case. Uh, and that would be a tragedy.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:53.140
Um, I mean let him make his case. He may not
win, you know, a military jury or judge may

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:58.570
not buy a Nuremberg defense if that's what
he's gonna argue. You know he can argue that.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:05.840
He can say, soldiers are required to report
uh war crimes under the Nuremberg precedents

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.541
which are supposed to govern. And that's all
I, you know, he could say that's what I thought

00:38:10.541 --> 00:38:16.760
I was doing. But they're accusing him of aiding
the enemy. That's a pretty serious charge.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.760
So. Yeah.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:24.470
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #5: If you'll pardon
me for a bit of a tangent. Um, you decided

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:29.900
to, uh, write a relatively short book quickly.
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Yeah.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:34.460
&gt;&gt; Male audience member #5: Um. I, could you
comment on sort of how viable this is as a

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:39.540
publishing strategy and uh whether you think
it's really, um, economically worthwhile to

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.720
put it on paper?

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.020
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Great, great, great questions.
You can also ask my editor and publisher John

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.740
Oakes over there uh after we're done 'cause
I'm sure he believes it's economically viable.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:39:02.359
Um, so the answer is, uh, I'm intrigued by
this possibility of you know the sort of shorter,

00:39:02.359 --> 00:39:08.810
quicker, you know, the timeliness of a book.
It's very frustrating as an author to write

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:14.150
a book and then have to wait nine months,
you know, for it to come out and by then you're

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:21.060
already out of date. Um, so when John came
to me in the middle of December and started

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:26.970
to, sort of, woo me into doing this, um, one
of the reasons why I thought, yeah, maybe

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.740
I could do it is because he said it just had
to be like 25,000 words and on a good day

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.770
I can write three or four thousand words if
I'm in in the right groove. So I thought,

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:40.550
you know, I can do this in a week. It ended
up taking three weeks and it was like 45,000

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:48.920
words. But, um, and then getting it out fast
is the second thing that's very gratifying.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:54.960
Um, does it make sense to still be on paper?
Well, I'm in the middle of trying to learn,

00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:03.829
you know, the plusses and minuses of e-books
myself. I mean, I do both now. Right? Um,

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:10.880
and I love the immediacy of getting that e-book.
[chuckles] Right? Um, and it works for me

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:17.180
with fiction, 'cause I really read linearly
in fiction. But I'm noticing like I, I also

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.381
have downloaded all the other WikiLeaks books
and I'm finding it really annoying that I

00:40:21.381 --> 00:40:26.851
can't, you know, sort of go to an index or,
you know, jump to somewhere in the middle.

00:40:26.851 --> 00:40:32.589
I mean when I pick up a physical book, I,
I, you know, I go like this. I, I, you know,

00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:38.200
there's a certain element of just, you know,
find where you're mentioned, [chuckles] you

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.470
know, whatever. Which I guess you could do
with search on on an e-book. But it it there's

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:51.170
something about the utility of the paper,
uh, that I like, um, that so far at least

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:57.290
on the Kindle platform, which is what I'm
using, doesn't quite do it. Um, on the other

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.970
hand, what I'm really intrigued by we're gonna
actually do, hopefully, right, we're gonna

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:09.640
turn the book into an app and we're gonna
add a couple of features to it, um, basically

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:19.099
three. Uh, one is there are about 15 places
in the book where somebody, uh, who I'm quoting

00:41:19.099 --> 00:41:24.920
actually has spoken at one of our Personal
Democracy Forum conferences. Um, so we have

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:31.180
video. Um, and you know we actually have done
a series of WikiLeaks-related events over

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.310
the last few months, so we actually have shored
video of people like Jeff Jarvis and so on,

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:41.570
you know, saying really smart things, that
if you're like really into the subject, having

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:49.010
that video right there might make it a richer
reading experience for you or a teaching experience.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:53.830
Um, so I'm really intrigued by adding that.
We're gonna add, because there are about 40

00:41:53.830 --> 00:42:00.869
or 50 websites mentioned in the book, we're
gonna add, sort of, links to screenshots and

00:42:00.869 --> 00:42:05.940
then I think if it's being done this way,
you know, click and it'll take you off, out

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:11.410
of the book to that site. And that too, I
think for, for some people, could be a nice

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:16.030
plus. And then the last thing which I'm really,
uh, which I don't think will work for my book,

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:21.880
but I'm willing to try it anyway just to be
a guinea pig, is there are one or two places

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:27.390
where I, I want to insert a discussion point
and actually ask the reader a question. So

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:33.240
this is where I had my epiphany. Alright?
This is, I tell the story in the book about

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:37.160
eight years, seven, eight years ago being
at one of Tim O'Reilly's conferences and seeing

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:43.349
people all using laptops networked with each
other and and in a back channel chat. Right?

00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:48.859
Like before it was, before Twitter, before
all the, you know, and that like blew my mind

00:42:48.859 --> 00:42:57.740
and I had this experience then of, oh, this
is gonna change like the structure of how

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:03.210
we do stuff in and I'm really curious when
everybody else has had that, you know, I think

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.900
a lot of people have had, at one point or
another, that sort of wake-up moment so I

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.140
thought let's put a spot in the book where
anybody who's reading it can, you know, stop

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:18.349
and add their comment and then the next time
you upload the book, the comment goes up to

00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:21.900
the server and then, you know, you'll see
what other people's comments are. You know,

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.750
let's make the book a discussion platform.
Um, the reason why I'm not sure it's gonna

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:33.829
work is my guess is is that you know two percent
of my readers will do that, so I need like

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:40.630
tens of thousands of readers to get a decent
number of comments. Um, but, I really, I mean

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:47.589
I'm intrigued by the e-book because I think
it, it is a, a, it can be exploded into something

00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:55.710
that's much more of a, a shared experience.
Um, like Amazon now you can read your, as

00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:00.171
you're reading, you'll see sections that have
been underlined by other people. It's, I want

00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:04.920
to know what my friends have underlined. Like
I'll read the same book that you're reading

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:12.170
and read your notes. That'll make the book
more interesting to me. Um, so yeah, I'm,

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.930
I'm fascinated by it. I'm glad you know this
sort of gives me a chance to maybe sort of

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:20.900
play in that space. So.
Um, we're almost out of time. I suppose we

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.570
should take one more, or, yeah.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:31.910
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #6: Are you sure it's
really a new paradigm? I mean if you know

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:38.080
a leak from WikiLeaks is like the fuel for
the fire, isn't a free press and a society

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.730
that wants accountability from its government
sort of the oxygen that that fire burns in?

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:48.540
And so isn't this WikiLeaks stuff just the
latest thing but it’s the same as, you know,

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.530
when Woodward and Bernstein got the list of
all the people who worked for Creep and had

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.370
to figure out who worked for who by figuring
out which phone numbers were closer together

00:44:54.370 --> 00:45:01.130
or that, you know, guy that got arrested and
you know in New Amsterdam, there's somebody,

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:02.630
Peter something or other got arrested.
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: John Peter Zenger, yeah.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:03.630
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #6: Yeah, so.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:08.710
&gt;&gt;Micah Sifry: Um, here's what's new. You're
right, because it's building on, you know,

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:14.310
we're standing on the shoulders of 500 years
of a free press or an emerging free press.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:19.310
But only in the last 10 years is it a networked
free press. I mean it used to be said, right,

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:28.869
that the freedom of the press belongs to him
who can own one. Um, I own one. Um, as long

00:45:28.869 --> 00:45:36.250
as you don't take the internet down on me,
OK? Uh, that's different. Um, the ability

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:45.430
for small and large groups to swarm around
information and keep it in the open is different.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:51.800
So I mean, I mean at some point it goes from
being a change in kind and not just a change

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.849
in degree. I, you know, we could argue it
doesn't really matter what, you know, where

00:45:56.849 --> 00:46:01.710
you come down on that argument. I mean I think
it's an acceleration that we're going through.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:12.520
Um, it may be not discontinuous. OK? Um, but
I, the way, you know, you guys you work in

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.501
an environment where you're like completely
you live and eat and breathe this. OK? Um,

00:46:17.501 --> 00:46:23.290
you know, one of the nice things I always
say to myself I'm glad I, I, you know there's

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:28.750
one piece of my life which is just purely
suburban and, you know, I'm with people who

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:35.240
are "normal." Um, so I get to see how a lot
of this is diffusing into people's lives much

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:42.000
more slowly and in very confusing and scary
ways. And I do think people need help understanding

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.930
why this is healthy and not something to just
have a knee-jerk fear response to. Um, and

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:56.079
also for younger people, how they can get
involved. Um, especially younger people, though

00:46:56.079 --> 00:47:00.480
it would be great if we could get folks with
free time, called senior citizens, more involved

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:06.640
in this too, but. Um, so that's, you know
so some of it may be is just a marketing ploy

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:12.520
to, you know, [chuckles] how do you sell ideas?
You make big claims about them. Uh, it makes

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:19.220
it easier for people to spread them. So I
do, you know, the age of transparency is one

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:26.161
way of making an argument about what's different
about now compared to, um, ten years ago.

00:47:26.161 --> 00:47:32.079
And I, I do think it's different. I mean,
it used to be that there was lots of information

00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:37.960
that was technically public, but completely
hidden in plain sight . Right? Like, unless

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:45.700
you had the time and money to drive down to
Washington D.C., make an appointment at the

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:53.109
FEC or at, uh, you know uh, uh, the House
of Representatives, where you could go into

00:47:53.109 --> 00:48:00.060
the room to open the paper records that show
who is donating to who, or how much a particular

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:06.490
member of congress was paying his staffer.
I mean that's public record, but difficult

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:14.140
to access. Now you can access it in a matter
of seconds. Uh, and when they hold it back,

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:19.869
see this is what I mean by paradigm shift.
Um, the argument for holding it back is is

00:48:19.869 --> 00:48:25.760
often, was well, we can't afford to make it
available in every library in the country,

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:31.150
so we're just gonna put it in a few. Uh, or
you know, you'll have to come make an appointment

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:36.950
to look up this information. Like the Justice
Department for example, requires every lobbyist

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:41.500
from a foreign country to register and provide
very detailed information on the lobbying

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:46.450
that they're doing. And it's only because
of the Sunlight Foundation, which I, I'm an

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:53.180
advisor to, starting to digitize those records
so that now you, because they're all written

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.630
in hand. People don't realize these are paper
records filled out in hand. You have to code

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:04.290
them in. Uh, that they're starting to move
to a system that will make those records digital

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:10.660
by default. But the argument in this day and
age is if something should be, is required

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:16.839
to be public, it should be online they those
things should become synonymous. So at Sunlight

00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:22.040
we've actually been pushing something called
the POIA bill. Public Online Information Act.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:28.819
Um, to require that going forward any document
that's generated that is required to be public

00:49:28.819 --> 00:49:35.109
is not sufficiently public until it is also
online in searchable and downloadable and

00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:41.359
machine readable format if if that's relevant.
So we have a lot of work to do. So I'm gonna

00:49:41.359 --> 00:49:48.480
end by saying, you guys, help us out. If you're
not already, ah, you know supporting Sunlight

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:54.900
for example, get involved. Go to sunlightfoundation.com.
They have a developer community of more than

00:49:54.900 --> 00:50:02.170
2,000 people who pitch in, uh, on projects.
Um, the other way to get involved is to help

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:08.510
explain it. Uh, you know, that's why I wrote
this book. Uh, give people a tool that sort

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:14.950
of put connects the dots and uh makes an argument
for why this is actually really healthy for

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:20.460
our democracy. And let's not let the people
who sort of knee jerk wanna go back to controlling

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:27.440
information and saying, "Trust us, we know
what's right", you know, to hold sway. Because

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:32.540
at the moment we are we are in a turning-point
moment. The WikiLeaks thing is a turning-point

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:37.849
moment for a lot of people in this administration
who said they were for open government and

00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:45.400
now are, you know, kind of silent, and people
who want to clamp down on, on information.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:51.010
And there are other bad ideas relating to
uh, you know, back doors into e-mail and stuff

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:55.170
like that. There's a lot of bad stuff that
these folks still would like to try and do.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:51:02.310
So, we have a fight. Anyway, thank you for
coming. We've gone our hour, right?

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.770
&gt;&gt;Female presenter: Thank you. [clapping]
