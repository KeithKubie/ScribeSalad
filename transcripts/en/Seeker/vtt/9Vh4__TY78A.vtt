00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.030
INTERVIEWER: This is a 2015
video of International Space

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.350
Station astronauts Scott Kelly,
Kjell Lindgren, and Kimiya Yui,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.660
enjoying a simple salad.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.490
Except it's not simple.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.930
It's actually the most important
salad in human history.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.770
Why?

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.400
Because these ISS astronauts
aren't just eating lettuce.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.110
They're dining on
the first lettuce

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.930
to be grown and eaten in space.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.820
And it's all thanks
to this creatively

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.010
named unit, the Vegetable
Production System,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.830
otherwise known as Veggie.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.580
Now trying to grow plants in
space isn't exactly a new idea.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.800
There have been many
attempts in the past.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.930
In 1997, bean seedlings were
grown on the Mir Space Station.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.270
And in 2012, ISS
astronaut Don Pettit

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.550
grew a zucchini
plant for a year.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.050
He even wrote a
blog about it called

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.820
"Diary of a Space Zucchini."

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.310
And NASA has been
looking into crop support

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.080
systems for over 30 years.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.980
But Project Veggie is the
first large-scale effort

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.340
to produce food crops
in space, an idea that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.710
is going to be critical
if we want astronauts

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.570
to make long duration missions
to places like Mars a reality.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.720
GIOIA MASSA: In space, if you
can get those environmental

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.930
conditions right-- the
light, the temperature,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
the atmosphere, the
nutrients, and the water--

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.360
if you can get
those right, plants

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.170
grow pretty well
and pretty similarly

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.630
as they grow on earth.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.470
INTERVIEWER: That
was Dr. Gioia Massa,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.410
who leads the Veggie team
at the Kennedy Space Center,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.870
the group responsible for
tackling the challenges

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.910
of growing plants in space.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.520
So far, the biggest of which
has been coming up with a way

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.150
to water plants in a
microgravity environment.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
GIOIA MASSA: You don't
think about how difficult it

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.400
is to water in microgravity,
or to wash your vegetables

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.960
or things like that,
until you start

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.720
to watch some of these videos
of just how water behaves

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.625
in space.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.250
INTERVIEWER: In order to tackle
the problem of providing water,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.580
nutrients, and light to plants
within a space environment,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.470
the Kennedy Space
Center teamed up

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.690
with Orbital
Technologies Corporation

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.660
to design and build
the Veggie unit.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.420
The hardware uses a
passive watering system

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.490
supported by plant pillows.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.770
These pillows are
single-use pockets

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.610
filled with soil substrate and
control released fertilizer.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.060
Embedded into the pillow is
a moisture wicking material

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.040
where seeds can be
glued and carefully

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.340
orientated to ensure
that the roots grow down

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.560
and the shoots grow up.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560
The LED light bank provides
red, blue, and green light

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.510
to help plants generate energy.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.160
And the walls of
the whole system

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.550
can be extended upward,
allowing room for growth.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.860
It was this low
mass modular system

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.980
that was sent to
the ISIS in 2014,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.400
where an astronaut set the unit
up and started to grow lettuce

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.960
as a test species.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.090
The crew also grew
zinnia flowers

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.460
to test the long-term
survival of flowering crops,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.020
like tomatoes.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.120
Initially, it was a success.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.040
The first group of
lettuce grown in Veggie

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.140
was sent back to
Earth for analysis.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.120
After those samples
were deemed edible,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.370
the ISS astronauts were
given the green light

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.430
to tuck into the second
crop of leafy greens, which

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.960
of course, they did.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.210
The zinnias, however,
were a different story.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.400
Shortly after nurturing
this bright orange flower,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.660
Scott Kelly sent this
tweet from the ISS.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.520
"Our plants aren't
looking too good.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.140
Would be a problem on Mars.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.230
I'm going to have to channel
my inner Mark Watney."

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.680
Despite channeling Mark Watney,
Scott's flowering zinnias

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.350
were dying, and there was
nothing he could do about it.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.740
GIOIA MASSA: We did get
fungus growing on the zinnia.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.590
And we were kind of
estimating water volumes

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.260
for the astronauts to
give to the plants.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.720
And our estimates
were not right.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.800
And so there was excess
water in the plant chamber.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.762
And this led to fungus.

00:03:57.762 --> 00:03:59.220
INTERVIEWER: Now
you'll be relieved

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.820
to know that Scott did manage
to save some of his zinnias.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.020
And the moldy ones?

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.580
They were sent back
to Massa's team

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.542
at the Kennedy Space Center, who
eagerly started analyzing them.

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:10.500
GIOIA MASSA: We've been
doing a lot of research

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.080
here on the tissue
that was brought back,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.500
to try and understand
where this fungus came from

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.079
and how it infected
these plants,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.367
so that we will
learn for the future.

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:24.950
INTERVIEWER: So far,
five Veggie crops

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.050
have been harvested on the ISS.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.550
And each time, the
team have learned

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.810
how to tweak the hardware to
support healthy space produce.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.775
And aside from fine tuning
Veggie to optimize plant health

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:37.160
and growth, the team
are also experimenting

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.140
with different levels
and intensities

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.720
of red, blue, and
green LED light

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.960
to make space crops more
nutritious and delicious.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.720
Now chlorophyll, the pigment
involved in generating plant

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.200
energy via photosynthesis,
absorbs red and blue light

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.130
best.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.410
Essentially, these
wavelengths help space crops

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.420
to grow without sunlight.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.450
Recent studies have also shown
a small amount of green light

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.830
could be important for
dense plant growth,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.240
particularly in poor light
conditions like in deep space.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.060
However, getting the
light balance just right

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.999
is still a work in progress.

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.540
GIOIA MASSA: It's
a really fun puzzle

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.780
to figure out, what
different plants are doing.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.080
You might get higher
levels of certain vitamins

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.430
under blue light.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.810
Red light tends to make
leafy crops expand more.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.870
But it's not, it's
not a universal thing.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.640
For the most part,
these light experiments

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.400
seem to be yielding
delicious results.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.270
In early 2017, astronauts Peggy
Whitson and Shane Kimbrough

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.940
grew a Chinese
cabbage on the ISS.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.480
And it was considered the best
tasting veggie crop so far.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.330
It was a proud moment
for those astronauts.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.950
And that speaks to
another strength

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.680
of Project Veggie, its
ability to boost morale

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.440
among those stationed on the
ISS for long periods of time.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.000
GIOIA MASSA: It's just been
incredible to watch them work

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.450
and to watch them
grow the plants.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.480
We're actually very interested
in the human factors

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.190
and the psychological
aspects of this.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.250
And so that's one
of the components

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.100
of the Veg-04 and
Veg-05 experiment

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.890
will be to do some
assessments trying

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.680
to quantify how much
the plants might

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.290
impact the experience
of living in space.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.760
INTERVIEWER: Next
year, NASA is set

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.120
to launch the Advanced Plant
Habitat, the largest plant

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.920
chamber built so far.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.590
The APH shares similar
technology to Veggie,

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.260
but will be able to
hold larger crops.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.620
So who knows?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.390
Perhaps the idea of astronauts
growing potatoes on Mars

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.610
might not seem so far
fetched after all.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.450
NASA may have plans
to make Mars habitable

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.060
using a giant space magnet.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.940
To find out more,
watch this episode now.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.200
Thanks for watching, and
