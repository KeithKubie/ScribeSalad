00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.240
- [Instructor] Let's
say that we are trying

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.640
to understand a relationship
in a classroom of 200 students

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.080
between the amount of time
studied and the percent correct.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.050
What we could do is we
could set up some buckets

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.230
of time studied and some
buckets of percent correct

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.240
and then we could survey the students

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.530
and/or look at the data
from the scores on the test.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.800
And then we can place
students in these buckets.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.390
So what you see right over
here, this is a two-way table.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.000
And you can also view this
as a joint distribution

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.130
along these two dimensions.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.070
So one way to read this is that 20

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.880
out of the 200 total students got

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.220
between a 60 and 79% on the test

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.290
and studied between 21 and 40 minutes.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.040
So there's all sorts of interesting things

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.240
that we could try to glean from this,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.770
but what we're going
to focus on this video

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.080
is two more types of distributions

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.110
other than the joint distribution
that we see in this data.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.300
One type is a marginal distribution.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.060
And a marginal distribution
is just focusing

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.800
on one of these dimensions.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.760
And one way to think about
it is you can determine it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.260
by looking at the margin.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.550
So, for example, if you wanted

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.140
to figure out the marginal distribution

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.180
of the percent correct,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.290
what you could do is look
at the total of these rows.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.400
So these counts right over here

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.090
give you the marginal distribution
of the percent correct.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.840
40 out of the 200 got
between 80 and a hundred.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.950
60 out of the 200 got between
60 and 79, so on and so forth.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.170
Now, a marginal distribution
could be represented

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.450
as counts or as percentages.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.960
So if you represent it as percentages,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.220
you would divide each of
these counts by the total,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.310
which is 200.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.200
So 40 over 200, that would be 20%.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.120
60 out of 200, that would be 30%.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.550
70 out of 200, that would be 35%.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.540
20 out of 200 is 10%.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.110
And 10 out of 200 is 5%.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.270
So this right over here
in terms of percentages

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.610
gives you the marginal
distribution of the percent correct

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.040
based on these buckets.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.520
So you can say 10% got
between a 20 and a 39.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.370
Now, you could also think

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.530
about marginal
distributions the other way.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990
You could think about
the marginal distribution

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.040
for the time studied in the class.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.690
Then you would look at these
counts right over here.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.330
You would say a total
of 14 students studied

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.580
between zero and 20 minutes.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.020
You're not thinking about
the percent correct anymore.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.680
A total of 30 studied
between 21 and 40 minutes.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.470
And likewise, you could
write these as percentages.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.270
This would be 7%.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.980
This would be 15%.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.200
This would be 43%.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.420
And this would be 35% right over there.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.140
Now, another idea that
you might sometimes see

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.973
when people are trying

00:02:45.973 --> 00:02:48.390
to interpret a joint
distribution like this

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.900
or get more information or
more realizations from it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.680
is to think about something known

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.023
as a conditional distribution.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.290
Conditional distribution.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.680
And this is the
distribution of one variable

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.350
given something true
about the other variable.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.840
So, for example, an example
of a conditional distribution

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.840
would be the distribution
of percent correct

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.770
given that students

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.670
study between, let's
say, 41 and 60 minutes.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.310
Between 41

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.810
and 60 minutes.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.950
Well, to think about that,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.020
you would first look at your condition.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.290
Okay, let's look at the students

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.900
who have studied between
41 and 60 minutes.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.230
That would be this column right over here.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.470
And then that column,
the information in it,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.060
can give you your
conditional distribution.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.430
Now, an important thing to realize

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.450
is a marginal distribution
can be represented

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.430
as counts for the various
buckets or percentages,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.980
while the standard practice
for conditional distribution

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.150
is to think in terms of percentages.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.790
So the conditional distribution
of the percent correct

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.910
given that students study
between 41 and 60 minutes,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.450
it would look something like this.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.140
Let me get a little bit more space.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.140
So if we set up the various
categories, 80 to 100,

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.290
60 to 79, 40 to 59,

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.110
continue it over here, 20 to 39,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.470
and zero to 19,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.450
what we'd wanna do is
calculate the percentage

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.750
that fall into each of these buckets given

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.020
that we're studying
between 41 and 60 minutes.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.700
So this first one, 80 to a hundred,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.140
it would be 16 out of the 86 students.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.380
So we would write 16 out of 86,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.220
which is equal to 16 divided by 86

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.950
is equal to, I'll just
round to one decimal place.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.723
It's roughly 18.6%.

00:04:53.723 --> 00:04:55.600
18.6.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.640
Approximately equal to 18.6%.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.250
And then to get the full
conditional distribution,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.270
we would keep doing that.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.870
We would figure out the percentage.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.620
60 to 79, that would 30 out of 86.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.440
30 out of 86, whatever percentage that is,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.620
and so on and so forth

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.403
in order to get that entire distribution.
