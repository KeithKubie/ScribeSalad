00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.139
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.790
In the video today, we're looking at whether
there is any truth to the idea that drinking

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.150
twice boiled water is bad for you.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.969
There’s a rather persistent idea that “reboiling”
water (i.e. boiling water two or more times

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.890
and allowing it to cool in-between) while
making a cup of tea is potentially harmful

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.400
to your health, with some going so far as
stating that regularly doing this even drastically

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.510
increases your chances of getting cancer.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.460
The general reasoning behind why this is purportedly
the case goes something like this:

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.410
"When we boil water, the chemistry of it changes,
which is usually a good thing as it boils

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.290
out volatile compounds and dissolves gases.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.610
This is why boiling water mostly ensures that
it’s safe to drink.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.260
If water is left boiled too long or is reboiled,
the chemical compounds change for the worst.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.110
By leaving your water to boil down, you’re
actually concentrating many harmful chemicals

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.710
instead of getting rid of them.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.500
The same thing happens when you reboil water,
as the compounds concentrate and increase

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
the risk of ingesting certain chemicals."

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.390
The website we gleaned this particular quote
from goes on to suggest that reboiling water

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.830
will expose you to toxic amounts of things
like arsenic, fluoride and nitrates, and even

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.190
includes the words “reboiled water causes
cancer” right in its URL.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.190
Countless others concur, positing that consuming
reboiled water is akin to drinking filthy

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.830
bilge water filtered through a hobo's socks
that had been previously stored at ground

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.970
zero at Chernobyl.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.990
So is it true that drinking reboiled water
is bad for you?

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.920
In short- nope, at least not so long as your
water is reasonably safe to drink in the first

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.140
place and you aren't the victim of some wildly
unrealistic scenario.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.140
Don't believe me?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.140
Well, keep watching then.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.890
As we’ve already talked about in our video
on why some ice cubes are cloudy and others

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.460
are clear, the kind of water that pours freely
from all of our faucets contains innumerable

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.870
impurities, some of which are, at least from
a practical standpoint for most home consumers,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.420
impossible to filter out entirely, such as
nitrates.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.250
However, the concentration of these impurities
is not generally particularly harmful in the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.420
normally negligible quantities you’d find
in common tap water.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.320
So unless you currently happen to live in
one of those place in where the tap water

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.811
catches fire or contains approximately the
same concentration of lead as pure lead, for

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:02.070
the most part your drinking water is probably
pretty safe as is.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.510
This brings us to the chief argument generally
leveled against twice boiled water- concentration

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.510
of impurities.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.450
When some of the water evaporates as the water
boils, while some impurities are removed,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.790
others remain (called non-volatile substances)
and are now more concentrated than when the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.520
volume of liquid was greater.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.870
This is absolutely true.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.150
So, case closed right?

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.430
Twice boiled water is definitely bad for you...

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.641
Except, this water is actually still not bad
for you, unless it was already bad for you

00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:30.849
to begin with (i.e. you have pre-existing
problems with your drinking water supply).

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.849
Why?

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.640
Aside from the fact that you aren't likely
letting the water boil down significantly

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.790
before brewing your cuppa (in fact, many don't
even bring the water to full boil before turning

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.400
off the heat and pouring), even if you did,
it wouldn't matter except for in outlandishly

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.800
unrealistic scenarios.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.170
You see, if you drank the entire teapot worth
of water straight- say five mugs worth- rather

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.250
than boiling it at all, it would not have
hurt you and would have contained more impurities

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.540
than the same full teapot boiled down to one
mug worth of water, as the impurities that

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.349
would have been otherwise boiled off would
still be present in the original five mugs

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.349
of water.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.080
The key point here is that boiling the water
does not add any impurities, it actually subtracts

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080
some.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.030
So whether five mugs worth of unboiled water
or one mug from five boiled down, you still

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.410
have mostly the same amount of impurities.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.270
The only real difference here is you'll be
more hydrated if you'd drank the five mugs.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.010
Now, potentially if you were always doing
this, and using tea as your primary hydration

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.930
source, continually getting five times the
impurities for one mug of water may be an

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.030
issue, depending on the purity of your water
source... except nobody is regulalry, or even

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.160
irregularly in most cases, boiling off anywhere
close to this amount of water when making

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.840
tea, and the more tea you drink, the less
will be evaporated off in between.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.150
Again, beyond that this is more an issue of
time boiling and potential evaporation time,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.640
rather than number of boils, no one actually
does this, not the least of which because,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.640
in the most extreme case, it would end up
making your tea taste awful, and at a certain

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.069
point you'd even likely get noticeable sediment
at the bottom of the kettle.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.540
In more realistic boiling scenarios, the extremely
minuscule amount of extra impurities per mug

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.410
isn't going to hurt you and isn't likely to
be something you'll taste the difference on.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.980
(More on this latter point in a bit.)

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.709
But what about the state of the water the
second time you boil it?

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.980
Couldn't there be impurities being added in
between?

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.459
While it is possible a kettle without a lid
left sitting on the stove or counter might

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.499
get a bit of dust or the like in the previously
boiled water, the composition of it isn't

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.469
likely to change much in the interim between
boiling, outside of scenarios like a construction

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.469
site or something.

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:25.249
In most office buildings or your home, this
isn't going to be an issue, and even less

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:26.909
so if your kettle has a lid.

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.309
Any microbes that find their way in there
would also be killed off during the subsequent

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:32.610
boiling process, so no health issue there
either.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.809
The only potential problem area left then
would be the water picking up something from

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:36.809
the kettle itself.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.430
But studies have shown that, while things
like iron and nickel and the like do leach

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.180
into foods in exceptionally small quantities
while you heat them in something like a stainless

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.400
steel container, this is not so much the case
when discussing leaching into tap water alone,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.090
particularly if you've used the container
several times before.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.939
Unsurprisingly most kettles are made from
extremely non-reactive substances (at least

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.060
to tap water).

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.909
Because of this, whether you boil the water
once or several times, any impurities picked

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.740
up from your kettle should be negligible in
the vast majority of cases.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.379
If they're not, that's an issue with a faulty
kettle and is likely an issue with once boiling

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:09.379
as well.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.189
Easy solution- get a better kettle.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.840
That said, if you brewed the tea in, for instance,
the stainless steel kettle itself rather than

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.969
your mug, then boil and let it sit, there
will be some leaching similar to when cooking

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.869
certain food items (with your mileage varying
depending on what exactly the kettle is made

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:24.880
from and what you're putting into the tea)
.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.590
But when discussing using that brewed water
later for re-boiling and brewing again, this

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.789
once again gets into the realm of "nobody
does that", and certainly isn't the scenario

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.729
people are talking about when discussing that
it is "bad" to use twice boiled water.

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.419
This is not to mention that impurities picked
up from the kettle aren't necessarily inherently

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.560
bad for you at the quantities they may be
leaching in this unlikely scenario (whether

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.819
double concentration from twice boiling or
single from once), and some might be good

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.210
for you, such as if you're low on iron and
getting leached iron from the kettle.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.800
In the end, there's a reason not a single
public health agency in the world advises

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.240
against drinking twice boiled water.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.560
Outside of elaborate scenarios that nobody
actually does, kettles that are dangerous

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.669
to boil water in even once, or water that
already has unsafe levels of some compound,

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.809
twice or thrice boiled water isn't going to
cause you any harm.

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:13.360
Another argument often leveled against the
idea of using twice boiled water in tea is

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.629
that it supposedly affects the taste.

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:20.749
Now as someone who works with a lot of British
people and adores some Earl Grey, hot, served

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:27.349
in my favourite Picard cups, I can tell you
that some people take making tea very seriously

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.889
and feel there is a genuine art to brewing
a good cup.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.419
However, the idea of what exactly constitutes
a “good” cup of tea, like your favourite

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.319
Power Ranger, varies dramatically from person
to person.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.129
For instance, I'm personally not a fan of
builder's tea, but the co-author of this particular

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:49.699
piece is quite partial to it (and the Green
Ranger, which at least there we were in agreement).

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.930
Builders tea is a colloquial term used to
refer to tea that is strong, milky and loaded

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.029
with sugar- all things “real” tea drinkers
would consider an affront to their very sense

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:59.029
of being.

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.969
Likewise, I know of others who turn their
noses up at anything less than the finest

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:06.550
Lapsang souchong (sew-shon-g) filtered through
the silken robes of a well-toned Shaolin monk.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.229
Unsurprisingly, there are quite literally
arguments on almost every part of the tea-making

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.139
process up to and including whether or not
it’s okay to clean the teapot you use to

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:15.139
make it.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.729
As an example of the kind of hearty debate
this topic inspires, one of the most controversial

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:24.129
things George Orwell ever wrote was an article
aptly titled “A Nice Cup of Tea”, in which

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:29.039
he, amongst other things, mocked the idea
of putting sugar in tea, saying “How can

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.119
you call yourself a true tealover if you destroy
the flavour of your tea by putting sugar in

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.319
it?” and insisted that milk should be added
after the tea.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.469
This latter is arguably one of the most common
points of contention amongst tea drinkers,

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:44.039
inspiring everything from comedic raps to
actual scientific studies.

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.819
(For the curious, science says that milk should
be added first because, if you don’t, the

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:52.229
hot water “causes the milk to heat unevenly”
which “causes the proteins in it to denature,

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.979
meaning they lose their structure and “clump”,
affecting the taste” whereas the rapper,

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:59.349
one Doc Brown, says you must be “out of
your mind” to put the milk in first, adding

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:00.349
that doing so “makes his heart burst”.)

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:03.129
Needless to say, when discussing what is better
tasting tea or not, “science” and “what

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:06.870
George Orwell think” have little to no bearing-
you like what you like.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.649
This brings us back to twice boiling tea and
that it purportedly "ruins" the taste of the

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:11.649
tea.

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:14.740
Beyond the subjectivity of such a statement,
the funny thing is, it's not actually clear

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.319
twice boiling water does affect the taste
of tea.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:21.009
While, as we mentioned, in an extreme case
of doing something crazy like boiling down

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:25.759
twenty liters of water to a single cup's worth
will indisputably drastically affect the taste

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:30.360
of the tea due to concentration of impurities,
when talking about a more realistic scenario

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.390
of something like twice or thrice boiled water
that barely has any of it evaporated off at

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.510
all in between (and generally fresh water
added before each boiling, diluting the mixture),

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.160
it's not so clear there is a difference in
taste happening, other than perhaps in peoples'

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160
heads.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.460
While I could not find any studies on the
idea of twice boiled water changing the taste

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.690
of tea, we can at least look at the mechanism
involved to get an idea on whether it is likely

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.560
or not that such a taste shift is occurring.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.320
For starters, many claim the taste difference
comes about due to twice boiled water having

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.010
less dissolved oxygen in it, referencing the
fact that, as the water temperature increases,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.640
the solubility of oxygen decreases.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.950
This latter fact is absolutely true.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.950
The former is not.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:13.490
You see, at 100°C (boiling point) the concentration
of dissolved oxygen (assuming normal atmospheric

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.880
pressure) will ultimately be near zero, whether
it's once or tenth boiled water.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.700
How long you boil the water does come into
play somewhat, but even then the differences

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.530
are minimal, with dissolved oxygen levels
at 1 atmosphere and 0°C on the order of 15

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:34.510
ppm, compared to approximately 5 ppm at 50°C
and near 0 ppm at 100°C.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.450
"But my tea tasting palate is extremely refined
and able to detect even the smallest of changes

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.170
of dissolved oxygen levels," you say as you
idly clean your monocle.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.580
It doesn't matter.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.510
Once the water is allowed to cool back down,
its dissolved oxygen levels will once again

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.310
begin to rise to normal levels given atmospheric
pressure and temperature.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.610
(CO2 levels, which can affect the taste, will
also return to normal.)

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.370
Given this, the second time you bring the
water back up to boil, things like the oxygen

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.980
level are not going to be any different than
the first, assuming equal boiling times and/or

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.060
temperature levels.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.490
That's not to mention that the idea that more
oxygen = better tasting gets into the aforementioned

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.240
debate on what does or does not taste better
when making tea- everyone's got their own

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240
preferences.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.230
And if you're curious, there have been studies
(Pangborn &amp; Bertolero 1972, Faust &amp; Aly 1998)

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.810
that have indicated that dissolved oxygen
actually doesn't noticeably impact the flavour

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.900
of water, though it should be noted that those
studies weren't dealing with brewing tea,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.000
and it is possible (even probable) that dissolved
oxygen could be interacting with elements

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.940
of the tea to change the flavour (similar
to what happens with wine).

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.610
But either way, whether once, twice, or thrice
boiled, you're getting essentially the same

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.730
dissolved oxygen levels, assuming you boil
and steep the same way each time.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.570
Another factor in twice boiled water that
may affect the flavour is higher concentration

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.920
of impurities, which, as we already discussed,
in realistic tea making scenarios isn't actually

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.030
going to be much different than once boiled
water.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.590
The only thing left would be the water picking
up something from the kettle itself that affects

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.620
the flavour, but, again as previously mentioned,
studies have shown that, while things like

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.820
iron and nickel and the like do leach into
foods in exceptionally small quantities while

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.590
you heat them in something like a stainless
steel container, this is not so much the case

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.580
when discussing leaching in water alone.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.150
The bottom line on all of this is that, whatever
your position on whether twice boiled water

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.820
does or does not affect the taste of tea and,
if so, if it makes it taste better or worse

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.980
to you, widespread claims, even from otherwise
reputable sources, that seem to imply twice

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.820
boiled water will somehow give even cancer,
cancer are not correct.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.180
Twice boiled water simply isn't bad for you
at all unless your particular water source

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.870
was already bad for you at the once boiled
level.
