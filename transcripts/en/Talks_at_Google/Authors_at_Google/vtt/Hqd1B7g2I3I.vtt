KEITH: Hi, everybody.

00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:14.055
My name is Keith [? Schafer ?].

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.782
I'm with the author's team
here at Google Los Angeles.

00:00:17.782 --> 00:00:20.100
I'm a little too
tall for this mic.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250
Susan Pinker is a
developmental psychologist

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.930
who writes about social
sciences for the daily press.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.780
She was educated at
McGill University

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.310
in the University of
Waterloo, after which she

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.660
spent 25 years in clinical
practice and teaching

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.920
psychology.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.790
Her newspaper columns, Problem
Solving and The Business Brain

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.790
on the Neuroscience and
Behavioral Economics

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.385
of the Business
World appeared weekly

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.830
in Canada's national
newspaper "The Globe and Mail"

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.600
from 2002 to 2012.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.470
And her radio columns currently
air monthly on the CBC.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.700
Susan also writes opinions
and feature articles

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.573
on psychology, public policy,
education, and business

00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:56.320
for the international press.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.970
Her latest book is,
"The Village Effect,"

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.100
which she's going to speak
to us about right now.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.135
Ladies and gentleman,
Susan Pinker.

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:04.289
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:05.580
SUSAN PINKER: Thank you, Keith.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.970
And thank you all for
coming today, everybody.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.600
I know you're giving up
your lunch hour, your R&amp;R

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.390
to be here.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.160
And I wanted to thank
also Ann Farmer who

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.390
invited me and [INAUDIBLE]
who I met on the airplane

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.510
yesterday for Montreal.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.820
And I asked, because he was
wearing a Google sweatshirt,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.200
if he was going to go to
the Google LA offices.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.780
And so that's how
we know each other.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.850
Which brings me to the
topic that I'm going

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.950
to talk to you about today.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.910
What kind of social
contact do we all

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.060
need to be healthy, happy,
and to live long lives?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.000
This is the question that I'm
asking in "The Village Effect."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.560
And it's really a
question when it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.750
comes to the science
about new evidence

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.110
from social neuroscience,
which is a fairly new field.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.830
It's about 10 to 12 years old.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.090
And it studies the effects
of our relationships

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.370
on our bodies and
brains and vice versa.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.370
What's going on in
our bodies and brains

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.640
and how that affects
our relationships.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.090
And one of the most basic
things that social neuroscience

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.470
evidence is telling us
is that our relationships

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.330
have a powerful impact
on our thinking,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.240
our resilience, and indeed,
on how long we live.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.550
So just a few
facts, for example.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.060
The type of social contact
that you have influences

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.340
your physical resilience,
whether or not you catch colds

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.940
and how long you have them, how
well you fight off infection--

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.490
even how fast
malignant tumors grow.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.140
A huge prospective study of
women with breast cancer.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.070
There were 4,000
women in the study.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.490
And essentially, they
looked at every aspect

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.472
of their lifestyles.

00:02:58.472 --> 00:02:59.930
And then they sat
tight and watched

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.580
who survived their illness
by the end of 10 years.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.580
And they discovered that
the most predictive factor

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.570
was the size of these women's
in-person social networks.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.460
So when I refer in this
talk to social network

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.090
I mean people that
you see and interact

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.370
with face-to-face as
opposed to social media.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.400
So in general,
people were learning

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.440
from social neuroscience
and demography

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.960
that people with active
in-person social lives

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.400
have a two- to 15-year
lifespan advantage.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.260
And I know, given
the average age

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.120
of people who work
at Google, maybe

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.920
you're not that concerned
with how long you live.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.780
But actually, you'll
be thinking about this

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.850
in not too long because
what we're learning

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.110
is that your social
contact is even more

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.820
powerful a predictor of
your health and longevity

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.480
than exercise or whether
or not you smoke.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.310
So it's a hugely powerful
biological predictor

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.930
of how well you think
and remember facts

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.340
and how well you fight off
all sorts of assaults on you--

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.540
for example, dementia.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.780
Lowest rates of
dementia among people

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.540
with the largest
in-person social networks.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.329
And this is what I'm
calling the Village Effect.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.390
It's a metaphor for the
kind of social contact

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.750
that we all need to
survive and to thrive.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.520
Now how did I get
to write this book?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.320
An intriguing fact
that I learned

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.740
from my last book, which
was about sex differences,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.650
the science of sex differences.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.360
And it was called
"The Sexual Paradox."

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.620
And one of the many
paradoxes that I discovered

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.580
was that everywhere in
all developed nations,

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.600
women on average live
longer than men do,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.910
about five to seven
years longer on average.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.420
And this isn't insignificant.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.130
I mean as we progress,
we're all living

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.210
longer lives because of advances
in medicine among other things.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.920
But we're just creeping along.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.230
So as men live longer lives
women live even longer lives.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.070
And wherever mature adults
gather-- and by mature, I

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.150
mean people in their
'50s and '60s and '70s--

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.250
you'll see that women outnumber
men about three to one.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.620
So if you look in places like
a library, a supermarket,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.460
tours for the retired,
pretty much-- book clubs.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.760
I mean I talked to a
lot of book groups.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.100
Usually women outnumber not only
three to one, but four to one.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.320
And yesterday it was Caltech.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.210
Women outnumbered
men about two to one,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.590
but it was Caltech, right?

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.120
So there's a difference there.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.650
Now a critical
factor I discovered

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.390
at the end of my
last book is that one

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.930
of the reasons
women live longer is

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.490
they have much more
extensive social lives.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.430
They groom their social networks
throughout the lifespans.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.775
Often, they choose work
that is more social,

00:05:56.775 --> 00:05:58.800
or they choose to work
on teams of people

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.210
that they like and respect.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.730
They spend a lot more time
doing what I call porch talk,

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.560
checking up on their
friends and family.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.470
And this is not only
a statistical fact,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.800
if you're interested, look
at my last book, "The Sexual

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.760
Paradox."

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.290
There's quite a bit about
that in this book too,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.380
but it's also true
of my own family.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.260
So I'm going to talk
about them for a minute.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.290
At the end of every
workday, my grandmother

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.530
would pick up her black
rotary model telephone.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.600
And she would check
up on all the people

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.110
who are important to her,
her friends and family.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.184
And she wrote on a
little pad and pencil

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:39.100
all the people she was
going to check up with.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.360
And despite the intimacy
of their conversations,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.070
she address them all
formally as was standard

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.140
of the time in the 1960s.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.570
And she addressed them all as
Mrs. [? Dubot ?], Mrs. Tarter,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.290
Mrs. Silver, Mrs.
Cooper, Mrs. Titelbaum.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.720
Even though they were
discussing things

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.270
like their digestive systems,
the state of their marriages,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.010
which one of their children
was having marital problems,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.910
et cetera.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.700
And my mother carried
on this tradition.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.440
This is not actually
my mother, but it

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.400
could've been my
mother, because she

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.380
spent much of my childhood
attached to the kitchen wall

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.640
by a long nine foot
telephone cord.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.830
And also very much use the
telephone and technology

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.240
to keep in touch with
her social contacts.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.250
And this is also true of me.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.570
So this is what's called a
sociogram for those of you

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.240
who've never seen it.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.430
Essentially, shows all my social
contacts with thick lines.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.520
I'm just going to use
the one screen for ease,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.540
for the pointer.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.120
The thick lines show
close connections

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.700
like intimate connections.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.770
The thin lines are
weaker connections.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.580
And as you'll discover
later in this talk,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.820
your weaker connections
are almost as important

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.210
as yours intimate, strong ones.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.160
So we'll come back to that.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.430
The circles are female.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.850
The triangles are male.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.980
And the dark dots are the people
who are profiled in this book.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.830
And the reason I
made that distinction

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.030
is because this
is not only a book

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.110
about social science and
science and network science.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.310
It's also a book about
stories of real people.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.006
And it's also a
cautionary tale for you.

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:19.380
If you ever get
to know a writer,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.500
you're going to end up in their
article or book some time.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.130
Now getting back to how I
started to write this book,

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.070
about six years ago, I was
sitting in a dark auditorium.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.080
And I learned an amazing fact.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.799
There is one place
in the world where

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.470
men live as long as
women, or nearly as long.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:43.450
And it's an island that is off
the southern coast of Italy.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.210
It's a remote mountainous
area in that island

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.230
which they call a blue zone.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.240
And it's where superlongevity,
as they call it,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.120
is much more common
in both sexes.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.420
So they're 10 times as many
centenarians in Sardinia

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.760
as there are in Europe
and North America.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.050
There are six times
as many as there

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.550
are in the Italian mainland
just about 120 miles away.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.509
And when I heard
about that I decided,

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:12.550
I have to go there and
find out what's happening.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.120
I wanted to discover,
talk to the scientists,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.970
and interview some
of the centenarians.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.870
And I was actually making
a radio documentary

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.009
for "CBC Radio
Canada" at the time.

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:24.050
And you can listen to it.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.090
If you're interested in
hearing the centenarians talk,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.460
you can listen to it
by googling my name.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.750
And it's called the
longevity puzzle.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.420
And you'll be able to hear it.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.830
Now Sardinia is an island
between Corsica and Tunisia.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.630
It's about the size of
Switzerland and has about maybe

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.200
a quarter of its population.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.630
So it's quite
sparsely populated.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.720
And as I said earlier,
it's the only place

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.780
where men live as
long as women, which

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.660
is actually extraordinary.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.280
It piqued my
curiosity, and I wanted

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.680
to find out what it
takes to live to 100,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.960
not because I had that ambition,
but because it would give me

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.720
an idea of the biological
processes behind that event.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.700
So let's meet some of
these centenarians.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.480
Here we get to meet, not only
a scientist whose name is

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.180
Giovanni [? Pez ?] who is a
physician and demographer who's

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.800
devoted his career to
studying longevity,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.140
but also because it
runs in his family.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.690
This his uncle Pasquale
Forscone, who here is about 104

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.600
but actually lived to 110.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.020
And he was born the year the
diesel engine was invented.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.210
And he died the year
Facebook was founded,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.125
2004, which is extraordinary.

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:44.750
And here he is.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.600
He's walking around-- he
even went boar hunting

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.320
when he was over 100 years old.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.270
So many people, even if
they do live to advanced

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.830
age in our society,
they're often infirm.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.220
They can't walk.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.230
They are often quite isolated.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.070
And they live often
and senior's residences

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.220
where sometimes they have
around the clock nursing care.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.850
And that was not the case there.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.790
Now he died before I got
to Sardinia, several years

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.680
before I got there.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.550
But I did meet some
other centenarians

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.030
who really illustrated
some of the science.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.390
This guy's name is Giovanni.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.420
I called him zio Giovanni,
which means uncle Giovanni,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.330
just to give them a little bit
of the respect that was due.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.780
And here is his niece
who he lives with.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.610
And this is his great
niece who visited.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.980
And I will tell you
that when I arrived,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.950
I discovered that the whole
lifestyle there is very

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.450
different than what I knew.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.810
For one thing, the
night I arrived,

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.649
three scientists
met me at my hotel.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:53.940
And we all went out for dinner.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.610
And everybody brought their
wives and their girlfriends.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.600
One even brought
his brother-in-law.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.480
And we were about 10 at
the table, 12 at the table.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.210
And we spent a really pleasant
evening eating outdoors

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.510
and getting to know each
other, which I would say

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.010
has never happened to me
before in a scientific context

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.310
in North America.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.380
And then when I started
to visit the centenarians,

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.890
I discovered much to
my chagrin at first

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.350
that they were never alone.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.205
And I could never
get any clean tape

00:12:23.205 --> 00:12:25.920
of them talking because
wherever I went,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.830
there was always
three or four people

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.320
there-- the neighbors, nieces,
nephews, sons, daughters,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.880
the priest, the
shopkeeper, the bar owner

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.390
who served this guy a drink
every day of his life.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.370
It was like a virtual party.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:45.200
And I quickly discovered that
being alone not only when

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.350
you're younger, say the
age that most of the people

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.936
are in this audience,
but as you age

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:52.390
is an impossibility there,
for better or worse.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.970
And something else
that I discovered

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:01.210
is that this guy who I
talked to, as you can see,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.840
he's not really a happy camper.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.520
Whenever I asked
him something, he

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.770
would kind of bark back at me.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.790
And I said, zio, what
do you think has allowed

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.930
you to live such a long life?

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.500
And there was a
pause, and he said,

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.490
nobody has to know my secrets.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.097
And I thought, OK.

00:13:20.097 --> 00:13:22.180
And his niece said, he
doesn't like that question.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.670
Ask him another question.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.041
So I said, well, do you
think it's the Cannonau?

00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:27.790
That's the kind of red
wine that they make

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.235
in the region, dark red wine.

00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:30.360
Do think it's the Cannonau?

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.040
And he said, nah.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.940
I like wine a little too much.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.060
And in general,
he was so grouchy

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.460
that he put a lie to
the notion that you

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.080
have to have positive thoughts
and a positive outlook

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.740
to live a long life.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.610
And actually, that's
what the research shows

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.390
is that there is no evidence
that thinking positively

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.530
does anything for your
immunity, your health,

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.800
or how long you live.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.500
It may make you
want to live longer.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.170
It may make you feel better.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.560
But it has nothing to do
with how healthy you are.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.330
As you can see from
this grump here.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.710
Yet he was still
called il tesoro

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.260
by his niece-- the treasure.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.900
And which really surprised me.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.720
And she treated him with
the greatest of deference.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.980
And she even got annoyed with
me when I said, don't you

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.980
feel a little hemmed in because
you're living with a shut-in.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.450
You're only in your mid 60s.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.750
You never get out.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.060
You can't leave him alone.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.110
Isn't this hampering
your life a little bit.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.150
And she said, you
North Americans,

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.200
you just don't
understand, do you?

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.390
This is a privilege for us.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.300
This is our heritage.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.610
We would never leave these
old people who are essentially

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.110
the symbol of our
community and our family

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.280
to age by themselves.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.370
They are the center
of our community.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.890
And it was very different
from how we treat people

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.170
as they age in North America
whereas George Burns quipped,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.820
happiness is having a
loving close knit family

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.920
living in another city.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.610
Most people are very mobile.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.600
They keep up with each other
maybe with email and text,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.690
maybe with Skype or FaceTime.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.330
But the idea of having say
a dozen different creams

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.920
for every different part of
their parent's or uncle's

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.890
body so not to abraid their
delicate skin is probably

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.750
very unusual here.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.260
Interestingly when I talk
about these anecdotes,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.090
it's to enliven in the story.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.530
But the research tells us that
even a study that came out

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.990
last month-- so it's not in
this book because this book

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.280
came out last fall.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.560
But a study in PNAS
came out last month,

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.070
indicated that people who
are either live alone or are

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.000
socially isolated,
whether they think

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.330
so or not-- in other words,
whether they think it's OK,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.520
or don't think it's OK, or
who say they are lonely,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.060
have a 30% reduction in
lifespan compared to their peers

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.544
during a certain period of time.

00:15:59.544 --> 00:16:01.460
And what's really
interesting about that to me

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.400
is that until that
study, loneliness,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.170
or social isolation,
was considered

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.030
to be a subjective thing.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.380
Like you weren't
socially isolated

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.130
if that's how you
wanted to live.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.200
And if you didn't like
to interact with people,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.570
that was considered
to be totally fine.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.180
But actually, it does matter.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.030
And it does affect
your immunity,

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.210
and it does affect your
happiness and your marbles.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.470
And that was the first study
that actually demonstrated

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.620
that it's not what you think,
it is the objective fact

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.670
of how many people
live with you,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.680
how many people do you interact
with day to day that really

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.250
counts.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.204
Another centenarian--
here I'll show you,

00:16:41.204 --> 00:16:42.870
I'll introduce to
you-- you could to see

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.770
that there was always a party.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.560
There I am.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.570
This is my daughter,
Eva, who came along

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.250
with me on the trip because
she just graduated from college

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.840
and, A, didn't know
what to do with her life

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.540
and, B, had just done an
internship at the CBC.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.842
So she had much better
audio skills than I did.

00:17:01.842 --> 00:17:03.925
She was the one who held
the mic and tape recorded

00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:04.940
the centenarians.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.750
But here is a centenarian
named Giuseppe.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.839
He's 102 here.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.140
Here are two of
his seven children.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.660
These guys Angelo and
Domenico didn't live with him.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.910
He lived by himself, but
they checked in on him

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.970
several times a day and
brought him stuff to eat.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.609
They were very suspicious
of us, by the way,

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:24.359
and were very protective of him.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.950
Now this guy was
really outgoing,

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.190
gregarious, cheerful,
loved to tell stories.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.170
I mean it was hard
to get out of there.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:35.480
And it was interesting because
he too illustrated the notion

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.040
that it's not your
personality type that

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.910
determines how long you live.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.940
So I know I'm in
California, and I

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.970
know the new age view is that
if you are not stressed out

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.650
and you have a positive
attitude, et cetera,

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.590
and you have the right
type of personality

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.270
that all good things
will happen to you.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.040
But actually, no.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.410
You can be outgoing
and cheerful,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.440
or you can be
quiet and taciturn.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.574
These actually don't have an
effect on how long you live.

00:18:04.574 --> 00:18:05.990
And in fact, there's
even evidence

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:11.490
that shows that anxiety and
persistence and perfectionism

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.820
actually adds to the length of
your life, believe it or not.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:21.800
So meeting these centenarians
are just some of the stories

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.010
that I tell in this book.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.010
And along with the science
that underpins them,

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.610
they help me understand some
little questions, such as when

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.440
am I going to die?

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.070
And how can I put that day off?

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.340
And as you will see from
some of the evidence,

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.014
it really wasn't
what I expected.

00:18:41.014 --> 00:18:42.680
The answer isn't
really what I expected.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.230
And I think it's
probably not going

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.560
to be what you expect in terms
of the type of lifestyle issues

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.930
that allow you to live
a long, healthy life.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.780
So when I talk about
lifestyle issues,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.770
I mean everything that you can
control because obviously we

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:58.980
can't control our genes.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.710
But we can control
epigenetic effects.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.960
And we can control different
things that where we live

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.830
and how we live.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.040
And that's what I'm
going to talk about now.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.500
I'm going to talk about a
meta-analysis by Julianne

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.800
Holt-Lunstad from Brigham
Young University, where

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.930
she essentially crunched about
158 studies of altogether

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:27.550
39,000 people in mid life.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.310
Every aspect of
their lifestyle was

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.420
recorded-- how much they
drank, how much they

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.190
ate, how much they weighed,
if they were married,

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.400
if they were divorced,
who they lived with,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.980
if they had a flu shot.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.960
Almost everything you could
think of was documented.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.180
And then they looked through
multiple regression analyses,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.150
they were able to
determine over time

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.970
who was still
standing and breathing

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.890
at the end of 7 and 1/2 years.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.150
So I mean the statistics are
complex, but the idea isn't.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.220
It would be like if I measured
everything about everybody

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.400
in this room times
many thousands,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.230
and then in 7 and
1/2 years check

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.060
to see who was still living.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.550
And it's not as
preposterous as you

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.880
may think because when
I was doing research

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.440
on my first book,
I had a high school

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.700
reunion that was planned.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.170
And this is just an anecdote.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.540
I contacted the
organizers to see

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.280
who had died in the 30
years since I had graduated

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.420
from high school, which was more
or less correct-- maybe 25, 30

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.100
years-- because they were
having some memorial services.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.200
And actually, the rates
of people who had died,

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.850
even some of them
before they turned 20,

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.460
mimicked exactly the
North American rates.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.170
So it's pretty
spooky, but there are

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:54.340
things that you can do that
might lengthen your lifespan.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.916
Let's look at some
of the risk factors.

00:20:56.916 --> 00:20:58.790
Here's one that's probably
familiar to people

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.990
in California.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.800
Whether you exercise
regularly or whether you're

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.590
a couch potato-- or I
should say screen potato.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.670
Whether you breathe clean
air-- kind of impossible

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.660
in LA-- or you
breathe polluted air.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.070
Whether you drink very little
or you drink a lot-- of alcohol,

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.350
I mean.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.950
Whether you have
your hypertension

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.770
treated or you ignore it.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.950
Whether you smoke or
not-- or smoke a lot.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.790
Whether you have a lean
physique or your packing

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.110
on a few too many pounds.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.520
Whether you have a full social
life or you're pretty solitary.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.130
And what I mean by
a full social life

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.910
means getting out
and seeing people,

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.120
whether it's to have a
beer with your friends,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.300
whether it's to play Dungeons
and Dragons, whether it's

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.510
to have a book club or
just a coffee once a week

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.640
with your best
friend at Starbucks.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.900
It means getting out there.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.360
It doesn't mean the
close one or two

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.570
people or maybe three people
who would probably give you

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.040
a kidney if you needed one.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.550
I'm talking about
your larger network.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.250
That's the high social support.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.550
That's the difference is
those are your close contacts.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.240
If you needed to borrow $500
who would dig into their pocket.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.660
Whether if you've had
a heart condition,

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.790
you're doing something about it.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.980
Of all of those, let's start
from this weakest predictor

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.540
and go to the strongest
one of how long

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.250
you will live after a span
of say 7 and 1/2 years.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.280
Do I have any guesses
from this group

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.330
of what is the least predictive
of longevity of those lifestyle

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.934
factors?

00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:48.503
I'm sorry, what did you say?

00:22:48.503 --> 00:22:49.410
AUDIENCE: Alcohol.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:49.870
SUSAN PINKER: Alcohol?

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.730
Any other guesses?

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:51.850
AUDIENCE: Clean air.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:52.480
SUSAN PINKER: Clean air.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.063
Who said that?

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.510
So any other guesses?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.362
AUDIENCE: Exercise.

00:22:59.362 --> 00:23:00.282
AUDIENCE: Smoking?

00:23:00.282 --> 00:23:00.990
SUSAN PINKER: Oh!

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.239
A lot of good guesses.

00:23:02.239 --> 00:23:03.530
Well, let's look at the bottom.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.440
It's clean air, which is
good news for you guys.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:10.384 --> 00:23:12.050
SUSAN PINKER: I didn't
know, [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.466
if you were looking
at the window,

00:23:13.466 --> 00:23:16.248
but the smog layer
over LA was amazing.

00:23:16.248 --> 00:23:17.914
AUDIENCE: Well, you
had the window seat.

00:23:17.914 --> 00:23:20.220
SUSAN PINKER:
[LAUGHTER] That's right.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.940
So don't worry.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.760
It might make
breathing difficult,

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.100
but it won't shorten your life.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.590
Whether you have your
hypertension treated

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:33.380
is important, but not as
important as some other things.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.730
How obese you are.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.620
That was a huge surprise to me.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.640
Not that predictive
of your lifespan.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.500
Probably at the
extremes, it might be.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.390
But certainly, in the realms
that most of us worry about,

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:45.900
it's irrelevant.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.290
How much you exercise.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:53.510
Huge surprise, I think, to
most of us of being predictive.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.262
And this is for
people in middle age.

00:23:56.262 --> 00:23:58.220
Whether or not you have
cardiac rehabilitation.

00:24:01.096 --> 00:24:02.720
What I love is that
it's more important

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.330
that you get a flu shot
than you go to the gym.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.188
How many of you here
have had a flu shot?

00:24:07.188 --> 00:24:09.197
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:11.280
SUSAN PINKER: Does somebody
come to Google offices

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.570
and go around and
poke everybody?

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.200
SUSAN PINKER: Yay, Google.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.650
Whether you were a heavy
drinker and you quit.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:24.580
Whether you were a heavy
smoker and you quit.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.250
Whether you smoked
just a wee bit.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.340
I remember when
I met my husband.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.270
He was a smoker.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.390
And that was kind of-- I
didn't really like that much.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:37.930
And so when we travelled,
he used to buy one cigarette

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.010
at a time.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.170
You can do that in Europe.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.540
People will sell
you one cigarette

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.250
and a book of matches.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.940
But gradually, he made the
segue into being a non-smoker.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.890
Next, how much you get out
and participate face-to-face

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.540
with people in a social way.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.730
And finally, it's
pretty much tied

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.950
for the top two
predictive factors,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.850
your close relationships.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.360
And what's really
interesting about that

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.080
is that our close relationships
have declined dramatically

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.680
in one generation.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.030
So from the mid 1980s,
the General Social Survey

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.280
the United States which
does telephone interviews

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.090
across the country-- and that's
where you get most of the data

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.720
that you read about.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.590
And at that point,
most Americans

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.110
had an average of
three people they

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.530
can confide in and depend on.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.690
These are people
that you really trust

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.960
who are very important to you.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.380
And now that number
is less than two.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.700
And a lot of people,
especially men,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.880
have one who is their
girlfriend or wife.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.510
That means they're one person
away from having nobody at all.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:54.030
So that's actually a
shocking statistic really.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.130
That's much less
common among women.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.180
Social integration
as I said is not

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.610
those close tight-knit people
who know a lot about you,

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:07.560
but more your kind of
medium range relationships.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.400
And these are the ones
that would probably

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.580
change if you move
locations, for example.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.371
The people you hang
out with every day.

00:26:15.371 --> 00:26:17.120
So for example, I tell
a story in the book

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.480
about a woman who
moved on to my street

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.590
and she joined my swim team.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.950
And we start a hangout a lot.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.380
And we would go and walk her dog
together once or twice a week.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.650
And as we walked
her dog together,

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.510
actually, I saw that I
lost about five pounds.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.020
Had a lot of fun,
learned a lot about her.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.770
And then after a few
years, she moved away.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.580
Never saw her again.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.190
And she was part of that--
part of my social integration.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.357
And then, it changed.

00:26:47.357 --> 00:26:48.940
And the research
does show that if you

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.550
don't renew your social
contacts in person,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:56.520
they tend to degrade
or decay, say,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.130
sort of like a plant
in your garden.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.410
So this was kind of interesting.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.650
Now it leads me to
the next question.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.740
Here I'm asking
what kind of factors

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.370
do we need to stay healthy
and to live long lives,

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.410
but what kind of relationships
do we need to stay focused,

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.860
to learn and to stay
connected to information?

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.300
Because right now,
a lot of education

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:27.340
is, of course, happening
online or through Twitter.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.650
Things are changing for
many people, not just people

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.460
your age but much younger.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.930
Many classrooms are
becoming digital classrooms.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.830
They're becoming-- first they
were laptop classrooms, now

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.380
they're one-to-one
tablet classrooms.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.800
And the question that I'm
going to pose to you today

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.790
which I think is a bit-- I don't
know if it would be considered

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.130
heretical in this environment,
but I don't think it should

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:59.710
be-- is that not all
types of social contact

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.380
are created equal.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.490
There are shadings
and differences

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.150
between the way there is
shadings and differences

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.640
in the type of food you eat.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.660
Even if, say for example, a
piece of your grandmother's

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.570
lasagna is 2,000 calories
and two Oh Henry!

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.140
bars are 2,000 calories, most
of us don't confuse the two.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.370
But very much, there's a
lot of conflation happening

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.280
between the types of ways that
we connect with other people

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.510
and especially, for
kids whose brains really

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:32.050
evolve to connect with people
face-to-face in a social way.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.920
Interestingly, when I was
writing this book-- for those

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.920
of you who are considering
writing a book,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.510
it takes a really
long time, years.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.160
So when I started to
write this book about-- I

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.760
guess the process
started like 2009.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.000
So that's five
years ago or more.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.130
And people said, well,
what's your next book about?

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.060
And I said, it's
about social networks.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.191
Everybody said, that's
really popular right now.

00:28:56.191 --> 00:28:58.440
That's going to be a great
success because, of course,

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.700
they thought I was writing
about online platforms.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.520
So if we look at
the type of research

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.460
that I just presented
for health and longevity,

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.290
but we look at
learning-- and here I'm

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.790
going to look at
classroom learning

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:19.550
because that's where most of
the research is right now.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.580
What does academic
success hinge on?

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.770
Do I have any guesses
from the group?

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.410
What do you think is the
strongest predictor of,

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.360
besides genes.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.710
Wealth?

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.240
OK.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.200
We're going to strip
out genes and strip out

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.726
wealth, which you
can do if you have

00:29:40.726 --> 00:29:42.230
a good command of statistics.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.820
You could hold it constant.

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.180
But yeah, wealth is a
very good predictor.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.130
Any other ideas?

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:54.375
SUSAN PINKER: Collaborative
learning environments?

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:55.885
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:55.885 --> 00:29:57.260
SUSAN PINKER:
That's interesting.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.406
Any other guesses?

00:29:58.406 --> 00:29:59.120
AUDIENCE: Praise?

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.550
SUSAN PINKER: Pardon me?

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.530
AUDIENCE: Praise.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.530
SUSAN PINKER: Praise.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.610
You guys are amazing.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.590
No wonder you work here.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.410
It's very, very
interesting answers.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:10.331
Well, let's look at
some of the evidence.

00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:13.970
Is it quality of parenting?

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.090
And this is a cartoon that
says, and then Winnie the Pooh

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.315
decided it was time to
check Daddy's email again.

00:30:22.314 --> 00:30:25.040
And there are studies
that show that,

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.500
contrary to what was
thought at first,

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.360
that there is a
difference between reading

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.150
to somebody with a book,
where you turn pages,

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.480
and reading from a tablet.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.550
And that the kids interact
with the medium and the written

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.100
word in very, very
different way--

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.720
and probably close
to the way you guys

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.760
would interact with reading
online, where you would

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.470
follow hyperlinks, for example.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.410
If you want a definition,
you wouldn't get up

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.090
and go get a dictionary
you would just

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:57.830
look right on your screen.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.660
And the difference is that
with kids, their brains

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.234
really, a lot of
them can't handle

00:31:03.234 --> 00:31:04.275
that kind of distraction.

00:31:04.275 --> 00:31:06.850
And they often lose the thread
of what they're reading.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.270
But I'm getting off topic
speaking of lose the thread.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:17.750
Not all learning is what
happens-- thank you very much,

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.360
15 minutes left.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.610
What happens in the kind of
ethereal sphere of cyberspace.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.860
Some of learning has to
do with actually talking

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.830
to other people,
having an exchange,

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:35.270
learning how to debate, learning
how to defend your views,

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.910
and often what is
happening in the classroom

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:42.600
now is that people are,
especially school boards are,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.980
following the path
of least resistance.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.590
Let's look at the
evidence of what

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:53.100
could be predictive of academic
success other than genes.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.590
Peers, and that's where
the collaborative learning

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.080
might come in.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.100
Single-sex schools-- is
this popular in California?

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.439
No?

00:32:02.439 --> 00:32:03.230
That's interesting.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.280
Popular on the east coast.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.950
Class size, whether it's a
big class or a small class.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.817
Whether or not that you
have a network classroom.

00:32:12.817 --> 00:32:14.900
Whether there's a white
board, whether every child

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.400
has his own screen
or her own screen.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.140
Whether there's a skilled
teacher running the show.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.990
Whether they each have
their own laptops,

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.531
although most of
the time now they're

00:32:24.531 --> 00:32:25.790
tablets as opposed to laptops.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.190
I sort of always
wondered, what do they

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:28.981
do for keyboarding when
they have a tablet?

00:32:28.981 --> 00:32:30.970
It's not very comfortable.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:32.232
The parents' culture.

00:32:32.232 --> 00:32:34.190
In other words, whether
they prize achievement,

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.900
whether they push the children,
whether they make sure children

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.890
finish a job that they started
in academic work at least.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.430
Parents' earnings.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.930
What of all of those do the
data tell us is most predictive?

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.280
And when you look
at meta-analyses,

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.910
essentially, when
you crunch the data

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:58.514
from many different studies, one
of the most predictive factors

00:32:58.514 --> 00:32:59.930
of educational
outcomes-- and when

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.346
I talk about
educational outcomes,

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:07.080
I'm talking about achievement,
not things like happiness.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.550
Was the quality of the
teacher, which is interesting.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:15.850
Even the studies of educational
technology, the only ones that

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:19.240
have shown really a
statistically significant

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.840
difference or the ones that
have included a component

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.080
of intense teacher training.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.210
So at the end, it's hard
to know whether it's

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.680
the technology or the
teacher training that

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.320
made a difference.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.830
One really
interesting study that

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:39.250
was done by some economists at
Harvard of school-age children

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.780
crunched a whole bunch of
data of 2.5 million children,

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.530
they hadn't only
their school records,

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.760
but they had their
parent's tax returns,

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.760
so they could rule out income.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.670
And they also had
information on things

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.520
like neighborhood,
where they lived.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.940
So they could control for many
factors that often, really very

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.630
loosely controlled in the past.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:04.080
And what they found was that
where they had areas where

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.139
a teacher boosted kids'
achievement way more than

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.780
could be expected--
in other words,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.230
the teacher was an outlier.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.170
He or she was that good.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.219
If they manipulated
it and replaced

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.130
a mediocre-- or
actually, let's face

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.639
it, a bad teacher--
with that good teacher,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.320
he or she could boost
their achievement,

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.260
but not only that had an
affect on their behavior

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.830
much later in life.

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:30.690
So one year with that
highly skilled teacher

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:35.600
between grades three eight
made it far less likely

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.780
for teenagers to become
pregnant or to make

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.725
their girlfriend pregnant.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.530
It doesn't make them,
but it was associated

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:51.130
with being more likely to go
to college, more likely to go

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.880
to a good, selective
college, more

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.890
likely to earn quite
a lot more as an adult

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.488
over their lifespan.

00:34:59.488 --> 00:35:00.946
Did I have a comment
from somebody?

00:35:00.946 --> 00:35:03.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.350
SUSAN PINKER: Total.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.290
Not per year.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:06.310
Sorry.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.380
No, not per year.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.390
I think it's an increase of
something like 1% per year,

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:15.800
something like that.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.460
More likely to live in a good
neighborhood, which is amazing.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.540
No teenager thinks about this.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:26.820
So it has to do with
immeasurable effects.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.130
And more likely to
save for retirement.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.700
So is there really any
point to distinguishing

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:39.760
between this kind of childhood--
or this kind of childhood which

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.800
is what goes on right
now for many kids

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.790
in their leisure time.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:47.760
Some shocking statistics
are that kids are spending--

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.150
before they get to school, the
average is four hours a day

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.120
on some sort of network device.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.120
By the time they're school
age, it's upwards of seven.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.000
In other words, they spend
more time in front of a screen

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.830
than they do on anything
else except sleeping.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.080
More time than
playing with friends,

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.900
going to the park,
sports, school.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.040
I mean it really eclipses
all their other activities.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.545
So is there any difference
between this and this?

00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:20.190
This is a picture of
me here playing cards

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.610
with my maternal grandparents.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.700
This is the one who
checked up on her friends

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.860
with the black rotary phone.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.040
Is there any difference in
the types of cognitive skills

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.040
that are required and the
types of social skills

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.200
that are required?

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.980
And I think that the research
is just now emerging.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.070
How am I doing for time?

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.540
Ten minutes.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.330
There's just newly
emerging FMRI research

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:51.360
which shows that social
interactions where there's

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.210
really a give and take
between you and somebody else

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.530
elicit different types
of brain activity.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:02.000
Essentially, the way
this research was done

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.520
was, Elizabeth Redcay who
was originally from Harvard

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.630
but is now on the
west coast, she

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.530
compared two groups of subjects.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:11.620
One group of
subjects, essentially,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.440
were in the scanner and
watched canned video,

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.860
say, like YouTube--
that sort of idea.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.810
And the second group
had the same content

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.950
but interacted about
that content socially

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.140
with somebody who was
in the room with them.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.030
It was actually a
research assistant,

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.780
so they had a conversation
or a discussion about it.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.220
And this subtracting
the brain activity

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.140
that happened in
the canned recording

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.060
scenario versus the interactive
scenario, these orange areas

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.890
were the differential bits.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.880
In other words, the
brain differentially

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.940
engages those regions
when interacting

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.800
with a real social
partner as opposed

00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.420
to somebody who is just
watching and listening.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.290
And what are those regions
if you can summarize them?

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.060
They have to do with
social cognition.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.070
Social cognition is
what psychologists often

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.680
call theory of
mind, imagining what

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.350
that other person is
thinking and feeling

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.820
and intending to do next.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:21.100
That's social cognition, paying
attention to those social cues.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.330
Where are they looking?

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:24.680
What does their
body language say?

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.220
Are they standing
too close to you?

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.210
Too far away from you?

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.400
Do they look bored?

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.270
Should you change your
conversation topic?

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.850
And finally, something that's
really interesting to me

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.530
is that elicits more activity
in the amygdala in areas

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:41.900
that signal reward,
that feels good.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.650
You'll keep me on
track here, right?

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:46.760
Because otherwise I'm
going to speed ahead.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:52.660
What are the signals that
are transmitted face-to-face?

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.850
This is work by Sandy
Pentland at MIT.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:58.630
Mimicry and synchrony,
this is how much

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.220
you echo what's going
on with somebody else

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.722
when you're talking to them.

00:39:02.722 --> 00:39:04.680
So if you're in a
restaurant, you lean forward,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.710
and they lean forward.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.490
If you lean back,
they lean back.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.980
If your voice rises in
volume, does their voice

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.750
rise in volume?

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:17.000
Because essentially, we've
evolved to interact in groups.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.620
So, much the way you
see birds fly together

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.185
as a flock or animals
pick up behavior

00:39:22.185 --> 00:39:23.560
from another member
of the group,

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.960
we do very much the
same thing because it

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.590
signals to each other that
we're of one mind, essentially.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:35.010
The activity level, how much
you move around when you talk?

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:38.120
The influence, how much
somebody's expressions

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.990
and movements affect
the other person's?

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.790
And finally,
consistency, meaning

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:47.400
how fluid is the person,
how convincing are they,

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.860
how confident are they.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.280
And when you measure
all of these things,

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.480
this measures group cohesion
and confidence and productivity.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.870
And if I were you, I'd
be asking, well, how

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.950
do you measure those things?

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.850
With a little device that
looks like an iPhone.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.450
This is called the
sociometer and it

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.570
captures those honest signals.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.960
It strips away content.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.200
So say, unlike what is done
at Google where it picks up

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.650
content and aggregates
content, here it

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.530
strips away content and
just looks at those signals.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.590
And using this
little device, you

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.650
can tell, for example,
how negotiations are going

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:28.710
and can predict with a
fair degree of accuracy

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.410
where the negotiation will go.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.560
It predicts salary
increases of about 40%

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.700
if you're more aware of
these honest signals.

00:40:38.114 --> 00:40:39.530
What's really
interesting about it

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:43.010
is that it shows how
cohesive small groups are

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.600
and the types of
signals that you

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.690
need to exchange in a small
group to be productive.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.890
Whereas in larger
groups, for example,

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.880
if the signals are just
logistical-- little bits

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.770
and pieces of
information-- it's not

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.380
really necessary to
be there in person.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.860
So if you confuse the
two, you risk losing

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.050
a whole rich range of data.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.930
Now, I think I'm going
to speed ahead now

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.850
and just show you one other
really cool slide where

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:14.130
an experimenter,
essentially, manipulated

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.720
facial features to find out
who looks more trustworthy.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:22.840
Because essentially,
in-person interactions

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.890
are hugely powerful, but they're
not always used for good.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.270
And when you're together
with somebody face-to-face,

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.370
not only their honest
signals influence you,

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:37.180
but even something like their
facial features influence you.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:42.010
And most politicians know this,
most scam artists know this.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:45.680
And so as you move
along this array,

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.830
I'll show you-- this
is an array that they

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.440
generated of many, many
different gradations

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.875
along the way.

00:41:51.875 --> 00:41:53.250
But essentially,
I'm just showing

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.960
you slices where there were
like 10 gradations in between.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.700
The most honest
faces are those that

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.070
are a little feminine looking.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.640
You see this person looks a
little bit feminine-looking

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.010
where they're arched eyebrows
as opposed to flat eyebrows,

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.960
where they have a softer,
baby-faced look and have

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.730
a cheerful demeanour.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.580
And so people who
have that kind of face

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.660
are more easily
elected, and they're

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.820
better able to pull
the wool over our eyes.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.220
So it's not as a face-to-face
contact is always

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.950
a unilateral good.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:35.680
For example, these guys who are
Ponzi scheme scam artists had

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.080
those believable faces.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.690
Earl Jones is a
Montrealer who scammed

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.750
the Anglo-Saxon
upper crust community

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.230
with his baby face
and his participation

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.400
in community events.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.400
He was a hockey coach.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.090
He was a church deacon.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.000
He did all sorts of great
things for the community.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.400
And people fell for him.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.180
And you can see, there's
his arched eyebrows,

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.140
his baby face, his
smiling demeanor.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.320
This guy, Salah
Ezzedine, essentially,

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.950
bilked the Hezbollah community
of billions of dollars--

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.040
$1.2 billion.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.300
He built Hassan Nasrallah
who was the second in command

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.500
of Hezbollah.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.480
And look, he's got those facial
features too-- high eyebrows.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.760
He's a little too
hairy to look feminine,

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.360
but essentially, he has those
rounded features that convey,

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.340
you can trust me.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:34.150
So why distinguish between
online and face-to-face

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.780
activity?

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.390
I'm going to skip past this.

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.470
In a world where,
essentially, people

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:45.960
are spending a lot of their
time online, leisure time, work

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:52.180
time, school time, our lives
have changed in radical ways.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.740
And we're just now learning
some of the impact of this.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:59.820
And we used to
socialize like this.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.370
Now many of us
socialize with strangers

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.850
who could be continents
away from us.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:10.090
For hours at a time, we spend
more than 520 billion minutes

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.000
a day online.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.120
And that's just the US.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.390
And it's probably
growing as I speak.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.690
So at a time when
our close networks

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:23.550
are reducing, at a time when
loneliness has increased, when

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:28.520
solo living has increased,
it's worth asking the question,

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.800
really, what difference
does it make?

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.360
Because we do know the
evidence does tell us

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.820
that those with large
active in-person networks

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:43.480
tend to live longer, happier
lives with their minds intact.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.620
And when I learned about
this, I was kind of

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.290
like Meg Ryan in "When
Harry Met Sally."

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:53.240
It was like, whatever it is,
I'll have what she's having.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.250
And that dish is what I'm
calling, village effect.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.767
Thank you.

00:44:59.767 --> 00:45:01.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.390
Any questions?

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.457
Yes.

00:45:10.457 --> 00:45:12.180
AUDIENCE: So, could
it be that there

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.430
is some other characters
think that causes

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.450
me both to socialize
and to live longer.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:20.620
Are there studies where they
coach people to socialize more

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.517
and then they
lived a bit longer?

00:45:22.517 --> 00:45:24.100
SUSAN PINKER: There's
a couple of ways

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:27.530
of answering that question
like what came first.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:34.046
And you can't, essentially,
in an ethical experiment,

00:45:34.046 --> 00:45:35.920
take two matched groups
and say, OK, you guys

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.150
aren't going to
have social contact,

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:38.691
and you guys are
going to have a lot.

00:45:38.691 --> 00:45:40.990
But you can do that with rats.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.890
And when you do that with
rats, who are social mammals,

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.201
they develop 84 times the
number of malignant tumors.

00:45:48.201 --> 00:45:48.950
It's bad for them.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.340
And their behavior changes too.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.920
And we also have another natural
experiment that, actually,

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.680
we're really good at in Canada.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.900
It's called solitary
confinement.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.750
And when you put prisoners
in solitary confinement,

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:03.160
essentially, they
lose their marbles.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.610
They become ill in many ways.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:12.120
And there's another-- these are
mostly perspective studies that

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.950
doesn't really answer
what you could answer

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.180
with experimental research.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:21.490
But we do know one thing, which
is that a lot of the lifestyle

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:24.620
research that has
affected all of our lives,

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.480
say, for example, on
cigarette smoking.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.996
It was also
correlational research.

00:46:29.996 --> 00:46:31.870
And it's something that
has changed our lives

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:34.170
and changed our
environment for the better.

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:36.290
And finally, my last
comment about this

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.730
is that, I'm sure a
lot of us in this room

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.850
are physically active without
being Olympic athletes.

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:46.780
We know that this
is good for us.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.650
And if we do a little
bit of, it will

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.290
be good for us a little bit.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.350
And if we're great at it, it
might be marvelous for us.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:57.740
But we can ape the success
of other people and say,

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.360
this works for that
population of 39,000 people.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.450
Maybe it'll work for me.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:06.780
So even without having
definitive experimental

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.300
evidence, which I think is
probably coming in the future,

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.516
we can still act on it before
it's too late essentially.

00:47:15.432 --> 00:47:17.990
AUDIENCE: Going along to
similar of what you just said.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:19.615
So there have been
studies with smoking

00:47:19.615 --> 00:47:22.490
that show if you quit
before a certain age,

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:26.400
it has a huge impact on
your life expectancy.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.135
Have there been
similar studies done

00:47:28.135 --> 00:47:31.130
in determining if you switch
from isolation to fostering

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:34.211
deep social networks
by a certain age it'll

00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:36.447
have an effect on your
life expectancy or not?

00:47:36.447 --> 00:47:38.280
SUSAN PINKER: That's a
really good question.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.590
I don't know of any studies
that have done that.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:45.410
But it would be probably
a really interesting kind

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:46.280
of experiment.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.770
But it would have to be
a natural experiment.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:52.170
Because you can't
impose that on people.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.590
But it would be an
interesting experiment

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.770
to do with lab animals,
say, for example.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:02.020
Right now, they do take
rats and separate them

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.220
and have them grow up in
an isolated environment.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.160
And that has a tremendous
impact on their cognition

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.390
and on their health.

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:11.540
But I wonder, they
could probably

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.920
let them grow to maturity
and then isolate them

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.030
and see what happens.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.011
So you could find out if
there's a critical period.

00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:20.010
I mean I don't have the
answer to that question,

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:22.280
but it would be really
an interesting question.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:28.982
I think one of the ideas that
came to me by immersing myself

00:48:28.982 --> 00:48:30.440
in this research
for a long time is

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:37.720
I see it more as how we view
climate change research.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.560
And when I was growing up,
it was a very different

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.802
environment than we have now.

00:48:41.802 --> 00:48:44.260
I mean you would drive along
the highway, open your window,

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:46.020
and throw trash out the window.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.940
People had no idea
about the ozone layer.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.460
People were not concerned
about pollution.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.340
And we essentially were in
love with the automobile.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.309
And it has taken
us 40 years or more

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:02.600
to realize that there have
been significant trade-offs.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.930
And we can't get back
now what we lost.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:08.330
In other words, our
cities have become donuts

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:11.590
with essentially people
moving to the suburbs

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.690
and we've lost
our downtown core.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.960
Many places have no sidewalks.

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.710
We have a lot of air pollution.

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:20.480
There's been an impact
on people's social lives.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.410
And I see this as a similar
kind of social experiment

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:27.800
where we can't wait for all
the experimental research

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:31.350
to start to examine the
impact, similar to, say,

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:33.452
the natural food movement.

00:49:33.452 --> 00:49:35.160
A lot of people have
changed their habits

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.670
without all the
evidence being in.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:39.470
But they don't want
to hedge their bets.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.670
They want to maybe
act conservatively.

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:46.830
Yes.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.074
And then I'm going
to get to you.

00:49:49.074 --> 00:49:50.740
AUDIENCE: Maybe I
didn't quite catch it,

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.380
but are you equating there's
a long life in happiness?

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.681
Or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:55.681 --> 00:49:56.430
SUSAN PINKER: Yes.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:59.300
I'm not equating long
life and happiness at all.

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:03.410
In other words, you
can be a miserable SOB

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.640
and still live a long life.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.892
So they're two
separate variables.

00:50:07.892 --> 00:50:09.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.750
SUSAN PINKER: Sometimes
they do, but not always.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.234
So there's research
by actually somebody

00:50:14.234 --> 00:50:15.400
who's not too far from here.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.510
He's at UC Riverside.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:21.400
And he more or less showed
that happiness is actually not

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.770
that critical to longevity.

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.320
I think his book is called
"The Longevity Project."

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.210
So happiness is a great
thing for other reasons.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:29.911
I think it's good to be happy.

00:50:29.911 --> 00:50:31.660
And because if you're
not happy, why would

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.286
you want to live a
long life, maybe?

00:50:35.286 --> 00:50:36.660
I mean I think
one of the reasons

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.590
why people live long there is
there is a genetic component.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.670
But the social component makes
them want to live a long life.

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:45.650
They're considered
part of the community.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.470
Whereas if you're isolated here
and you don't talk to anybody

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:50.900
for weeks at a time,
maybe you wouldn't

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.890
want to live that long.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:55.390
So I mean, they're
correlated in some way

00:50:55.390 --> 00:51:01.080
but, in terms of the better
research, does not lend them,

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.100
but separates them.
