is yes and I hope we will be convincing

is yes and I hope we will be convincing
so one way to do that would be to start

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330
so one way to do that would be to start
 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.840
so one way to do that would be to start
with products and that's what the way we

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850
with products and that's what the way we

it's a delusion methodology so we think

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960
it's a delusion methodology so we think
 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.310
it's a delusion methodology so we think
that we need to start with problems with

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320
that we need to start with problems with
 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.900
that we need to start with problems with
philosophical products and then we think

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910
philosophical products and then we think
 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.810
philosophical products and then we think
that you can find in different practices

and so the our question is whether if we

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250
and so the our question is whether if we
 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.370
and so the our question is whether if we
pay attention the clearest attention to

meant by that in that he wanted us to

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:32.630
meant by that in that he wanted us to
 

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.819

variation something which is already
 

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.520
variation something which is already
defined as a variation right so that's

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:30.530
defined as a variation right so that's
 

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.320

that's why

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.330
that's why
 

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.150
that's why
so not to define the president as

so not to define the president as
 

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.250
so not to define the president as
something that changes but to define the

full of variation that it is so it's the
 

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.630
full of variation that it is so it's the

so it's a very under political relation

00:12:41.869 --> 00:12:41.879
so it's a very under political relation
 

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:44.389
so it's a very under political relation

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:03.100
 

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.970
okay now this I did decided that there

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:05.980
okay now this I did decided that there
 

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.340
okay now this I did decided that there
is that thing but rather that there are

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920
 

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.070
and it's like it's a very odd idea which

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.080
and it's like it's a very odd idea which
 

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.500
and it's like it's a very odd idea which

it shows something about what you are
 

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.389

don't forget I wasn't interested in that

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:28.540
don't forget I wasn't interested in that
 

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.540
don't forget I wasn't interested in that
but trying to understand why that

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:30.550
but trying to understand why that
 

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.350

well to say that in English actually

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:41.890
well to say that in English actually
 

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:50.460
well to say that in English actually
it's the net that out emergency and it

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.470
it's the net that out emergency and it
 

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.410
it's the net that out emergency and it
was the terror that it may start the

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:52.420
was the terror that it may start the
 

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.670
was the terror that it may start the
game it was indeed a huge its relation

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:56.680
game it was indeed a huge its relation
 

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.960
game it was indeed a huge its relation
to question much

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:02.970
 

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.400
so in other words the point of this

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:05.410
so in other words the point of this
 

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.110
so in other words the point of this
historical film is not to teach us

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120
historical film is not to teach us
 

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.210
historical film is not to teach us
anything about the past but rather to

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.220
anything about the past but rather to
 

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.670
anything about the past but rather to
make our present itself more problematic

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:11.680
make our present itself more problematic
 

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.480
make our present itself more problematic
to our minds to unsettle our relation to

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:15.490
to our minds to unsettle our relation to
 

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.510
to our minds to unsettle our relation to
ourself now so the math disturbing I

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520
ourself now so the math disturbing I
 

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.230
ourself now so the math disturbing I
have the relation to that the present

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240
have the relation to that the present
 

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.570
have the relation to that the present
it's not that is something which moved

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:23.580
it's not that is something which moved
 

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.110
it's not that is something which moved
no which can't be nerman actually so

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120
no which can't be nerman actually so
 

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.690
no which can't be nerman actually so
it's a strange reversal actually if you

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700
it's a strange reversal actually if you
 

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.880
it's a strange reversal actually if you
think about it in the notion of

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:31.890
think about it in the notion of
 

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:44.210
think about it in the notion of
historical knowledge it's so you have a

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220
historical knowledge it's so you have a
 

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.820
historical knowledge it's so you have a
very clear example of that in the final

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:46.830
very clear example of that in the final
 

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.519
very clear example of that in the final
scene maybe if I have time actually it's

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:49.529
scene maybe if I have time actually it's
 

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:52.039
scene maybe if I have time actually it's
true in some of these where you have the

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:52.049
true in some of these where you have the
 

00:18:52.049 --> 00:18:54.919
true in some of these where you have the
room of the cabinet I think it's a block

00:18:54.919 --> 00:18:54.929
room of the cabinet I think it's a block
 

00:18:54.929 --> 00:18:57.250
room of the cabinet I think it's a block
which is the gas chamber

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:57.260
which is the gas chamber
 

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.190
which is the gas chamber
and you'd say that it is a strange

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200
and you'd say that it is a strange
 

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:07.899
and you'd say that it is a strange
observatory and in fact it means that

00:19:07.899 --> 00:19:07.909
observatory and in fact it means that
 

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:10.840
observatory and in fact it means that
these images which you will see and are

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:10.850
these images which you will see and are
 

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.389
these images which you will see and are
not meant to be see for themselves that

00:19:13.389 --> 00:19:13.399
not meant to be see for themselves that
 

00:19:13.399 --> 00:19:25.810
not meant to be see for themselves that
meant to displace we had in mind the

meant to displace we had in mind the
 

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:36.820
meant to displace we had in mind the

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:36.830
colonial war against other people you

the suspected that was about the caste

00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:38.779
the suspected that was about the caste
 

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.450
the suspected that was about the caste
in the Soviet Union but actually doesn't

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:40.460
in the Soviet Union but actually doesn't
 

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.759
in the Soviet Union but actually doesn't
matter too much in the center the point

00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:42.769
matter too much in the center the point
 

00:19:42.769 --> 00:19:45.430
matter too much in the center the point
is more general than that I think and we

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440
is more general than that I think and we
 

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.990
is more general than that I think and we
can still think about it

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000
can still think about it
