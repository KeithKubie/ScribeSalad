00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.060
Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
World History and today is the penultimate

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.880
episode of Crash Course. We’re gonna talk
about globalization.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.940
This was going to be the last episode, but
I just can’t quit you, World Historians.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.690
So, today we’re going to talk about globalization,
and in doing so, we’re going to talk about

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.239
why we study history at all.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.100
Ooh ooh, Mr. Green!

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.020
Yes, Me from the Past?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.320
We study history to get a good
grade to go to a good college to get a good job --

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.810
--so you can make more money
than you would otherwise make and be a slightly

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.260
larger cog among the seven billion gears that
turn the planet’s economic engine, right?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.440
And that’s fine, but if that’s why you
really study history, then you need to understand

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.989
all the ways that the t-shirt you’re wearing
is both the cause and result of your ambition.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.969
This t-shirt contains the global economy:
its efficiency, its massive surplus, its hyperconnectedness,

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.809
and its unsustainability. This t-shirt tells
one story of globalization. So let’s follow it.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:55.700
[Theme Music]

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.260
So, globalization is a cultural phenomenon.
It’s reflected in contemporary artwork and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.729
population migration and linguistic changes,
but we’re going to focus, as we so often

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.470
have during Crash Course, on trade.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.550
So the world today, as symbolized by our international
felt melange, experiences widespread global

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.470
economic interdependence. Now, of course economic
interdependence and the accompanying cultural

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.890
borrowing are nothing new. You’ll remember
that we found trade documents from the Indus

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.530
Valley civilization all the way in Mesopotamia.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.780
But for a few reasons, the scale of this trade
has increased dramatically:

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.200
1. Multinational corporations have global
reach and increasing power.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.860
2. Travel and shipping are cheap and safe.
It took about two months to cross the Atlantic

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.600
in 1800. Today it takes about five hours by
plane, and less than a week by ship.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.950
3. Governments have decreased tariffs and
regulations on international trade, leading

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.170
to what is sometimes called euphemistically
”free trade.” To which I say, if this

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.710
trade is so free, how come BBC America is
in the premium tier of my cable package?

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.390
To understand the role that governments play
in international trade, let’s look again

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.890
at this t-shirt. This t-shirt, like most t-shirts
made in the world, contains 100% American

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.000
cotton. And that’s not because the U.S.
makes the best cotton or the most efficient

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.409
cotton, it’s because the U.S. government
subsidizes cotton production. And that’s

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.009
what makes this cotton cheaper than cotton
of similar quality from Brazil or India. But

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.670
in the last 30 years, the US’s share of
cotton exports has gone down as Brazil, India,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.760
and Africa’s cotton exports go up. And that
trend will likely continue as the US moves

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.390
away from its expensive cotton subsidies.
In fact, these days it’s already possible

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.210
to find t-shirts with Brazilian, Indian, or Ugandan cotton,
or a mixture of cottons from all around the world.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.440
But because the American government doesn’t
subsidize industry in the way it does agricultural

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.690
production, the actual spinning and weaving
of the cotton takes place in lower wage countries:

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.000
Mexico, Guatemala, Vietnam, China, India,
China, China, sometimes even China. And then the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.080
finished shirts, called blanks, are usually sent to Europe 
or the United States for screen printing, and then sold.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.060
You would think the most expensive part of
this process is the part where we ship this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.390
across the Pacific Ocean, turn it into this,
and then ship it back across the Pacific Ocean,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.580
but you’d be wrong. Wholesale t-shirt blanks
can cost as little as $3; the expense is in

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.720
the printing, the retail side of things, and
paying the designer at Thought Bubble who

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.240
was tasked with the difficult job of creating
a Mongol who is at once cute and terrifying.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.450
So contemporary global trade is pretty anarchic
and unregulated, at least by international

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.459
institutions and national governments. Much
of this has to do with academic economists,

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.630
mostly in the U.S. and Europe who have argued
with great success that governmental regulation

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.810
diminishes prosperity by limiting growth.
Now, some nations-- in Latin America, the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.940
Caribbean, and Africa-- haven’t been particularly
keen to pursue free trade but they’ve been

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.330
bullied into it by larger economies with whom
they desperately need to trade.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.989
So in the past 30 years, we’ve seen all
these emerging markets lowering their tariffs,

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.270
getting rid of regulation, and privatizing
formerly state-run businesses. And they often

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.989
do that to appease the International Monetary
Fund, which offers low interest loans to developing

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.840
world economies with the motto: Many Strings
Attached.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.800
Now, whether these decreased regulations have
been a net positive for these developing world

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.050
economies is a subject of much debate, and
we will wade into it but not until next week.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.069
First, we need to understand more about the
nature of this trade. So you’ll remember

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.180
from the Industrial Revolution episode that
industrial western powers produced most of

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.110
the manufactured goods, which were then sold
in international markets, but you’ll also

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.190
remember that domestic consumption was extremely
important. I mean, almost all early Model

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.720
T’s were built by Americans, and bought
by Americans.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.710
But since the 1960s, and especially today,
former non-industrialized parts of the world

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.660
had been manufacturing consumer goods-- for
domestic markets, yes, but primarily for foreign

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.470
ones. This t-shirt, made in China and the
Dominican Republic before being imported to

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.160
Mexico and then to the United States, is a
primary example of what I’m talking about,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.380
but so is the computer that you’re watching
me on. Your computer was probably manufactured

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.880
in China, but with parts from all over the
world, especially Taiwan, Japan and South

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.500
Korea.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.030
And this international manufacturing is always
finding, like, new markets too. Like, Brazil,

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.190
for instance, has a huge technology sector.
They make iPads there, actually. Sorry, I’m

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.880
trying to play Angry Birds. But, what all
these countries have in common is that while

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.020
there is a domestic market for things like
iPads and t-shirts, the foreign markets are

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.210
much, much bigger. Oh, it’s time for the
Open Letter?

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.660
An open letter to Cookie Monster. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.400
today. Oh, it’s a cookie dough flavored
Balance Bar. For people who love cookies and

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.740
pretending to be healthy.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.040
Dear Cookie Monster, Here’s the thing, man.
You don’t have a stomach. That’s why when

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.020
you put a cookie in your mouth, it crumbles
up and then it just falls out of your mouth.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.699
But here’s what fascinates me, Cookie Monster.
I believe you when you say you love cookies.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.080
It doesn’t matter that you can’t actually
eat cookies because where you would have a

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.729
stomach, you instead have someone’s arm.
And that, Cookie Monster, is what makes you

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:44.350
a beautiful symbol for contemporary consumption.
You just keep eating. Even though you can’t

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.850
eat. Cookie Monster, you are the best and
the worst of us.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.380
Best wishes, John Green

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.340
So, although die-hard Marxists might still
resist this, by 2012 it’s become pretty

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.990
obvious that global capitalism has been good
for a lot of people. It's certainly increased

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.889
worldwide economic output. And while American
autoworkers may suffer job loss, moving manufacturing

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.229
jobs from high wage to lower wage countries
allows a greater number of people to live

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.720
better than they did when the First and Second
Worlds monopolized manufacturing. And while

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.080
I don’t want to conflate correlation and
causation, some 600 million people have emerged

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.669
from poverty in the last 30 years, at least
according to the World Bank’s definition

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.430
of poverty, which is living on less than $1.25
a day.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.380
Americans can argue about whether absurdly
inexpensive clothes, shoes and televisions

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.680
are worth the domestic economic and social
dislocation, but for the Vietnamese worker

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.750
stitching a pair of sneakers, that job represents
an opportunity for a longer, healthier and

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.440
more secure life than she would have had if
those shoes were made in the U.S.A.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.380
But, before we jump on the celebratory globalization
bandwagon, let’s acknowledge that this brave

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.910
new world has some side effects. For instance,
it maybe hasn’t been so good for families,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.169
it definitely has not been good for the environment,
and also there’s a chance that globalization

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.729
will spark, like, the end of the human species.
But, we’re gonna talk about all that next

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.190
week. For today, let’s bring on the bandwagon
and ride straight for the Thought Bubble.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.740
So these days, people move more than they
ever have. 21% of people living in Canada

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.520
were born somewhere else, as was an astonishing
69% of Kuwait’s current population.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.340
Migration has become easier because:

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.700
1. Air travel is pretty cheap, especially if
you only take a few plane trips in your life, and

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.720
2. It’s relatively easy and inexpensive
to stay in touch with relatives living far

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.910
away thanks to Skype, mobile phones, and inexpensive
calling cards. Also

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.479
3. Even with increased industrialization in
the developing world, economic opportunities

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:37.449
are often much better in wealthy countries.
Remittances-- money sent home by people working

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:42.729
abroad-- are now a huge driver of economic
growth in the developing world. Like, in Tajikistan,

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:49.120
for instance, remittances are 35% of the country’s
total gross domestic product.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.600
With all these people moving around the world,
it’s not surprising that globalization also

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.699
means cultural blending. When people move,
they don’t just give up their literary,

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:00.830
culinary, artistic, and musical traditions.
Globalized culture is a bit of a paradox,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.990
though, because some people see culture today
as increasingly Americanized, right? Like,

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.490
FRIENDS is currently broadcast in over 100
countries; you can find Diet Coke for sale

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.520
deep in the jungles of Madagascar; the NBA
is huge in China. There are fewer languages

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.740
spoken today, and probably less cultural diversity.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.130
But on the other hand, an individual’s access
to diverse cultural experience has never been

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:28.340
greater. Bollywood movies, Swedish hip hop,
Brazilian soap operas, highlights from Congolese

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.200
football matches, these are all available
to us. Culinary cultural fusion is all the

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.890
rage; more novels are translated from languages
than ever before, although few are actually

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:43.770
read; and in the surest sign of cultural globalization,
football, the world’s game, has finally

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.709
reached America, where broadcasts of the greatest
collective enterprise humanity has ever known,

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:53.870
Liverpool Football Club, got record ratings
in 2012. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:59.880
Hey, one last request: Could you put me in
a Liverpool jersey? On the pitch at Anfield?

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.080
Raising the premier league trophy? WITH STEVEN
GERRARD HUGGING ME? YES, JUST LIKE THAT. OH,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.170
THOUGHT BUBBLE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.490
Okay, so this all brings us to how globalization
has changed us, and whether it’s for the

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.470
better. Assuming you make the minimum wage
here in the United States, this t-shirt, purchased

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.890
at your friendly neighborhood e-tailer dftba.com,
will cost you about three hours’ worth of

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.680
work-- and yes, that does include shipping.
By the time it arrives at your door, the cotton

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.610
within that t-shirt will have traveled by
truck, train, ship, possibly even airplane

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.750
if you opt for priority shipping. And it will
probably have travelled further than Magellan

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.160
did during his famous circumnavigation of
the globe. You get all that for THREE HOURS

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.180
of work; by contrast, a far less comfortable
garment several hundred years ago would have

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.410
cost you ten times as much work.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.970
But these improvements have been accompanied
by change so radical that we struggle to contextualize

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:58.470
it. Like, the human population of our planet
over time looks like this. Dang. Like, in

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.480
1800, there were a billion human beings on this planet.
And that was more than had ever been seen before.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.540
And we live more than twice as long on average
as humans did just two centuries ago, largely

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.420
due to improved health care for women in childbirth
and their infants, but also thanks to antibiotics

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.050
and the second agricultural revolution that
began in the 1950s, the so-called “green

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:22.080
revolution” that saw increased use of chemical
fertilizers lead to dramatically higher crop yields.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.110
Of course, these gains haven’t been evenly
distributed around the world, but chances

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.420
are if you’re watching this, you A. survived
childbirth and B. feel reasonably confident

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.380
that your children will as well. That’s
a new feeling for humans. And as a parent,

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.640
I can assure you, it’s a miracle, and one
to be celebrated.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.310
We study history so that we can understand
these changes, and so that we can remember

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:46.610
both what we’ve gained and lost in getting
to where we are. Next week, our last week,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.720
we’ll look at the many facets of globalization
that aren’t causes for celebration. But

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.890
for today, let’s just pause to consider
how we got from here to here, how the relentless

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:01.700
and unquenchable ambition of humans led to
a world where the entire contents of the Library

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:07.080
of Alexandria would fit on my iPhone along
with recordings of everything Mozart ever

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.019
composed. In such a world, it’s easy to
feel that we are big and powerful, maybe even

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:18.060
invincible. It’s easy to feel that... and also dangerous.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.720
