00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.232
- [Instructor] What
we're going to try to do

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:05.719
is use our powers of calculus to

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:08.960
find this blue area right over here.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.677
What this blue area is is the area

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.938
in between successive loops of

00:00:12.938 --> 00:00:14.935
the graph, the polar graph.

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:18.001
R of theta is equal to
three theta sin theta.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.290
I'm graphing it in polar coordinates here.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.744
Just to make sure we understand

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:24.189
what's going on, this first loop gets

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.106
traced out when theta
goes between zero and pi,

00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:31.868
so this is zero is less than or equal

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:34.502
to theta is less than or equal to pi.

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:36.980
That makes sense, when theta is zero,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.477
this whole thing is zero, but then

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:42.555
as theta increases, our
R increases as well.

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:44.762
But then as theta goes back to

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.663
approaching pi, remember sin of pi

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:48.484
is zero, so then this thing will

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.774
approach zero again, so that makes sense.

00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:53.384
Then as we go from pi to two pi,

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:55.279
you might expect to see some type

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:58.022
of a graph down here, but what you need

00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:02.044
to realize is when we
go from pi to two pi,

00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:04.976
sin of those thetas are gonna be negative.

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:07.328
So what it does is it flips over,

00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:09.756
so instead of having an R right over

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:11.428
here in the third quadrant, when we're

00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:13.556
a little past theta being a little bit

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.105
more than pi, since R would be negative,

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:20.301
it flips over and then it
ends up right over there.

00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:22.968
Between theta from pi to two pi,

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.475
we actually trace out this second

00:01:26.475 --> 00:01:29.077
circle right over here, this outer one.

00:01:29.077 --> 00:01:31.320
It makes sense that the radius is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.251
getting larger because we have

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:35.335
this three theta right over here.

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:38.472
As theta is getting larger and larger

00:01:38.472 --> 00:01:40.529
in magnitude, we should say the

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:43.360
magnitude of our R is getting larger.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.871
It turns out that the R would have been

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.638
up here if it was positive, but then

00:01:47.638 --> 00:01:49.595
it goes negative, it goes out here,

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:51.179
but it has a larger and larger

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.093
magnitude because of this three theta.

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:55.773
With that out of the way, let's

00:01:55.773 --> 00:01:58.976
think about how we find this area.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:00.697
In general, if you're looking at

00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:03.000
a polar curve and if you want to find

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.279
an area, the general notion is

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:08.743
you would go from theta is equal

00:02:08.743 --> 00:02:10.973
to, let's just call it alpha, to

00:02:10.973 --> 00:02:12.804
theta is equal to beta, so this

00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:15.111
would be your bounds on your angle.

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:16.827
What you do, and we've shown this,

00:02:16.827 --> 00:02:18.608
we've given you the intuition for it

00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:20.843
in previous videos, it would be

00:02:20.843 --> 00:02:24.343
one half times R of theta squared D theta,

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.487
is the general formula for finding

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:30.359
the area inside of a polar curve.

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.018
But what we're trying to do here is

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:35.031
find the area between two successive loops

00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:37.037
for this polar curve, where as theta

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:40.925
goes from zero to two
pi, so how do we do that?

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.825
One way to do that, we can find

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:46.742
the total area in this larger loop,

00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.611
and then subtract from that the

00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:55.790
area in the smaller loop right over here.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.401
How do we do that?

00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:59.038
At any point, if you get inspired,

00:02:59.038 --> 00:03:00.565
pause the video, it's always good for you

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:02.240
to try to work it through yourself

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.836
than just passively
watch me work through it.

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:07.162
Let's do it together, so
what's the area of this

00:03:07.162 --> 00:03:11.081
outer circle if we include
this right over here?

00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:13.061
That's going to be the integral.

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:14.631
Remember, the outer circle gets traced

00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:17.214
out as we go from pi to two pi,

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:20.857
and it'd be one half times all

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:25.168
of this business squared, so three theta

00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:27.668
sin of theta squared, D theta.

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:33.247
That's the outer circle,
and then from that we

00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:36.682
want to subtract the area
of this inner circle.

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:39.209
Minus, what are the bounds there?

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.068
We said we'd trace out that inner circle

00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:44.697
as we go from zero to pi, zero to pi,

00:03:44.697 --> 00:03:47.447
one half times three theta sin of

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:53.333
theta squared, D theta.

00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:57.054
It turns out that these are not

00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:59.524
trivial integrals to solve on your own,

00:03:59.524 --> 00:04:01.270
but we have tools, in fact, if you're

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.945
taking a lot of classes they expect

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:04.356
you to be able to use tools.

00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:06.130
If you're taking AP Calculus BC,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.760
they would expect you to be able to

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.214
use a graphing calculator, so that's

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:10.563
what we're gonna do right now in

00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:12.214
order to calculate this quantity,

00:04:12.214 --> 00:04:13.822
or to calculate this area, so let

00:04:13.822 --> 00:04:17.739
me get out my TI-84
emulator, there we have it.

00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:22.634
Let's see, I want you
to see my keystrokes,

00:04:22.634 --> 00:04:24.446
so let me see if I can remember that.

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:25.918
The first, well it's the same thing

00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:27.893
over again, it's just different bounds.

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.827
The first time, what you want to do

00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:32.284
is you want to go to the math functions,

00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:33.956
math, and then you see right over

00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:36.584
here this is your definite
integral function.

00:04:36.584 --> 00:04:39.087
I'm just gonna scroll down there,

00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:40.965
to the definite integral and this

00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:43.154
TI-84 Plus CE I guess, writes it in

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:45.817
nice, definite integral notation.

00:04:45.817 --> 00:04:47.462
Sometimes you'll just see that

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:48.984
FN int open parentheses and then

00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:51.013
you write the expression, you say

00:04:51.013 --> 00:04:52.640
what your integrating with respect

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.241
to and then you give the bounds,

00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.349
but here it's pretty clear.

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.782
Remember that blue
integral right over there,

00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:01.756
I want to go from pi, so I'll do

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:04.433
second, that's the pi
button right over here,

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:07.516
pi to two pi, two second pi, and then

00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:15.132
I'm going to have one
divided by two times,

00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:22.354
and I'm just gonna do
it with respect to X,

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:24.811
it doesn't matter if I do all the thetas,

00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:26.865
instead of thetas I use Xs, so I'm

00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:28.740
gonna have, and I'm just doing that to

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.435
make it easy to type into the calculator.

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:34.435
This is going to be three X sin of X

00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:41.296
and then I am going to want to square

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:43.879
this entire thing, so sin of X,

00:05:44.903 --> 00:05:46.926
whoops, I don't want to go there,

00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:50.172
sin of X, I have that doesn't close

00:05:50.172 --> 00:05:52.087
that parentheses yet, okay that

00:05:52.087 --> 00:05:55.453
closes that parentheses, and so I

00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:58.648
want to square that, so squared.

00:05:58.648 --> 00:06:00.172
There you have it, and then I want

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:03.862
to do DX, so that's that
first blue integral.

00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:07.114
From that, I want to subtract, so I'll

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:09.220
get my math function again, I can just

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.844
click nine, it does the integral again.

00:06:11.844 --> 00:06:16.796
Now I'm gonna go from zero
to pi of this same thing.

00:06:16.796 --> 00:06:19.879
I'm gonna go from zero to second, pi.

00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:24.771
I'm gonna try to type in that same thing.

00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.771
I am doing one divided by two, times

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:31.762
open parentheses, three X sin of X

00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:41.733
close that, close that, so that's that

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:45.476
and I'm gonna square it, square it.

00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:48.393
Then I have my DX, so then I do DX,

00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:51.668
and if I typed in everything correctly

00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:55.414
I should just be able to
press enter and get the value.

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:58.164
I got 139 point, we're just gonna

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:02.890
round to the nearest hundred, .53.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.390
This is approximately 139.53 square units.
