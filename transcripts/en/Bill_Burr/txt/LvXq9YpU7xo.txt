Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, June 11th, 2018 what's going on? How are Ya? How's everybody doing? I'm a fucking old man. It's 50 year old. Oh, I remember when podcasting started back in 2005 I just want to throw that out there cause I know there's going to be a bunch of fucking old podcast people going.

Speaker 2:          00:00:28       Well it should. The puck is, it's been ruined. Japan since 1968 and I studied my poor kid asleep. Full use before years in [inaudible]. When mind is you get these many, many hits. His Huish judge on who gives a fuck.com I actually look at the numbers every week and I feel them. We put [inaudible] [inaudible] come on chanted. I'm, I'm providing

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       computer. Will you shut the fuck up? I love people. Look at their fucking podcast numbers. You notice everybody seems to be in the top 10 everybody, you know it's like five talked about this before. It's like a, it's like back when I used to do college gigs, every college I went to somehow they figured out a way to fudge the numbers that they were number one in something. You know the number one a fucking school for mathematics, the number one school for engineering's doesn't have to have mathematics in it. I don't know. Right. And then we're just so you get down to a community college and they'd be the number one commuter college, uh, you know, with fucking the best deal with triple a or some shit. I don't know. Some other one. Number one is something you got to hang your hat on something.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       If you're a college to try and get people to go there. If I, if I was a dean, do they have deans at like community colleges? I would just, I would go on fucking TV and say, listen, why the fuck would you go for years when you can only pay two years? You know, you want to go to Harvard, fine. All you have to go as your junior and senior year go your freshman and sophomore year over us over us. We are number one and being fucking 10 times less per year than Harvard. You got the grades, you know you're in. Come on down and teach us dummies, my dumb students. How do we have fucking loafers with those socks? Whatever the fuck it is. You smart people to do your freshman and sophomore year here translate, translate, fucking transfer over to Harvard. And then you go and you can graduate from Harvard wide a dad, Ya de judge you or whatever they'd fucking school song is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       What is this school? So my dad is rich and I did real bad in school, but he has money. So, um, fuck in here now, let's see. That's a stereotype. I searched. Well, I knew, I knew a I, one kid in my high school, he got into Harvard and he did it with fucking grades and no social life. He made the sacrifice. The rest of us didn't want to do it. You know, like that little fable there with the fucking ants saving all the food and the other animals like, hey man, I'm just jumping around having a good fucking time. You know, you know who wrote that story? I bet somebody who couldn't fucking, who was really socially awkward at a party. So he was looking at the fucking, was it a rabbit toward us in the hair? That's not the story. I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       But you know, people who are outgoing, they, they get fucking annoyed by people who are outgoing, who are out there having a good time talking some shit, hooking up, right. Sing songs. They in the life of the party, they stand on the side and the fucking wall and they write scripts, you know, so that's why now, I dunno what the fuck happened back in the day. Used to have cool people movies. Now I'd be cool person has this underlying insecurity that they're trying to overcompensate for. That's all right. Shit. I think, you know what I mean? Some people just are the life of the party. So anyways, now that I'm a senior citizen, I banged out 54 pushups on my birthday, a boy, and then immediately just fucking collapsed onto the carpet and was like out of breath. Like, I ran 54 flights of stairs, but I did it, man. I did it. I don't know what it means. It's still means I'm 50, but it made me feel pretty good about myself. Um, I had a great birthday. I want to thank my lovely wife. Um, she surprised me with tickets to the French Open Roland Garros module to Limu.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       Um, we fucking, we went there and I got to see, uh, what the fucks his is his name there. He's the only one left. He just won his 11th Rafael Nadal. That's right. I'm not the biggest fucking tennis guy. And I knew that he had won this thing a couple times. I didn't realize he'd already won the fucking French Open. You'd already won it 10 times. And I saw him when his 11th. And what's really interesting is that guy, um, he wanted oh five oh six oh seven oh eight and then Federer, one oh nine, then he wanted in 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. So he won it four years in a row, Mr Year. And then when it, five years in a row and then two years, 15 and 16, he didn't win it. So people probably all thought, all right, his run is over. He's one of the greats of all time, but now that he's older, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he fucking comes back last year and this year to go back to back again, winning 11 and I was talking to somebody last night and we were trying to say how, how, what, what do you compare that to in a different sport?

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       You know, you can't really say it's like winning an NBA championship because there's only one of those where with tennis majors there's, there's four. So it's like they have four sort of Superbowls. So we kind of said, I guess you'd have to go to golf, compare it to golfers were, um, you know, there's four majors in that sport. I don't fucking know. It was kind of saying, well, maybe it's like Lebron going to the NBA finals eight, nine years in a row. And it's like, well, no, because this guy actually won the thing. Um, I can't believe people give Lebron Shit after losing to them. They, people forget so quickly. You know, how ridiculous it was that Kevin Duran went to the warriors and then the very, you know, and then he wins a championship. People like what the fuck? And they need to scan and say, ah, this is how it is.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       This just how it is. Like when they first put led a little fucking TVs in the back of cabs and people like get these things the fuck out of there and then making me car sick, then I got right. And then later on they just put them back in again and nobody said, oh yeah, I guess this is just how, I guess this is just how it is. Right. Um, all right. Uh, I don't know what the fuck I was going with that, uh, tennis golf majors to shit. But I mean, just the fact that this guy won 11 in a row and I basically got to see on my birthday the greatest, um, I guess you'd have to say the greatest player ever on clay. I got to see him. I got to see the fucking Wayne Gretzky, the Bobby will, uh, uh, tennis and, uh, he was playing this other kid.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       Now he broke him his first game of both sets and the kid had a bunch of unforced errors and uh, you know, you could see he kept that the guy who lost it seem like he was a kid and he just had to go there, experience it, lose, make a bunch of unforced errors for the next time when he comes back. And in the end, right, these English dude comes out who won the French Open? Uh, I dunno it from the way he was talking was like late fifties, early sixties. And he came out to say a bunch of great shit about Raphael and they dowel. And then when he talks about the other kid, he was just like, go. And, you know, we would have liked to see more, we ought to say more tennis said, uh, I'm sure he's, uh, a little disappointed in his game today as were the rest of us. And everyone's just sitting there going like, dude, you didn't need to fucking say that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       I couldn't tell if the guy was nervous that he just sort of talked himself into a corner and he meant to say, um, he has nothing to be disappointed about. I don't what I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, but everybody's just kind of sitting there like, Eh, I kind of, uh, of put a fucking damper on things. I mean minutes about done here. Right. Sorry, got the bootleg recorded here. Um, which I have on my stomach too soft. He started hearing grumbling. I apologize. Um, anyways, um, I was able to watch game, uh, was at game three of the NBA finals when I was in London at about two in the morning. I was able to watch and I was able to watch my God, the fucking Washington capitals.

Speaker 3:          00:09:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       Win The Stanley Cup through Josh Adam Meyers. Cause I couldn't get it on my phone cause I couldn't remember my password from fucking, um, you know, my cable company. I could've just gone on to NBC sports and just sat there and watched it. But my, my daughter and my wife were sleeping, so I was laying a bed while in bed wide awake with the lights out, just hitting refresh on my phone, looking at the score. And uh, when there was a few minutes left, I text Josh Adam Meyers and he goes, dude, he goes for fuck it. He was the one to tell me was just going to NBC sports. And of course it didn't work out for me because I knew my password. And he goes, oh, call me up. I'll answer my computer, I'll facetime and, or some shit. So I said, all right, but here's the thing, I'm going to be in the dark and I can't say anything because my, my daughter's sleeping in the same room and everything.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       So he goes, all right, call me. So I snuck into the bathroom lights still out because the only way to turn on the lights in that fucking hotel room as I had to have the bathroom door open, which would have woke my kid up. So I'm sitting in there that like a dark in the dark, like a creep. The only thing that's lighting me up is off of my fucking phone. It looked like a horror movie and Josh was just laughing at me and he's like, can you see, can you see it? And I just put my pasty white, the hand up to the screen, given the thumbs up. And I actually watched the final three minutes of the Stanley Cup. Um, and I have to tell you, uh, this guy on the Internet put it best. He said in talking about Alexander Ovechkin, he goes, I don't, can't remember the last time.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       I was just happy for a complete stranger. Um, that was watching the capital's when was everything that you fucking watch sports for? It's everything that I love about sports. And, um, do you know anybody that says, you know, Russian players don't give a shit about the Stanley Cup? Just all I need to do is just watch him walking around with that thing in Vegas. And how cool is it? Like they actually know it would've been great if they wanted it at home, obviously, but like if you got a win it on the road, Las Vegas has to be the place you want to be if you're going to go party. Right. And, um, I say it every year at the Stanley Cup is the greatest fucking championship trophy and all the sports simply because there's only one. And you grew up as a kid watching all your heroes hoists in that thing up.

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       And when you're in the million to one odds, whatever the fuck it is that you actually went in, when you hoist thing up, you're holding the same cup. You know, Maurice, which Shard Gordie Howe, Bobby or Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier, Mario Lemieux, all of these great big, same fucking Cup Eisenman all of those guys, you hoist that fucking thing up, said Dave, you know, Ciara, right? Tries. I had to throw another Braun in there. Um, it's the coolest fucking thing ever, you know, however, I would not drink out of it. I can tell you that right now, because I didn't spend enough guys who've, uh, you know, over the years, hockey, former hockey players that have told stories about some of the shit that happens to the Stanley Cup. He goes, yeah. And one of them, I've vaguely remember somebody saying, I would not drink out of that thing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       This stories of strippers sitting in the top of the fucking thing and bending it or some shit like that. Um, I dunno. And then each player gets it for like a week. It's so fucking crazy. So crazy. And then there's this guy, there's gotta be a fucking movie about that sometime. The poor bastard who has to follow the cup around all year. Somebody must have done a documentary on it. Vaguely remember seeing some shit like that where you get a follow what, you know, go up to fucking a titty bar and Saskatoon, whatever the fuck that cup ends up for the week. Um, but anyways, congratulations to the Washington capitols in their first Stanley Cup championship. And, uh, what is it, 44 years, 45 seasons. Um, and as I tweeted, one other great thing is, uh, NHL has another great hockey city in Las Vegas. And after all those years of taking these cities that just, you know, there was the initial excitement and then it just kind of fizzled. Um, they kind of hit a home run in Nashville, in Las Vegas, and I got a feeling that Seattle's going to be huge just because those fans are maniacs, you know? And I'm sure they'll build a stadium to make him sound even louder.

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       Why

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       do I always give them shit? You know what? Because it's fun because it's fun. Oh, I heard Edelman got busted for something. PDS is something like that. And, uh, now they're gonna, he's gonna appeal it. And what I'm going to love about that and is now everybody's going to be like, she, that's why they beat Atlanta and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, and all this fucking shit because of the Patriots. That's how it works. You'll just look the other way when 30% of the Legion of boom tested positive for fucking steroids. Ah, that's all right. That's all right. That's Seattle. That's okay. I At pee, Dee sent to my house in my wife's name did for my wife. She was taking a pop tart out of the toaster and she hurt her shoulder and she needed a fucking steroids to get back in shape again so she could make some fucking lemon Marangu Pie.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       Anyways. Um, if I had to guess, you know, we had that horrific injury and he's doing the Andy Pettitte thing. He's fucking trying to get back. He took some fucking roids and you go kite took something and go kite is what I'm thinking. Um, but I do know anytime anybody seems to appeal these things, I don't think that ever goes back the other way. But I'm glad that I'm not in the u s to listen to ESPN and all these fucking guys. And they'll say, oh yeah, yeah, they should take away all their titles because they got caught there to play or get caught doing what a player got caught on. Every other fucking team has done. Um, so anyways, enough, uh, enough with the sports shit. I am in Patty, Amy and Patty and I am bombing with my French. They didn't brush up as enough as I wanted to and it's making me discouraged, but I'm hanging in there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       I got my, uh, I got my fucking, uh, what do you call it? Rosetta stone in that Shit I'll do when you, when you go to the fucking French Open, all right? And you have your ticket, you go in and you got to have the fucking thing scanned. And then after he gets scanned, you get this little fucking, it's like a ticket the size of the, then they put in your fucking wiper when you, when you pay for parking. All right? And then everywhere you go, you have to take that thing out and they have to scan it to know where the fuck you are at all times. You know, I went into the Goddamn gift shop, bought a little fucking 2018 Roland Garros Mug, and he goes, I need to, you know, let me scan your ticket. And it's just like, I wish you just said no, you're not scanning my fucking ticket.

Speaker 1:          00:16:24       I'm paying for that. So now what does that add? Does that add to my whole fucking information online? He's into drums. He does this. He drinks too much whisky and he, he can't lay off of a mug when he's in some touristy fucking place. Now I'm going to get all these fucking ads. Now I'm going to get all these ads in the side when I go to fucking porno sites and shit about mugs can be funny if there, why don't they have a gift shop on online? Poor porn. Why go there were good. Um, actually they'd probably do. Um, so anyways, every fucking place you went yet to keep taking out, keep taken out and put it away, whatever. So now, finally I'm going, you know, I bought like a fucking still water in a crepe for my wife and I had to get the things scanned.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       You know what? I'm in another country, so I'm on my best behavior. Normally I would be like, why the fuck do I have to scan this? But the only reason why I didn't say this is I didn't know how to say, why the fuck do I have to get this thing scanned, you know, in French on Francais, right? So now I go to walk in, it's five or three French time and uh, the match starts at three o'clock, right? So we go to go in and guess what I can't find because they've had to take it out of my pocket 58 fucking times. I can't find a ticket. I need to get into the goddamn match. But I have that other thing. And the ladies that come starting, sir, you could not get into the bay, but it's a, but dude, I was fucking shit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       And I'm just like, are you serious? Then she got mad at me. She's like, yes, yes. I had to go all the way the fuck back, wade through all of these goddamn people. Then go to customer service. Oh my God, the fucking Tourette's that was going on with me as I walked all the way back past all of these fucking people. Um, I got to give it up to the French people. You know, you guys, you know, you don't smell as bad as everybody says, but I will say this when you do. Holy Shit Dude. When we walked out of the stadium, there was this guy like fucking, he was probably really good six feet in front of me. And I said, Jesus Christ, we actually made, he went left down the stairs. After one flight I would write and I tried to get away from the guy. I said, can I have my shirt up over my nose so bad? This guy smelled. I said to me, and because she's closest guy smells like fucking plate. How do you smell that bed? Sitting watching people working out? Maybe because he was walking down the stairs fast. Who's creating a breeze? And it was passing through his fucking French arm pits. But Holy Shit. Did that guy stick? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:19:02       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:03       Not as bad as a homeless guy, but like he smelled like he, you know, freshly homeless, good. Three, four days, you know, maybe a tornado hit his fucking house and Fema hadn't come over to help them get, that's what this fucking guy smelled like sitting, you know. And tennis is a really snobby fucking rich person's sport, especially down below, you know, up top, it's a bunch of animals. That's where we were sitting in. If you ever go, uh, we got front row in the upper deck, get the second row upper deck, cause front row they had this glass thing, but you know that you partition that you look through. But on top of it they have this solid thing that all holds it together. And I was like in America this would have been clear plastic. So I had to look over and duck under it, the whole fucking match, which was still fine. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       So anyways, but down low is where all the fucking, you know, the coaches are the super fucking rich people and they go there and like fucking outfits and they're big dumb hats and all of that shit. But all the animals were up top, you know, doing the wave and shit when nay dow had some problem going on with the servant hand or his arm. I don't know what the fuck happened. And, um, but anyways, I always, it was, it was an amazing fucking time. So I had to go all the way back and I got the ticket. Then I came walking up and I, you know, after all that flipping out and all of that fucking bullshit, I still made it in the time to see the match as always. 99% of the time I flip out later on if there's a solution, whatever I thought was going to happen because of the inconvenience, never fucking happens.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       And, um, I thought I was going to leave all of that behind in my forties, but evidently it's to continue. I started strong the day I turned 50. Fucking, it just continued on. So, um, I'm going to rent a fucking bicycle today and I'm going to ride around Paris with my, uh, my daughter goes to sleep and we just been having the, uh, the best time here. As always. I'm going to take a well deserved fucking little vacation here. And, um, the hardest thing for me on vacation is not to just plant a bunch of shit every day. Um, you know, then, then it just becomes a thrash. It's funny, like we, uh, we drove by, was it that Notre dam or some shit like that and the guy driving us was going, you go, you know, it's beautiful. You got to go in there and blah blah, and I swear I'm just not into that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:21:41       Those old churches and stuff, you walk in and I just look around and just say, yeah, you guys, you guys really decorated the shit out of this place, didn't you? You, uh, no negative space scenarios all just filled up with the most gaudy. Um, you know, you know, like, you know, like the Migos dress, that's like the Church version of that where you just can't have enough fucking precious stones and or like how those, you know, that new thing where you get a Lamborghini, then you do the fucking shiny wrap that you put around it. It's like, it wasn't enough that it was a fucking Lamborghini. Those old churches, it's like, it's not enough that you have 90 foot fucking ceilings. All right. Then you got to have a bunch of sad broken hearted people painted up there in like real gold and all of this crazy hocus pocus shit up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       They're like, I don't have any desire to do that, but um, you know, if there's no line, I'll poke my head in and be like, wow, wow, this old church looks exactly like every other old church. It's creepy. I'd feel like I'm going to catch tuberculosis because it's cold and damp in here. And uh, the vibe in here is not the vibe where good things happen. So I'm going to leave now. Um, yeah. So I'm going to, I'm going to fucking ride my bike around today. Uh, like the big fucking Nancy boy that I am maybe burn a few calories. Um, I brought my little exercise bands over here cause I'm old. Uh, my shoulder feels fucking great. Uh, but I got a problem with my fucking left foot. You know, it's just always something. It's always something. I'm an old, I'm an old man, people, I'm 50. How the fuck did that happen? You know, it's actually got to be kind of, be honest with six kind of a cool age to turn in a lot of ways. You know, God knows I had a bunch of friends that didn't make it this far. So how the fuck can I sit here and bitch and I like a nice round number, you know, 30 sucked. 40 was like, Whoa, fifties been cool. Um, but I'll tell you 60 is going to crush me.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       You know what's great about 50 you can lie to yourself to your forties. I'm a young 40 something and blow blow 50. It's like, no dude, you're fucking old. So I am old and uh, I've got to embrace it. Maybe I'll start dressing a little more dapper on stage. Give myself a little pocket square, hanging out on my button down.

Why would I be singing that here? What's a good French song? Prayer, Raj, and are you are very classically beautiful place. I've always told you, you're, it's your cheekbones. That's where the late hits, when you go to look to the left, it's the rate in the rate lit restaurant. I'm just like, there it is.

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       We had a great time. That's how I ended the freedom of my single life. We had an awesome time lesson, so fun. And we ended up meeting up with friends. We ran into a friend at the royal and gals. Uh Oh, that was so fucking random. So random. There's about a hundred gift shops at the Roland Garros. We just happened to run into them, but we went into the bad one. The one that everybody goes into this. Yeah. You want to go to the boutique boutique once there's an Adidas store. I saw that the way up, but I was trying to beat the crowd. Oh, how funny was that? Were like, we gotta get away from the crowds so we can get a fucking Uber and, and I went right when everybody else went left just to, you know, get a few blocks over it. It gives somebody a chance and you know, all the streets are blocked off.

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       And we ended up going from Roland Garros and just walked past, I thought it was a parking garage to another. It was another stadium. And I looked at soccer magical yet I was like, oh fuck. And then next door was another soccer stadium. Like this is like stadium row over here. Um, and of course we call the Uber and the guy couldn't come down the street and it just was a whatever it was. Yes, we did. And we went out to dinner and had a lovely dinner and then we ended up meeting up with the friends that we ran into at Roland Garros plus another friend of yours, plus some friends of mine. So we all met up in a, uh, yeah, it was four couples and we just ended up having this table at this cafe. Late night. We shut it down, sang me happy birthday. Yes, we've got some champagne.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       Oh, it was awesome. It was so much fun. By the way, one of the only times anybody's ever sung happy birthday to me and I haven't been embarrassed. It's happened three times in my life. All right, there it Royal Albert Hall. So it was twice the same birthday. And then, uh, last year when I was onstage in Montreal, uh, they all sang happy booms. One of the coolest things that ever happened to me, the crowd all saying it, and the fact that they sang it to a Bruin fan, that we could set aside our differences to celebrate one bald heck in that moment, you know, which gives me hope that when Donald Trump goes to talk to old petty fucking fat face over there, can you imagine like you be in that fat when all your people are starving? Now granted, I know is people are starving because of our frigging embargo.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       They tried to make it seem like he's, but he is like a dictator. So of course he's going to be like, oh, fat and eat lobster and Doug and drinking the best wine every night. We're talking about Kim Jong, right? Keep going. You've got to have the right name. That's there. All Kim, John [inaudible] and his dad was Kim Jong Il. I was going to say, imagine his wife calling for dinner. You uh, yeah. Um, Hey Kim. Jon. Hey Alyssa. I'm Tryna tell you something. That picture that I posted of you on my Instagram for your birthday. Go over 5,000 likes. That's what you're really into that I you, yeah, like certain tweets. Yes I do. I am. I meant to all of that. I'm an influencer so I honestly I'm into it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       Do you want to tell the story why you want to tell a story? Why you marked that whole influencer thing? What is my story? You don't remember when we first heard the term influencer, you are going to do something and then you couldn't because they wanted influencers. Oh yeah. I was asked to be a part of a name. Any names I won't, I was asked to be a part of a storyteller show. Um, and what was the saying? Yes. And the theme was like cultural diversity and families and stuff. So it was like, oh sure. Right up the oil. We there. Yeah. Yeah. We have an interracial relationship with a biracial child is kind of, yeah, I can come up with something for that. And then the person who asked me said that they had to disinvite me because they wanted more influencers. So network wanted more network, wanted more influencers and you know, so they got, they replaced me with someone who had apparently more quote unquote influence and effect just means more friends or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       People on social media. Um, and I didn't even really dig into this person was, but apparently they were terrible and the whole show was like kind of awkward and not that great. So it's fine. But I was so offended that I wasn't seen as an influencer when I have like, you know, I, I'd healthy following on Twitter and Instagram that I just decided that I was going to be an, and I'm one of the greatest influences ever. I am an influencer. Like that's, that's the bottom line. Like I feel like at this point I don't even need to keep telling people anymore. It's just who you are coming out of your pores. Yeah. Like naturally people want to be like me. So it's weird for some reason. I don't know. Just looking at your firm is I want braids right now. Well that's the thing, like if I have it, you want it wouldn't influence it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       And what is is you didn't even tell me to get it. You just had it and I was like, I want that. Could you see how good it looks on me? And so you're like, wow, can I look like that? There's only way to find out. It's just to get it. And then you're like, oh I don't. But I tried and it's like that's really what it's about justice, what an influencer does. Yeah, exactly. You just exist in this space, like your own site guys. Like you are your own movement. You are your own moment. It's just something could, could you teach this to somebody else? Oh God, no, no, no, no. You either have it or you don't. So I, if you want to become an influencer, I'm not really quite sure what to tell you because it's like you already have some sort of falling.

Speaker 1:          00:40:52       Is it a, is it a gift? Well, how would you describe like, yeah, it's just, it's a, it's a state of being, you know what I mean? It's like you're just always influencing all the time, so I can't teach it. I can't explain it to Zika texting or tiring. It'll, you know, it really doesn't, you know, because it's like breathing [inaudible] you go people and some inside tips on how to be a fucking influencer. Yep. I can't believe that people walked away from a, you know, you just influenced me to try to read up more on influencers. All right. Hey, people giving me a, send me some parish tips here. Okay. By the, did you read that thing about the wine country? The email that I forwarded you, one of our listeners wrote in maybe. When did you send that off? Evidently, I'm not an influencer. All right. It's just an email from your husband that says wine country.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       You know, you'd think that one wouldn't you? At least open. I know you don't open the ones that I send you that they have the subject. Are You mad at me? All right. Paris chips, they go right into the, the junk bugs right in the fog in trash or were there, hey, thank you for the best birthday. That was the best birthday I've, I've ever had. I've had two back to back last year it was the, uh, was the selfish one where I was, I was in Montreal and I went to an f one race who I don't even know who won that the Lewis Hamilton wanted again. I gotta look that up. I'm a little behind here. Um, but this year was the best. Uh, all right. You know what it's about the song happy birthday. It's really long. And it almost sounds like people are making fun of you. Happy Birthdays are the Yarra douchebag. Yes, you are.

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       And then in the end it's always speech, speech. So I actually, I thought what I said at Royal Albert Hall was really nice and I was like, I did it, I got through it, knocked it out, thanked everybody and I'm done. And then as I'm walking away, people would go speech, speech, and then I go, I try, I should just fucking gave one. I still get angry. Let me long God I Paris tips. Hey Bill, I am a fan from Perry. I heard you were visiting our lovely city soon. Uh, this is my French accent. Uh, makes sure that you start by, let comp twice in Sasha Ma, uh, Metro Audi on as we get our for a nice meal. Then take your lovely lady to the cafe Laurel in Rue dauphine for a league drink and some jazzy entertainment. That sounds good. They have a nice garden where you can smoke a cigar and sip on some scotch. Slash. Wine. Also, don't learn French. It's useless. Better learn Chinese instead. Uh, enjoy your stay and go fuck yourself. Let's go do that. All right. Thank you. Thank you for that tip. Now I want to try, was that guy in influencer? Now he's more implemented in former suggester.

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       Can we please label everybody that if I can. He's a suggestion. Wasn't yesterday. That'd be funny if that was in a shop. No, I am not. I not a suggestion. I was mute. I am a presenter. I was presenting information that you can do. You know, I mean, it was a suggestion. That's really what it was. Not Bad does adjust things, but you're suggesting even in this age of me too, Hey, I suggest you come over here and you ride. It was just a suggestion. My associates, um, crazy lawsuit. Crazy law suit. All right. Hey there Billy birthday cake. Wondering if your friends in the comic community passed this on to you. Oh, please don't let this be performer getting sued and Oh, oh, this is a long one. You know what? I'm going to go take a shower, take a shower. Uh, I see.

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       Take a shower and something Douche. Um, all right. Wondering if your, uh, friends in the comic community of Wa Nini of why influence out, uh, wondering if your friends in the comic community pass this onto your backstory. This guy, oh my God, he touched my hair and then you hit it. Uh, this Guy Matt acts like the TV show who started a page in the 90s called the best page in the universe. Um, he became famous for calling out Christopher Reeves for not caring about paraplegics. Tilly became one himself. Well, I mean, Jesus Christ, if out of all the things to call people out on, uh, basically lambasted him for being a selfish piece of shit. Jesus Christ, I don't understand. He never sold me on the aggressive manner of hating Reeves. The only way he keeps, he does this without looking like an asshole, just as if he was also in a wheelchair, you know, and live at the top of a flight of stairs of some shit and nobody never made a ramp for him.

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       Then I could see him being mad at Christopher Reeves, but even then it would still be misdirected. It's still should be aimed at people like myself that then go over there and help build them a fucking ramp anyways. But I appreciate it. A different point of view on topics. No one questioned. And so I had, okay, but I appreciate a different point of view on topics. No one questioned. And so I had some respect for this. He also had a post called something like, I can draw better than your kids. And then posted pictures, kids made and trash them are I like this guy now because this guy's just being a cunt. Um, he's just, maybe he's the original troller I like it. He's going to, that was like 15 years ago. I hadn't heard of him since college until I read about this lawsuit. Apparently this same guy who made a career trolling the people on a personal level across the Internet became offended by a comic who decided to troll him. Oh No, no. We had no sense of humor about himself. Or is this more trolling? Is this guy the Andy Kaufman of the Internet? He's sued the comic for $20 million, which is basically way to bankrupt the comic for whatever. Literally had the judge essentially threw out the case. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       on the advent of your 50th birthday, I just want to thank you for not turning into a huge hypocrite like Maddix. I'll do it. I want the most hypocritical people you ever gonna meet doing yoga, meditating, and then slipping out? Cause I, cause I lost my ticket saying this whole system is fucking stupid. Dude. Did you really build a system that makes sure that when you get to your seats that mother fucking assholes not sitting in it? You fucked up, take your medicine. And I didn't act like a big fucking baby. Um, even if he thought he was being wrong, he should have taken it like a man realized that he had to come in after years doing the same thing to others. You don't feel like this is the final act of his performance. And now he's gotten you up in arms. Uh, you're a fewer years older than me and I've definitely taken a page on your book in terms of allowing myself to stay true to who I am, but also allowing myself to grow into a more well rounded person.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       I'm an o and a fan or a from back in the day, and it's my favorite content ever. But when I see comments online that sounded like they came from the crowd at the virus tour, I just feel bad for these miserable cunts. Thanks for everything and happy birthday. All right. That went a little left there. But I know what you mean about the, um, that happens with everything, by the way, not just fans of the OB. And Anthony showed this, I mean, go on Youtube, there's always going to be the initial thing that you like and then you look at the comments and I forget what comic did that Pitt, but he was just like, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:48:59       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       You scroll down like three or four comments before it spins into like somebody dropping the n word or some, you know, thanks a lot. Obama, like somehow that'll be watching like slap fights. At least that's the shit that I watch, which I do not understand those for the legs of me. First of all.

Speaker 4:          00:49:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       The fact that if they hit your ear, what that's gonna do to your hearing, you know? Do you know that was a thing that like, I gotta look this up. Moms used to do that. That was like a disciplinarian thing back in the day. You block she mothers box boxing.

Speaker 3:          00:49:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       Their children's is just too specific. I don't think I'll get anything. Ears. They would just, you know, it was like kill a con how he used to do that. That screen well, Huh? Oh Man. Just hit boxing the ears. Okay. Boxing hears the other Victorians. Uh, Anthony. Joshua says there's nothing wrong with parents giving them which one should I click on here? World champion boxer. Antsier said there's nothing wrong with parents giving their children a clip around the year. Boxing child's ears can cause deafness. Yes it can.

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       That's, look, this one up here.

Speaker 1:          00:50:24       Oh, unable to open this because of legal. The fuck does that mean? All right. Boxing ears. Let's see if this one will open up. Come on, come on. Come on. There we go. Alright. I'll phrase it confused me while reading Alice's adventures in wonderland was the rabbits explanation of why the Queen order the Dutches to be executed in chapter eight. What that I've never seen Alison wonderland is a queen in Dutchess and La Shit. People get an executed I, you know something, you know, I think there's so much death in old fairy tales, the original ones too, because so many people just fucking died back then. Anyway, so it really was a part of life. Um, the rabbit, I mean, it's still a part of life, but it's, it's way down the fucking road. But everybody had like a brother who died of like a fucking appendix, ruptured appendix or some Shit, get some sort of flu, a, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       The rabbit explains to Alice, she box the Queen's ears. The actions of boxing is, is something I had never heard of. So I decided to look into the meaning of the term. I found that boxing of ears is a hard simultaneous slap of both of yours. Yet the violent act was a popular form of child punishment during the Victorian era. Oh my God. In an 1878 issue of the London reader of literature, science, art in general information, the punishment of boxing ears is debated. The article warms is 1878 people like, dude, what the fuck are we doing here? Uh, for not only his deafness caused by boxes, which ruptures as they continually do the drum of the ear, but the inflammation of the internal cavity, which is so frequent, a result may be followed by disease. Of the bone giving rise to absent to abscess of the brain and having a fatal termination. I like how they took pick the euphemism. They're on the same year. Kids are going to fucking die. The article explains, school boys is suffering from the chest dies meant by school masses and fears as noted above, that the effects of the slabs may be longterm. I swear to fucking God if my, if I have had a teacher that boxed my ears, oh my God. I mean how angry with children back then.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       Oh my God. Like I literally have to walk away from this article. Ah, man, I wish they was, you know, some fucking kid back then just fucking snapped was just big enough. You know, it just beat the shit out of his teacher and boxed his ears like nine times. Made him a deaf fucking bastard. Um, yeah. So whenever I watch those slap fights, it's just like you're going to make somebody deaf. They put something in their ear. Forget about just taking a concussion for no goddamn reason. I mean, we'll, we'll slap fight competitions like what is the fucking prize money? Um, anyways, continuing on a Bayer and Monsanto. Whoa. Jesus didn't, uh, I guess see what time I've done here. 53 minutes, right? It didn't mean Santo changes their name, like Jefferson airplane or some shit. Um, bear in Santo. Hey there, you over the counter cunt. So bare and Monsanto are merging and reminded me of the time you mentioned an article where bare admitted to knowing and allowing the distribution of some aids infected shit. Found the article for this sounds official. First of all came from me and then you described the Arctic, the subject of the article as aids infected shit. Well, let's check out the link. It is from CBS news.com. So all right. Bear admits it paid millions in HIV infection cases just not in English. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:20       Dude, I swear to God. At what point, how much money do you have to pay politicians where they feel like they have enough money and they don't need the corporate dollar and that they can actually start to dismantle or a restructure? These corporations, these corporations are going to kill us. Not Isis, not fucken, uh, the Russians. None of this fucking shit. All right. When I say kill us, I mean no human beings left are going to be the result of because of corporations. All right? And what, how they view people, how they view the environment, how they view money in their whole idea of, of what is a is worth. I mean, I know I've just never heard a corporation ever being like, you know what the, the, the, the costs to innocent people or the environment is too high for us to do that. Maybe they do. It'd be refreshing if you have an article like that that wasn't actually written by someone from that corporation that's lying. All right. Turn to the read the English speaking media. You'd never know that bear just paid tens of millions of dollars to end a three decade long scandal in which the company sold HIV contaminated blood products to haemophiliacs thousands of whom later died of AIDS. They just killed thousands of fucking people

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       or admitted to it. But that doesn't mean they actually said that they did it. You know, that fucking legal thing. Um, ironically bears new hemophilia who feel your iPhone app got some coverage ads. Did bears hemophilia research grant, are they covering their tracks to the University of Florida? Go gators, but you have to pick through the French and Italian news meeting to find out that bear is finally writing checks to people who got aids. I've got HIV that turned into aids in the 1980s the cutter biological unit of bear ignored federal law to recruit prisoners, intravenous drug users and high risk game in is donors. I'll they ignored that of the blood cutter then used to make factor eight and nine the clotting product that he will feel the x need to order, need in order to not bleed to death. Oh, so they pulled the Bella check whether they were like, all right, you guys are all filling. Need the team on the sidelines. You can no longer do that. And they just ignored it.

Speaker 4:          00:56:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:56:58       All right. The German group bear in three other labs will pay tens of billions of euros to hemophilia ex who accused them of having sold in the 1980s blood products contaminated with HIV. A source close to deal told them. So did it, was it that they knew that it had HIV in it or did they just went to high risk people to get blood? The figure of tens of millions of euros in compensation is not totally wrong. She had it bear in the U S company. Baxter are the two main parties to the agreement. She said, a company spokesperson said, how are the company accepts no responsibility in this case and continues to insist and it always acted responsibly and ethically that's how they get out of it. It's like, all right, we'll admit that we did that shit. If you say it wasn't our fault and that we always behaved above board. You know what that's like? That's like when they send somebody to jail and innocent person to jail and then they're like, all right, we're gonna let you out. But the only way we can let you out as if you sign this paper saying you won't sue us because we fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:58:03       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       Anyways, found the article. I might just read some of it. They're still in business. They're still in business. Can't bring down bear. That's our medicine, but maybe our food supply. Nope. Then you got, I don't know what this guy's talking about now.

Speaker 4:          00:58:20       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       Then you've got Monsanto who can't be sued because Obama signed that laws saying that you can't soup and Santo now there was super team corporations are like NBA team side. You got room in the chopper for me, Bill just guy was all over the place. All right, and why did Obama sue that sign that, so that, why did he sign that bill? Everybody? Is it because he's a liberal targe snow flake or whatever people get wears a blue tie or is it because he's grossly underpaid for his fucking job and, and I bet those guys funded is fucking campaign. So then he had to do them a solid, it's all the same shit.

Speaker 1:          00:59:03       They all make 500 grand grand a year and then come out of office worth hundreds of millions of whatever. Fucking 70 80 million bucks. How does that happen, everybody? Although recently I saw Bill Clinton when that fucking piece of shit brought up the me too thing. You know with Monica Lewinsky. I love level. They tried to make that a me too thing. You know what I mean? It's like she was in her twenties. She was a college graduate. She never learned that she should. That's what I was saying on stage. She never learned that you shouldn't blow a married guy in his house with his wife and kid down the fucking hall. She didn't know that. Now she's coming back being influenced by his power and it was, you view people, people, we get the fuck outta here. You are a driven young adults who somehow in your 20s got a job in the fucking White House.

Speaker 1:          00:59:52       Okay. You weren't some dopey founded a bus station. I Nia. Hi. Um, some of them monocle Wenski thing where now that she's trying to like turn it around that he used his power and influence. It's like you were a college graduate working in the White House. Right? I don't know. I thought we had dealt with all of that. I know and he got punished for it, but in that thing he said Clint was like, I left the White House. I was $16 million in debt. You know what I mean? He's, if that's true. I think he's the only fucking president ever did that. Oh Geez. She's, she's getting ready for nap time. Alright. Um, big band drumming. Dear bill, I'm 17 years old and I played drums every day. That's awesome. It's my life and I'm in every band, jazz concert and marching. Good man. And I play percussion for the chorus and for the school place.

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       Kenny Aronoff is my era. Well, that, I was going to say that sounds like his autobiography. Uh, how we started out. Thank you for that dream interview. I have it on a playlist with music. That's how much I listened to it. Oh, let's go. I'm glad you liked it. You know Nia not for nothing. People say actually do a good interview. Oh yeah. From Kenny Aronoff to Danica Patrick to my lovely wife. You know, I said to you guys up, no, no. Let you guys, I love it over the plate. I learned that by going on Cronin. That's what he does. Amy and Andrea, they, they, they just, they just lob it over to you. All right. Andy Rector. My Day was telling me about, my dad was telling me about the scar movement in the 90s. I just watched swingers and discovered this band, squirrel, nut zippers. Oh my God, let's say takes it back to your college days.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       It's really takes me back to my early thirties and I was in my late twenties. It's really different than anything I've heard. I discovered that I don't like all scar but I like these guys cause it's more big band than scar. I really think you uh, enjoy the drumming. It's really a cool mix between big band drumming, punk and almost some premise tape drumming stuff because at the time work, uh, did you get ever get into any of that? I remember that big bad voodoo daddy and that type of stuff. I liked it a little bit but I was a little too old at that point. That was actually kids music to me. Um, this is what our lovely daughter does before afternoon that she screams bloody murder. Um, and then falls asleep though. Then talks to herself when she comes down and then falls asleep. Anyways, I doubt this will get read because it's too nerdy, but maybe just maybe thanks for the laughs.

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       All Billy rim shot. Um, no, I like all that stuff. I mean, I like when Robert Plant book, Jesus, I liked him. Robert Plant did that. The honey drippers same with Paul Shaffer. Um, I've always liked big bands in that type of stuff and I really liked the way all of that music is the score on that separately and all that. I just liked the way it was produced. It sounded really live. And um, and also, you know, when you get that many people in a band and they can all play, it's always sounds great. So I'll be back in the day, he was also in swingers. Okay. I did not know that. Um, where make a gun out? I'll goes, oh yeah. Oh yeah, they were, uh, they were great. They are great, I should say. Right. What did they figure out? A plea. All right. Being rude to wait.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       Staff. Alright man. Hey, their ability bath salts. Your YSI talking about Nia being slightly rude to wait staff. And it made me a heads of word got cut off something, a podcast. I've heard years back about raising kids. Essentially a group of economists gave their opinions on what you can and can't change in children supported with studies and evidence. One person suggests with evidence that there are only a small number of habits that kids pick up from their parents. Those adverts are drinking, alcohol, smoking, and how we treat others. Wait, staff, family, et Cetera. Well, those are kind of big things. As a former bartender who's dealt with incredibly rude patrons, I would love to hear you and Nia debate if she is actually being rude or not. If she feels she's not being rude, which she'd be okay if she saw her daughter treating a family member the way she treats waitstaff, absolutely she would love in the air.

Speaker 1:          01:04:34       Can't wait to hear her thoughts. Here's a link to a podcast as a new data. I think you'll dig it ab a great summer and I hope you get sunburned. You some of them on vetch, um, near do you feel as an influencer, why can't you just influence them to make better, better service? I am not rude ages and something goes wrong. I just let them know and underrated that and that like, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I asked for his actions that I don't do that cause what am I apologizing for? Unlike no out of this. Can you change it? Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       What do I had to, I had with like, you want me to fucking the weight or because he did something wrong, like he's blowing me. No, I'm just saying it's throws a little sugar on it in the end. I feel like I'm very sugary. I'm not no terrible. Take it back right now. Like, no, it's not like that. You did one time it was called and you said, can you have them go back and heat this up? And they say, Oh my God, I'm so sorry. You and you're like, yeah. Cause it's like, yeah. As they went to take it away. And I was just like, Jeez, you remember everybody was at the table like God damn near know everybody. Who was everybody at the table? I got Danny. And what have been your family now? That didn't happen? Nope, I don't, I don't remember it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:57       So maybe it didn't happen, but like what? That didn't happen. I don't remember it. Maybe it did happen. That was hilarious. Or the pork course that didn't happen. I don't remember that. Yeah. Maybe it did happen. I don't recall ever being, behaving in such a manner that it would be like so, so freaked out. You're adorable. But even when you live, um, yeah. Um, I, I go the other way. I'm too nice and we'll eat fucking whatever the fuck they send me. You're not seeing when, and they send me the wrong thing. I still eat it because I don't want, cause they don't want them to throw it out. Oh, who was I going to throw it out? They may put it to the side and maybe somebody lunch and the later on. No. Yeah. You're telling me if somebody brought a plate of food out into public and they said that's not what they want and brought it back, you'd be like, Oh fuck it needed somebody may it. Why do you know they haven't put their fucking mouth on it and was like, oh, this isn't Ravioli. This is French toast. I thought it looked weird. And then you go over there and you get the old breakfast. Herpes.
