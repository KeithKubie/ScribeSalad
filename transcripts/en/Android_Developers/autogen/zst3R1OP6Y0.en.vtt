00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.370
hello my name is Bruno Oliveira and I

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
hello my name is Bruno Oliveira and I
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.470
hello my name is Bruno Oliveira and I
work in the play games team and we here

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
work in the play games team and we here
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.720
work in the play games team and we here
for second episode of play games and NDK

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
for second episode of play games and NDK
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.430
for second episode of play games and NDK
so now we're going to talk about how to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
so now we're going to talk about how to
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.779
so now we're going to talk about how to
do achievements and leaderboards for

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
do achievements and leaderboards for
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.990
do achievements and leaderboards for
native game so to recap from from from

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
native game so to recap from from from
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.849
native game so to recap from from from
the last episode what we have right now

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
the last episode what we have right now
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.529
the last episode what we have right now
is you have your awesome game activity

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
is you have your awesome game activity
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.330
is you have your awesome game activity
which derives from native activity and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
which derives from native activity and
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.589
which derives from native activity and
then we're implementing a few callbacks

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
then we're implementing a few callbacks
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.900
then we're implementing a few callbacks
and that in that class actually manages

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
and that in that class actually manages
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910
and that in that class actually manages
the the game helper object so you're

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
the the game helper object so you're
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.350
the the game helper object so you're
just hooking hooking up the callbacks

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
just hooking hooking up the callbacks
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.090
just hooking hooking up the callbacks
and then game the game helper is

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
and then game the game helper is
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.180
and then game the game helper is
actually doing the the actual work so

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
actually doing the the actual work so
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.440
actually doing the the actual work so
how do you go ahead and unlock an

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
how do you go ahead and unlock an
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.200
how do you go ahead and unlock an
achievement from there so to unlock an

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
achievement from there so to unlock an
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.970
achievement from there so to unlock an
achievement first of all you have to the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
achievement first of all you have to the
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.069
achievement first of all you have to the
code that you want to make is on on game

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
code that you want to make is on on game
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.420
code that you want to make is on on game
client you have a method that's called

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
client you have a method that's called
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100
client you have a method that's called
unlock achievements so that's the method

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
unlock achievements so that's the method
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.270
unlock achievements so that's the method
that you want to go on get on games

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
that you want to go on get on games
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.100
that you want to go on get on games
client so normally this is how you would

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
client so normally this is how you would
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.590
client so normally this is how you would
do this however remember that your game

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
do this however remember that your game
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.150
do this however remember that your game
is going to be running on a game thread

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
is going to be running on a game thread
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
is going to be running on a game thread
that's different from the UI thread so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
that's different from the UI thread so
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.439
that's different from the UI thread so
to prevent any synchronization problems

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
to prevent any synchronization problems
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.729
to prevent any synchronization problems
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
what we're going to do is we're going to
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.200
what we're going to do is we're going to
write a method called post unlock

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
write a method called post unlock
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.670
write a method called post unlock
achievement and that method is going to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
achievement and that method is going to
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.950
achievement and that method is going to
call run on UI thread and then that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
call run on UI thread and then that
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.590
call run on UI thread and then that
method is going to invoke the the unlock

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
method is going to invoke the the unlock
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.780
method is going to invoke the the unlock
achievement method on the UI thread so

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
achievement method on the UI thread so
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.310
achievement method on the UI thread so
that's what well the method that we're

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
that's what well the method that we're
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.920
that's what well the method that we're
going to call from from the native side

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
going to call from from the native side
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.289
going to call from from the native side
so next since we have that method all we

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
so next since we have that method all we
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.640
so next since we have that method all we
have to do is call it from native side

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
have to do is call it from native side
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.990
have to do is call it from native side
so to call it from the native side

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
so to call it from the native side
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.429
so to call it from the native side
you're going to need the achievement IDs

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
you're going to need the achievement IDs
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.550
you're going to need the achievement IDs
the achievement IDs can be can be can be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
the achievement IDs can be can be can be
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.499
the achievement IDs can be can be can be
obtained from the developer console and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
obtained from the developer console and
 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.210
obtained from the developer console and
they are these funny-looking strings

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
they are these funny-looking strings
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740
they are these funny-looking strings
that you see here so these funny alpha

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
that you see here so these funny alpha
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.480
that you see here so these funny alpha
numeric strings so going to have one

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
numeric strings so going to have one
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190
numeric strings so going to have one
distinct string for each achievement

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
distinct string for each achievement
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109
distinct string for each achievement
that your game has so once you have

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
that your game has so once you have
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.960
that your game has so once you have
those so this in this case this would be

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
those so this in this case this would be
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.190
those so this in this case this would be
a game where they prove theorems and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
a game where they prove theorems and
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.429
a game where they prove theorems and
then you advance in your academic career

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439
then you advance in your academic career
 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.810
then you advance in your academic career
so once you have those IDs all you have

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
so once you have those IDs all you have
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.160
so once you have those IDs all you have
to do is call unlock achievements with

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
to do is call unlock achievements with
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.859
to do is call unlock achievements with
those IDs so first of all you have to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
those IDs so first of all you have to
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.539
those IDs so first of all you have to
initialize all the jni stuff so we're

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
initialize all the jni stuff so we're
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.590
initialize all the jni stuff so we're
going to assume that you have that ready

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
going to assume that you have that ready
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.969
going to assume that you have that ready
so if you if you don't know how to do

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
so if you if you don't know how to do
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.929
so if you if you don't know how to do
that you can take a look at the last

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
that you can take a look at the last
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.179
that you can take a look at the last
video so you have your android app

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
video so you have your android app
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.190
video so you have your android app
structure you have your jni environment

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
structure you have your jni environment
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840
structure you have your jni environment
we have the the activity object and the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
we have the the activity object and the
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700
we have the the activity object and the
activity class after you do that all i

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
activity class after you do that all i
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560
activity class after you do that all i
have to do is just make a simple jane i

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
have to do is just make a simple jane i
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569
have to do is just make a simple jane i
call to the unlock achievements method

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
call to the unlock achievements method
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.340
call to the unlock achievements method
so we are just getting the method ID

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
so we are just getting the method ID
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559
so we are just getting the method ID
then we were allocating and java string

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
then we were allocating and java string
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.610
then we were allocating and java string
that corresponds to that achievement ID

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
that corresponds to that achievement ID
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.720
that corresponds to that achievement ID
and then we're making the year the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
and then we're making the year the
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.399
and then we're making the year the
method call and remember and this is

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409
method call and remember and this is
 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.199
method call and remember and this is
pretty important we are also G

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209
pretty important we are also G
 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.210
pretty important we are also G
allocating the the java string after

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220
allocating the the java string after
 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.300
allocating the the java string after
we're done with that we're done with it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
we're done with that we're done with it
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.440
we're done with that we're done with it
and that's pretty much all there is to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
and that's pretty much all there is to
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.830
and that's pretty much all there is to
unlocking an achievement also you might

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840
unlocking an achievement also you might
 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.600
unlocking an achievement also you might
want to avoid repeated calls because Jay

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610
want to avoid repeated calls because Jay
 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.580
want to avoid repeated calls because Jay
and I calls are somewhat expensive so if

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
and I calls are somewhat expensive so if
 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.350
and I calls are somewhat expensive so if
you're running a tight game loop and you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360
you're running a tight game loop and you
 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.550
you're running a tight game loop and you
were calling unlock achievement all the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560
were calling unlock achievement all the
 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.229
were calling unlock achievement all the
time you probably want to avoid that

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239
time you probably want to avoid that
 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.380
time you probably want to avoid that
that or that overhead so well one thing

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390
that or that overhead so well one thing
 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.050
that or that overhead so well one thing
that you can do is actually keep a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
that you can do is actually keep a
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.270
that you can do is actually keep a
dictionary on the native side and that

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
dictionary on the native side and that
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.009
dictionary on the native side and that
tells you which achievement you have you

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019
tells you which achievement you have you
 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.539
tells you which achievement you have you
know you have unlocked and which ones

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549
know you have unlocked and which ones
 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:47.680
know you have unlocked and which ones
you don't know if you have unlocked or

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
you don't know if you have unlocked or
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.270
you don't know if you have unlocked or
not whenever you try to unlock an

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280
not whenever you try to unlock an
 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.440
not whenever you try to unlock an
achievement that you know you have

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450
achievement that you know you have
 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.119
achievement that you know you have
unlocked you can just return and not do

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129
unlocked you can just return and not do
 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.740
unlocked you can just return and not do
anything so we can do that using

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750
anything so we can do that using
 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.059
anything so we can do that using
something like the string SAT class

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069
something like the string SAT class
 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.160
something like the string SAT class
which is great for in every way except

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170
which is great for in every way except
 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.750
which is great for in every way except
the fact that it doesn't exist so you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760
the fact that it doesn't exist so you
 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.399
the fact that it doesn't exist so you
actually have to implement your own and

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409
actually have to implement your own and
 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.199
actually have to implement your own and
string set structure in C++ in any way

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209
string set structure in C++ in any way
 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.940
string set structure in C++ in any way
that you wish you can you see the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950
that you wish you can you see the
 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.619
that you wish you can you see the
standard template library or you can use

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629
standard template library or you can use
 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.119
standard template library or you can use
your own class the important thing is

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129
your own class the important thing is
 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.390
your own class the important thing is
avoid making J&amp;I calls on every frame

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400
avoid making J&amp;I calls on every frame
 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.949
avoid making J&amp;I calls on every frame
this is what are the methods you can use

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959
this is what are the methods you can use
 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.780
this is what are the methods you can use
to do that now let's talk about

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790
to do that now let's talk about
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.629
to do that now let's talk about
leaderboards so when you when you have

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639
leaderboards so when you when you have
 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.400
leaderboards so when you when you have
leaderboard is pretty much the same as

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410
leaderboard is pretty much the same as
 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.900
leaderboard is pretty much the same as
achievements because the the method

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
achievements because the the method
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.030
achievements because the the method
calls are pretty similar so you have the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040
calls are pretty similar so you have the
 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.129
calls are pretty similar so you have the
post submit score which is made in the

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139
post submit score which is made in the
 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.720
post submit score which is made in the
same way as post unlock achievements so

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730
same way as post unlock achievements so
 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.089
same way as post unlock achievements so
it's just run on UI thread and instead

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099
it's just run on UI thread and instead
 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.710
it's just run on UI thread and instead
of that we're posting to the UI thread

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720
of that we're posting to the UI thread
 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720
of that we're posting to the UI thread
and then on the UI thread we're calling

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730
and then on the UI thread we're calling
 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.930
and then on the UI thread we're calling
game game client dot submit score so

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940
game game client dot submit score so
 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.860
game game client dot submit score so
that's what's at what's actually

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870
that's what's at what's actually
 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.839
that's what's at what's actually
unlocking I mean something is submitting

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849
unlocking I mean something is submitting
 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.849
unlocking I mean something is submitting
the score and then from native code

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859
the score and then from native code
 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.110
the score and then from native code
we're going to write a very similar

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120
we're going to write a very similar
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.420
we're going to write a very similar
method as in unlock achievement which

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
method as in unlock achievement which
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.000
method as in unlock achievement which
simply gets the ID of that of that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010
simply gets the ID of that of that
 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.800
simply gets the ID of that of that
method and then makes a method call and

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810
method and then makes a method call and
 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.119
method and then makes a method call and
passes the score that you want to submit

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129
passes the score that you want to submit
 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.979
passes the score that you want to submit
to the leaderboard and then you call the

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989
to the leaderboard and then you call the
 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.689
to the leaderboard and then you call the
method and you delete the local

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699
method and you delete the local
 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.759
method and you delete the local
reference and that's pretty much all

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769
reference and that's pretty much all
 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.020
reference and that's pretty much all
there is to it now we have achievements

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030
there is to it now we have achievements
 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.780
there is to it now we have achievements
and leaderboards in your native game so

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790
and leaderboards in your native game so
 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.430
and leaderboards in your native game so
thank you very much and please watch our

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440
thank you very much and please watch our

next episode in which we're going to
talk about how to do more complex

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000
talk about how to do more complex
 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.039
talk about how to do more complex
complicated stuff in the native side

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049
complicated stuff in the native side
 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.129
