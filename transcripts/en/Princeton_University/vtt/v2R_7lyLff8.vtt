00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.660
NICOLE BUSINELLI: Princeton
University's chapter of

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.400
Engineers Without Borders
started a new program in

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.720
Samne, Peru this year.


00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.220
Last summer, we visited the
community and talked to the

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.530
people in the town and asked
them what their priorities

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.340
were to try to decide what our
first project would be.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.990
And while we were here, we got
approached by some people in

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.040
La Pitajaya, which is
a settlement on the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.230
outskirts of Samne.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.260
Currently, they drink from the
Rio Moche, which is a river

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.310
nearby that's contaminated with
mining waste and other

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.810
contaminants.


00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.700
So we decided that our first
project in Samne, Peru would

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.590
be a potable water system for
the community of La Pitajaya.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.500
DANIEL WRIGHT: I have some
experience working in water

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.080
and sanitation projects
in Latin America.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.890
And I could tell from the first
minute of the first

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.210
meeting that Pitajaya was going
to be a really good

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.380
community to work with.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.530
They were really excited about
the project and very motivated

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.290
to work, very organized, and had
a very clear idea of the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.770
importance of having clean
water, both for themselves and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710
for their children.


00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.980
EMILY MODER: So we were all
really excited to come back to

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.610
Samne for a second time and see
all of our old friends,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.560
and also have a real project
in mind that we

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.480
were working towards.


00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.780
So our goal was to take samples
and look at the area

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.770
to assess the feasibility of the
capturing of all the water

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.670
in the source.


00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.360
And then walk the line that we
will transport the water with.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.100
And take the GPS coordinates and
the altitude measurements

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.900
to assess the feasibility
of each possible system.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.990
And then do water tests on
those different sources.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.420
DANIEL WRIGHT: From an
engineering perspective, the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.100
project should be very viable
because we'll be able to build

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.730
a gravity-fed water system,
which, compared to other

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.480
alternatives such as pumps, the
gravity-fed system is much

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.810
easier to maintain.


00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.430
And the community should be able
to handle all the repairs

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.670
and everything like that on
their own once we've finished

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.540
with the construction.


00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.340
ANDRES PARRADO: The opportunity
that we've had

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.140
coming to Samne has been
an incredible one.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.900
We've been able to experience
all the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.280
components of the project.


00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.230
The community aspect, with the
amazing people of Samne who

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.960
really want to make this
project happen.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.670
The technical challenges
trying to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.970
look for the sources.


00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.210
The finances of it.


00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.120
When it all comes together, we
have a truly amazing project

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.650
like the Peru project.


00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.900
NIHAR MADHAVAN: Coming here to
Peru has really changed my

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.270
perspective on what we do back
home can do for others.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.040
And I've just really felt that
I've grown a lot because of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.500
working on this.


00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.020
I'm really excited for the work
that we're going to do

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.760
for this project.


00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.910
And I'm really looking forward
to this summer.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.330
I know it's going to be great.
