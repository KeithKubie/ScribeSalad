00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.530
Welcome to the presentation
on multiplying and

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.270
dividing negative numbers.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.750
Let's get started.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.920
I think you're going to find
that multiplying and dividing

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.730
negative numbers are a lot
easier than it might

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.000
look initially.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.760
You just have to remember a
couple rules, and I'm going to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.790
teach probably in the future
like I'm actually going to give

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.000
you more intuition on
why these rules work.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.860
But first let me just teach
you the basic rules.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.220
So the basic rules are when you
multiply two negative numbers,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.790
so let's say I had negative
2 times negative 2.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.970
First you just look at each
of the numbers as if there

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.240
was no negative sign.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.150
Well you say well, 2
times 2 that equals 4.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.670
And it turns out that if you
have a negative times a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.175
negative, that that
equals a positive.

00:00:45.175 --> 00:00:47.710
So let's write that
first rule down.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.285
A negative times a negative
equals a positive.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.400
What if it was negative
2 times positive 2?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.770
Well in this case, let's
first of all look at the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.060
two numbers without signs.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.170
We know that 2 times 2 is 4.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
But here we have a negative
times a positive 2, and it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.910
turns out that when you
multiply a negative times a

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.920
positive you get a negative.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.260
So that's another rule.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.255
Negative times positive
is equal to negative.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.760
What happens if you have a
positive 2 times a negative 2?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.140
I think you'll probably guess
this one right, as you can tell

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.170
that these two are pretty much
the same thing by, I believe

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.800
it's the transitive property --
no, no I think it's the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.860
communicative property.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.700
I have to remember that.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.780
But 2 times negative 2, this
also equals negative 4.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.640
So we have the final rule that
a positive times a negative

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.980
also equals the negative.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.985
And actually these second
two rules, they're kind

00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:04.990
of the same thing.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.570
A negative times a positive
is a negative, or a positive

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.140
times a negative is negative.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.730
You could also say that as when
the signs are different and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.400
you multiply the two numbers,
you get a negative number.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.890
And of course, you already know
what happens when you have a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.550
positive times a positive.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.840
Well that's just a positive.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.900
So let's review.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.970
Negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.390
A negative times a
positive is a negative.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.730
A positive times a
negative is a negative.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.290
And positive times each
other equals positive.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.980
I think that last little bit
completely confused you.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.270
Maybe I can simplify
it for you.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.350
What if I just told you if when
you're multiplying and they're

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:55.175
the same signs that gets
you a positive result.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:11.010
And different signs gets
you a negative result.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.780
So that would be either, let's
say a 1 times 1 is equal to 1,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.120
or if I said negative 1 times
negative 1 is equal to

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.510
positive 1 as well.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.150
Or if I said 1 times negative
1 is equal to negative 1, or

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.600
negative 1 times 1 is
equal to negative 1.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.130
You see how on the bottom two
problems I had two different

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.590
signs, positive 1
and negative 1?

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.120
And the top two problems,
this one right here

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.680
both 1s are positive.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.970
And this one right here
both 1s are negative.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.110
So let's do a bunch of problems
now, and hopefully it'll hit

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.510
the point home, and you also
could try to do along the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.010
practice problems and also give
the hints and give you what

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.000
rules to use, so that
should help you as well.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.750
So if I said negative 4 times
positive 3, well 4 times

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.820
3 is 12, and we have a
negative and a positive.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.670
So different signs
mean negative.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.060
So negative 4 times
3 is a negative 12.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.310
That makes sense because we're
essentially saying what's

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.070
negative 4 times itself three
times, so it's like negative 4

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.800
plus negative 4 plus negative
4, which is negative 12.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.120
If you've seen the video on
adding and subtracting negative

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.200
numbers, you probably
should watch first.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.210
Let's do another one.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.430
What if I said minus
2 times minus 7.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.470
And you might want to pause the
video at any time to see if you

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.030
know how to do it and
then restart it to see

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.420
what the answer is.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.190
Well, 2 times 7 is 14, and we
have the same sign here, so

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.530
it's a positive 14 -- normally
you wouldn't have to write the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.930
positive but that makes it a
little bit more explicit.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.880
And what if I had -- let me
think -- 9 times negative 5.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.800
Well, 9 times 5 is 45.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.660
And once again, the signs are
different so it's a negative.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.010
And then finally what if it I
had -- let me think of some

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.540
good numbers -- minus
6 times minus 11.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.730
Well, 6 times 11 is 66 and
then it's a negative and

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.720
negative, it's a positive.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.910
Let me give you a
trick problem.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.100
What is 0 times negative 12?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.740
Well, you might say that the
signs are different, but

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.460
0 is actually neither
positive nor negative.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.315
And 0 times anything
is still 0.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:52.080
It doesn't matter if the thing
you multiply it by is a

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.650
negative number or
a positive number.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.630
0 times anything is still 0.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.020
So let's see if we can apply
these same rules to division.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.080
It actually turns out that
the same rules apply.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.030
If I have 9 divided
by negative 3.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.820
Well, first we say
what's 9 divided by 3?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.640
Well that's 3.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.920
And they have different signs,
positive 9, negative 3.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.190
So different signs
means a negative.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.520
9 divided by negative 3
is equal to negative 3.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.830
What is minus 16 divided by 8?

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.790
Well, once again, 16
divided by 8 is 2, but

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.370
the signs are different.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.830
Negative 16 divided by positive
8, that equals negative 2.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.140
Remember, different signs will
get you a negative result.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:07:00.500
What is minus 54
divided by minus 6?

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.320
Well, 54 divided by 6 is 9.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.050
And since both terms, the
divisor and the dividend, are

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.890
both negative -- negative 54
and negative 6 -- it turns out

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.000
that the answer is positive.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.310
Remember, same signs result in
a positive quotient in this

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.350
example we did before,
it was product.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.730
Let's do one more.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.500
Obviously, 0 divided by
anything is still 0.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.510
That's pretty straightforward.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.200
And of course, you can't
divide anything by 0

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.210
-- that's undefined.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.420
Let's do one more.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.890
What is -- I'm just going to
think of random numbers --

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.930
4 divided by negative 1?

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.610
Well, 4 divided by 1 is 4,
but the signs are different.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.130
So it's negative 4.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.410
I hope that helps.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.680
Now what I want you to do is
actually try as many of these

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.380
multiplying and dividing
negative numbers as you can.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.010
And you click on hints
and it'll remind you

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.260
of which rule to use.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.460
In your own time you might want
to actually think about why

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.490
these rules apply and what it
means to multiply a negative

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.320
number times a positive number.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.520
And even more interesting, what
it means to multiply a negative

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.230
number times a negative number.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.800
But I think at this point,
hopefully, you are ready to

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.160
start doing some problems.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.620
Good luck.
