Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcasts and

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       just checking it on Ya. I'm checking in on you because I give a fuck. Right. I care about you. Oh, who gives a fuck? I do. Um, how's your week going? Everything going good with you. I hope it is. Um, all freckles. The pasty old fucking man, 48 years old. My back feels better than it has since that since I don't know when, um, just been going to the chiropractor and getting this fucking, the shit beat out of me in massages is finally a, I dunno, it's fucking great. I guess my spine was compressed and twisted for, for decades. So, you know, after having professionals beat the shit out of me for like weekly for like the last since May, I guess. Um, I dunno. I think I finally, I undid the, they undid it or whatever. But now, like when I go to stretch, when I go to a, you know, you know the whole thing, you lay on your back and this young people won't know this because they just get up off the couch and start running.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       They're fine because they're young, but old people, you know that she lay on the floor, right? You get down on the floor, right? You make that noise and you keep going down and getting up. It's the same noise. Ah, right. You get down on the fucking ground and then yeah, you bring one of your knees up to your chest, right? And then you bring it over to one side and then you have your arms sticking out. You know, like almost like you're doing like some sort of old time you football move right high stepping over somebody. But when I do that on the ground now, I just bring that over in my back. Just cracks from the lower back to about three quarters of the way up. And that never used to, I wouldn't crack at all. It was just all fucking jammed in there.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       And um, feel good, man. I've been working out, I host been eating like a fucking animal though. Went to a barbecue Sunday, so that's all she wrote with that. Right. And I did a show, so I ate barbecue and then I also fucking eight and a comedy club, Green Room. I was working down there and have most at the, uh, the comedy and Magic Club and, um, which is really fucking cool to go down there now because whenever I look at the pier, I'm like, that's the thing I fly over. Right? But, you know, as I'm coming down, you know, does the Hermosa Beach Pier and then Manhattan Beach Pier, when you get to that one, you gotta be down around like, you know, like 300 feet. And that's when you call lax and say, Hey, I want to fucking skit adol underneath the fucking jets there. Right. And I never knew any of that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       I never knew where the beaches were. I mean, look at me, this Red Eddie cut. Know where the beaches are. The only reason why I know where the beaches are is so I know how to drive in the opposite direction. I fucking hate the beach. I fucking, oh my God, I hate the beach. I love the fucking beautiful brown people that go there, you know, tanning themselves up. God bless you. I sit there like the boy in the bubble, you know, and one of those Ford Astros' with the slide and fucking door with the AC on looking out like the boy in the bubble. Right? Um, I, I fucking hate it. I get there. It's hot as fuck. It's boring. I'm terrified to go in the ocean. I'm not fucking going in there. It's Goddamn sea monsters and they're going to fucking grab you. You know what?

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       A bunch of editing, what kind of a fucking moron. I just, I'll never get over there at the fact that people just swim in the fucking ocean and the oils a shark attack today. Yeah. You know, it's funny, somebody goes to the fucking zoo and they crawl into the fucking cage and they get attacked. Everybody's general consensus. Consensus is yes, it's a tragedy. And what are you going there for? What'd you think was gonna Happen? You know, you go to the beach and you go into the fucking ocean, everybody acts like it's a big, it's a big surprise out of that happened, I can't believe it. You went into an unnatural environment, right? And do something where there was a bunch of shit there that could kill you when something did or took a chunk out of you took a fucking bite out here. You know, when you've come stumbling out of there.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       I don't know why. It just makes me think of an unfinished cigar when somebody gets bit right. You know what? I went to this fucking party, right? And I brought in Sony for my birthday and got me this really incredible box of cigars. So I, uh, I immediately call all my friends because you know, or whatever. It's like, cause I'm not gonna smoke all 10 of these fucking things. First of all, that's not what cigar smoking is about to social thing. Right. And secondly, I don't want to smoke all of them because I'm trying to keep the habit at bay. All right. Special occasions once to twice a month. Right. So I brought it over there and there was a bunch of hover and cons, who all showed up. Everybody acting like they're fucking cigar smokers and some handing them out to these people, I don't fucking know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       And I turned my back and like 15 minutes later, like three of them have been stomped out there. Like they weren't even halfway done fucking idiots anyway. So then I just, I figured that's, you get bit by a shark, you know, he'd come in, it takes like, you know, the bottom 30 you off and you come out like a, like a fucking unfinished. The gar. No, I don't fucking know. It made sense to me visually. That's what I thought of at all going to be relax. This podcast doesn't even count. This is me just checking in on you. Oh, Billy back brace. Huh? I took it off like fucking Forrest Gump. I actually feel like I could run, the only downside to my back feeling as great as it does right now is I have to fight myself from doing something really stupid. Um, but uh, but as always, I was psyched.

Speaker 1:          00:06:06       I didn't have to use any drugs. I stayed away from all of that shit. And it reminded me of that guy when I used to watch that doc, the doctor drew show, the celebrity Rehab, and there was that guy from taxi who since passed away and he kind of got hooked on painkillers and shit. He's always bitch about his back. And a, I remember I had, for whatever reason, I was just thinking about that. Go, man, I wish that guy went to a fucking chiropractic and [inaudible] Seuss instead of going down the fucking painkiller route. I don't know. Who knows? He might have fucking done heroin first. He might've fucked up his back nod off on heroin. Although they tend to stand pretty upright. They have to keep that back straight and then their legs bend. I don't know. But as always, I don't know what the fuck's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       Um, yeah. So Monday night, Sunday night, sorry, I went to, uh, went to the comedy Magic Club, uh, worked. And that's not an easy room. It's not an easy room to do. Well, and as those people have seen a ton of fucking comedy, you know Jay Leno goes down there every Sunday so they used to see in the top notch shit. So you know, if you go down there and you have fast that you get a bump. So it had, I had a good set. Fortunately I had something in the middle of my set though I was, I was leaning on the mic stand and they had, and I had my, my arm sorta like instead of leaning onto how I usually do, I had my arm up and something was like pushing into my elbow. And when my hand was like that, I went to close my make a fist and like my middle, my index and my fucking ring finger wouldn't close.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       It was like in slow motion really freaked me out. I don't know what the Hell I did, but what I'm basically telling you, people's, I'm falling apart. Um, but my back feels good. So anyways, so that was the first night of me like an asshole. But I still work out every day, fucking crushed in the elliptical. I give it back at night, a little bit fucking drink here are fucking cheese stick, whatever the fuck I have. Right? But uh, then Monday last second, a buddy of mine called me up and said, hey, sting and Peter Gabriel a plan at the fucking Hollywood bowl, right? So I said, you know what, I bet Vinnie call Udas playing drums. I got to go see that. That's like a bucket list. He's one of my favorite drummers of all fucking time. And he's one of those guys who just keeps getting better.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       He's an absolute monster. I mean, the guy's like pushing 60 years old and he could still like blow away young drummers in their teens. You know what I mean? A lot of young drummers just thinking of all the young guys are the shit and they're all fucking flashy. And then as guys get older, you know, they stopped practicing or whatever. He's one of the few fucking guys, there was no drop off. He just kept getting better and better and better and better. So I say, fuck this, right? So I called up somebody, you know, who was in the know and I was like, Hey, is Vinny play in tonight? And they were like, they got back to me and I was like, fuck, that was the, that was the game right there. I was like, I gotta go fucking see it. Right? So I go on the hub of the stub there, they'll stub hub and just pay through the fucking nose, get as close as I can.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       So now I'm all fucking excited. I'm all Dow low, right? And I'm fucking going, oh my God, you look at, they got to drum kits up there. I'm guests, Peter Gabriel's going to open do is set, then stings going to do with fucking set and then a, the end, they're going to come out and sing, fucking have on the Gila, whatever. They're gonna do some sort of encore together, right? The fucking show starts. Okay. And the, uh, there was so many fucking people on stage. I didn't know what was going on. And Peter Gabriel all of a sudden is like, you know, you guys like right in front of us, he sings one of his fucking, I dunno, world music songs. It was amazing. And his voice sounded fucking incredible. And I'm like, okay, Peter Gabriel and his giant band here, this giant ass fucking band with two drummers and shit is, is going to fucking open and then stinks going to come out and we get to see Vinny, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       He finishes the first fucking song, he walks off stage and then all of a sudden staying just walks out and he's like, what the fuck? Right? And he starts playing the Afi Abba. You right. You start singing that song. And I'm like, wait a minute, where the fuck's and I realized he's been playing the whole fucking time. He's just behind these, this fight on what the fuck it was somebody amps or some shit. So I could see was like the top of his head, but there was like video screens and stuff. So, of course I was standing on my tiptoes to watch it, but what killed me about his playing is, uh, you know, every great musician has a voice, right? I know this is like hacky to say that, but that fucking guy, the bell of his ride cymbal and when he plays the cross stick on a snare, it's just undeniably you're like, that's fucking Vinnie call you.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       And the fact that he was making that noise that close to me and I was immediately hearing it and just all the Times that I've listened to, uh, all the music that he's made with staying in everybody else, the fact that they were actually reproducing it live right there, it was fucking nuts to me. You know, like they're playing this, these songs for us, this is fucking incredible, right? So then the consequent, and they just keep flip flopping back and forth. So stink finished his fucking song. And then Peter Gabriel came back out, but staying stayed in fucking played bass on Peter's shit. And then they just kept going back and forth. And occasionally Peter did too. And then instinct to a couple, occasionally sting would walk off and Peter would do his thing and then vice versa, whatever. And finally in the middle of it, um, well maybe towards the beginning and I can't, they talk to the crowd a couple times and they basically said that they would just, that a, they both had bands in there kind of competing with each other's band.

Speaker 1:          00:11:41       And Peter Gabriel's band was the red band and strings was the blue band. And then I then I finally know to sell one drum has got red, the other Vinnie's playing on blue drums. And I, you know, the way he told the story, they would just, you know, having a battle of the bands and they were like, why don't we fucking go on tour? All I can say is it was an incredible night. They played like all the fucking hits. Peter Gabriel played big time sledgehammer, shocked a monkey, a red rain, um, staying played, fucking, uh, sending out and it's so as bunch of shit off. 10 Summers tails, uh, some shit off of soul cages. It was some police stuff. It was fucking amazing. It was fucking amazing. And uh, you know, definitely a bucket list night. But of course I was in the crowd and at the Hollywood bowl, the either drink wine, which just gives me a brutal hangover oil. They had these giant fucking beers. Um, which I gotta be honest with just does nothing to me. It's just this, it's like, it's like somebody just handed a job here, why don't you drink this? I give fuck and I get, I get really nothing out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       That's why I like whiskey, you know, it gives you all right there Fred. And it's just a couple of swallows. Um, but anyways, Jesus Christ, the level of musicianship, the backup singers, one in particular was just, they kept, you know, given her solos and stuff, she was incredible. Um, got to watch sting played bass, got to watch them up close. And the weird way he kind of comes from the side rather than might've. Bass players are kind of have their hand up top rest of their thumb on the low eat or whatever the fuck that string is. And he's, he looks like he's coming at it from the side like a fucking crap. It was really interesting. But uh, anyways, it was like some of the best musicians you ever going to see. So that's what I did Monday. And then Tuesday we came in, we did the Polish up after the table read of episode 10, and we recorded episode 10, and that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       Or fucking Billy red faces on fucking a summer vacation here. And I got a nice, um, I don't know where I got, I got about nine days before I go off to the European tour and I'm going to work out like a madman still, you know, have a couple, two, three drinks, whatever. It work hard, play hard. What are you gonna do? And I plan to have a nice, um, I want to have a healthy fucking tour over there. You know, my wife isn't going on this run. She's going to meet me over there afterwards when take a few days to hang out. But uh, during the whole run, it's a thrash. It's like a different city every fucking night. So it's kind of boring and pointless. You're really just saying to the person who isn't doing shows like, Hey, do you want to, uh, do you want to go over to Europe and like pack and unpack every fucking day? And they're like, yeah, no, I, I don't in barely see anything.

Speaker 1:          00:14:36       That's what I'm offering you. So what I want to do, the first side, I'm working with Joe to Rosa in Dublin on one of the shows. It's an earlier show, which is odd to me, but whatever. It's not my fucking deal. Right? So that night's a wash. I mean, we're going to get shit faced. Um, then the next night I'm in Belfast and I got to drive up and drive back. So that night I'll fucking take it easy. I can hear all the Irish people bitch. And I already asked that being a pussy drink every night. I can't do it cause I got to make sure I have good shows and then I got Gallway but a chill for that than London. Chill for the first night. Second night I'm going to maybe, you know, knock a few back. And then I go to Scotland, I believe, and uh, two nights stair I'll just fucking chill. And then the third night, you know, that's going to be hard because it's, it's the whole fucking, the festivals going on over there. Somebody may mean a ton of comedians. That might be a rough one. And in Germany, I don't gotta worry about Shit. Who's kidding? Who? I've got to go out and have some beers that you, okay. It's going to get a little rough once I get around Scotland. Who's kidding who, but, but the, the first half of it. Oh, that first half I'm going to be healthy. Um, does the Amsterdam in there?

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       All right. You know what? This whole thing just went off the rails. Okay. For the first few nights in Ireland, I think it's got to be okay one night in London. Other than that, yeah, it might be a little rough, but if I can eat well, the problem is when you go over to Europe though, there's just this, just fuck it. There's no treadmills. They, these people just don't work out. It's weird. They're not like necessarily fat, but they're not in shape, be that they're just sort of people, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, those arms, you know? Yeah. They're connected to your torso. They got like,

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       like, I think ellipticals are illegal in England. I don't know what the fuck it is. Everybody's so jammed in there and that little island, um, I'm fucking with you. Obviously they have gyms over there, so I'm going to try to hit treadmills and shit as much as I can. And, um, I already know how I'm going to open my set when I'm over there, you know? Um, it's, it's gonna be, it's gonna be a great fucking time. I can't wait to do it. And I'm so site that we got the first big chunk of work done on a, on f is for family. I feel I can, could finally fucking, uh, could finally fucking chill out a and coming up this week, by the way, next Monday night is the second, uh, the two year anniversary of the goddamn comedy jam and a, they're going to have it at the rock seat down on sunset boulevard.

Speaker 1:          00:17:14       And, um, rumor has it that I'm, I might be down there, I've gotta be down there for that show. It's next Monday night if you're in the area and uh, I'm going to be busting out the fucking, I'm going to bust out the fucking green sparkle Ludwig Kit. I'm going to bring it down there for that. And I bought it two years ago. I've never played it. I got this 71 Ludwig, it's fucking gorgeous. And right as I got it, I had it all set up and everything we got, we had the water damage on the house. Fortunately thank Christ it didn't come down in the room with the drums were so immediately went out and I got drunk cases and I put the fucking things away. And then, um, you know, that was a year getting the house fixed and they stayed in cases. And then the next year my truck, shit, the bed I had to get the engine rebuilt because it was going to do is put them in the cases and take them over to rehearsal space.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       I was never able to do that. And, uh, then my truck was better. And then I started writing on f is for family. So and just like that fucking two years goes by. So I busted them out. 71 Ludwig Kit, I got the fucking Pisces symbols, that whole bottom set up, the 15 inch high hat, the 24 inch ride, complete fucking overkill. And I'm going to play a couple songs. I actually sat down and played drums today for the first time since like March, I played like a drum kit, you know, other than a cup that I think I took two lessons. But that's, you know, different than sitting down and playing. And I'll tell you right now, I fucking sign, oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Just blew out the uh, you're saying, oh my God, that was fucking terrible. Terrible. I better get my shit together by Monday night or I'm just going to look like a dose with a really nice kid who can't fucking play. Um, but I'm really looking forward to doing that. And now let me do a little, let me still read here. The one advertising advertisement that we have here for this week. It's our old friends. Oh, a little bit of Zip.

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       Rat root has been used by over 800,000 businesses and right now my listeners can post jobs to zip recruiter up for free by going to ziprecruiter.com/ [inaudible] that's ziprecruiter.com/borough one more time. ziprecruiter.com/ [inaudible] all right. There you go. Sorry about that. I fucking thought I had the levels down. I guess when you scream zip recruiter, it's bound to go off the rails after awhile. Um, all right. So what else did I want to talk about? Anything. Um, somebody said that the New York Times did this article and for the love of God, I can't, it they did it. And talking about the legalization of pot and was saying in states where weed is become illegal, that, uh, prescriptions have gone down drastically, obviously for pain, anxiety and all of that other stuff. And it's really starting to become the wonder drug man that all the hippies always said.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       And I always fucking was like, no, booze is legal, blah, blah, blah. And now it's really looking at like, booze does way more fucking damaged. Oh, but it's so delicious. Does way more damage than we does. So, according to this New York Times article, according to this person who said it was in New York Times article, um, that the pharmaceutical lobbyists are now going after legalized marijuana in every state and that they're going to try and start trying to fucking, you know, basically go, oh my God, it's the devil and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and get people to stop using it and have all this shit about side effects. But they start showing commercials and all that. But I got to tell you, um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       the fact that this is the prop, well maybe they won't. I was gonna say the problem that they're going to have is now that the cat's out of the bag, okay. In these states are making so much money in tax revenue, right? Like this, this whole thing going on in Denver, because it's legal at a state level, but not at a federal level. You don't pay federal income tax. I don't know. It's this weird fucking thing. So nobody knows. Oh, I know banks won't accept the money, you know, cause the banks, federal banks or whatever can't accept the money or whatever. So what these, these people who grow the wheat are doing, they're just buying up land. So in Colorado, from what I earned, once again, I never read, I listened to people and whatever they say to me, I just considered it as as a fact, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       It's so much easier than doing research. And you know what's great about it? If you fuck up, it makes other people feel smart, you know? Nothing, nothing. Structure Ego like correcting another human being. That's a human being. That thing can speak. It can drive a car. Maybe you can fly a plane to be right. I mean, anybody can be right when there's a dog, you know there's a fucking dog in the room that doesn't do anything for you, you know? But if it's another fucking person, right, who's got a thumb and shit and can like hold a hammer, if you fucking rad that just, it's the greatest. I actually, ah, that was, it was actually 1897 yes. 1890 set Spanish American war. Anytime you get to do that and then you get to watch them be all fucking mad. Like when I was talking about George Bush, I thought everybody was making fun of him because he did.

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       He didn't dance well, I didn't realize it was some memorial service for, you know, fallen officers or, or, uh, uh, an officer in particular. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't look, I just watched the fucking video. Oh. And it just rolled in, you know, everybody, oh, let's, let's, let's fucking correct old Billy red beard. You know, everybody had a great fucking time doing that. Um, but I'm off the rails here. Okay. I still have to say, you know, you know, as much as that was inappropriate, which it was completely inappropriate, obviously it was fun to see him, you know, it was fun to see that he's enjoying his retirement. It's like when you see Letterman, he let the beer go out. He got rid of the fucking two pages and it doesn't give a shit. And when you looking at him, a lot of people were saying, you know, maybe George was a little drunk.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       And, uh, you know what good for him, good for that fucking guy because that fucking guy, he held it together for eight goddamn years. Ya Know, granted he gave a speech, the way I read advertising, granted we went and into Iraq because there was weapons of mass destruction and we never fucking found Eddie. I love how that fucking story goes away, but if you make fun of fat people as a comedian, all of a sudden you get in trouble. And was like, what about this fucking guy? This guy was playing fucking patty cake, Patty cake bakers man at a fucking funeral. Good Lord. That guy is like, he's like, when you talk about failing upwards, I think, you know something. There's something about that guy. He's just smart enough to know that he's not qualified. And I think that that's why he drinks. I think that's why it's to shit that fucking vibe.

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       He just, he, he's kind of like Rodney, like he does everything but tugs on his collar. Like it'll tell you it's a rough one, you know? Um, I dunno, we'll see. We'll see what the fuck happens. But what, what was I talking about? Oh yeah. In New York Times they were saying that, yeah. That these pharmaceutical lobbyists, you know, we're, we're going to be trying to fight back to win back some of their money, capitalistic society here. Right? What do you do? Somebody's taken into year, you're cutting into your territory. What do you do? Yeah. You go on the offensive, you start making up shit about him. You lie, you know, that's what you do. So, um, I was going to say now that the cat is out of the bag legally with weed, um, and I think it's going to be really hard. I was going to say, because not only is it appearing to have all these positive effects medically according to stuff that people said to me that they sit allegedly said scientists did.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       Um, it also makes you feel good. That's a rough one. You know what I mean? Whereas all that other shit, a lot of the pharmaceutical stuff just sort of like numbs the pain, all of that stuff. And then you all of a sudden you get onto the harder drugs and all that. It's really fucking evil. You know, I got a friend of mine, she had problems with there. She couldn't something going on with the shoulders. She couldn't pick a fucking arms up past the shoulder. I refer to this same as suits that I went to and she immediately was getting results and she, she was, according to her, was stuck going to these fucking doctors. I'm, look, I'm not totally shitting on doctors and stuff like that, but, uh, I don't know. It would be nice if the mainstream medical would kind of let these other people come in.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       You know what I mean? It's just that I think the, the people outside people outside of the mainstream medical basically hospitals and shit, I didn't know what mainstream medical means. It just sounds right to me. Right? Oh Jesus. I am so out of my fucking element. You know what? It feels good. I feel like I could start swinging my arms at a funeral right now. Um, when you get outside of hospitals and stuff, you could actually, most people you'll find don't know what the fuck they're doing. But if you find that gem that's outside of the fucking studio system, basically, they actually can cure, you know, where a lot of this other shit is. Just treating it and treating it and treating it and treating it until you then get symptoms for something else and then treat that, treat that, treat that. You know, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:27:38       It's, it's a fucking shady think and uh, it's a big fucking problem and it requires a lot of reading and research. And I have to be honest with you, I did none of that before I started talking about seven minutes ago. So there's that subject. What are we up to here? 27, almost 28 minutes. Um, this is all drum nerd shit, but I saw Steve Smith is playing with journey again. I'm going to have to go fucking see that. You know, I've never seen him when he played with vital information. I've never seen that guy play life, got all this fucking DVDs and all that shit. There's another one I got to check off the fucking bucket list. But uh, um, if, if that, that sting Peter Gabriel tour is coming to your, uh, neck of the woods, do not sleep on it. Like I've never seen like staying, having so much fucking fun and I've never realized how like goofy and silly Peter Gabriel was.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       He's got all these sychronized dances and shit. It's fucking hilarious. And he's funny as hell and like sting was just like really just taken a back seat when letting Peter Schein and all of that all, you know, all that fucking drama that you always heard in that band. The police, it was great seeing sting just fucking, I mean granted the guy still, he looks better than he looked when he was in the police. It's fucking ridiculous. Jesus Christ clean living and fucking yoga and, and whatever the fuck he does that tantric where you come for like fucking 50 minutes, whatever that shit is. It's unbelievable. I mean the guy looks better than he did fucking 30 years ago. His hair somehow grew back. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck this guy is doing. He looks like it's a combination of like a teen idol and he, he's in like Mad Max all at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:29:22       He never kind of would like, as far as like his wardrobe though, I will say that guy is never sort of advanced past, um, uh, that synchronicity tour, you know? And when he yells, he always has to put an o at the end of it. You know, when he did Roxanne and then when he had wanted to do a call and response with the Cra, what the crowd is going rock said, oh, like where do they all come from? He loves the, Oh, I bet he does that. His castle, you know, his wife yells up, you know, up the fucking goddamn stone stairways,

Speaker 3:          00:30:02       what do you want for lunch? Lunch, lunch. And he's up there has said which show?

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       It's fucking driving her nuts. Fuck does he put, oh, at the end of everything, just fucking say sandwich. All right, you fucking cunt. What? You get knighted and all of a sudden you can put an o at the end of everything. I don't know. Anyways, what am I doing here? It was a fucking great show. Um, all right, so I still have to go to work tomorrow. Now we do the animatics, I'll take you through the whole process. Everybody over the next year as we wait for this fucking thing that come out. So once you write the thing, and once you record it before the animated, they have these things called animatics, which is just rough sketches. Okay. Of the scenes, the way that they're going to drop, draw. Like, you know, they look at the script and says, you know, frank walks into the house so they know it's in the house, but there's a lot of other stuff that is sort of variables about where people are standing and where they're sitting, how they're eyes are moving and all of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       And it's that, this is where it gets a little bit tedious. But, uh, it was much harder the first season, the second season. Now everybody kinda knows how everybody creates and shit. So we go in now and we'll look at the animatic for like the second first or second episode. And you just look at, you know, is the scenes go and you'd be like, all right, frank needs to be standing up here or sue needs to be doing this or whatever. And um, I have to be honest with you, I am decent at arm gestures, but I'm really bad at the directing shit. Like this should be a two shot that should be a master and all that. Um, not only make bad at it, I have no desire to get good at it. So that's a tough thing. Like I don't give a shit that is that there's nothing more boring to me then that just sitting there going like, this should be over this guy's shoulder and this should be a two shot.

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       Can we Dolly in? Can we get a fucking whatever the fuck they say. And I just said, I just glaze over. It reminds me of when, for whatever stupid fucking reason, my junior year of high school, like I took Algebra two and fucking trigonometry and it was just like I fucking had to go to summer school after Algebra. I barely got out of that shit. I got a fucking d minus in geometry just because my teacher was cool. I flunked it. She gave me the d minus, so I didn't have back to back going to summer school and did this. I mean I was lost by, I was done. I was done three weeks into September, Algebra two and trig was fucking over and I ended up in fucking motherfucking summer school again. I swear to if my geometry teacher didn't hook me up with a d minus, I have had like a dynasty.

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       I would have three years in a row, a summer school, fucking dope. Um, I dunno, I'll tell you this right now. This is how dumb I am is, I can't even remember why I even just fucking told you that. What the hell was I talking about? I just sat up in my whole memory, went, what the fuck out of his? Say what? Yo. Right. Then I started talking about some, I don't, I don't, I don't remember. Um, but you know what the great thing is is I don't have to remember anything else who gives a shit because this is, this is the a, this is just me checking in on you. Just peeking into your cubicle or maybe you got an office. You've got a door. Huh? You feel good about yourself. You liked that door. You put stuff on it. Do you close it and say, no calls makes you feel good. Then you close the door and you snicker to yourself. Like I just said, no calls. I'm the no calls guy. Hold my calls.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       Um, anyways. All right, that's it. That's, that's a podcast. Uh, please go see Peter Gabriel and sting on tour and the amazing Vinny Coley, Yoda, and everybody else in both of those bands. Uh, I should have known more than names. I should have looked it up, but, uh, you know, I'm running around like a fucking loan to tick. Um, and that's it. If anybody can find that New York Times article, I would really love to read it. And um, I'm also going to try to read up on all that whole fucking European Union thing for when I go over there just in case anybody's a cut to me, uh, about not knowing what the fuck's going on in the world, which, which I don't. Um, I do know that there was some sort of fucking failed coup attempt in Turkey. Jesus Christ. The only thing scarier than trying to overthrow the, the government is attempting it and then failing.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       This is one of the scariest couple of paragraphs I ever read. Turkish President Tay. Yup. T double why p Ertegun tapered again, I'm declared a state of emergency on Wednesday is he widened a crackdown against thousands of members of the security forces judiciary to you, you're airy, civil service and academia after a failed military coup. All right, here's where it gets scary. Erdogan, how you said, said the state of emergency lasting three months would allow his government to take swift and decisive measures against supporters of the COO and was allowed under the constitution. Yeah. They're about to kill a couple thousand motherfuckers. Jesus. That right there is that definition and Odot, Jesus in the old right there, Fred, right? There's no code lotion in there.

Speaker 4:          00:35:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:35:32       You're not cold. Lotion is, is is your final meal on death row.

I feel great. I'm in a great mood. Please enjoy this music. And then we got 30 minutes of some throwback podcasts. Greatest hits from a podcast in a year.

Speaker 6:          00:36:07       All right, see you. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:37:15       so I got that out of the way. Then I had two days to hang in New York and then I came down in New Jersey and I'm like, this is going to be great. I got the pressure Letterman off me. That's off my fucking back. And, uh, now what? Now. What do I do? I get to go to one of my favorite clubs in the country, the stress factory I was already talking to while Vinnie brand, the club owner, he's got a boat. We were going to go out on his boat on Sunday. Everything was going to be great. All the shows were fucking sold up. Had a great time. And then what happens? These fucking nerds on the weather channel. What do they do? They turn out all the lights in this studio and they put a flashlight under their Chin and just start scaring the living shit out of people and you know what kills me is every fucking time people buy into it. I was joking about it all weekend. I'm like, nothing's going to happen. I'm in my whole tell them I don't even have a fucking snickers bar. Nothing's going to happen. You're going to be fine. All these people going out gathering up fucking food for what people do. You realize how long you can go without food. Food is no big deal. You need water. That's what the fuck you need.

Speaker 5:          00:38:38       That's what you need. I'm actually looking here on a, who gives a fuck.com? How long can a person survive without food and water? Uh, basically it depends on a number of factors such as body weight, genetic variations, other health considerations, whether you're a fat fuck or not. Uh, most importantly the presence or absence of dehydration. As long as you got water people, you can basically go 46 to about 73 days without, without food. Then that was based on a 10 individuals who died on a hunger strike and they all died between 46 days and 73 days. As long as they drank water. If you don't have water, I believe you dead in about three days. All right, so enough with the fucking milk and eggs.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:39:28       Ali soccer moms now for the next fucking three weeks. Who wants, who wants cereal? Who wants to wait? What you have in theory all and you're having an Omelette isn't going to go to waste. He's fucking people telling you to fill up your goddamn bathtub full of full of full of water just in case Jesus fucking Christ. I'd rather die than drink out of my bath tub. All right. I wash my fucking dog in there.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:39:59       Not Drinking out of that thing. What? Can I just stick my head out the window and drink the raindrops? I think those windows be cleaner.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:40:08       Then the God damn tub that I watched my dog in and then hit with chemicals, love stomach cancer. By the time to fucking rescue boat comes, you just get water. Everybody get water. Get yourself a couple of fucking zag nut bars and they'd go down, go down, go down to a Goddamn fucking seven 11 and go buy an $8 Poncho. You find you're in a house. You find he's fucking people. Whether Chino much they cost me half my God damn gig money.

Speaker 2:          00:40:43       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:40:43       We could've had shows. We could add show Saturday night. It was raining hard Saturday night. It could have done both shows. Everybody could have got their fucking labs. Everybody goes home and then at night [inaudible] Boegli the fucking hurricane or hurricanes come through the northeast. It's like, it's like an old price fighter. By the time it comes to us, it's all fucking punch drunk and people have no business standing out in it cause they should've gotten knocked out, have no fucking problem than they just sit there laughing at it. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       That's what it is. That's what a hurricane is in the northeast. It, you know when it's down south, it's Cassius clay. Right before he becomes Muhammad Ali. By the time it gets up to Jersey in New York, it's fucking Ali. When he fought Larry Holmes every fucking time. Yet these people, they all run out the weather channel. How long you guys, you guys think Fox News lies to you or CNN? Depending on what side of the political fence you're on. You want it. You want to see some lies put on the weather channel. Anytime there's a storm scaring the shit out of you. Every time there's going to be, it's going to be four to six Sanchez. Holy Shit. That's almost up to my calves. How will I ever get to where the food is? 46 inches. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:42:10       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:42:11       Who are they talking to? 80 year olds.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:42:15       Even then, you know, 80 year old people, they'll be fine. You are. They're already wearing a sweater.

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:42:24       They're dressed for a blizzard year round. Does anybody you work for the weather channel? Does anybody who listened to my podcast? Can you please tell me? Well, who's behind you? I think the supermarkets are behind that, right? Ralph's Shaws, Gelson's fucking whole foods. All of them. That's their payola. You know with the big time corporations, they wait for the political elections. That's when they start throwing their money around and start calling up a truck full of hookers to go blow some Bible belt and Douche bag, right?

Speaker 5:          00:43:00       I'm married. I got five kids. I love my wife and I love Jesus. Support the troops, right? And then what do they do? They throw a big pile of money at them. Have two, three whores dropped to their knees and next what? Next? What happens next? He comes on his blue blazer. That's what happens. Everybody goes all over his red tie and then he goes out. Jesus Christ. All right, you got me, you own me. You got video of it. Just tell me what you want me to do. I will pass any bill you want me to pass for the love of God. Don't let my wife see that.

Speaker 2:          00:43:33       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:43:33       That's basically how that works. Well though, let's, let's stay on track here. Okay. The fucking weather. She, does anybody listen to my podcast work? Did they ever work? Can you give me any sort of anonymous behind the fucking scenes over there? Why? Every time it's just going to rain.

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:43:49       Do they scare the living shit out of us? Why is that?

Speaker 2:          00:43:53       You know,

Speaker 5:          00:43:55       how often are they right? It always is. It's always downgraded to a tropical storm. By the time it comes here, someone was telling me the entire east coast, the way it's shaped, that's from years of hurricanes comes riding into Florida and Georgia, South Carolina gives it a nice fucking uppercut to their southern balls and then slows the fuck down right over the Carolina, Virginia.

Speaker 2:          00:44:23       Yep. Then what?

Speaker 5:          00:44:26       Trimet hits DC. Barack Obama's out on the porch drying off his nuts with those. Nice. When that Nice Hurricane Wind, right?

Speaker 5:          00:44:35       Oh Jesus. I don't know what I'm talking about. I just want to fucking go home. I was actually thinking, you know, when you, you know, when you fuck up in life, feel like God, if I could just go back 48 hours, Howard do this differently. There's an Avis in the lab of my, uh, uh, Jesus as a callback. Remember this time we left this comedian, he was always late. We had a car service to the airport. We were so sick of waiting for and we were going to miss our flight. We just took off with that and we said fuck them. And we got halfway to the airport and he calls up all pissed off. It's like, Yo, where the fuck boy you put a fuck. Why you like dude, we waited for 20 minutes. You didn't show up. And he's like, I was in the

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:45:19       And that became the catch phrase for the rest of the tour. I was in the lobby anytime you fucked up and people will call it calling you on some shit. You went over your time. No I didn't. Yes you did. I was in the lobby. Oh. And it made us laugh. I don't know if it made you laugh. I don't give a shit what he expected from me. I'm, I'm stranded. I feel like I'm being held hostage in my captures. Forgot about me, you know, or maybe it was just all a practical joke. I have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:45:50       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:45:51       So whatever. Here I sit.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:45:54       You know, is there anything sadder than a stranded comedian with no shows to do?

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:46:01       They got a 24 hour gym downstairs. I haven't used it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:46:06       Um, but talking to you guys about all the way to eat, the way to lose weight. I haven't been doing it dummy pizzas. I had fish and chips today at fucking to hamburgers. This is all during the hurricane. Big Bad hurricane Irene fucking over rated.

Speaker 3:          00:46:25       Ugh.

Speaker 5:          00:46:26       So I'm sitting here, I realized, you know, tomorrow I'm like, finally I'm getting the fuck out of here. Go home. Could see my girl, I can see my dog, right?

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:46:36       Can have a good fucking time, you know, can cruise around in my hybrid. That's what I was looking forward to doing. And, uh, all of a sudden I realized that was stranded here. So what do I do? Do I handle it like a man? What do I start cursing like a little bitch? You know what the answer is? So once I'm done having my fucking temper Tantrum, excuse me, I a sufficient chips. I say, all right, I'm going to rent a fucking rent a movie here in the hotel. So I go to rent a movie.

Speaker 5:          00:47:14       It's called catching hell to documentary about the guy with the glasses who was at the cubs game, who, uh, reached up for that foul ball that Moisis I Lou was allegedly going to catch. So I hit the info to watch the trailer and they're talking about, they got this guy on, they're gone and says how you worked for sports illustrated? And his assignment was defined, this guy, whatever the fuck his name was, Steve, Ms Arac, I don't know. I'm not from Chicago, so I don't give a shit. I don't know what his name is. Alright, his is, he goes, my assignment was to find this guy and he goes, my heart sank. You know, because I actually felt for this guy, I didn't want to go see him and I said to my editor, editor, why can't we just leave this guy alone? Can we just leave the guy alone? And he goes, no, go find them. And then they shot showing the highlights of this dude. And for those of you don't know the play, basically the cubs have won the world series since 1908. You know, they're a game away from going there. Five outs away from going to the fucking world series. Sorry to all the cub fans. Just hit fucking mute for the next 10 minutes. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:48:26       they got the five outs away. So some dude, right? A lefthanded batter hits a slicing foul down the left field line. It's right there. And uh, the cubs left field or Moises Alou, he's got a chance to make a play and all the, all these fans reach up to grab the ball. But the, the, it just hits one guy and a Moises Alou flips out cause he doesn't catch it and he sort of yells towards the fans. Like, what the fuck? I could have caught that. And then after that the wheels start falling off, but they got a double play ball. Gonzales could have made it buddy boated it and first and then they let up eight runs, they lose the game and then they lose games seven and then everybody wants to murder this fucking kid. So this guy is basically sold that. They're going to basically interview the guys as far as I could fucking tell.

Speaker 5:          00:49:14       Am I Jesus Christ? That's fascinating. I won't let me watch this. God, God knows that got the time. Let me watch this movie. All right. So I go to order it and it doesn't allow me to, so I got to call downstairs to have the uh, you know, I don't know what somebody had kids or something. He didn't want to run a porno, so had to get that, you know, switched over so I could actually be an adult and pick out a movie. So I watched this fucking thing. All right. About the cubs, about their history, about their curse, about this poor bastard that got used as the scapegoat. This is what I was sold. This is the bill of goods. I was sold. Okay. After 36 hours of being lied to by the fucking weather channel, I want some truth in my life. This is what you're telling me.

Speaker 5:          00:50:01       This thing is about, this is how your advertising and I want to see it. Do you know what the first 15 minutes of that movie was? It was taking me through the red sox in 1986 as they excrutiatingly slowly replayed the bill Buckner incident and I'm sitting there watching it. All of a sudden I'm looking at bill Buckner. I'm like, what did I order the wrong fucking thing? I don't want to see this shit. Do you understand? This is like my baseball nine 11 I don't ever want, you know that like the 10 year anniversary of nine 11 is coming up and like they, I don't want to watch any of that. I don't ever want to see that footage again. Like how the fuck could you ever forget it? It's absolutely fucking horrific. Horrific. I don't want to see it. I don't need to see it to remember it.

Speaker 5:          00:50:50       I'll never forget. It's our Pearl Harbor. My grandmother still doesn't like Japanese people because of Pearl Harbor. Okay. If she can remember that shit, I don't think I've got a problem members something 10 fucking years ago. Okay. So now, anyways, total total fucking tangent there. So I'm watching this thing and for the first 20 just to warn red sox fucking fans, the first fucking 50 minutes of this movie is the bill Buckner thing. The thing that we left behind. It's so funny because Paul Versey just texted me then the night before during the hurricane, typical fucking Yankee Fan. Typical Yankee Fan living in the past, right? He texted me, he goes, hey bill, what was, what was worse for a Red Sox Fan? He goes, Buckner or Aaron Boone just out of nowhere. We weren't even talking baseball. And I was just like, I was like neither do to that. It's like, I don't even think about that shit anymore to be honest with you.

Speaker 5:          00:51:53       And then he gets mad at me. A typical red sox fan, terrible fucking answer. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, I don't know what he wanted out of me. So I just texted him back. It's like, dude, I haven't thought about that shit since 2004 it's over. You know what it is. It's Yankee fans used to be able to bully red sox fans about that shit because we hadn't won one forever, you know? So they just, I think that they, they miss, they're kind of like our big brother who just beat the shit out of us forever. And then one day we were the same height and kick the shit out of him, you know? And then they just stay. It was over. We're not scared anymore. We expect to beat you. It's fucking over. And I think they still don't know what to do.

Speaker 5:          00:52:38       You know? Wait a minute, we used to tease you and we used to always win and yeah, now you don't, now you don't. Now we've got this, the biggest choke of all fucking time has hung around your neck. That'll never be beaten. When do you guys think another $220 million $10 million team, whatever the fuck it was with five first ballot hall of famers are going to lose four games in a row, have to be an up three games to none. I'm asking you to a fucking team that hasn't won a world series in like a hundred years. Right. He had just asked me about that and I swear to God, I had not thought about Buckner. Yeah. Since like oh four it was fucking, it was over. It was great. I don't even give a shit now. I don't even give a shit. And I gotta tell you, it's phenomenal to sit down and watch a red sox game and expect something good to happen. And when something bad happens, you get upset at the player rather than some sort of specter or some sort of ghost or some overly Boodley horseshit. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       So

Speaker 5:          00:53:41       I'm going to watch this fucking thing and all of a sudden out of nowhere, this show and I made two, they broke, they almost broke down bill Buckner more than they broke down the poor cubs fan. And in the end, the dude doesn't get the interview. There's no interview. They just taught all that. But what I still recommend it, I'm still wrecking recommending it because they show, um, they talk to the people. Some people, I guess they found that people who like through bear at him, they talked to the security guard. He was removing them, giving them shit that he now feels bad that he did and they have the footage of him.

Speaker 2:          00:54:23       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:54:24       Going out of the ballpark and putting the jacket over them. It's fucking amazing what happens to this dude. And uh, I, I totally recommend it, but I just, they should have been some sort of warning for a red sox fan. It was like walking, go run into your old psycho girlfriend, somebody who stopped you or something. Just somebody who just hadn't even thought about 2047 years. I haven't thought about that shit. I haven't even thought about that. And fucking seven years and all of a sudden this documentary about the cubs, they just go blow by blow through the Buckner thing. Cause they, I guess they wanted to show how Buckner was used as escape goat, despite the fact Bob Stanley through the wild pitch. And now this kid was used as a scapegoat for the cubs, despite the fact that Gonzales booted a fucking double play ball, which would've got him out of the [inaudible]. Um, I dunno, it's, I, it's definitely interesting, but I was, I was more than upset.

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:55:32       That and, and Eleanor and they even show the Aaron Boone home run, which I don't even remember because that was basically annoying for about 12 months, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Huh.

Speaker 5:          00:55:42       Because it was immediately rectified

Speaker 2:          00:55:45       and, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:55:47       but it was just one of those things. I don't know. I don't fucking know, but I, I gotta be honest with you, I never really felt bad for cubs fans. I never did because, you know, they didn't have that anger did the Midwest, I don't know what it is. They're positive. I don't know what it is. They just didn't have that anger or misery, you know, with the red sox back in the day, it was every Yankee success was our failure. And with the cubs, they just, you know, hey, let's play two zippity Doo Dah. I was like a big fucking keg party,

Speaker 2:          00:56:19       you know.

Speaker 5:          00:56:20       It's like they didn't even give a shit. Even their curse was stupid. The curse of the goat. It was just fucking stupid.

Speaker 6:          00:56:28       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:56:29       Made no sense. It's a ballpark. You got to go. It doesn't belong here. It's going to shit all over the place. Get it Outta here. I curse you. Really?

Speaker 6:          00:56:37       MMM.

Speaker 5:          00:56:39       Any fucking waste. So they actually bring up what like scapegoat am actually ruining this entire thing. You probably don't have to fucking run it. They start talking about what is, how they came up with that terminology. The scape goat and it went back to religion. Oh Gee. That I guess back in the day, I don't know what the hell religion it was. They're all fucking stupid when you really get down to it other than they're due on to other stuff that every religion has. Um, they would basically have a goat. They bring a goat in and I'm thinking, all right, they're going to sacrifice it or whatever. And they wouldn't have, the priest would lay his hands on a goat for once instead of some unsuspecting child. Oh, a little molestation joke for you. How'd you guys like debt? Huh? Do you like dead on your Monday? Do you think that that was crossing the line? Well, fuck you. I'm stranded in New Jersey.

Speaker 6:          00:57:35       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:57:36       Fucking New Jersey, Huh? Jesus Christ. What a bunch of animals. It amazes me about New Jersey is how they still support Jon boat. Jon Bon Jovi or the Bon Jovi ban. To the point that that band can sell out giant stadium still.

Speaker 6:          00:57:57       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:57:57       Unbelief. Let's Jersey Foya. It's 70,000 people singing, singing along. Lay Your hands on me. Your love is not bad medicine. Zach [inaudible]. Whoa. Fucking acid wash as far as the eye can see. Dirty Jersey.

Speaker 5:          00:58:21       Actually I think New Jersey underrated is New Jersey. It's fucking phenomenal. All of these New York's snobs, Paul Versey being one of them. I'm really trashing him this week. Paul versus your typical New York snob and I hope you're listening to this. Paul, our help on somebody sends this to you. Um, yeah, he's, he's a snob. He's one of those guys who just thinks because he's on the other side of an imaginary line that all of a sudden, I don't know what that the trees are greener. The grass is Grad or know what the fuck it is. You know, I really realized like most New Yorkers Judge New Jersey on their drive to Newark Airport, when they go by all those chemical plants, look at it. It's so fucking shit hole. Oh, right. Despite the fact that all some of the most major celebrities live here. What do you think they live next to the plant? You know,

Speaker 5:          00:59:18       all those fucking guys down on Wall Street, the children of the Illuminati, they all live out there and red bank with their fucking, uh, Rockefeller estates. I know, but they, they got New Jersey license plates. Therefore it must suck. Anyways, let's get back to the scapegoat. Um, so basically the, uh, you know, the priest would take a day off from dental and kids and he'd lay his hands on a farm animal and one would think he would grab the horns and then start fornicating. But this, that's another story. What they would do with the, with the goat is he lay his hands on it and he would basically, somehow, I guess after everybody confessed to this douche bag, he would then place all of the sins on the goat and then they would just banish the goat and send it out of town with all the sins in everybody's souls. We're going to be clean again, but this is the funny thing. As the goat left, people would line up on either side of the street and they would, they would heckle the goat and jeer at them. Eh, you fucking adulterous paces shit. Yeah. Why don't you check off again? You cut just yelling about the sins that they did. I don't know what it was. Yeah. It keeps stealing from the pot at work. You selfish prick, yelling at a farm animal. You know, I swear to God, I would love to have a segment on here of all this stupid fucking things that, that, that they do in religion that people, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:00:57       there's no fucking way, there wasn't somebody like me back then going through, this is fuck, why are we yelling? At a goat, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:01:10       I mean, I hope you, you banged somebody fucking wife. You stole money from work. You know, you're booted an old lady in the ass. Do you really think it's in the goat now and it's just walking? I just don't fucking get it. Even if they filled you head up with it as a kid, at some point you gotta be looking at it like this is a fucking goat. It's got nothing to do with it. So anyways, they would just cheer at this thing and they'd send it out of town and then everybody would be absolved. And I don't know where to go. Would go. Sometimes they say they take the goat and they would throw it off a cliff, you know? I know it's extra painful for me because I fucking love goats. I really do. I was actually feeding some this morning. I don't know what it is about them.

Speaker 5:          01:01:55       I think they're fucking hilarious. You know, I got this buddy. He lives out here, right? It's got this giant house, there's all this fucking land and he's got farm animals, farm animals on it. And I'm thinking he's got these fucking things because he's like me. He's, he likes, he thinks goats or funny or whatever, and it isn't. I found out that there's tax laws out that if you farm on your land, you only have to pay property taxes on one acre. So he went out and got these goats. He doesn't even give a shit about him.

Speaker 7:          01:02:34       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:02:36       Can you fucking believe that? He's got like 10 goddamn goats and he has to go out there with this bucket of feed every day. He's got to feed these things and it's hard as an in it. That's what kills me.

Speaker 2:          01:02:50       Okay?

Speaker 5:          01:02:51       It's just just pay. It's just pay the taxes. If I, it would be worth it to not get up there with that lunch pail a cheerios every fucking morning,

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       okay?

Speaker 5:          01:03:03       Jesus fucking Christ. What is wrong? It's just money. It's paper. Who gives a fuck? You just, you know, work a couple extra hours. Fuck it. What do I owe you? You sit down, you write numbers on a piece of paper, you stick it in a magic envelope, you'll fucking Likud you send it out next. Jesus Christ. You're gonna sit there and have a bunch of goddamn livestock is fucking guys swear to God.

Speaker 7:          01:03:34       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:03:34       If, if, if you had a Giraffe, oh, what do you guys want? What do you guys want? Hang on. This is the hotel. Yeah, sorry about that. I had to go answer the phone. I couldn't even figure out how to work the fucking phone. He's probably somebody above me. I was probably yelling too loud. God knows what they all mad about.

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:03:55       And now just think about some of the Shit I've made fun of. You know, Jesus beastiality and Bon Jovi and they all hold the same weight here in New Jersey. Um, the hell was I talking about? Oh yeah, this fucking guy. I swear to God, if he, if he would get a giraffe, you get like five giraffes. If, if he only had to pay like a quarter acre tax, that always amazes me when people like that in the money, you know, I mean, I obviously give a fuck about money. I want to have enough to survive.

Speaker 7:          01:04:29       But, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:04:32       the amount of shit that didn't work and I never took it back, just blows my eye. I've probably kept at least 25 grand with his shit. That doesn't work in my life. I just gotta you gotta be shit they see as what the fucking prime. He's fucking pieces of shit and I go off, then my girl goes last year, return it. Ah, I'm not doing that shit. Standing down there with the sales slip, like some angry old fucking lady. I'm not doing it. Who the have would be calling me now? I'm all self conscious. I would have or if I'm too loud, knock on my door.

Speaker 5:          01:05:09       I sweat it. Got Up. But it was the Bon Jovi Shit. Um, anyways, let's get on with the podcast. This is the money morning podcast. Everybody if you to this podcast welcome. Um, this is, yes, and if you're thinking this is extra dirty and extra angry this week. No, this is how it is every fucking week. All right. Do one of these every week. I do them on Monday mornings because I know most people hate their jobs or they hate their commute. They hate their spouse or they hate themselves, you know, and they need, they need a break. And it's also a great way to whore out wherever the fuck I'm going to be. Uh, speaking of which I am going to be in, uh, Columbus, Columbus, Ohio at the funny bone down at the mall, not bragging on the, uh, September 9th, 10th and 11th. That is my next gig. I'm going to try to go to that, uh, Ohio state game. You know, it's in September. That's always a dangerous one. You know, to go to a college football game in September. Who they play it. Huh? They playing Wentworth technical institute.

Speaker 5:          01:06:22       You know, I'm new to college football the last couple of years and ever deadly. That's what they do. They've got all their cupcake games in the beginning of the year. And, uh, I guess these other colleges, uh, they pay money to, to play these giant teams and get the living shit kicked out of him on television just to, I don't know what to expose to get TV exposure for their school. I have no idea. Speaking of scapegoats, their entire fucking division three team goes out there a bunch of up against a bunch of roided up division one guys or whatever the fuck they're doing now. I don't know. And then they get the shit kicked out of him, but I don't know, every once in awhile an Appalachian Mountain state community college will beat a Michigan. So I don't know who they're playing that weekend, but I'm going to go down there.

Speaker 5:          01:07:10       I was looking forward to it until I spent fucking 14 straight days on the road. But, uh, anyways, the podcast.

I got one, they're 99 cents is a great to contribute 99 cents, and he gets something if you want to listen to NFL football star, right tackle [inaudible] from Salaam. Talk about trying to rip somebodies voicebox out as they, as that guy tried to fucking break his arm, that interview was there and a, I will be doing Monday morning podcast selects as I meet interesting guests. That's how I'm doing them. All right. When somebody, uh, somebody different. Okay. Because, uh, I don't want to interview other comedians. I just feel too many podcasts of doing that. I've done too many podcasts talking about comedy. I don't have any comedy stories left. I really don't. And I gotta be honest with you, aside from a couple of people who are really good interviewers, the Mark Marin's, Joe Rogan's and that type of shit, uh, I probably should've saved most of them for, ah, the unmasked that I did.

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:09:08       With, uh, Ron from Ron and Fez, I dunno where he can find that, but I did one of those this past week and, uh, I just been running my Yap all fucking week. Liz, why don't, why don't we get to something entertaining here? Uh, somebody sent me a, um,

Speaker 5:          01:09:25       this youtube video or this week, you really have to watch it. Okay. It's one of those shows. It's basically, it's a rip off of the view. It's for broad sitting around and they got, you know, the same thing. You know, they got the older one, they got the sexy one, they got the one who was fat and then got her fucking stomach tied up like a goddamn balloon. Not now. She's dropping weight faster than a junkie. Right. I don't even know if that's true. I just looked around him, you know, they got the racially mixed chick and they all got on their fucking shoes. Right. The little outfits. Uh, hang on a second. Hang on a second. Somebody's knocking. I'll let you know what this is.

Speaker 2:          01:10:01       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:10:01       All right. You guys aren't going to believe this shit that was security and they just said that they, they had a noise complaint. It was a lot of, uh, the guy comes, I go to the door. Right? This is so pathetic that it 43. I'm getting reprimanded. I feel like I'm in fucking high school and I talk like it too. Um, let me just the levels here or maybe turn up yours cause I don't want to get kicked out of here. Um, until you open the door and there's a security guard and he goes, uh, you Ben. And I'm like, no.

Speaker 2:          01:10:36       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:10:42       Cause I know he, I know that he knows my name is bill. Well this is the thing when security interrogates you, you never offer any information, you know, are you bent now? And then I just looked at him like, is there anything else I can help you with? And he's like a, he looks down on a piece of paper. Oh are you bill? And I was like, yes, yes I am. And he goes, uh, yeah, we, uh, we get a noise complaint from people on either side of you.

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       Uh, these are VIP rooms on either side of you. And uh, talking about, uh, three loud, there's a lot of cursing. And I'm like, all right. He goes, is there anyone else? No. Oh wait, wait, wait. He told me, can you step out in the hall? And I go for what? He goes, I need to step out in the hall. And I said, for what? And then he just goes into a Spiel, you know, what the fuck do I need to step out in the hall for? Am I gonna be able to hear you better? You know the rack like your God Damn State trooper with you, you're fucking sport coat on. But as the name of the hotel on the Lapel, I'm supposed to step out in the hall. I don't know who you are,

Speaker 2:          01:11:55       right?

Speaker 8:          01:11:57       I'm such a Dick. It's ridiculous. Right? So I made them basically say, I just didn't doorway. And he asked me, he goes, is there anybody else in there? And I was like, no. And then yeah, that's what he basically said that I'm being too loud. Jesus Christ. I was cursing, I think it was when you realized, he said there's people on either side trying to sleep. And I was singing Bon Jovi songs at the top of my fucking lungs. All right. And I was also talking about beastiality and I was trashing Jesus. You know what? This hotel is cool as hell. Cause when you really think about it, they probably should have kicked me up. Um, all right, so this is going to be my voice for the rest. This is bill on punishment voice. I'd like to apologize to everybody here at the Sheridan. Um, anyways, you know what some rich costs on the other side of the door, that fucking piece of one of those really fancy glasses that they think came from France but actually came from a fucking pottery barn. Um, if you can hear me, go fuck yourself. This is what you get for nuke in the economy. Um, all right. So anyways, so I'm watching this show, these four fucking broads on it. Okay. Listen nothing to Irb. Oh, he told me this is, this is your one and only warning. Next time you'll be rejected from the hotel. He had such hacky security, uh,

Speaker 8:          01:13:29       like terminology, you know, I don't fucking know. I T do you know how bad I just want to yell content at the top of my lungs right now and get ejected from the fucking hotel just so I can get out of Jersey? Maybe I should call up Paul version. Tell me to, you don't fuck that. That's what I'm gonna do after this podcast. I'm calling up Paul [inaudible] and I'm having them come down and get me. All right. You know, fucking threaten me next time I come up here. What do you my fucking Dad

Speaker 2:          01:13:56       fucking douchebag

Speaker 8:          01:13:58       Christ. I swear to God. You know what's funny about the male voice is it, uh, is it carries you have another set and there's a couple next door. You can never, the woman's voice, you just hear the guy every once in a while ago. Uh, Lou. Yeah. Well the WHO? Yeah. You'd never hit the broad, so I'm probably going to get kicked out. What do I do? Go Fuck Yourself. I'll take a cab back to New York.

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:14:31       Then they prop. Of course, they probably won't show up because they're still afraid. Afraid of the weather channel. Um, anyway, so these four fucking brides are on TV, right? And they ended up there talking about that guy that doing that story. You know that story where that dude got his dick cut off. I'm gonna have to raise the levels here. There we go. How's that? Is that better? All right. So they're talking about that guy who got his dick cut off his wife, drugged him, tied him to a bed, cut his dick off, threw it in a garbage disposal and turned it on. And it was basically because he wanted to get a divorce from her. She mutilated. And um, she ended the guy's fucking life and he solved quality. Life is over and these women are talking about it and lo and behold, it's fucking hilarious to them. They had all they could do to keep a straight face during the first minute of setting up the story. And then all the jokes come and they're laughing their fucking asses off.

Speaker 8:          01:15:41       It's the funniest fucking thing ever. And this right here. It's because of that type of shit that I don't feel that I am massage monistic I just don't, I think that I am just like women. I trashed women the way they trash guys. It's just nobody pays attention to the broads. They don't. Do you think of a guide mutilated a woman in any shape or form that four guys on a pregame NFL show would be laughing about it. You know, Sharon Osborne was the guest and she goes, somebody asked, do you think the guy deserved? And she goes, well, it depends on what he did. You know, I mean that thought is totally overlaps. The thought of those morons in the Middle East who cut women's clits off, you know, it's fucking medieval thought and it's just considered silly. I don't know what it is. I don't know.

Speaker 8:          01:16:46       But it maintains what I've always fucking said, that women will do it to you exactly what they don't want you to do to them if you let them. And I think why so many guys are miserable in marriages is they get married to fucking young before they really know how to stick up for themselves in a relationship. And that's why before you know it, yeah, married and all your shit is either in the basement of the garage and she's barely touching it and a, and you're wondering what the fuck happened to your life. You know, I dunno. The video is, is going to be up on the [inaudible] podcast.com. You know something. This is actually, I like this talking like this. This is very challenging to try and be funny with a late night DJ voice. All right, this next chunk of the podcast goes out to the ladies.

Speaker 8:          01:17:40       Ladies, if you're out there and you're single, hang in there, there's a date rapists on the horizon. This next song right me by nirvana goes out to all you. Um, I know there's somebody, some Vanderbilt on either side and may going Keith cursing again. Um, anyways, uh, being on the road or do they want to talk about bitches laughing at Dick being cutoff already talked about that, wanting to go home, talked about that. All right. Last week, uh, I was, I was showed that youtube clip about that guy running on that soccer field and getting, uh, you know, getting beat down by the cops and then the crowd overwhelms the cops and beats down the cops. And I wanted to hear from the police officers to just ask basically why they're such dicks when they pull you over. I'm not in a judgment that way, but just, I'm just basically asking the question the way all drivers talk. So we have a kite responding here. He says he built, not all cops are assholes. Some are just lazy. Uh, the summer after my sophomore year, oh, no, no, no, no. This is a different one. We'd have fucker's the one from the cop. That's the one I want to hear. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Let's see if I can read this before being ejected from the hotel. Uh, you're not going to be the worst is if I do get injected. This guy's gonna be standing here,

Speaker 7:          01:19:08       uh,

Speaker 8:          01:19:09       with this security fucking jacket on in my hotel room, watching me gather my things. So once again, I already have a game plan for that. If I come, if there's another knock at my door, I'm not opening it. I'm going to look through the people and I'm talking through the door. So we opened the door please. And I'm going to go, why? Uh, uh, cause and I'm just going to ask him straight out. Am I being ejected from the hotel? Uh, yes sir. You need to let me, uh, and I'll just bolt the door and I'm going to be like, listen, I'm gonna gather my things. I'll be out there in five minutes. You just sit tight. All right. You with no fucking badge. All right. What are you going to do? Take off your shoe? Is that what you're gonna do? Train. Throw it through the crack in the door. It's not going to hit me.

Speaker 7:          01:20:02       What

Speaker 8:          01:20:02       a fucking asshole. Can you step out into the lobby until the hallway police go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:20:11       Huh?

Speaker 8:          01:20:13       You fucking half a cop. You half a security guard? Well I step out into the hotel. Yeah, no I won't locate then I'll just just stay there. Then you douchebag. Um, anyways, this plow ahead. So here's a cup a day. Um, okay bill. Uh, the thing about this job is basically that we have no fucking idea who we are dealing with at any given time. Just because someone looks sweet and innocent and just because the situation isn't likely to escalate doesn't mean that they're not capable of murder or that the situation may go pear shaped quickly. I don't even know what that means.

Speaker 2:          01:20:56       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:20:56       pear shaped. I didn't want to shape is a pair of shape. Like what? What, what shape is it before it goes pear shaped? Is it an apple shape? Listen Buddy, he can't talk shop cause you're gonna lose me. I'm not that bright a guy. Um, anyways, I can't tell you how many times that someone said to me like, I'm going to do anything. People. Oh, what about that person running upstairs? Hi, can you reject that eight, eight year old on the fucking hotel. All right. [inaudible] you know, I feel, I feel like right now like, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:21:30       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:21:31       Either I'm announcing a golf match or um,

Speaker 2:          01:21:36       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:21:37       Um, I'm reporting live from a hostage situation. Okay. There talking to him right now, he still has the weapon up to the woman's head. You can clearly see that she's frightening. Okay. There's somebody flanking him on the left. Oh, he doesn't like, okay. He's fired a shot. It missed and hour they just took them down. Oh my God. He's been shot in the head and they have the woman. Um, anyways, here we go. Plowing ahead here. Um, so anyways, the amount of time just got pulls people over and the person behind the wheel says like, I'm going to do anything. People think that I know. Oh, the people, the drivers and stuff think that I know them their whole lives and know that their Cape, that they're incapable of harming anyone. But I don't, I always think back to the academy and all the videos we watched of cops getting killed or nearly killed because they made one mistake or had a lapse in the paranoia that keeps us safe.

Speaker 8:          01:22:34       See that? I knew it. I knew it was something that they showed them at the academy. I said, another thing to remember is that there is a gun at every call and every traffic stop the gun on my belt. No Man is invincible and a lucky punch can knock me unconscious, leaving me vulnerable to take to them taking my weapon and killing me or others. For this reason, we like to keep some distance. We don't like to be touched. And above all, we can't allow people to get the opportunity to take control of our weapon. Um, so when someone's Sir a squirrely or not listening to my commands, they may get cuffed and put in the back of my car until everything is figured out. They may not like it, but I am going home at the end of my shift, not to the morgue.

Speaker 8:          01:23:18       Um, that leaves another point of control. No one likes to be bossed around and told what to do. But when the police are there, were there for a reason someone called us or we have a reason to believe that we're needed. Once we're there, we have to be in control. We call the shots, not, um, not forgo or to be on a power trip, but because if we lose control, we're fucked. It's our ass. If someone gets hurt and our president and it's literally our ass if we get hurt or killed, if someone thinks that they can do what they want or walk over me, how am I supposed to do my job? Uh, as for the videos you recently posted, those cops with the name changer were absolutely terrible. If there is a lawful warrant for that guys arrest despite the reason, uh, it is their job to arrest him.

Speaker 8:          01:24:04       Um, the suspect knew about the warrant. I didn't know what video is. It didn't take care of it. Now he asked to see a judge. They should've just, they should have used much more forced to take them into custody. But the reality of it is you can't just be able to keep passively Redis resisting a cop until, until the cops let you go. Uh, they can't let you go. All right, here we go. The video at the stadium was disturbing. They shouldn't have been obviously jabbing the guy with their buttons, but they had the right to take them into custody. People running around sports fields isn't and shouldn't be tolerated. Are they supposed to stop the game and wait for him to be finished with running around? What if he assaulted or killed at athlete? Then everyone would be crying that the cops didn't do anything.

Speaker 8:          01:24:46       There was a great point. Also, when we deal with people, 90% of the possible danger from them is their hands. If you're laying on your hands and I can't see them, I will expect the worst. How am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to know what they are late? That they aren't laying on a weapon? Uh, when I want your hand gimme your hand or I will use force to get them out. Yeah. There you go. Uh, one last thing is tasers. Uh, they are amazing tools. I had been tased and training and yes, it sucks, but it beats getting thumped or shot. Uh, we're in the old days, that guy may get the crap beat out of him or his brain can cause now he gets an electric ride for five seconds. It's also amazing because the suspect can be cuffed while being taste basically less chance for everyone to see, to get seriously hurt.

Speaker 8:          01:25:36       Why should I risk getting seriously hurt or killed going hands on with someone when they can just be taste. Um, that, you know what somebody told me a long time ago, if you want to make, if you get pulled over by a cop, a great way to help them relax and maybe bring down them being a dick to you is a, have your hands where they can see them. You know, if it's during the day, I always put them like right on the steering wheel. I get pulled over a lot, by the way. Uh, not as much. I guess back in the day I did, cause I used to just drive 80 miles an hour anywhere I was going, you know, there's only so many fucking farm she can look at. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:26:18       yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:26:19       it was funny. So I'm still nervous about getting thrown out of here. And the only reason why is because some of the roads are washed out and I don't know where the fuck I would go, but I don't know why I'm nervous because I am now speaking in a speaking tone if I'm not allowed to speak.

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:26:35       No, this is actually great stuff. What if I show the hotel security my hands, maybe he'll allow me to stay. So anyways, um, yeah, I, I put my hands right on top of the steering wheel where they can see them. Um, if it's a sunny day, I have one hanging out the car window where they can see it. And the other one I just put on top of my head like an ape chilling out in, uh, in the zoo. You know, when they sit there and they just have that one arm draped over their head,

Speaker 7:          01:27:06       uh, I sit like that

Speaker 8:          01:27:09       and then when they show up, I just had my hands on the steering wheel and uh, and you know what, there's still assholes.

Speaker 3:          01:27:20       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:27:20       You know, it's kind of a crap shoot, you know, so, but I think this guy run up a lot of great points. What the fuck is he supposed to do? And that's a great point. If the guy ran on the field and did something to an athlete, then they would blame the security and it would be screaming and yelling at them, you know, which probably goes back to the weather channel then if they don't scare the living shit out of people that they would get blamed for not warning people. But I think it has more to do with a scaring people, gives them great ratings. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:27:46       yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:27:46       so I don't know any more cops want to weigh in? I, here's one for you. I want to know what do you guys think about that? You can anonymously talk about this as cops, that kid who got shot on the subway platform and died new year's Day in Oakland, um, that do definitely wasn't being compliant. He definitely wasn't given them showing them his hands. And this guy, I don't know, he's like the Manchurian candidate. All of a sudden the guy said the wrong thing. The guy's laying on his stomach. One cops got his foot on his neck. I mean that the dude is down.

Speaker 2:          01:28:21       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:28:21       And all of a sudden this one kid just stood up, takes out a gun and just shoots the guy right in the back. And I do, it's like, what the fuck you shot me? And he ended up dying.

Speaker 7:          01:28:32       Um, you know what about [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:28:35       that one? That's, that's, that's one. This is what I should say for the podcast select cause that's what I want to ask. And I didn't want to like just have somebody go on there and honestly and just say what you think about it. Should have that cop gone to jail because, uh, he got what basically usually happens when a cop shoots somebody. Is he

Speaker 7:          01:28:56       it off? Um, I dunno, but

Speaker 8:          01:29:02       I don't want to, I don't want to do this whole cop thing attack and cops. I'd like to try to create some sort of forum where you can actually anonymously present your side and that worry about pissing off other cops or worry about pissing off victims are in that type of shit. Cause I think it's, I don't know. It's one of those things for some reason I guess I know why. The reason is it's too much shit at stake so people don't talk about it. Um, that could have been a lot more fun topic. I didn't have to speak in my time up voice. This is officially the first mm podcast timeout on. Oh wait a minute then fucking old bastard downstairs. You know something? I think I'm allowed asshole.

Speaker 2:          01:29:42       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:29:42       I think that that's what it is. You know, on both sides of the country. I've been told that I'm too loud. I need to shut the fuck up self. You know, at some point you've gotta look in the mirror and realize that you, all right, let's plow ahead of here. All right. Advice for the week. Bill. I have known this young lady for a few years and we're very fond of each other. Uh, but she has had, she's had, she has a possessive boyfriend with a stupid haircut. And a couple of times when she's broken up with him, she's come to me. Uh, but then she goes back to macro man. Uh, this is the thing that bothers me. Whenever things have got gotten sexual between us, like I go down on her and blow her fucking mind. This guy has definitely got confidence. He goes, she never returns the favor.

Speaker 8:          01:30:26       She gets disgusted. She even gets disgusted. If I sulk in my seat that I didn't get any dude sulking is like, I don't, I'm not gonna sit here and act like I know what turns women on. But I can tell you the exact opposite of turning a woman on. If you want to have the exact opposite, Spanish fly would be sulking. Nothing makes her pussy dry up, like sulking, just letting you know right there. Okay. Um, but nothing that makes it wetter with complete indifference. Um, anyways, once she said callously Oh, after she did, after the guy went down on her and then she, he didn't get a blow job. She wants callously said, have a wank to alleviate my horniness. After having her completely naked on my chair worshiping her and pleasuring her holes to Jesus Christ, buddy, they got 'em at yelling. That one right there would have kicked me out. Uh, it was just me with the Styrofoam Cup. Another time when we had intercourse, we were drunk. She stopped me halfway through and she even stopped halfway through,

Speaker 8:          01:31:38       uh, shit doing you a favor, a hand job. She's never made me come. These are only the only examples of when she tried to get me off. And I'm a good looking chappy, so it's not that recently I boycotted her body. I said, let's be friends to be strictly platonic. I won't even play with her. NORCS I'm guessing her titties. Uh, this is, this has had the result of her trying to rekindle things like the old magic. Um, if she's not that into me, what the fuck is going on? I'm finished with her. But any insights you can give is a treasure. All right? First of all, dude, you're not finished. What? They're, um, just halfway through writing that you've probably realized what a PSAP you were being. All right. Okay. First of all, who's kidding who? You're, you're fucking with the psycho. All right.

Speaker 8:          01:32:29       And uh, I don't know if this is a very, there's a very touchy one to talk about here, but um, this girl strikes me as one of those girls who wants to be put in her place and wants to be bent over something and once a guy to tell her what the fuck is what? Ra. Okay. Consensually. Do you understand what I mean? Okay. Don't take this the wrong way. Going in and just fucking give him a forearm. Give her a forearm shiver. Right. I'm not saying to do that. All right. You know, some girls are cons and they know their account and they want to get us to basically tell them that it could be this. I have no idea. If I could tell you one thing right now, sulking and keep coming back for more. You'll like Charlie brunch keeps pulling the football and uh, you know, if you want to fuck this girl, walk away from her, stop returning your phone calls and all that type of shit, you, you basically started to do that when you boycotted a body. But then you said, let's be friends. That's a weak move. Okay. What's this girl I think wants to see you be a fucking man. All right? And you're not, you're going down on her, you're pleasing her and she's doing everything. Everything she can to disrespect you and you're allowing it.

Speaker 7:          01:33:50       MMM.

Speaker 8:          01:33:51       And I think that's turned on or off. And I think she's a fucking statistic. Psycho. So she's getting you off. She's leaving you with blue balls, you know, I don't know. That might be it. Or she might be fucking angry at something else and she's taken it out on you. All I know, dude is walk away from this girl. Just walk away from her brother for some fucking reason. You still want to bang her one more time, blow her off, blow off her texts in or calls for like a week and a half. And then randomly answer one. And when you pick up the phone, just just have a whatever vibe. Hey, what's going on? And we're being McCune and make calls and me or make ticks and the busy, what's up? You want to hang out now?

Speaker 8:          01:34:36       Why not? Yeah. You know, I don't know. What do I want to hang with you for? Get blue balls. You know, you're fucking selfish. You're fucking annoying. Leave me alone. You know, that's probably too angry, but just, I'm sorry guys, I'm fucking angry right now that I have to talk like this. Um, yeah, just blow her off and just be, you know, and when you go to meter meter in a public place, don't go over a place where she can immediately, she's going to dress extra sexy when you come over there because she's trying to get that power over you again. Meet her in a fucking public place and be talking to her as you kind of glancing around the room, you know, sort of head on another girl while she's standing there, I'm telling you, you know, and when she asked you to go home with their, don't

Speaker 8:          01:35:31       just say I'm cool or whatever, you know, fucking blow her off. If she ever calls you again, she wants to hang out or whatever. Tell, tell him to come over to your place. And the second she starts acting like a Douche, kick her out. I don't know. I had sheets. What sucks about a girl like that as immediately you got to try and get into her head. Then you've got to start playing games. It's not worth it. There's too many decent girls out there who will, when they take the dick out, they will fucking complete whatever you want. So I would just walk away from her.

Speaker 7:          01:36:05       MMM.

Speaker 8:          01:36:06       Let's be friends. Jesus Christ, buddy that and sulking you need to take. Those are the two parts of your game. You need to work on this off season. All right? And then maybe next year you'll get the ring. Okay. Good luck. All right, next one. Bill. I'm a cubicle dwelling, suffocated engineer in Texas. I was rushed through the college machine with all the rest of the cattle destined to find a job, dimes, some pleated Khakis and live the rest, live the rest of our lives. And he's steadily paid servitude of the man. But a few years ago out of college,

Speaker 7:          01:36:42       uh Oh,

Speaker 8:          01:36:43       but a few years ago out of college and I hated, like you saying, I'm a few years out of college and I hate it. Uh, I wish I'd followed my desire to be some sort of a writer. And after listening to your podcasts among others and hearing from friends that I should have, I wish I'd given stand up a shot. Well, now I'm 30 years old, staring down the barrel of 35 more years as a cozy smug engineer, making six figures, but hating five out of every seven days of my life. I don't have any wife or kids, but I feel like I'm too old to jump back into being a starving artists. What do I do?

Speaker 7:          01:37:18       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:37:19       dude, this is on you. All right? I would never tell somebody who's got a six figure paying job to jump into this fucking awful business. All right? Um, but I would never tell you not to do it. All I got to tell you is you can't half ass getting into this business, all right? Or you are going to be, you think you hate in your life. Now, uh, just picture hating five out of every seven days, except you're making fucking, you make it low five and you're old now and nobody wants to fucking book you and you don't have any wife and kids. I'm telling you, all right, I'll give you this advice. If you decide to become a fucking comedian, there's no turning back, all right? And you've got to go into it.

Speaker 8:          01:38:14       You can't even consider quitting. And it has nothing to do with fucking talent and has to do with desire. I'm telling you. Um, that's what I would say. So what I would do if I was you, I would keep my six figure job and I'd start doing some open mics. That's what I would do. All right. And if you feel in your heart as you're standing on stage that this is what the fuck you want to do with your life. I would do it in a second because six figures, seven figures, if you're miserable, it's not going to be worth it. All right? But I don't know if you know you're into comedy, you know, the way I'm into playing drums, drums or a hobby for me, I absolutely fucking love them. But there's no fucking way I would have, I was about to climb into a van with three other fucking guys, you know, and eat pasta.

Speaker 8:          01:39:13       I want, I'm not going to do it. It just, I don't know. I actually played drums and I realized I didn't have it. You know, I didn't, I didn't have it as a musician and I didn't have that drive. Um, but when I got on stage, the first time I did comedy, I just, I, I never look back and I was just like this, I'm doing this shit. So, um, they go, so you have to answer those questions. So the best way to do it is to sign up for some open mics. All right? See how it goes and see how you feel. And like I said, if you feel like that's what you want to do, then I would, I would work towards it, but I would not quit that six figure paying job. Uh, you don't just quit your fucking job. You don't build up your time so you can swing out of that job into some fucking paid gigs.

Speaker 8:          01:40:04       That's how I did it. Um, I kept my day job until I moved to New York City and I had saved up a bunch of money. Um, you know, I had paid off all my bills. I didn't have a car payment, I had nothing. And I moved to New York and I had a nest egg of fucking money. And uh, and yeah, I've told these stories before. I hate fucking spaghetti every goddamn night. Three pieces of bread filled up my stomach and I just did stand up every night and I just did. I just wasn't doing standup. I was working towards getting better at it, analyzing what I was doing wrong, and um, you know, but I would, I would never tell you to quit your job. And I would also never tell you that you can't start comedy at 30 years of age because you can't. All right, so there it is, but at the ball's in your fucking court.

Speaker 8:          01:41:00       All right. Youtube videos of the week. Uh, we had an earthquake here, um, this past week. Uh, best earthquake reaction. This is hilarious. It's like three guys on the MLB network or something like talking about baseball and all of a sudden the hurricane comes. Uh, it's fucking hilarious because people on the east coast don't know what an earthquake feels like. A, so they're sort of looking around like, um, wait a second is, does anybody else feel like something moving? Uh, in defense of them was one of those little shakin ones. Um, somebody sent some home videos of Peyton manning as a kid, uh, running around whining or whatever. But, uh, I, I'm too hard on Peyton manning is fucking ridiculous. How hard I am on this guy. Bought A, everybody wind is a kid, but at this still funny as a patriots fan to watch. Um, and here's two that I get.

Speaker 8:          01:41:55       Um, it's called fuck, fuck the police one. And this is hilarious. This is some guy, I dunno if he's in Brooklyn or what, this black dude who knows his rights has been harassed by the police. She can tell his entire life or whatever, but he's screaming at the cops. That's the mistake he makes. They don't arrest them, but the shit he's saying, if he would just say it, if he just said it, I think he would've been fine, but he's screaming it. Uh, and it's really funny. It's actually, it was, this guy goes on for like 20 minutes and uh, I've said before, it's all about not losing your shit and this guy loses his shit. But I don't think he ever gets arrested, but it's fucking hilarious. Um, and he has a youtube video of the week. This was actually suggested by Paul Versey, uh, oh out will forte.

Speaker 8:          01:42:51       And this is a, a sketch with Peyton manning. Peyton manning is fucking hilarious in the sketch. Um, it's basically will forte, you know, everybody comes walking in there like a basketball team and they get their asses kicked and well forte comes in and basically tells people that they shouldn't quit and that he had a coach and they played him this song one time when his team was down by 60 points and by listening to the song and amped, I'm all the way up. And then he basically puts on some fucking songs from the 1930s and starts dancing to it and it's fucking hilarious. Underrated for the week. Will Forte, the guy is fucking hilarious. And uh, please watch the director's cut of macgruber. Highly recommended that. And what else do we got here? We got the a woman cuts, guy's Dick off all the four broads laughing at that.

Speaker 8:          01:43:42       And then I got one other one here. What the fuck is it? Hang on, hang on, hang on. Um, I'm the worst. The fuck did it go? All right. Oh wait, don't say it too loud. Don't curse too loud. We will eject you from the Sheridan. Um, I'll future gun owner. I'll creepy game show host is another one that we have creepy fucking game show host. She used to see this, I can't believe that this guy actually was allowed on air and I showed it to Bobby Kelly and he was laughing at just this guy's fucking, the game show was basically a mother and a daughter. You know something. They already showed this on tosh point. Oh, I really try not to do that because I figured everybody sees them, but we'll put it up there just in case. But Bobby Kelly actually showed me another one.

Speaker 8:          01:44:31       I don't know where the fuck this took place. It sounds like it's in Scandinavia. And this guy calls this kid up to sing a song and he basically just starts kissing his back. It's unbelievably disgusting. Uh, nibbling on his ear in the back of his hair is this kid is singing. It's fucking brutal. Um, all right. Overrated. Underrated for the weekend. Then I'm going to fucking rap this pie. Holy Shit. Hour and 15 minutes. Time flies when you're whispering in a super eight, um, overrated hand sanitizer. I've been sharing the company restaurant with a bunch of coworkers who believe using hand sanitizer is the equivalent or even superior to washing their hands with good old soap and water. It's not the rubbing alcohol and the hand sanitizer kills the bacteria and destroys virus presence on the hand. And that's about it. It does not physically remove the genital grime deposited on the hands after guy has finished jiggling his junk to get rid of the last drops of Piss.

Speaker 8:          01:45:28       These people also use other commodities such as the company refrigerator, therefore effectively covering every goddamn thing that they touch with their dead penis and vagina cells. All right, guy, he's not short. If descriptive adjectives, uh, overrated launch, people dump all kinds of chemicals to make them look pretty. Personally, I prefer a clean water over a pretty long, uh, overrated. The overnight, the other night, and decided to have a nice wink and crash out for the night. So I hop on the generic porn site and started browsing. Next thing I know, two hours have passed. I was still awake, hadn't banked, and barely even had a Fleetwood Mac, soft rock, half Chubb, et Cetera. Uh, I didn't even watch a full video, which I think no one really does total fucking waste. Instead, I just use the girl's section of a Hurley catalog I had laying around, which worked pretty well, just so we all know.

Speaker 8:          01:46:25       All right. Underrated the paper. Grocery bags, plastic bags are given to you by default. And all the grocery stores I've been to, they should give you paper, and if you want plastic, he should have to ask for it. Uh, all right. This ends the, uh, comedy, the Monday first Monday morning podcast, comedy timeout. And I feel lucky because I did not get ejected from the hotel. Um, that's it. I hope you enjoyed this weird ass fucking podcast. This podcast was like a nirvana song started off loud. Then it got quiet, but never got loud again. Um, so I guess it isn't, it's like the first don't feel shut the fuck up. All right. Go fuck yourselves. That's the podcast. See Ya.
