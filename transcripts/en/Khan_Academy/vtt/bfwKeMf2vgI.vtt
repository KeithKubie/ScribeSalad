00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Narrator] Watsonville, California

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.830
is an agricultural community.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.880
We have 98% of our students are Latino

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.330
and about 90% of our
students speak Spanish

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.990
as their first language.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.180
Teachers cannot do their job alone.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.600
They need to have resources

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.720
because every class that they receive,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.890
which is usually between 25 and 30,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.361
has a variety of learners
in that classroom.

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.150
Teachers use a wide variety of tech tools

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.600
in their classrooms and Kahn
Academy is one of those tools,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.828
'cause it allows for differentiation
amongst the learners.

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:33.128
- I want to subtract
four here, whatcha do?

00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:36.103
(students respond)

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:39.320
- Miss Kotto takes teaching as a skill

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.193
and turns it into an art form.

00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:43.610
- This year was amazing with LearnStorm.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.095
I had a group of students
that couldn't add,

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:48.200
subtract, multiply, or divide fractions.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.470
They avoided it at all costs.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.290
But since it was an assignment,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.580
they would try it and they would

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.780
eventually do much better.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.788
And what was amazing was that
the lower-achieving students

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:03.400
were able to see that they
were part of something huge.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.170
They were able to contribute,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.480
and that, I thought, boosted
their self-confidence,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.620
their self-esteem, and I didn't realize

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.310
that would happen after doing LearnStorm.

00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:16.050
- LearnStorm really made me realize

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.130
how much you can grow in
just a short amount of time.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.360
If you put that same amount of effort,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.510
you can grow even more.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.810
- I'm impressed.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.210
Many of you guys are getting it right.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.710
Some of you guys are getting stuck.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.300
I will show you where
you're getting stuck,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.090
and I love that you're not giving up.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.849
- All of our classmates
work so well together,

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.060
and it really showed that
we really did win as a team.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.040
It was really breathtaking

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.110
'cause I think our goal
was just to reach Level 12,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.095
and then we ended up reaching Level 36.

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:51.163
We completed, I think, 8,080 assignments.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.320
- First thing in the morning,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.290
I had everybody start doing
some mastery challenges.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.110
After I took roll I said, okay guys,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.006
let's look at the progress tracker.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:01.650
And it just kept going up.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.820
The students loved it.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.530
The growth mindset activities,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.010
we watched one every
single week as a group,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.770
and they would share their
ideas with their partners.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.747
I can see towards the end of the year,

00:02:12.747 --> 00:02:13.890
they don't give up.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740
They work harder.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.532
- Keep going, keep growing
means to push your limits

00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:21.680
and to, even if you make a mistake,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.320
learn from them and keep
growing when you're learning.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.730
- Thinking about LearnStorm

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.270
and the students going to college

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.668
almost makes me want to cry

00:02:28.668 --> 00:02:30.760
because I think at the beginning,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.340
so many of the students
felt I just can't do it.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.690
But because they were
able to do LearnStorm

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.750
and their skills are so much higher now,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.880
they know that they can
keep going and keep growing,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.093
and nothing will stand in their way.
