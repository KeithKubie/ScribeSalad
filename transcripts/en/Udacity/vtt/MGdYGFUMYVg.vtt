00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.520
So now we know how to start with personas and

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.400
use cases to always keep our end user in mind.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really important to keep our

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.800
persona and use cases in mind, as designers

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.570
and developers when we're prioritizing feature lists, figuring

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.850
what to build, how to build it and when

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.450
to build it. Because if we don't do

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.030
that we fall into the trap of creating applications

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.410
either for no one or everyone, or just

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.900
for ourselves, both of which are really bad options.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900
&gt;&gt; I think we can really consider ourselves divine,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.100
dev, design-minded developers at this point.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. So what's next in the process now that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.790
we've talked about personas in each cases and prioritizing feature lists?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.780
&gt;&gt; Well what we want to next is focus on next is low res wireframing.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.940
We talked a little bit about that in lesson one, and we're going to go into

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.370
it more in lesson three. And lesson three

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.330
is going to be all about the mobile user,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.410
because after all, we are building Android apps

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.580
and we need to start thinking mobile first.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.880
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
