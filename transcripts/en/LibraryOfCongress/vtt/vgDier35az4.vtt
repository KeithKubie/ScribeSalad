00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.867
SPEAKER:  ROBERT, I HAVE TO BE 
HONEST, WHEN I RECEIVED THE 

00:06:18.308 --> 00:06:21.323
INVITATION.  FIRST OF ALL, 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, I'M 

00:06:21.862 --> 00:06:24.632
ECSTATIC.  I MEAN THE WHOLE IDEA
 OF BEING HERE.  AND THEN I 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.750
THOUGHT DISCO FASHION.  

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.018
[LAUGHTER].  IT'S -- BUT THEN I 
FELT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HAS

00:06:33.265 --> 00:06:35.691
 EVERYTHING.  AND YOU DO.  SO 
WHY NOT?  

00:06:35.692 --> 00:06:42.470
SPEAKER:  IT'S TRUE.  WE DO.  WE
 ARE -- WE ARE GROUND ZERO FOR 

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:45.774
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISCO ERA,

00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:49.930
SEE, A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.

00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:53.170
SPEAKER:  IT TAKES ME BACK.  
[LAUGHTER].  

00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:58.071
SPEAKER:  IT'S ALSO FUN BECAUSE 
YOU'RE A FELLOW WASHINGTONIAN.  

00:06:58.212 --> 00:07:05.762
SPEAKER:  I AM, GENERATIONS.  
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].  

00:07:05.763 --> 00:07:13.433
SPEAKER:  AND A GRADUATE OF 
CORCHRAN CULTURE.  

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:16.444
SPEAKER:  YES.  FOR FIVE YEARS. 
SPEAKER:  SO TELL US HOW DID YOU

00:07:20.576 --> 00:07:22.576
 MORPH FROM 

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:28.602
CROCHRAN MAJOR.  
SPEAKER:  WELL, HOW MUCH TIME DO

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:36.628
 WE HAVE.  EVEN GETTING TO THE 
CORCHRAN WAS A SERENDIPITOUS 

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:41.354
PATH AND I HAD AN UNDER GRADUATE
 DEGREE.  I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I 

00:07:41.473 --> 00:07:44.632
WAS GOING TO BE DOING IN 
LITERATURE.  I STUDIED 

00:07:44.926 --> 00:07:47.532
ARCHITECTURE.  AFTER ONE 
SEMESTER OF IT, I THOUGHT THIS 

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:56.613
IS A SURE TRIP TO AN INSANE 
ASYLUM.  YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE 

00:07:57.336 --> 00:08:03.686
PULLING INK AND A STYLUS ALONG A
 STRAIGHT AGE AND 20 HOURS INTO 

00:08:03.687 --> 00:08:08.606
A DRAWING, THE WHOLE THING 
BLEEDS.

00:08:08.607 --> 00:08:14.347
I GRADUATED FROM CORCHRAN AND I 
THOUGHT HOW AM I GOING TO 

00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:16.945
SUPPORT MYSELF AS A STARVING 

00:08:20.577 --> 00:08:24.850
SCULPTOR.  AND I WENT BACK IN 
WASHINGTON, BUT IN A DIFFERENT 

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.972
FORM OF 

00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:35.442
DEPARTURE.  AND I WAS INVITED TO
 TEACH AT THE CORCHRAN.  AND IT 

00:08:35.443 --> 00:08:42.112
WAS ANOTHER TRIP TO THE ASYLUM. 
 FOR A WHILE I THREW UP EVERY 

00:08:42.113 --> 00:08:45.575
MORNING IN THE PARKING LOT.  I 
HAD A WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO HIRED 

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:52.043
ME.  A WONDERFUL WOMAN.  AND 
DURING THE WEEK I KEPT REHEARSNG

00:08:53.044 --> 00:08:55.246
 THE TALK I NEEDED TO HAVE WITH 
HER

00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:01.519
 FRIDAY AFTERNOON AFTER CLASS.  
I THOUGHT I CAN'T DO THIS.  AND 

00:09:02.218 --> 00:09:09.383
SOMEONE ELSE DECIDED THEY CANNOT
 RETURN TO TEACH.  AND I HAD 

00:09:09.384 --> 00:09:15.673
THIS WONDERFUL IMPASSIONED 
SPEECH.  I WASN'T EATING.  I 

00:09:15.674 --> 00:09:19.028
WASN'T SLEEPING.  AND LIFE 
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.  SHE 

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:23.565
LISTENED TO ME.  SHE SAYS I 
TRUST THAT THIS 

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:30.896
WILL EITHER CHANGE YOU OR KILL 
YOU.  AND I THOUGHT THE LATER.  

00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:36.089
OH, NO.  I GOT TO GO BACK ON 
MONDAY.  BUT CURED ME IT DID.  I

00:09:36.856 --> 00:09:39.824
 ENDED UP BEING A CAREER 
ACADEMIC.  29 YEARS

00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:48.796
 IN THE CLASSROOM.  SO I WAS 
INVITED TO TEACH AT PARSONS 

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:54.554
SCHOOL OF DESIGN IN NEW YORK.  
THIS WAS 1982.  AND I SAID NO, 

00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.931
NO, NO.  
THANK YOU.  I LOVE WASHINGTON.  

00:09:57.075 --> 00:10:00.900
HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.  AND 
THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS THAT 

00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:04.004
WERE HAPPENING FOR ME.  IT'S 
VERY INTERESTING HOW MUCH LIFE 

00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:08.674
CAN CHANGE.  AS QUICKLY AS EIGHT
 OR NINE MONTHS.  THINGS CHANGE 

00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:13.765
QUITE DRAMATICALLY.  AND I 
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING TO

00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:23.238
 GO OR WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO.  
AND THE PHONE RANG IN THE OLDERN

00:10:25.318 --> 00:10:29.506
 DAYS WITH THE RING RING.  AND 
IT WAS PARSONS SAYING WE ARE 

00:10:29.507 --> 00:10:32.071
TRYING AGAIN.  AND I SAID I WILL
 COME UP AND INTERVIEW AND WE'LL

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.614
 SEE. 
AND TWO WEEKS LATER I WAS LIVING

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:38.732
 IN NEW YORK.  AND THAT WAS 34 
YEARS AGO.  SO ITS BEEN A LONG 

00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:45.765
RIDE.  NOW, I HAD ANOTHER ROLE 
AT PARSONS OR EVENTUALLY DID.  

00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:49.446
IN 1990 I WAS APPOINTED 
ASSOCIATE DEAN.  AND IN THAT 

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:52.765
CAPACITY I WORKED WITH 
DEPARTMENTS WITH CURRICULUM 

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:56.089
DEVELOPMENTS AND FACULTY HIRING 
AND FULL-TIME FACULTY HIRING AND

00:10:56.368 --> 00:11:01.520
 CHAIR HIRINGS.  BUT MOST OF IT 
WAS CLEAN UP.  PEOPLE CALLED ME 

00:11:02.504 --> 00:11:05.905
MR. FIX-IT.  AND I CALLED MYSELF
 A POOPER SCOOPER.  AND I WOULD 

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:09.976
SAY THIS PLACE HAS TO STOP 
POOPING SO MUCH.  AND IT WAS.  

00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:13.224
AND THAT'S HOW I LANDED IN THE 
FASHION DEPARTMENT.  I NEVER -- 

00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:18.571
PEOPLE SAY WHEN DID YOU FALL IN 
LOVE WITH FASHION?  WELL, IT WAS

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:24.388
 WITH A BAYNETTE IN MY BACK.  I 
NEVER INTENDED TO BE PART OF THE

00:11:24.664 --> 00:11:26.028
 FASHION WORLD, IN ANY CAPACITY.

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:29.698
WE HAD A CRISIS OF LEADERSHIP IN
 OUR FASHION PROGRAM.  WHICH AT 

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.573
THE TIME, WELL, IT STILL IS 
ARGUABLY THE MOST FAMOUS PROGRAM

00:11:33.715 --> 00:11:41.152
 AT PARSONS.  WE HAVE A CRISIS 
OF LEADERSHIP.  I WAS SENT IN TO

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:47.666
 CONDUCT A SEARCH FOR THE NEW 
CHAIR.  AND WHEN I STARTED MY 

00:11:47.887 --> 00:11:51.460
EXCAVATION OF ISSUES, I WENT 
BACK TO THE DEAN AND SAID THIS 

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.373
IS NOT A QUICK FIX.  AND IT'S 
NOT SOMETHING THAT AN OUTSIDER 

00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.212
CAN DO.  AND HE SAID, WELL I 
WANT YOU TO GO IN FOR A YEAR.  

00:11:58.544 --> 00:12:06.583
SO THAT WAS THE DEAL.  I WOULD 
THERE FOR A YEAR.  AND THE 

00:12:06.862 --> 00:12:11.997
LIMITS TO THE YEAR WERE THE 
FOLLOWING.  I WENT IN, IN 

00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:17.306
AUGUST.  THE BUDGET SET JULY 
1ST.  FACULTY CONTRACTS WERE 

00:12:17.454 --> 00:12:22.075
SET.  ROOM ASSIGNMENTS, I MEAN 
EVERYTHING WAS LAID OUT FOR YOU 

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:24.718
FOR THE COMING YEAR.  THERE IS 
REALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO EXCEPT

00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:29.752
 OBSERVE AND PROBE.  I ASKED 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF 

00:12:30.058 --> 00:12:32.754
QUESTIONS.  SO AFTER ABOUT THREE
 MONTHS THERE, I WROTE A STATE 

00:12:32.755 --> 00:12:35.861
OF THE UNION OF SORTS TO THE 
DEAN. 

00:12:35.862 --> 00:12:39.619
SAYING THIS PLACE IS 
HEMORRHAGING.  IT'S NOT A QUICK 

00:12:39.924 --> 00:12:47.410
FIX.  IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN I 
EVER DREAMED.  AND CALLING IT 

00:12:47.775 --> 00:12:52.507
FASHION DESIGN, IT'S A DRESS 
MAKING SCHOOL.  IT REALLY WAS.  

00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:55.462
THERE WAS NO TALK ABOUT 
CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT.  THERE 

00:12:55.463 --> 00:12:59.014
WAS NO FASHION HISTORY.  OH, I 
ASKED, HOW CAN THIS BE?  WE 

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:03.791
DON'T WANT THE STUDENTS TO BE 
INFLUENCED.  CAN YOU IMAGINE?  

00:13:05.456 --> 00:13:11.146
SO BURY YOURSELF IN A BASEMENT 
AND PRETEND THAT FASHION HASN'T 

00:13:11.633 --> 00:13:16.184
BEEN AROUND SINCE MILLENIA.  AND
 NOTHING IS DIGITAL.  IT'S THE 

00:13:16.553 --> 00:13:19.628
YEAR 2000.  SO I WILL FAST 
FORWARD.  I ENDED UP BEING 

00:13:19.836 --> 00:13:22.531
APPOINTED CHAIR.  NOTHING THAT I
 INTENDED TO DO.  I HAVE TO TELL

00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:28.614
 YOU A FUNNY STORY.  A DEAR 
FRIEND OF MINE FOR MANY YEARS, 

00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:32.147
IT'S DIANNE VON 

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.898
FOSTENBURG, SHE IS A DOLL.  SHE 
WAS MY GO-TO PERSON FOR ANY KIND

00:13:41.033 --> 00:13:44.507
 OF DILEMMA. 
SHE IS A REAL PROBLEM SOLVER AND

00:13:44.828 --> 00:13:47.941
 KNOWS HOW TO ASK THE RIGHT 
QUESTIONS.  AND SHE KNOWS HOW

00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:55.722
 TO DIAGNOSE AND PRESCRIBE.  SO 
SHE WAS MEETING WITH ME IN MY 

00:13:55.723 --> 00:14:03.064
NEW OFFICE AS CHAIR.  AND I WAS 
VERY AWARE JUST IN TERMS AURA 

00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:04.080
THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY 
DIFFERENT.  

00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:06.944
AND I LOOKED AT HER.  AND I SAID
 WHAT'S THE MATTER?  AND SHE 

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:11.139
LOOKED ME UP AND DOWN.  AND SHE 
SAID, YOU NEED NEW CLOTHES.  SHE

00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:16.132
 SAID YOU CANNOT BE RUNNING THIS
 DEPARTMENT LOOKING LIKE THIS.  

00:14:16.349 --> 00:14:19.393
AND I SAID IT'S THAT BAD?  SHE 
SAID IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.  I JUST

00:14:19.782 --> 00:14:25.056
 NEVER HAD A NEED TO TELL YOU.  
[LAUGHTER].  

00:14:25.057 --> 00:14:27.431
SPEAKER:  WHAT A GREAT PIECE OF 
ADVICE.  I LIKE IT.  

00:14:27.432 --> 00:14:30.451
SPEAKER:  BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU
 ANOTHER FUNNY STORY HAVING TO 

00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:36.831
DO WITH DIANNE.  I'M SORRY I'M 
STRAYING.  I HAVE THIS WAY OF 

00:14:37.835 --> 00:14:38.914
TALKING.  
SPEAKER:  PLEASE GO ON.  I LOVE 

00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:40.558
IT.  
SPEAKER:  AS A CHAIR, THERE WERE

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:44.592
 CERTAIN THINGS I HAD TO DO.  
CURRICULUM WAS A HUGE ONE.  

00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:49.785
FACULTY WAS ANOTHER.  THERE WAS 
A VERY POWERFUL FACULTY MEMBER 

00:14:50.001 --> 00:14:56.366
WHO -- AND I SAY POWERFUL 
BECAUSE HE ASSERTED HIMSELF INTO

00:14:56.968 --> 00:15:00.059
 EVERYTHING.  AND DID SO VERY 
INAPPROPRIATELY.  BUT IT HAD 

00:15:00.249 --> 00:15:03.316
BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS.  AND 
MANY WAYS, THE PRECEDENT HAD 

00:15:03.442 --> 00:15:07.075
BEEN SET.  AND WHO IS TO SAY TO 
HIM YOU CANNOT DO THE FOLLOWING 

00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:11.614
THINGS?  AND I THOUGHT, WELL I'M
 THE ONE WHO IS GOING TO SAY IT.

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:20.020
HIM.  I MEAN I COULD HAVE.  I 
KNEW POLITICALLY IT WOULD BE 

00:15:20.318 --> 00:15:23.234
VERY DANGEROUS.  I WAS LIKE 
OKAY, I NEED TO GET TO GUY TO 

00:15:23.477 --> 00:15:29.696
QUIT.  SO I WROTE HIM A VERY 
MATTER-FACT LETTER LAYING OUT, 

00:15:29.816 --> 00:15:32.560
HERE ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES 
AND HERE THE THINGS THAT YOU 

00:15:32.736 --> 00:15:39.438
HAVE BEEN DOING AND WILL NO 
LONGER BE DOING.  AND SENT IT.  

00:15:40.081 --> 00:15:44.116
WAS WAIT FOR THE REPERCUSSIONS 
AND WITHIN ABOUT 10 DAYS THIS 

00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:47.883
ENORMOUS, I MEAN ENORMOUS 
ENVELOPE ARRIVED.  AND IT WAS 

00:15:48.262 --> 00:15:51.291
HARD.  I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T 
REALLY -- YOU COULDN'T BEND IT. 

00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:55.618
I THOUGHT, WHAT IS THIS?  WELL, 
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS AN EXTREMELY

00:15:56.306 --> 00:16:00.961
 TALENTED ARTIST.  I PULL OUT 
THIS DOCUMENT THAT LOOKS LIKE A 

00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:07.608
MID EVIL MANUSCRIPT.  I MEAN, IT
 WAS SPECTACULARLY STUNNING WITH

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:15.481
 GOLD LEAF AND DRAGONS.  AND I 
READ IT.  AND IT BEGAN WITH I 

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:19.444
RECEIVED YOUR MENACNG

00:16:21.776 --> 00:16:24.786
 MISSION. 
AND IT CONCLUDED WITH I QUIT.  I

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.675
 WAS THRILLED.  
SPEAKER:  WOW.  

00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:34.558
SPEAKER:  SO A FEW WEEKS LATER, 
DIANNE WAS IN THE OFFICE.  AND I

00:16:34.805 --> 00:16:38.707
 WAS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE MY OWN 
LITTLE PRIVATE RESTROOM IN MY 

00:16:38.943 --> 00:16:42.360
OFFICE.  SO I TOOK THIS THING, 
THIS DOCUMENT, AND HUNG IT 

00:16:42.597 --> 00:16:48.233
BEHIND THE BATHROOM DOOR, WHICH 
FACES THE 

00:16:51.757 --> 00:16:54.125
TOILET.  SO DIANNE GOES TO THE 
BATHROOM AND CALLS OUT, WHAT'S A

00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:56.589
 MENACING 

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.639
MISSIVE. 
SPEAKER:  DO YOU STILL HAVE IT. 

00:17:02.865 --> 00:17:06.671
SPEAKER:  YEAH. 
SPEAKER:  YOU'RE BRAVE.  

00:17:06.672 --> 00:17:09.619
SPEAKER:  AND PROJECT RUNWAY 
CALLED.  AND I MADE -- I WILL 

00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:17.161
SAY THIS MODESTLY, BUT ALSO 
RATHER -- WHAT'S THE WORD I AM 

00:17:17.365 --> 00:17:25.696
SEARCHING FOR?  I'LL JUST SAY 
THIS MODESTLY.  I HAD TO MAKE 

00:17:26.062 --> 00:17:28.952
CHANGES IN THE DEPARTMENT.  AND 
THEY WERE VERY CONTROVERSIAL IN 

00:17:29.396 --> 00:17:34.464
THE CASES.  AND MANY PEOPLE, 
PARTICULARLY ALUMNI HATED ME.  I

00:17:34.638 --> 00:17:38.881
 WAS REALLY UNPOPULAR.  I TOOK 
THIS PRECIOUS THING.  THIS 

00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:42.803
FASHION DESIGN DEPARTMENT THAT 
HADN'T CHANGED IN 52 YEARS AND 

00:17:48.553 --> 00:17:50.553
TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN.  MY

00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.104
 PREDECESSORS WERE KEEPERS OF 
THE LINE.  AND MY PRODUCER HEARD

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:04.350
 A LOT ABOUT ME.  YOU SHOULD GO 
TALK TO HIM.  HE MADE A LOT OF 

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:08.283
CHANGES.  ENDS WERE VERY GOOD.  
AND MAYBE HE CAN HELP YOU WITH 

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:11.309
THIS PROJECT.  SO THEY CALLED 
ME.  AND I SAID -- I'LL TELL YOU

00:18:11.604 --> 00:18:16.673
 EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.  FASHION 
REALITY?  THIS INDUSTRY HAS 

00:18:19.058 --> 00:18:22.080
ENOUGH TROUBLE WITHOUT THAT.  SO
 THEY ASKED IF THEY CAN COME 

00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:26.099
MEET WITH ME.  AND OF COURSE, I 
GOOGLED THEM.  AND I FOUND OUT 

00:18:26.929 --> 00:18:30.122
THEY WERE THE PRODUCERS OF 
PROJECT GREEN LIGHT WHICH HAS A 

00:18:30.589 --> 00:18:32.930
LOT OF INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE.  
AND THEY MET WITH ME.  AND I 

00:18:33.242 --> 00:18:35.911
BECAME VERY EXCITED.  THEY 
WANTED TO WORK WITH REAL FASHION

00:18:37.498 --> 00:18:40.533
 DESIGNERS AND IT SOUNDED 
INTERESTING.  IT SOUNDED 

00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:44.112
INTERESTING AND FUN.  BUT THEY 
ASKED ME A QUESTION THAT I KNEW 

00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:49.024
WAS "THE QUESTION" SO TO SPEAK. 
AND IT WAS THE FOLLOWING.  HOW 

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.487
WOULD YOU RESPOND IF WE WERE TO 
TELL YOU THAT WE WANT THE 

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:56.109
DESIGNERS TO CREATE A WEDDING 
DRESS IN TWO DAYS?  COMPARED TO 

00:18:56.357 --> 00:18:59.467
PROJECT RUNWAY TODAY, TWO DAYS 
SOUNDS LIKE AN ETERNITY.  AND I 

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.900
MEAN, I COME FROM THE

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:08.198
 ACADEMIC WORLD.  AND WE HAVE 
ARCHITECTURE WHERE YOU GET A 

00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:11.697
PROJECT ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
CRITIQUING IT ON SUNDAY.  AND IN

00:19:11.698 --> 00:19:16.121
 FACT, WE'LL HAVE TO CREATE A 
WEDDING DRESS IN TWO DAYS.  IT 

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:20.093
CAN BE DONE.  
WELL, IT CAN BE DONE.  IT'S NOT 

00:19:20.223 --> 00:19:22.223
GOING TO BE AN 

00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:33.100
OSCAR LAUREN OR A VERA WANG 
GOWN, BUT IT WILL BE A SHIP 

00:19:33.101 --> 00:19:37.250
WITHOUT SLEEVES.  ACTUALLY A 
COLUMN WITHOUT SLEEVES.  AND 

00:19:37.475 --> 00:19:42.816
THEN I DIDN'T HEAR FROM THEM FOR
 WEEKS.  AND I THOUGHT WELL, 

00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:45.918
THAT WAS INTERESTING.  AND I WAS
 THEIR CONSULTANT UP UNTIL TWO 

00:19:46.246 --> 00:19:48.876
DAYS BEFORE THE DESIGNERS 
ARRIVED.  IN A WAY, I'M STILL 

00:19:49.285 --> 00:19:53.198
THEIR CONSULTANT.  BUT TWO DAYS 
BEFORE THE DESIGNERS ARRIVED, 

00:19:53.537 --> 00:19:58.716
THEY ASKED ME IF I WOULD GO INTO
 THE WORK ROOM AND PUMBLE THE 

00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:01.657
DESIGNERS WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  AND I 

00:20:02.388 --> 00:20:07.200
THOUGHT, THAT'S HOW I SPENT MOST
 OF MY LIFE.  SURE.  I TOLD YOU 

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.813
BACK STAGE, I NEVER DREAMED OF 
BEING THE CUT OF THE SHOW.  I 

00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:13.806
THOUGHT AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE
 DESIGNERS RESPONDING TO ME, NO 

00:20:14.208 --> 00:20:17.833
ONE NEEDS TO HEAR MY VOICE.  NO 
ONE NEEDS TO SEE ME.  AND FOR 

00:20:17.948 --> 00:20:21.587
THAT REASON, I DIDN'T GO TO THE 
PREMIERE PARTY.  WELL, IF I'M IN

00:20:21.707 --> 00:20:25.116
 THE SHOW.  WHAT WILL I LOOK 
LIKE AND SOUND LIKE?  AND IF I'M

00:20:25.247 --> 00:20:34.177
 NOT IN THE SHOW, I WILL BE KIND
 OF HUMILIATED.  SO I WATCHED 

00:20:34.178 --> 00:20:37.869
THE PREMIERE ON TELEVISION.  I 
WATCHED IT, THE SAME WAY THAT I 

00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:43.439
USED TO WATCH "THE WIZARD OF OZ"
 WHERE I WAS IN BED PEEKING OUT 

00:20:43.847 --> 00:20:48.888
FROM BEHIND MY SHEETS.  I HADN'T
 SEEN ANYTHING IN ADVANCE.  I 

00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:51.054
THOUGHT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW.  MAYBE 

00:20:51.248 --> 00:20:53.248
IT'S SEXUAL 

00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:58.984
ESCAPADES IN THE APARTMENT.  I 
HAVE NO IDEA.  AND THE FIRST 

00:20:58.985 --> 00:21:02.285
FIVE AS SOON AS OF THE SHOW WE 
WERE ON BRAVO AND DURING THE 

00:21:02.286 --> 00:21:04.397
TAPING OF THE FIRST SEASON, 
THERE WAS A WOMAN STANDING NEXT 

00:21:04.834 --> 00:21:11.269
TO ME IN THE DARKNESS OF THE 
BACK OF THE PARSONS AUDITORIUM 

00:21:11.432 --> 00:21:15.538
WHERE WE FILMED THE RUNWAY SHOW 
WITH THE DESIGNERS AND THE 

00:21:15.539 --> 00:21:18.626
JUDGE'S DELIBERATION.  AND WE 
WERE WATCHING THE JUDGE'S 

00:21:18.985 --> 00:21:22.524
DELIBERATION.  AND THIS PERSON, 
UNKNOWN TO ME, TURNED TO ME AND 

00:21:22.743 --> 00:21:28.612
ASKED, WHO IS GOING TO WANT TO 
WATCH THIS?  AND THE PERSON WAS 

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:36.660
THE PRESIDENT OF BRAVO.  
[LAUGHTER].  SO WHO KNEW?  I 

00:21:36.916 --> 00:21:42.389
MEAN, AND ALSO AT AGE 50, I HAD 
AN ENTIRELY NEW THRESHOLD TO MY 

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:48.454
LIFE.  I MEAN, IT WAS 
PHENOMENAL.  AND I HAD A VERY 

00:21:49.251 --> 00:21:54.244
HAPPY, VERY REWARDING 
SPIRITUALLY CAREER.  

00:21:54.245 --> 00:21:59.266
SPEAKER:  SO OVER THE COURSE OF 
PROJECT RUNWAY, HOW HAVE YOU 

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.433
CHANGED AS ONE WHO CRITIQUES 
DESIGN AS A TEACHER, AS A 

00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:05.158
MENTOR?  
SPEAKER:  THAT'S AN INTERESTING 

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:09.381
QUESTION.  WELL, ACTUALLY, 
BECOMING A MENTOR WAS VERY 

00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:12.786
CHALLENGING.  IN WAYS THAT I 
DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WOULD.  

00:22:13.176 --> 00:22:16.281
BECAUSE I BECAME AWARE VERY 
QUICKLY THAT I HAD TO TAKE OFF 

00:22:16.618 --> 00:22:23.206
MY TEACHER'S HAT AND ACTUALLY IT
 HAPPENED, EPISODE 1.  SEASON 1 

00:22:24.113 --> 00:22:30.977
EPISODE 1.  I WAS IN THE SEWING 
ROOM THREADING A BOBBIN.  

00:22:30.978 --> 00:22:34.735
BECAUSE ONE OF THE DESIGNERS WAS
 HAVING DIFFICULTY DOING IT.  

00:22:34.879 --> 00:22:39.928
JANE LIPSIT ONE OF THE EXECUTIVE
 PRODUCERS IS KNOCKING BECAUSE 

00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:44.163
SHE HAS A FEED, THERE IS A FEED 
IN EVERY ROOM.  KNOCKING ON THE 

00:22:45.187 --> 00:22:49.670
SEWING ROOM DOOR.  SAYING TIM, 
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU IN THE 

00:22:49.817 --> 00:22:53.281
HALLWAY?  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  
I'M THREADING A BOBBIN.  SHE 

00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:56.329
SAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT.  WHY 
NOT?  BECAUSE IT'S A FAIRNESS 

00:22:56.944 --> 00:23:00.751
ISSUE.  IF YOU THREAD THE BOBBIN
 FOR THAT DESIGNER, YOU HAVE TO 

00:23:01.444 --> 00:23:06.751
THREAD THE BOBBIN FOR ALL OF THE
 DESIGNERS.  AND I SAID I'M OUT 

00:23:07.096 --> 00:23:12.634
OF THE SEWING ROOM AND I'M NOT 
GOING TO BECOME THE BOBBING 

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:16.024
THREADING HAND MAIDEN.  AND I 
ALSO LEARNED DURING THE 

00:23:16.148 --> 00:23:18.177
CRITIQUES -- AND I HAVE BEEN 
LIKE THIS.  THE MENTOR YOU SEE 

00:23:19.062 --> 00:23:22.137
IN THE WORK ROOM IS VERY MUCH 
THE WAY THAT I EVOLVED AS A 

00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:27.300
TEACHER.  BECAUSE IN THE EARLY 
DAYS OF TEACHING, I THINK IT'S 

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.459
SOMEWHAT NATURAL FOR AT LEAST 
NOVICES TO WANT TO MAKE SURE 

00:23:32.596 --> 00:23:41.285
STUDENTS INTO LITTLE MINI ME'S. 
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THE SAME --

00:23:44.615 --> 00:23:47.863
WORK HABITS AND ALL OF THE 
MYRIAD THINGS THAT GO WITH THAT,

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.786
 PUCTUALITY AND BREAK TIME AND 
THE THING THAT I EVOLVED TO WAS,

00:23:56.222 --> 00:24:01.107
 WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?  AND
 HOW WELL ARE YOU SUCCEEDING AT 

00:24:01.595 --> 00:24:04.051
THIS?  WHAT ISSUES ARE YOU 
HAVING?  I DEVELOPED A VERY 

00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:08.318
SOCRATIC APPROACH TO TEACHING.  
HUMBLING PEOPLE WITH QUESTIONS. 

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.934
AND I WILL SAY THIS FOR ANY 
TEACHERS OR WOULD-BE TEACHERS IN

00:24:13.278 --> 00:24:17.382
 THIS ROOM.  AND ANOTHER THING 
THAT I RID MYSELF UP.  THE 

00:24:17.681 --> 00:24:21.937
DEBILITATING THROWING UP PART OF
 IT, FEELING THAT I WAS 

00:24:22.675 --> 00:24:26.860
RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY KERNEL OF 
INFORMATION.  THAT I HAD TO BE 

00:24:26.979 --> 00:24:33.530
THIS VUNDER KENT ANSWER MAN. AND
 IT WAS JUST

00:24:37.665 --> 00:24:40.593
 DEBILITATING.  SO WHAT I 
EVOLVED TO, IF SOMEONE WERE TO 

00:24:40.594 --> 00:24:44.271
ASK A QUESTION, IF A STUDENT 
WERE TO ASK A QUESTION. 

00:24:44.272 --> 00:24:46.272
I WOULD SAY, INTERESTING 
QUESTION.  FOR THE NEXT CLASS, I

00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:51.848
 WANT ALL OF YOU TO RESEARCH 
THIS QUESTION.  AND COME IN WITH

00:24:52.118 --> 00:24:54.118
 AN ANSWER THAT YOU DON'T THINK

00:24:56.868 --> 00:25:00.424
 ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE FOUND.  
SO THEY HAD TO DIG DEEP.  AND 

00:25:00.655 --> 00:25:07.049
THEN WE WOULD SHARE IT ALL.  AND
 IT WAS FANTASTIC.  BECAUSE THE 

00:25:07.275 --> 00:25:11.402
CONVERSATION THAT WOULD EVOLVE 
FROM THAT ONE QUESTION WOULD BE 

00:25:12.013 --> 00:25:17.072
A CATALYST FOR A MILLION OTHER 
THINGS AND WOULD TAKE US INTO A 

00:25:17.383 --> 00:25:22.602
DIRECTION OF A MILLION OTHER 
THINGS, AND WAS A HUGE 

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.815
ENHANCEMENT FOR THE COURSE 
SYLLABUS AND FOR ME TO MOVE INTO

00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:27.396
 THE MENTOR POSITION ON RUNWAY. 

00:25:27.397 --> 00:25:30.435
I WON'T SAY IT WAS EASY.  I WAS 
A NERVOUS WRECK.  I WAS 

00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:34.001
ESPECIALLY A NERVOUS WRECK IF 
HEIDI WAS EVER AROUND.  MY PALMS

00:25:34.128 --> 00:25:40.156
 WOULD SWEAT.  SHE IS VERY -- I 
MEAN SHE IS A LOVELY FANTASTIC 

00:25:41.244 --> 00:25:46.248
PERSON WHO I LOVE DEARLY.  BUT 
SHE IS HEIDI KLUM. 

00:25:46.249 --> 00:25:50.457
SPEAKER:  YEAH.  THAT CAN BE 
VERY INTIMIDATNG I'M SURE.  

00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:53.431
SPEAKER:  BUT IT WAS A JOURNEY. 
SPEAKER:  RIGHT.  

00:25:53.432 --> 00:25:55.432
SPEAKER:  AND ONE THAT I REALLY 
LOVED.  

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:02.293
SPEAKER:  SO WHAT IS IT LIKE 
ACTUALLY DOING PROJECT RUNWAY?  

00:26:02.465 --> 00:26:04.331
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO DO 
IT?  

00:26:04.332 --> 00:26:09.273
SPEAKER:  WELL WE DO THE BULK OF
 IT WHICH CONSISTS OF 12 

00:26:12.485 --> 00:26:16.465
CHALLENGES IN 31 DAYS.  WE HAVE 
NO BREAKS.  SOMETIMES 18 HOUR, 

00:26:16.687 --> 00:26:21.185
SOMETIMES 20 HOUR DAYS.  I LOVE 
PROJECT RUNWAY JUNIOR.  WE HAVE 

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:26.997
TO ABIDE BY THE CHILD LABOR 
LAWS.  IT'S

00:26:30.211 --> 00:26:33.834
 LIKE A VACATION.  
IT'S SO WONDERFUL.  THE DAY ENDS

00:26:34.111 --> 00:26:36.435
 AND EVERYONE IS OFF THE CLOCK. 

00:26:36.436 --> 00:26:40.891
FOR RUNWAY, IF IT'S DECIDED THAT
 THE WORK ROOM IS GOING TO NOT 

00:26:41.021 --> 00:26:45.224
CLOSE AT 12:00 AND WE STAY OPEN 
UNTIL 2:00, WE SHARE IT WITH THE

00:26:45.973 --> 00:26:48.219
 AUDIENCE.  WE NEVER 
MISREPRESENT THINGS.  AND THEN 

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.495
I'M THERE UNTIL 2:00.  IT'S 
FINE.  IT'S A HIGH CLASS 

00:26:52.617 --> 00:26:58.365
PROBLEM.  THE LONG DAYS.  AND I 
WILL SAY, IT GETS TO ALL OF US. 

00:26:59.105 --> 00:27:03.737
 I MEAN, IT'S A CUMULATIVE 
EXHAUSTION.  

00:27:03.738 --> 00:27:07.363
MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY, 
CREATIVELY.  IT GETS TO US.  BUT

00:27:07.598 --> 00:27:12.003
 I WOULDN'T NOT DO IT.  AND IT'S
 FOR BUDGET REASONS THAT WE DO 

00:27:12.004 --> 00:27:14.503
IT IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF 
TIME. 

00:27:14.504 --> 00:27:18.807
AND THERE IS A HIATUS.  AND I DO
 THE HOME VISIT WHICH IS 10 DAYS

00:27:19.127 --> 00:27:24.064
 INCLUDING TRAVEL.  AND THEN 
THERE IS ANOTHER VERY SMALL 

00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:27.710
HIATUS AND THEN WE HAVE FASHION 
WEEK.  WHICH TAKES US FIVE DAYS 

00:27:27.835 --> 00:27:30.007
BEGINNING TO END.  
SPEAKER:  WONDERFUL.  WELL, ONE 

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:33.632
OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE HERE 
IS TO CELEBRATE DISCO.  THE 

00:27:33.778 --> 00:27:38.674
WHOLE DISCO ERA AND WE'RE BOTH 
PRODUCTS OF THAT ERA.  

00:27:38.675 --> 00:27:41.388
SPEAKER:  REGRETTABLY.  
SPEAKER:  WHAT DO YOU THINK 

00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:45.541
DEFINES DISCO IN TERMS OF 
FASHION?  

00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:50.651
SPEAKER:  WELL, I WANT TO GIVE 
IT A BIT OF A CONTEXT.  WE'RE 

00:27:50.772 --> 00:27:55.017
COMING OUT OF THE 1960S, WHICH 
WAS IN MY VIEW, THE MOST 

00:27:55.387 --> 00:27:58.946
REVOLUTIONARY DECADE IN FASHION 
EVER.  I MEAN, WE USHERED IN 

00:27:59.102 --> 00:28:02.140
WITH MAD MEN PRIMNUS AND

00:28:07.003 --> 00:28:13.967
 BUTTONED UPNESS FOR MEN.  AND 
WE USHER IT OUT WITH HIPPIES.  

00:28:13.968 --> 00:28:19.556
AND WE HAVE THE CLEAR VINYL 
DRESS COURTESY OF YSL.  WE HAVE 

00:28:19.557 --> 00:28:25.087
THE PAPER DRESS.  THAT'S WHY 
TODAY, ESPECIALLY THOSE, OH, GOD

00:28:25.227 --> 00:28:30.068
 THOSE HORRIBLE KARDASHIANS 
RUNNING AROUND.  [LAUGHTER]. 

00:28:36.151 --> 00:28:38.151
 I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.  THE 
ONLY

00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:49.937
 THING THAT MAKES ME RISE MORE 
IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WHITE 

00:28:50.117 --> 00:28:57.672
HOUSE.  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].  
BUT TRULY, AFTER THE '60S, 

00:28:58.835 --> 00:29:02.082
FASHION WISE, I'M PRETTY 
UNSHOCKABLE.  SO WE HAVE THIS 

00:29:06.762 --> 00:29:12.853
TERM OIL.  WE ENTER INTO THE 
'70S AND THERE ARE CERTAIN 

00:29:13.136 --> 00:29:17.674
ASPECTS OF IT BROAD MEN.  WE HAD
 A PEACOCK MOMENT OF MEN IN THE 

00:29:18.802 --> 00:29:22.181
'60S WITH EXTRAVAGANT DRESS AND 
MELTED BEAUTIFULLY INTO THE 

00:29:27.514 --> 00:29:31.551
WHOLE DISCO MOVEMENT.  WE HAD A 
KIND OF BODY AWARENESS WITH 

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.086
WOMEN.  WHERE VERY LITTLE WAS 
LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION.  AND 

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:39.708
THAT CERTAINLY SEGUED VERY 
BEAUTIFULLY INTO DISCO. IT WAS A

00:29:40.714 --> 00:29:46.774
 TIME OF FLAMBOYANCE.  IT WAS A 
TIME OF DIFFERENTIATION AND 

00:29:47.001 --> 00:29:51.027
EVERYONE WANTED TO STAND OUT.  I
 AM ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE 

00:29:51.728 --> 00:29:55.896
CLOTHES, THE CLOTHES WE WEAR 
SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT HOW THE 

00:29:56.312 --> 00:30:00.951
WORLD PERCEIVES US.  YOU WANTED 
TO BE DISTINCTIVE AND DIFFERENT 

00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:05.242
ON THAT DISCO DANCE FLOOR.  IT 
WAS REALLY A GIANT RUNWAY OF 

00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:12.212
SORTS.  AND IT WAS SEXUALLY 
CHARGED.  SOCIOLOGICALLY 

00:30:12.341 --> 00:30:16.152
CHARGED.  IDENTITY CHARGED.  
THERE WERE GENDER-BENDING 

00:30:16.327 --> 00:30:21.842
ASPECTS TO DISCO CULTURE.  AND 
WE SEE THE RISE OF CERTAIN 

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.438
DESIGNERS IN THAT PERIOD WHO 
ALSO WERE 

00:30:30.575 --> 00:30:35.229
INEXTRICABLE FROM THE MOVEMENT. 
 HOLTSTON BEING THE MOST 

00:30:36.005 --> 00:30:40.983
PROMINENT, WORKING WITH JERSEY 
WHO HAD STRETCHED.  HOW CRAZY 

00:30:40.984 --> 00:30:46.109
WOULD IT BE WEARING HOLTSTON ON 
THE DANCE FLOOR.  

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.110
DIANNE VON 

00:30:52.377 --> 00:30:59.724
FURSTENBURG ANOTHER, NORMA 
CANOLLI, ICONIC IN THE '70S AND 

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:05.444
ENTRENCHED IN DISCO CULTURE.  IT
 WAS A PHENOMENAL TIME.  AND 

00:31:05.445 --> 00:31:09.253
IT'S DEBATABLE, AND ARGUABLE.  
BUT MANY PEOPLE SAY 

00:31:13.025 --> 00:31:18.125
THAT DISCO CULTURE CAME OUT OF A
 GAY SUBCULTURE.  AND I BELIEVE 

00:31:18.258 --> 00:31:25.393
THAT.  IN MANY WAYS IT DID.  AND
 COINCIDENTALLY, I AM SURE MANY 

00:31:25.732 --> 00:31:30.120
OF YOU ARE ENTIRELY TOO YOUNG TO
 HAVE ANY AWARENESS OF THIS.  IN

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:39.684
 SOME WAYS I THINK YOU SHOULD.  
IN 1973 HOMO SEXUALITY WAS 

00:31:39.836 --> 00:31:42.466
REMOVED FROM THE LIST OF 
PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS BY THE 

00:31:42.588 --> 00:31:46.038
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.  
SO SUDDENLY YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO 

00:31:46.373 --> 00:31:48.539
WORRY ABOUT BEING OUT.  BECAUSE 
PRIOR TO THAT, TO YOU CAN BE 

00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:50.866
LOCKED UP.  I 

00:31:54.203 --> 00:31:59.347
MEAN, LEGALLY.  SO THIS 
SUBCULTURE COULD EMERGE AND 

00:31:59.348 --> 00:32:02.823
BECOME -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY 
MAIN STREAM.  BUT ACTUALLY 

00:32:03.052 --> 00:32:06.618
EMBRACED BY THE MAIN STREAM.  I 
MEAN, THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT 

00:32:07.037 --> 00:32:10.045
DISCO CULTURE, IT WAS ALL 
INCLUSIVE.  IT DIDN'T CARE WHERE

00:32:10.164 --> 00:32:16.120
 YOU CAME FROM, WHO YOU WERE, 
WHAT YOUR IDENTITY WAS, WHAT 

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:21.900
RACE YOU WERE.  IT EMBRACED 
EVERYBODY.  AND IT WAS -- 

00:32:21.901 --> 00:32:25.147
ACTUALLY I DID A LITTLE BIT OF 
RESEARCH IN IF ANTICIPATION OF 

00:32:25.304 --> 00:32:28.799
OUR INTERVIEW.  I THOUGHT, WHAT 
DO I REALLY KNOW ABOUT THIS?  I 

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:35.446
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT BY 1978 IN 
THIS COUNTRY ALONE, THERE WERE 

00:32:37.131 --> 00:32:39.843
10,000 DISCO TECHS.  
SPEAKER:  OH, I HAD NO IDEA.  

00:32:39.983 --> 00:32:41.517
SPEAKER:  THAT'S A STAGGERING 
NUMBER.  

00:32:41.518 --> 00:32:44.438
SPEAKER:  IT IS.  
SPEAKER:  AND OF COURSE THE 

00:32:44.911 --> 00:32:49.480
GRAND PUBA OF THEM ALL WAS 
STUDIO 54. 

00:32:49.481 --> 00:32:54.045
SPEAKER:  YEAH.  AMAZING.  SO 
FROM THIS PERIOD, DO YOU HAVE 

00:32:54.424 --> 00:32:59.998
ANY KIND OF YOUR OWN FASHION 
RECOLLECTION?  THINGS THAT YOU 

00:33:01.303 --> 00:33:07.231
WERE WEARING?  IS THERE ANYTHING
 IN YOUR CLOSET THAT YOU WANT TO

00:33:07.499 --> 00:33:15.129
 TELL US ABOUT?  [LAUGHTER].  
SPEAKER:  YOU KNOW, I HAVE THIS 

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:20.845
THEORY CALLED THE MONKEY HOUSE 
AT THE ZOO.  AND IT IS THE 

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:25.533
FOLLOWING.  WHEN YOU FIRST WALK 
INTO THE MONKEY HOUSE, YOU 

00:33:28.916 --> 00:33:33.368
SHRIEK THIS PLACE STINKS.  AND 
AFTER 20 MINUTES YOU SAY, THIS 

00:33:33.482 --> 00:33:39.840
DOESN'T SMELL SO BAD.  AND AFTER
 30 MINUTES, YOU THINK, WHAT 

00:33:39.992 --> 00:33:42.983
SMELL?  BUT ANYONE NEW WALKING 
IN SAYS THIS PLACE STINKS.  THAT

00:33:43.363 --> 00:33:52.387
 WAS MY '70S FASHION.  I PUT ON 
THE POLYESTER PANTS AND THE 

00:33:52.522 --> 00:33:56.729
FLORAL SHIRT AND I THOUGHT THIS 
IS UNACCEPTABLE AND ATROCIOUS.  

00:33:56.841 --> 00:34:04.176
AND AFTER 20 MINUTES, I THOUGHT 
YOU KNOW, I LOOK KIND OF HIP.  

00:34:04.413 --> 00:34:10.430
AND AFTER 30 MINUTES, I THOUGHT,
 OKAY, I CAN LEAVE MY APARTMENT 

00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:16.563
NOW.  BUT LOOKING BACK AT IT, 
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?  

00:34:16.564 --> 00:34:20.050
SPEAKER:  RIGHT.  WELL, TIM, I 
WENT INTO MY CLOSET.  

00:34:20.051 --> 00:34:25.792
SPEAKER:  WHAT DID YOU FIND?  
SPEAKER:  [LAUGHTER].  

00:34:25.793 --> 00:34:27.793
SPEAKER:  ROBERT YOU STILL HAVE 
THEM?  ARE YOU WAITING FOR THE 

00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:29.861
RETURN?  
SPEAKER:  I WISH I CAN GET MY

00:34:33.041 --> 00:34:38.297
 FOOT IN THEM.  1977, I BOUGHT 
THESE IN PARIS.  I WAS STUDYING 

00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:41.328
IN FRANCE.  YES, I THOUGHT I WAS
 THE COOLEST THING THAT EVER HIT

00:34:41.481 --> 00:34:43.177
 THE EARTH.  
SPEAKER:  WELL, YOU WERE. 

00:34:43.178 --> 00:34:45.205
SPEAKER:  SO WHY DO I STILL HAVE
 THESE?  

00:34:45.206 --> 00:34:49.484
SPEAKER:  WHY DO YOU?  
SPEAKER:  I HAVE NO IDEA.  

00:34:49.485 --> 00:34:51.485
[CHEERS AND

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.153
 APPLAUSE].  
SPEAKER:  THAT IS HILARIOUS.  

00:34:57.333 --> 00:35:01.628
ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK GOD FOR 
TINY NEW YORK APARTMENTS.  

00:35:01.629 --> 00:35:10.750
BECAUSE UNLESS I RESIGN MYSELF 
TO BEING A HOARDER, I GET

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:15.426
 RID OF THINGS.  THAT'S 
EXTRAORDINARY.  

00:35:15.427 --> 00:35:17.562
SPEAKER:  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
 YOU WERE TELLING ME BACK STAGE,

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:20.800
 BACK IN YOUR CAREER THAT 
SURPRISED ME WAS THAT YOU HAVE 

00:35:20.974 --> 00:35:24.158
TO HAVE YOUR OWN WARDROBE.  
SPEAKER:  OH, I DO.  I SUPPLY 

00:35:24.916 --> 00:35:27.446
EVERYTHING.  
SPEAKER:  I THOUGHT YOU WERE 

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.550
JUST SITTING BACK, AND PEOPLE 
WERE HOLDING UP OUTFITS.  

00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:35.874
SPEAKER:  NO.  BUT YOU JUST 
TRIGGERED A STORY THOUGH THAT 

00:35:36.188 --> 00:35:41.049
HAS LEFT MY MIND.  YEAR ONE OF 
PROJECT RUNWAY, IT'S 2004, 

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.754
BANANA REPUBLIC WAS ONE OF THE 
SPONSORS OF THE SHOW.  IN FACT, 

00:35:45.264 --> 00:35:50.655
WE HAD THE BANANA REPUBLIC 
CHALLENGE FIRST TWO YEARS.  AND 

00:35:50.959 --> 00:35:55.330
THEY WERE GOING TO WARDROBE ME. 
OUTFIT ME.  AND COINCIDENTALLY, 

00:35:55.454 --> 00:36:01.074
I WAS A BIG BANANA REPUBLIC FAN.
AND DIANNE VON 

00:36:04.513 --> 00:36:07.343
FURSTENBURG SAID ARE YOU GOING 
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.  I 

00:36:07.344 --> 00:36:11.528
WENT TO SAKS AND FOUND A BLAZER 
THAT I TRULY LOVED.  IT WAS 

00:36:11.863 --> 00:36:16.651
EXPENSIVE.  AND THEN I WALKED 
ACROSS THE STREET TO THE BANANA 

00:36:16.652 --> 00:36:20.629
REPUBLIC OF FLAGSHIP ACROSS THE 
STREET BY ROCKEFELLER CENTER.  I

00:36:20.747 --> 00:36:25.448
 REMEMBER BANANA REPUBLIC BEING 
KHAKIS, AND GOING INTO THE 

00:36:25.695 --> 00:36:29.711
AMAZON.  AND I FOUND THE 
IDENTICAL JACKET MORE OR LESS 

00:36:29.712 --> 00:36:36.719
FOR 25 -- FOR 75 PERCENT LESS.  
IT WAS A MERE 25 PERCENT OF THE 

00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:41.347
PRICE.  I BOUGHT IT.  AND TOOK 
THE JACKET BACK TO SAKS.  AND I 

00:36:41.348 --> 00:36:44.188
DISCOVERED THE WORLD OF BANANA 
REPUBLIC.  AND I HAD A LOT OF 

00:36:44.189 --> 00:36:47.190
THE CLOTHES.  AND I WAS 
THRILLED.  I WAS GOING TO GET 

00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:49.655
NEW STUFF AND THEY WERE 
ANTICIPATING WHEN THE STUFF 

00:36:50.169 --> 00:36:53.689
WOULD BE AIRED, IT WOULD BE NEW 
FALL CLOTHES.  AT ANY RATE, 

00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:56.089
NOTHING CAME.  NOTHING CAME.  

00:36:59.409 --> 00:37:03.811
NOTHING CAME.  SO THEN, SOME 
CALLS WERE MADE, AND CLOTHES DID

00:37:04.164 --> 00:37:12.355
 ARRIVE TAPED TO A BICYCLE 
MESSENGER'S BIKE, A BAG OF 

00:37:13.578 --> 00:37:17.731
BANANA REPUBLIC CLOTHES.  I WAS 
WEARING BANANA REPUBLIC CLOTHES 

00:37:18.114 --> 00:37:20.424
EVERY DAY.  BUT IT WAS MY BANANA

00:37:23.465 --> 00:37:25.248
 REPUBLIC CLOTHES.  NOT THEIRS. 

00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:28.140
SO I GOT A STEAMER.  AND WORKED 
ITSELF OUT.  AND AT THE END OF 

00:37:28.276 --> 00:37:31.134
THE SEASON, THEY WANTED 
EVERYTHING BACK INCLUDING THE 

00:37:32.034 --> 00:37:34.462
SOCKS.  SO I DRY CLEANED 
EVERYTHING.  AND I HAD MADE 

00:37:34.615 --> 00:37:36.615
CERTAIN ALL OF THE SOCKS WERE

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:44.928
 LAUNDERED AND I WAS THEN LATER 
ASKED, THIS IS GETTING REALLY 

00:37:45.243 --> 00:37:52.568
TEDIOUS, I'M SORRY EVERYONE.  I 
WAS ASKED, LAUREN DAVID PENEN 

00:37:52.763 --> 00:37:58.014
WROTE FOR WOMEN'S DAILY AND HAD 
A REGULAR FEATURE OF GIVING 

00:37:58.156 --> 00:38:05.394
SOMEONE 100 DOLLARS AND WHAT 
WOULD YOU BUY?  OH, THERE IS A 

00:38:06.548 --> 00:38:08.528
RAIN COAT ON SALE AT BANANA 
REPUBLIC AND IT'S 100 DOLLARS 

00:38:08.529 --> 00:38:12.024
AND I WILL PAY THE TAX.  AND

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:20.531
 TALKING ABOUT TAKING THE 
CLOTHES BACK.  ALL HELL BROKE 

00:38:20.689 --> 00:38:22.689
LOOSE.  
DON'T TAKE THEM BACK IF YOU 

00:38:22.735 --> 00:38:25.875
DON'T WANT TO TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM.  I WAS 

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.228
FLABBERGASTED.  SEASON TWO, 
BANANA REPUBLIC IS BACK.  AND I 

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:37.173
AM STILL WEARING BANANA 
REPUBLIC.  I'M WEARING THEIR 

00:38:37.305 --> 00:38:42.041
CLOTHES BUT I'M TURNED OFF BY 
THE PUBLIC RELATIONS.  AND THE 

00:38:42.768 --> 00:38:46.273
PEOPLE WITH THE SPONSORS SAY TO 
ME, WE NEED AN INVENTORY OF 

00:38:46.475 --> 00:38:49.790
EVERYTHING YOU WORE THIS SEASON.
WHY?  WE NEED TO CREDIT BANANA 

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:54.831
REPUBLIC WITH IT.  I SAID, WELL 
I'M WEARING BANANA REPUBLIC BUT 

00:38:55.005 --> 00:38:57.790
IT'S ALL MINE.  THE CLOTHES 
NEVER CAME.  AND THEY DIDN'T.  

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:04.849
ONCE AGAIN, ALL HELL BROKE 
LOOSE.  I MEAN, I LOVE BEING I A

00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:10.306
 TRUTH TELLER.  BUT IT DOES 
CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS.  I AM 

00:39:10.307 --> 00:39:13.947
RESPONSIBLE FOR MY WARDROBE.  
AND I TAKE THAT ROLE VERY 

00:39:14.145 --> 00:39:17.750
SERIOUSLY.  AND IT MEANS THAT I 
NEED TO GET NEW THINGS EVERY 

00:39:18.087 --> 00:39:22.601
YEAR.  AND I TAKE A LOT OF 
THINGS TO GOOD WILL AND HOUSING 

00:39:22.602 --> 00:39:25.572
WORKS BECAUSE I HAVE SMALL NEW 
YORK CLOSETS AND IF ANYONE IS 

00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:29.076
WONDERING, NO, YOU CAN'T WRITE 
THEM OFF IN YOUR TAXES.  ONCE 

00:39:29.077 --> 00:39:32.008
ANYTHING LEAVES THE STUDIO, OF 
COURSE I'M ON THE SUBWAY EVERY 

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:36.730
DAY, SO IT LEAVES THE STUDIO.  I
 DON'T HAVE A DRESSING ROOM.  I 

00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:39.637
DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO CHANGE.  
SO IT'S MINE. 

00:39:39.638 --> 00:39:43.252
BUT THAT ALSO MEANS I CAN DO 
WHAT I WANT WITH IT.  

00:39:43.253 --> 00:39:46.224
SPEAKER:  THAT'S GREAT.  WELL, 
TIM WE'RE GOING TO TURN IN A 

00:39:46.428 --> 00:39:49.214
MOMENT JUST TO SOME QUESTIONS 
FROM THE AUDIENCE.  

00:39:49.215 --> 00:39:53.369
SPEAKER:  OH, THRILLING.  
SPEAKER:  IT WILL BE FUN.  BUT I

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.942
 HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS THAT 
EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS TO KNOW. 

00:39:58.144 --> 00:40:03.042
AND I MUST GIVE THEM TO YOU NOW.
SPEAKER:  UH-OH. 

00:40:03.043 --> 00:40:06.753
SPEAKER:  THE FIRST IS, DO YOU 
HAVE A TATTOO?  

00:40:06.754 --> 00:40:11.688
SPEAKER:  YOU KNOW, IT'S 
SOMETHING I FANTASIZE ABOUT.  

00:40:11.975 --> 00:40:18.561
AND AT THE MOMENT, NO.  BECAUSE 
I HAVE A SERIOUS ADVERSION TO 

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:23.727
PAIN.  BUT IF I WAS TO EVER GET 
A TATTOO, AND HONEST TRUTH, I 

00:40:23.846 --> 00:40:27.160
HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES, IT 
WOULD BE MY LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 

00:40:27.288 --> 00:40:32.198
CATALOG NUMBER.  ONE OF THEM.  
SPEAKER:  BRAVO.  [CHEERS AND 

00:40:40.924 --> 00:40:45.551
APPLAUSE].  ALSO, IN A WAY, WHEN
 YOU THINK ABOUT TATTOOS, AND I 

00:40:46.307 --> 00:40:49.819
MEAN THIS WITH ALL RESPECT, 
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S AN 

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:53.255
ANTEDOTE.  THIS IS GREAT.  
SPEAKER:  IT'S WONDERFUL.  WE'RE

00:40:53.256 --> 00:40:55.882
 GOING TO GO PLACES WITH THAT.  
I'M NOT SURE HOW YET.  BUT WE'RE

00:40:56.746 --> 00:41:01.103
 GOING TO GO THERE.  ACTUALLY 
JUST TWO MORE THINGS.  COULD YOU

00:41:01.213 --> 00:41:03.743
 GIVE US ANY DISH ON YOUR 

00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:09.727
CO-STARS?  
SPEAKER:  COULD I? 

00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:19.976
 LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.  HEIDI 
IS A DOLL.  

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:24.230
THERE ISN'T A DEVIOUS BONE IN 
HER BODY.  AND ALL YOU NEED TO 

00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:32.151
KNOW IS THAT CREW MEMBERS ADORE 
HER.  THEY DO NOT SEPARATE.  AND

00:41:38.119 --> 00:41:41.025
 THEN THERE ARE THE OTHER TWO.  
I HAVE TO INTERACT WITH THEM 

00:41:41.026 --> 00:41:43.594
SINCE SEASON 12.  I HAVE HAD TO 
SIT WITH THEM

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.466
 FOR THE RUNWAY SHOW.  
I'M TELLING YOU, COMING DOWN THE

00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:52.598
 RUNWAY.  WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE 
LOOKING AT IT.  AND FOR ME, YOU 

00:41:52.803 --> 00:41:55.152
CAN SAY, YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT 
THE WORK IS.  NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN

00:41:55.309 --> 00:42:00.211
 IT WALK.  I HAVEN'T SEEN IT ON 
MODELS.  I HAVEN'T SEEN HOW THE 

00:42:00.348 --> 00:42:02.592
PROPORTIONS WORK WITH THE 
PROPORTIONS OF THE BODY.  I 

00:42:02.734 --> 00:42:05.997
HAVEN'T SEEN IT WALK.  AND THE 
JUDGES HAVEN'T SEEN IT AT ALL.  

00:42:06.116 --> 00:42:08.996
AT LEAST I SAW IT IN THE WORK 
ROOM.  I WILL BE SITTING THERE 

00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:15.112
STUDYING THE SHOW AND NINA WILL 
LEAN OVER AND ASK, SO HOW IS 

00:42:15.237 --> 00:42:17.237
YOUR 

00:42:19.038 --> 00:42:23.493
SUMMER?  LOOK AT THE SHOW. 
I USED TO SAY, BEFORE I 

00:42:23.766 --> 00:42:26.225
INTERACTED WITH THEM, THAT I 
WOULD SAY HELLO TO THE JUDGES 

00:42:26.427 --> 00:42:29.575
WHEN THEY ARRIVED.  BUT I 
FREQUENTLY DIDN'T SAY GOOD BYE 

00:42:30.086 --> 00:42:34.421
BECAUSE I WAS MAD.  SO I STILL 
DON'T SAY GOOD BYE.  BUT I DO 

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.273
SAY HELLO. 
SPEAKER:  THAT'S GOOD.  WELL MY 

00:42:37.573 --> 00:42:41.407
LAST QUESTION IS REALLY ON THE 
SERIOUS SIDE.  MANY OF US ARE 

00:42:43.805 --> 00:42:51.337
FAMILIAR WITH YOUR VERY MOVING 
VIDEO ON THE IT GETS BETTER 

00:42:51.738 --> 00:42:54.375
PROJECT.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  

00:42:54.376 --> 00:42:58.604
SPEAKER:  BEAUTIFUL.  
[APPLAUSE].  AND YOU HAVE DONE 

00:42:58.855 --> 00:43:02.873
SO MUCH WORK CHANTING PREVENTION
 OF TEEN SUICIDE.  AND HOW DO 

00:43:02.874 --> 00:43:05.663
YOU MANAGE ALL OF THE CHARITABLE
 WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING WITH 

00:43:05.664 --> 00:43:09.412
THIS VERY DEMANDING PROFESSION? 

00:43:09.413 --> 00:43:11.955
SPEAKER:  WELL, I CONSIDER IT A 
RESPONSIBILITY.  YOU JUST HAVE 

00:43:12.491 --> 00:43:18.469
TO MAKE TIME FOR IT.  IT'S VERY,
 VERY IMPORTANT TO GIVE BACK.  

00:43:18.876 --> 00:43:21.794
AND HAVING SPENT MOST OF MY 
LIFE, WELL ALL OF MY LIFE REALLY

00:43:22.593 --> 00:43:26.780
 WITH YOUNG PEOPLE, WITH 
ESPECIALLY STUDENTS AND

00:43:30.332 --> 00:43:35.981
 KNOWING HOW PAINFUL NAVIGATING 
THE WORLD CAN BE.  AND GROWING 

00:43:35.982 --> 00:43:41.203
UP CAN BE. 
I'M A SQUISH.  I MEAN, I HAVE A 

00:43:42.802 --> 00:43:47.841
SOFT SPOT FOR THAT KIND OF PAIN 
AND ANGUISH.  I THOUGHT I WOULD 

00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:53.395
NEVER BE DELIVERED FROM IT.  AND
 TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO PEOPLE, 

00:43:53.842 --> 00:43:58.288
INDIVIDUALS, IT REALLY DOES GET 
BETTER.  BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS 

00:43:58.432 --> 00:44:01.101
TOO TO EVERYONE.  LIFE IS A 
COLLABORATION.  WE DO NOT DO 

00:44:01.276 --> 00:44:05.488
THINGS ALONE.  AND WE CERTAINLY 
DON'T GET BETTER ALONE.  AND I 

00:44:05.605 --> 00:44:10.445
HAD -- I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE -- I 
DIDN'T THINK I WAS LUCKY AT THE 

00:44:10.569 --> 00:44:13.738
TIME.  I THOUGHT IT WAS 
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  I WAS 

00:44:13.965 --> 00:44:17.744
LUCKY TO HAVE AN INTERVENTION BY
 AN INCREDIBLE DOCTOR WHO 

00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:20.339
WOULDN'T PUT UP WITH MY 
NONSENSE.  HE SAVED ME.  AND 

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:24.707
STOOD BY ME.  I'M FOREVER 
GRATEFUL.  

00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:27.488
SPEAKER:  THANK GOD.  SO THANK 
YOU.  I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO 

00:44:27.693 --> 00:44:29.149
TURN TO SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE 
AUDIENCE.  

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:33.222
SPEAKER:  I LOVE IT.  
SPEAKER:  OUR STAFF HAS 

00:44:33.356 --> 00:44:36.102
MICROPHONES AND IT'S KIND OF 
BRIGHT UP HERE.  ANY QUESTIONS, 

00:44:36.224 --> 00:44:43.506
COME UP.  HERE WE GO.  READY FOR
 OUR CLOSE UPS.  WE HAVE A 

00:44:43.923 --> 00:44:45.923
QUESTION.  
SPEAKER:  I JUST WANT TO SAY, 

00:44:46.042 --> 00:44:52.061
YOU'RE A FABULOUS LOOKING 
AUDIENCE.  [APPLAUSE].  I AM SO 

00:44:52.393 --> 00:44:56.271
GLAD THE LIGHTS WENT UP.  WHERE 
IS OUR QUESTION?  

00:44:56.272 --> 00:44:59.119
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  HI.  YOU HAVE 
I THINK THE BEST WASHINGTON, 

00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:04.482
D.C. STORY I HAVE EVER HEARD.  I
 WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN TELL 

00:45:04.483 --> 00:45:09.051
US AGAIN ABOUT VIVIAN VINCE.  
SPEAKER:  YES, MY FATHER WAS AN 

00:45:10.196 --> 00:45:15.726
FBI AGENT FOR 26 YEARS.  AND HE 
WAS IN A FIELD OFFICE IN NEWARK,

00:45:15.861 --> 00:45:19.448
 NEW JERSEY OF ALL PLACES FOR 
THREE OF THOSE YEARS AND THEN 

00:45:19.578 --> 00:45:23.958
WAS MOVED TO HEADQUARTERS.  AND 
MY FATHER WAS A VERY TALENTED 

00:45:24.999 --> 00:45:31.353
WRITER AND ENDED UP BEING 
HOOVER'S GHOST WRITER AND SPEECH

00:45:31.692 --> 00:45:35.225
 WRITER AND TOOK CARE OF ALL OF 
THE CORRESPONDENTS AND MY SISTER

00:45:35.353 --> 00:45:38.709
 AND I WOULD FIST THE FBI 
HEADQUARTERS ONCE A YEAR AND 

00:45:38.845 --> 00:45:43.018
TAKE THE FBI TOUR.  IT'S A REAL 
THRILL.  AND IT PROBABLY STILL 

00:45:43.161 --> 00:45:46.621
IS.  AND REMEMBER, THIS IS THE 

00:45:49.818 --> 00:45:56.251
OLD ER DAYS OF HUBERT.  IT WAS 
NOT A PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT. 

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.670
IN FACT, I HAVE A WHOLE 
CONSPIRACY THEORY ABOUT HIS 

00:46:00.018 --> 00:46:05.610
DEATH.  SO THIS ONE PARTICULAR 
DAY MY FATHER SAID TO MY SISTER 

00:46:07.102 --> 00:46:13.116
AND ME, VIVIAN VANCE IS VISITING
 MR. HOOVER.  AND I WAS A HUGE 

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:18.903
"I LOVE LUCY" FAN AND I AM A 
HUGE "I LOVE LUCY" FAN AND WAS 

00:46:19.012 --> 00:46:22.781
LIKE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET 
HER?  OF COURSE.  WHO WOULDN'T. 

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.071
 IT WAS THRILLING.  IT WAS 
BEFORE SELFIES AND LITTLE 

00:46:26.072 --> 00:46:28.575
PORTABLE PHONES AND THINGS OF 
THAT SORT. 

00:46:28.576 --> 00:46:33.218
SO THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION.  
WE MET VIVIAN VANCE.  IT WAS 

00:46:33.603 --> 00:46:40.425
GREAT.  YEARS LATER, MY  FATHER 
HAS PASSED.  ALL OF THE STUFF 

00:46:41.103 --> 00:46:46.453
COMES OUT ABOUT HOOVER BEING A 
CROSS DRESSER.  AND IT WAS 

00:46:46.705 --> 00:46:50.438
THANKSGIVING DINNER AND I TURN 
TO MY SISTER.  AND I SAID 

00:46:50.618 --> 00:46:54.935
REMEMBER THE VISIT TO MR. 
MR. HOOVER'S OFFICE WHERE WE MET

00:46:56.579 --> 00:46:58.846
 VIVIAN VANCE.  AND I SAID, DO 

00:47:02.049 --> 00:47:08.920
YOU THINK IT WAS ODD THAT MR. 
HOOVER WASN'T IN THE OFFICE?

00:47:08.921 --> 00:47:15.085
PUT A CURLY FRIGHT WIG ON MR. 
HOOVER, IT'S MR. MERTZ.  

00:47:15.086 --> 00:47:24.766
WOW.  SO I WROTE ABOUT THIS.  I 
THINK IT WAS IN RULES.  AND THE 

00:47:25.054 --> 00:47:27.765
CHECKER HAD TO GO THROUGH 
EVERYTHING.  AND WHEN I GOT TO 

00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:34.972
THE STORY.  THEY CONTACTED 
VIVIAN VANCE'S TWO BIOGRAPHERS 

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.610
AND THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT A 
VISIT TO THE FBI.  AND THEN THEY

00:47:38.338 --> 00:47:41.718
 CHECKED THE VISITOR LOGS OF THE
 FBI.  

00:47:41.719 --> 00:47:48.064
SPEAKER:  OH, MY GOSH.  THAT IS 
SOME WASHINGTON

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:56.463
 FOOTNOTE.  WOW. 
SPEAKER:  BUT IF VIVIAN VANCE 

00:47:56.586 --> 00:47:59.896
WERE STILL ALIVE AND WERE TO 
VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE 

00:48:01.147 --> 00:48:03.147
WOULD STILL BE NO RECORD.  

00:48:07.449 --> 00:48:10.620
[APPLAUSE].  
SPEAKER:  OH, WE HAVE A QUESTION

00:48:10.743 --> 00:48:13.244
 RIGHT HERE.  
SPEAKER:  HI.  

00:48:13.245 --> 00:48:16.634
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  HI.  I'M 
JENNIFER.  OF ALL THE THINGS 

00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:20.624
THAT YOU SEE CELEBRITIES THAT 
ARE JUST PEOPLE TODAY, THAT WE 

00:48:21.047 --> 00:48:25.839
WEAR, THAT IS YOUR LEAST 
FAVORITE TREND?  

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:31.413
SPEAKER:  WHAT IS MY LEAST 
FAVORITE?  

00:48:31.414 --> 00:48:32.857
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  TREND.  TREND 
TODAY.  

00:48:32.858 --> 00:48:37.537
SPEAKER:  OH, MY GOD.  I'M GOING
 TO OFFEND SOME PEOPLE.  CAN I 

00:48:37.662 --> 00:48:46.526
ASK THIS QUESTION?  WHEN DID THE
 LEGGING BECOME A PANT?  [CHEERS

00:48:50.691 --> 00:48:54.640
AND APPLAUSE].  WHEN DID IT 
HAPPEN?  YOU KNOW IT'S A CLASSIC

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:58.883
 MONKEY HOUSE ITEM.  YOU KNOW IT
 IS.  I CAN'T GO OUT WEARING 

00:48:59.176 --> 00:49:01.176
THESE.  AND 30 MINUTES LATER,

00:49:04.546 --> 00:49:10.748
 I LOOK HOT.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND
 IT.  IT'S A FORM OF UNDER 

00:49:10.874 --> 00:49:14.605
GARMENT.  WEAR IT UNDER A TUNIC 
OR A PAIR OF SHORTS OR A DRESS. 

00:49:19.448 --> 00:49:21.493
IT'S NOT A PANT.  
SPEAKER:  YOU HEARD IT HERE 

00:49:21.915 --> 00:49:24.614
FIRST WASHINGTON, D.C.  
SPEAKER:  REALLY.  

00:49:24.615 --> 00:49:26.836
SPEAKER:  OKAY WE HAVE ONE RIGHT
 UP HERE.  

00:49:26.837 --> 00:49:29.831
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  HI.  SO MANY 
OF THE CHALLENGES ON PROJECT 

00:49:30.017 --> 00:49:34.080
RUNWAY SEEM TO BE RUN BY THE 
SPONSORS.  

00:49:34.081 --> 00:49:36.017
SPEAKER:  OH, THEY ARE.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  HAVE YOU EVER 

00:49:36.018 --> 00:49:39.497
GOTTEN ONE THAT YOU WERE JUST 
DISGUSTED BY?  

00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:42.785
SPEAKER:  YES, BUT FORTUNATELY 
WE -- THE SPONSOR GOES AWAY.  

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:49.106
BECAUSE HEIDI AND I SAY WE WON'T
 DO IT.  WE WON'T DO IT.  IF YOU

00:49:49.548 --> 00:49:53.268
 CAN BELIEVE IT, THE ONES THAT 
YOU DO SEE ARE MODIFIED AND 

00:49:53.815 --> 00:49:57.173
MITIGATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT 
THEY ACTUALLY AT LEAST, FROM MY 

00:49:57.597 --> 00:49:59.597
POINT OF VIEW, WORK.  ALTHOUGH 
THERE IS

00:50:03.657 --> 00:50:06.026
 SOME EXCEPTIONS.  YEAH.
I MEAN THERE ARE TIMES WHEN 

00:50:06.734 --> 00:50:11.972
HEIDI AND I WERE SUPPOSED TO 
DRESS UP AS DETERGENT BOTTLES 

00:50:12.159 --> 00:50:15.857
AND PRESENT A CHALLENGE.  IF WE 
DO IT, DO IT IN LA AND WE'LL GO 

00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:18.596
ON "LET'S MAKE A DEAL" OR DO

00:50:25.534 --> 00:50:30.039
 IT ON HALLOWEEN.  WE COULDN'T 
DO THE SHOWS WITHOUT THE 

00:50:30.636 --> 00:50:33.073
SPONSORS. 
WE HAVE SUCH A SLIM BUDGET.  

00:50:33.246 --> 00:50:38.552
THERE WOULD BE NO SHOW.  WE DO 
THE BEST WE CAN WITH IT.  

00:50:38.553 --> 00:50:40.996
SPEAKER:  GREAT.  A QUESTION 
RIGHT HERE.  

00:50:40.997 --> 00:50:42.997
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  HI, TIM GUNN. 
I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.  I'M 

00:50:43.169 --> 00:50:46.857
SORRY.  I WANT TO KNOW WHO YOUR 
FAVORITE LOOK WAS AT THE MET 

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:54.782
GALA LAST NIGHT.  AND WHAT YOUR 
FAVORITE BAR IN D.C. 

00:50:58.498 --> 00:51:00.498
IS?  
SPEAKER:  LAST NIGHT.  WELL, I

00:51:04.778 --> 00:51:06.778
 MEAN,

00:51:08.379 --> 00:51:14.182
 HONORING IT'S REALLY A LICENSE 
TO WEAR HALLOWEEN COSTUMES.  AND

00:51:14.628 --> 00:51:19.215
 A LOT OF PEOPLE DID.  I TENDED 
-- I MEAN, PERSONALLY.  I'M AN 

00:51:19.216 --> 00:51:25.251
OLD DUDDY.  
I LIKE THE LOOKS.  I THOUGHT 

00:51:25.405 --> 00:51:30.155
JENNIFER LOPEZ LOOKED FANTASTIC.
BUT WAS SHE OUT OF STEP WITH THE

00:51:30.503 --> 00:51:34.195
 THEME OF WHAT THE SHOW WAS?  
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT PERMITTED TO 

00:51:34.319 --> 00:51:40.309
ATTEND THE GALA.  I'M VERY PROUD
 OF THAT.  BECAUSE THE HOSTESS 

00:51:40.457 --> 00:51:50.108
AND I ARE ARCH ENEMIES.  [CHEERS
 AND APPLAUSE].  OH, MY

00:51:50.955 --> 00:51:53.657
 GOODNESS.
DO YOU NOT KNOW THIS STORY?  IT 

00:51:53.837 --> 00:51:57.549
WAS AN OUTCOME OF TRUTH TELLING.
SPEAKER:  OH, MY GOSH.  

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:59.319
SPEAKER:  DO YOU WANT TO HEAR 
IT?  

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.865
SPEAKER:  IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, 
DEAR.  YES.  

00:52:03.866 --> 00:52:07.600
SPEAKER:  I WAS BEING 
INTERVIEWED BY ROBERT YORK AT 

00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:12.878
THE NEW YORK POST FOR A COVER 
STORY THEY WERE DOING 

00:52:13.724 --> 00:52:16.498
CORRESPONDING TO A PREMIERE OF 
PROJECT RUNWAY, A NEW SEASON OF 

00:52:16.841 --> 00:52:19.539
PROJECT RUNWAY.  AND HE ASKED 
ME, WHAT IS THE MOST 

00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:22.592
UNFORGETTABLE THING THAT YOU 
HAVE EVER SEEN IN FASHION.  AND 

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:25.629
HE SAID, I DON'T MEAN AN ARTICLE
 OF CLOTHING.  BUT SOMETHING 

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:29.663
THAT HAS HAPPENED.  AND I SAID 
OH, THAT'S EASY.  I SAID I WAS 

00:52:29.898 --> 00:52:35.149
WATCHING ANNA WINTOR BEING 
CARRIED DOWN FIVE FLIGHTS OF 

00:52:35.269 --> 00:52:38.325
STAIRS FROM HER FASHION SHOW. 
JUST THE FACTS.  NO 

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.692
EDITORIALIZING.  JUST THE FACTS.
CAME OUT ON SUNDAY OF COURSE. 

00:52:45.818 --> 00:52:50.141
AND IT WAS A LITTLE BOX.  AND I 
WAS TEACHING THE FOLLOWING 

00:52:50.268 --> 00:52:56.411
MONDAY MORNING.  I GET BACK TO 
MY OFFICE.  SO THIS IS PARSON'S 

00:52:56.539 --> 00:53:03.162
OF COURSE.  AND I WISH I CAN 
RECREATE MY EXPRESSION AND 

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:07.675
MOVEMENTS.  THERE WAS A WHILE 
YOU WERE OUT LITTLE POST-IT 

00:53:07.985 --> 00:53:11.900
THING THAT WAS ALSO LIKE OLD 
DINOSAURS.  ANNA WINTOR'S OFFICE

00:53:12.705 --> 00:53:17.566
 CALLED.  PLEASE RETURN.  WELL, 
I

00:53:20.634 --> 00:53:26.671
 WAS -- I THINK EVERYTHING 
OPENED.  SO I CALLED.  ACTUALLY 

00:53:26.859 --> 00:53:31.434
I DIDN'T CALL RIGHT AWAY.  I 
THOUGHT, WHEN WILL SHE PROBABLY 

00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:36.815
BE AT LUNCH?  YEAH, SO 
INTUITIVELY, I THOUGHT 1:30.  SO

00:53:37.362 --> 00:53:41.411
 I CALLED.  AND SHE WAS AT 
LUNCH.

00:53:41.412 --> 00:53:48.914
SO I THOUGHT OKAY.  DEED DONE.  
HOWEVER, SOMEONE ELSE PICKED UP 

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:54.211
THE PHONE AFTER BEING ON HOLD 
FOR A FEW SECONDS.  NAMED 

00:53:54.354 --> 00:53:57.262
PATRICK MCCONNEL.  HE WAS THE 
DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR 

00:53:58.029 --> 00:54:04.824
VOGUE.  AND HE SAID MS. WINTOR 
DEMANDS A RETRACTION.  OF WHAT, 

00:54:04.967 --> 00:54:07.883
I ASKED.  SHE DEMANDS THAT YOU 
CALL THE POST AND HAVE THEM 

00:54:08.007 --> 00:54:11.799
PRINT A RETRACTION.  AND I SAID,
 THAT WOULD IMPLY IT'S NOT TRUE.

00:54:16.232 --> 00:54:18.232
 I SAID IT IS TRUE. 

00:54:21.535 --> 00:54:24.296
 AND THIS HAPPENED.  AND I KEEP 
A DIARY.  

00:54:24.297 --> 00:54:29.270
IT WAS SEPTEMBER 12TH.  THE 
METROPOLITAN FIDDLING.  I WAS ON

00:54:29.612 --> 00:54:33.490
 THE FLOOR.  AND THE 
METROPOLITAN IS AN OLD 

00:54:33.491 --> 00:54:39.799
INDUSTRIAL BUILDING.  
IT'S ONE BIG FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:44.306
AND MS. WINTOR WILL NOT RIDE IN 
AN ELEVATOR AND ALONE WITH HER 

00:54:46.641 --> 00:54:49.877
SECURITY DETAIL.  SO WE WERE -- 
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WERE GOING 

00:54:50.028 --> 00:54:54.268
TO THE SHOW AND SPECULATING NOT 
HOW SHE WOULD ARRIVE, THAT CAN 

00:54:54.473 --> 00:54:59.149
BE EASY FACILITATED.  GET HER IN
 ALONE.  GET HER OUT.  BUT HOW 

00:54:59.633 --> 00:55:03.493
SHE WOULD DESCEND.  BECAUSE IT'S
 A FRANTIC MAD RUSH.  YOU GOT TO

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.366
 LEAVE THAT LOCATION.  AND GET 
TO THE NEXT LOCATION FOR THE 

00:55:07.367 --> 00:55:10.293
NEXT SHOW.  SO WE WERE STANDING.

00:55:10.294 --> 00:55:14.155
ALWAYS HAPPY TO STAND AT A 
FASHION SHOW.  OR WE WERE 

00:55:14.545 --> 00:55:19.344
DIRECTLY OPPOSITE ANNA WINTOR 
AND HAD TWO HUGE BODY GUARDS 

00:55:19.465 --> 00:55:23.759
INSIDE OF HER.  AND THOUGHT, 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE

00:55:23.878 --> 00:55:29.203
 LIGHTS COME ON.  WELL, WE RAN 
OUT BEHIND THEM.  AND THERE WAS 

00:55:29.324 --> 00:55:33.197
A BIG GIANT OPEN STAIRCASE. 
AGAIN, A BIG INDUSTRIAL 

00:55:33.475 --> 00:55:37.544
BUILDING.  AND THE TWO SECURITY 
PEOPLE MADE A FIRE MAN'S LOCK.  

00:55:38.249 --> 00:55:44.405
AND SHE SAT IN IT.  AND THEY 
WOOSHED HER DOWN THE STAIRS.  SO

00:55:44.516 --> 00:55:47.139
 I RAN TO THE WINDOW, TO SEE 
WHETHER THEY WOULD PUT HER DOWN 

00:55:47.417 --> 00:55:50.524
ON THE SIDEWALK OR TAKE HER TO 
THE CAR.  THEY

00:55:58.846 --> 00:56:05.268
 TOOK HER TO THE CAR.  DOWN 18TH
 STREET THEY WENT.  I DIDN'T SAY

00:56:05.969 --> 00:56:10.986
 ANY OF THAT.
HAD IT IN MY DIARY, ALL OF THE 

00:56:11.124 --> 00:56:17.087
INFORMATION THAT I GAVE WITH 
PATRICK MCCONNEL.  OH, DEAR, OH,

00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:23.876
 DEAR, OH, DEAR.  SO GOOD DAY, 
PATRICK.  

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:32.429
[LAUGHTER].  TUESDAY HE CALLS.  
HE CALLS.  AND HE SAID, YOU'RE 

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:37.314
GOING TO LOVE THIS.
HE SAID, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW MS. 

00:56:38.324 --> 00:56:40.324
WINTOR KNOWS HOW TO WORK A 

00:56:43.706 --> 00:56:51.271
MANOLO.  WHAT?  SHE COULD TAKE 
THOSE STAIRS.  LOOK, I KNOW MS. 

00:56:51.513 --> 00:56:55.108
 WINTOR KNOWS HOW TO WORK A 
MANOLO.  IT WASN'T WHETHER SHE 

00:56:55.848 --> 00:56:59.299
CAN WALK DOWN THE STAIRS.  IT'S 
ABOUT SPEED.  THESE GUYS AND 

00:56:59.424 --> 00:57:03.621
THEIR FLAT SECURITY SHOES WERE 
BEING MUCH FASTER THAN SHE WOULD

00:57:03.622 --> 00:57:06.663
 HAVE EVER GONE IN THE MANOLOS. 

00:57:06.664 --> 00:57:10.498
ONCE AGAIN, OH, DEAR.  OH, DEAR.
SO THE FOLLOWING DAY, HE CALLS 

00:57:10.667 --> 00:57:13.347
AND HE SAYS ALL RIGHT.  WE HAVE 
TO GET THE LAWYERS INVOLVED.  

00:57:14.311 --> 00:57:16.450
AND I SAID, GOOD.  BECAUSE THIS 

00:57:20.215 --> 00:57:25.836
MEANS WE CAN'T TALK ANYMORE.  SO
 THEN, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS

00:57:26.868 --> 00:57:32.592
 PART EVEN MORE.  A COLLEAGUE OF
 MINE WHO I HAD AN APPOINTMENT 

00:57:33.019 --> 00:57:35.845
WITH IN MY OFFICE, CAME AND 
LOOKED AT ME AND SAID YOU LOOK 

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:40.069
HORRIBLE.  WHAT'S GOING ON?  AND
 SO I TOLD HIM THE STORY.  AND 

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:43.466
HE SAID, I WAS THERE.  I SAW IT.

00:57:43.467 --> 00:57:46.303
HE PICKED UP THE PHONE.  HE 
CALLED PATRICK AND HE SAID IT'S 

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:49.334
SO AND SO.  AND HERE IS THE PART
 THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE.  I 

00:57:49.335 --> 00:57:53.976
CAN'T SAY SO AND SO'S NAME 
ANYMORE.  

00:57:53.977 --> 00:57:57.952
BECAUSE BY AN ATTORNEY, ANNA 
WINTOR THREATENED HIS JOB 

00:57:58.413 --> 00:58:03.094
BECAUSE OF THIS ASSOCIATION WITH
 ME.  BUT ANYWAY, HE SAVED ME.  

00:58:03.262 --> 00:58:07.903
SO HE SAID, I WAS THERE.  I SAW 
IT.  AND OF COURSES THERE WERE 

00:58:08.274 --> 00:58:11.002
PROBABLY 100 PEOPLE WHO -- WELL 
PROBABLY NOT.  THERE WERE 

00:58:11.185 --> 00:58:14.809
PROBABLY 50 OF US GATHERED 
AROUND THE STAIRWELL.  BUT SHE 

00:58:15.051 --> 00:58:18.167
INSTILLED SUCH FEAR IN PEOPLE 
THAT NO ONE WOULD SAY ANYTHING. 

00:58:18.563 --> 00:58:24.088
WELL YES, SHE DOES SCARE ME.  SO
 I DECIDED TO TAKE THE HIGH 

00:58:24.859 --> 00:58:28.372
ROAD.
I CALLED THE FLOREST THAT I 

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:33.908
USED.  AND I SAID I WANT AN 
ENORMOUSLY STAGGERING BEAUTIFUL 

00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:38.108
ALL WHITE ARRANGEMENT SENT TO 
MS. WINTOR.  AND I WROTE MY OWN 

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:43.043
NOTE.  TOOK IT TO THE FLORIST TO
 ACCOMPANY THIS.  AND THOUGHT, 

00:58:43.193 --> 00:58:49.236
OKAY.  THIS IS THE RIGHT THING 
TO DO.  HOWEVER, I HAD A SECRET 

00:58:49.374 --> 00:58:51.374
EMBEDDED MESSAGE IN THE WHITE

00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:56.043
 FLOWERS.  HERE IN WESTERN 
CULTURE IT MEANS PEACE.  BUT IN 

00:58:56.469 --> 00:58:58.469
ASIAN CULTURES

00:58:59.528 --> 00:59:02.273
 IT MEANS DEATH.  
[LAUGHTER]. 

00:59:09.575 --> 00:59:17.542
 GOT IT.  HOW DID WE GET OFF ON 
THIS TANGENT?  ANYWAY -- 

00:59:17.543 --> 00:59:19.405
SPEAKER:  I DON'T THINK WE WILL 
TOP THAT.  

00:59:19.406 --> 00:59:24.430
SPEAKER:  OH, THE GALA.  I WAS 
INVITED.  WHEN LIZ 

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:32.649
CLAIREBORNE, MY BOSS OR CEO 
INVITED ME.  THE FIRST YEAR, 

00:59:32.981 --> 00:59:38.687
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.  DON'T BE
 RIDICULOUS.  I BUY A TABLE 

00:59:38.688 --> 00:59:42.343
EVERY YEAR.  AND COME WITH ME.  
WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS 

00:59:42.344 --> 00:59:47.288
HE CAME TO ME AND SAID SORRY YOU
 HAVE BEEN UNINVITED.  AND SHE 

00:59:47.812 --> 00:59:52.187
GOES THROUGH THAT LIST.  AND I 
DON'T WANT TO GO TO THAT THING 

00:59:52.783 --> 00:59:55.579
ANYWAY.  WHAT WAS YOUR SECOND 
QUESTION?  

00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.998
SPEAKER:  WE HAVE ONE LAST 
QUESTION.  

00:59:58.999 --> 01:00:02.817
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  HI, WOW, 
THAT'S LOUD.  WHAT WAS YOUR 

01:00:02.946 --> 01:00:07.155
FAVORITE CHALLENGE ON PROJECT 
RUNWAY?  

01:00:07.156 --> 01:00:14.916
SPEAKER:  I HAVE TO SAY IT'S 
VERY SENTIMENTAL FOR ME.  SEASON

01:00:15.084 --> 01:00:18.846
 1 CHALLENGE 1 WHEN WE HAD TO GO
 TO THE HIGH END FABRIC STORE 

01:00:18.847 --> 01:00:20.674
AND WE TOOK THEM TO A GROCERY 
STORE.

01:00:20.675 --> 01:00:27.085
AND WE SAID OKAY.  HERE IS YOUR 
MONEY.  SHOP FOR ALL OF THESE 

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.861
UNCONVENTIONAL MATERIALS.  IT 
DOESN'T APPEAR IN THE SHOW.  BUT

01:00:29.977 --> 01:00:34.053
 ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOMENTS WITH
 AUSTIN SCARLET WHO WON THAT 

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:40.284
CHALLENGE WITH THE INCREDIBLE 
CORN HUSK DRESS.  IT WAS 

01:00:40.422 --> 01:00:45.315
STAGGERING.  HE HAD A SHOPPING 
CART FILLED WITH CORN.  AND ON 

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:51.229
TOP OF IT WERE ALL OF THESE BAGS
 OF POTATO CHIPS.  I SAID, I 

01:00:51.679 --> 01:00:55.896
UNDERSTAND THE CORN.  BUT WHAT 
ARE THE POTATO CHIPS FOR?  AND 

01:00:56.013 --> 01:00:59.791
HE SAID FOR THE BUS RIDE HOME.  
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]. 

01:01:06.425 --> 01:01:10.112
 ARE FABULOUS.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  [CHEERS 

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:12.934
AND APPLAUSE]. 

01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:29.233
AUDIENCE. 

01:01:35.212 --> 01:01:37.212
 THANK YOU.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

01:01:44.651 --> 01:01:47.730
 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE].
