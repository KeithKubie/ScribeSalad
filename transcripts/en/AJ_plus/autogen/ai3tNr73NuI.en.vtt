00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:15.450
you

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460
 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.900
it sends any of four conductors and you

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910
it sends any of four conductors and you
 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.480
it sends any of four conductors and you
know that human being are conductors so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490
know that human being are conductors so
 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.730
know that human being are conductors so
when we put our finger on it it's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740
when we put our finger on it it's
 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:32.510
when we put our finger on it it's
actually switched on we also work with

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
actually switched on we also work with
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.060
actually switched on we also work with
stretchable sensor and textile actions

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070
stretchable sensor and textile actions
 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.939
stretchable sensor and textile actions
that can get signal body signal so that

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949
that can get signal body signal so that
 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.400
that can get signal body signal so that
can be very helpful with family tree
