00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:01.797
- [Instructor] In a previous video,

00:00:01.797 --> 00:00:04.421
we defined this random variable x.

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:05.837
It's a discrete random variable.

00:00:05.837 --> 00:00:08.020
It can only take on a
finite number of values,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.667
and I defined it as the number of workouts

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:12.417
I might do in a week.

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:15.915
And we calculated the
expected value of our

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.401
random variable x,

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.721
which we could also
denote as the mean of x,

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.788
and we use the Greek letter mu,

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:25.504
which we use for population mean.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:26.944
And all we did is,

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:29.243
it's the probability-weighted sum

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:32.006
of the various outcomes.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.583
And we got for this random variable

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:36.627
with this probability distribution,

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:40.737
we got an expected value or a mean of 2.1.

00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:42.501
What we're gonna do
now is extend this idea

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.916
to measuring spread.

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:46.263
And so we're going to think about

00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:49.119
what is the variance of
this random variable,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.837
and then we could take
the square root of that

00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:53.276
to find what is the standard deviation.

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:54.878
The way we are going to do this

00:00:54.878 --> 00:00:57.130
has parallels with the
way that we've calculated

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.266
variance in the past.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.240
So the variance

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.492
of our random variable x,

00:01:03.492 --> 00:01:04.886
what we're going to do
is take the difference

00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:08.090
between each outcome and the mean,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.831
square that difference,

00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.107
and then we're gonna multiply
it by the probability

00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:13.440
of that outcome.

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:18.214
So for example for this first data point,

00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:22.135
you're going to have
zero minus 2.1 squared

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:24.550
times the probability of getting zero,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.383
times 0.1.

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:29.797
Then you're going to get

00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:31.964
plus one minus 2.1 squared

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:37.483
times the probability that you get one,

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:38.400
times 0.15.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.451
Then you're going to get

00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:45.618
plus two minus 2.1 squared

00:01:47.863 --> 00:01:49.604
times the probability that you get a two,

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:50.437
times 0.4.

00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:54.202
Then you have plus

00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:56.119
three minus 2.1 squared

00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:58.602
times 0.25.

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.002
And then last but not least you have

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.252
plus four minus 2.1 squared

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:09.059
times 0.1.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.035
So once again,

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:13.590
the difference between each outcome

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.673
and the mean,

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.282
we square it and we multiply times

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:19.326
the probability of that outcome.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:23.134
So this is going to be
negative 2.1 squared,

00:02:23.134 --> 00:02:24.457
which is just 2.1 squared,

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:27.963
so I'll just write this as 2.1 squared,

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:28.796
times .1.

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:32.515
That's the first term.

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:34.511
And then we're going to have plus

00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:35.844
one minus 2.1 is

00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:37.986
negative 1.1,

00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:41.524
and then we're going to square that,

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:44.496
so that's just going to be
the same thing as 1.1 squared,

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.702
which is 1.21 but I'll just write it out,

00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:47.619
1.1 squared

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:50.600
times .15.

00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:57.052
And then this is going to be two minus 2.1

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.984
is negative .1.

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:04.233
When you square it is
going to be equal to.

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:05.233
So plus .01.

00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:11.823
If you have negative .1 times negative .1,

00:03:11.823 --> 00:03:13.406
it's .01 times 0.4,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.253
times .4.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.061
And then plus we this is going to be

00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:25.311
0.9 squared, so that is .81

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:29.351
times .25.

00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:32.860
And then we're almost there.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.943
This is going to be plus 1.9 squared,

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:38.604
1.9 squared times .1.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.388
And we get 1.19.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.298
So this is all going to be equal to

00:03:50.298 --> 00:03:51.131
1.19.

00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:55.453
And if we wanna get the standard deviation

00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:57.195
for this random variable,

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.795
we would denote that with
the Greek letter sigma.

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:02.140
The standard deviation
for the random variable x

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.484
is going to be equal to the
square root of the variance.

00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:07.876
Square root of 1.19,

00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:12.043
which is equal to, just get
the calculator back here,

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.306
so we are just going
to take the square root

00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:18.889
of what we just, let's
type it again, 1.19.

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:21.924
And that gives us,

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:24.174
so it's approximately 1.09.

00:04:25.523 --> 00:04:27.106
Approximately 1.09.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.539
So let's see if this makes sense.

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.929
Let me put this all on a
number line right over here.

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:36.111
So you have the outcome

00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:36.944
zero, one,

00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:39.118
two, three,

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:41.542
and four.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:47.350
So you have a 10% chance
of getting a zero.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.905
So I will draw that like this,

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:51.808
let's just say this is a height of 10%.

00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:54.803
You have a 15% chance of getting one,

00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:59.029
so that would be 1 1/2 times higher.

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.398
So it would look something like this.

00:05:01.398 --> 00:05:03.975
You have a 40% chance of getting a two.

00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:05.475
That's going to be

00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:07.664
like this.

00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:11.870
You have a 40% chance of getting a two.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.957
You have a 25% chance of getting a three.

00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:16.790
Like this.

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:23.225
And then you have a 10%
chance of getting a four.

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:24.308
So like that.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.590
So this is a visualization
of this discrete

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.680
probability distribution where

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.096
I didn't draw the vertical axis here,

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:34.509
but this would be .1, this would be .15,

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.435
this would be .25, and that is .4.

00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:41.127
And then we see that the mean is at 2.1.

00:05:41.127 --> 00:05:43.794
The mean is, the mean is at 2.1,

00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:46.723
which makes sense.

00:05:46.723 --> 00:05:48.604
Even though this random
variable only takes on

00:05:48.604 --> 00:05:50.926
integer values, you can have a mean

00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:53.782
that takes on a non-integer value.

00:05:53.782 --> 00:05:57.033
And then the standard deviation is 1.09.

00:05:57.033 --> 00:05:59.935
So 1.09 above the mean is going to get us

00:05:59.935 --> 00:06:01.018
close to 3.2,

00:06:02.977 --> 00:06:07.144
and 1.09 below the mean is
gonna get us close to one.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:12.288
And so this all at least
intuitively feels reasonable.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.494
This mean does seem to be indicative

00:06:14.494 --> 00:06:18.511
of the central tendency
of this distribution.

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.276
And the standard deviation does seem

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:22.087
to be a decent measure

00:06:22.087 --> 00:06:23.254
of the spread.
