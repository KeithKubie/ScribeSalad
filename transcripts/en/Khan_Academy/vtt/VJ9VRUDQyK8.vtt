00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.850
Welcome back.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.510
In the last presentation, I
showed you how to essentially

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.660
reverse the chain rule when
you're doing an integral.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.370
And you could also do this
by integral, it's called

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.890
integration by substitution.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.690
And I'll show you why.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.030
And this is essentially just
a reverse of the chain rule.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.770
The last problem we did in that
last video, I said, sine of x

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.490
to the third power times cosine
of x, and I took the integral

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.980
of the whole thing.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.850
And I did it kind of, you know,
just telling you that, well,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.090
we're just reversing
the chain rule.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.110
So we see the derivative of the
sine x here, right, which is

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.170
cosine of x, so we can just
treat sine of x like a variable

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.550
and take its integral.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.890
And I said that that is
equal to sine of x to

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.260
the fourth, times 1/4.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.600
Right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940
And the reason why we could
just treat the sine of x like

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.880
it's just like kind of a
variable instead of a function,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.120
is because we had its
derivative sitting right here.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.640
And if you keep doing it back
and forth between the chain

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.100
rule and what I just did, I
think it'll make

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.080
a lot of sense.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.430
So this might have been
a little confusing.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.595
So I'll show you a technique
called integration by

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:13.130
substitution, which
is essentially the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.410
exact same thing.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.200
So let's start with this exact
same integral here, and let's

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.970
pretend like we don't
know the answer.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.250
We say, well, we have a
function and its derivative, so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.510
let me let u equal the function
that we have the derivative of.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.846
Right?

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.070
u is equal to sine of x, right?

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.510
u is sine of x.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.180
Well, what's the
derivative of u?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.000
du, dx.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.610
Well, we know what
du dx is, right?

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.540
du of dx is equal
to cosine of x.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.440
We memorized that, and maybe
in a future presentation I'll

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.060
actually prove it to you.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.400
So what we can now do is
substitute these 2 things

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.240
into this integral.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.080
So the integral now becomes,
instead of writing sine of x

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.830
to the third power, we can
write u to the third power.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.590
And what's cosine of x?

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.700
Well, we just showed, cosine
of x is just du dx, right?

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:32.860
So it's times du dx, and then
we have times dx, right?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.100
And I know you're probably not
too comfortable with the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.740
differentials at this point,
but they behave in just the way

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.520
regular numbers do
with a fraction.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.400
So this dx and this dx actually
do cancel out, and you're left

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.160
with, that this is equal to the
integral of u to the third du.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.320
And now this is an
easy integral.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.850
The only thing different than
what you might have seen

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.195
recently is that instead of
an x, we have a u here.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:02.060
And while we know that the
answer of this integral, this

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.020
is equal to 1/4 u to the
fourth, and then, of course,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.600
we should add the plus c.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.390
Are we done?

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.730
Well, I mean, almost, but it
would be nice to just take that

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.630
u, and unwind it, and put the
sine of x back in for it.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.840
So let's do that.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.190
So u is the sine of x.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.390
That's what we said
at the beginning.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.180
1/4 sine of x to the
fourth, plus c.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.520
Done.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.440
Actually, this might be an
easier way to think about these

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.290
type of integrals than what I
did in the last presentation.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.000
But you know, every now and
then you have to bear with me.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.540
I do things in the wrong order.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.940
Let's do a couple more
problems like this.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:04:06.770
Let's take the integral of 2x
plus 3 times x squared plus 3x

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:16.140
plus 15 to the fifth power dx.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.340
That looks complicated
to you, doesn't it?

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.840
Well, just like we said, this
is a pattern, like we saw

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.120
in the previous examples.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.780
We have this expression here,
x squared plus 3x plus 15,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.590
and well, what's the
derivative of this?

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.540
x squared plus 3x plus 15?

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.930
Well, it's 2x plus 3, right?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.700
Notice that I'm engineering it
so it works cleanly, but most

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.850
textbooks and tests
tend to do that.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.550
So let's make the substitution.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.430
Because we have a u that we
can use, and then we have

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.630
its derivative, right?

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:56.380
So we can say u is equal to x
squared plus 3x plus 15, and we

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.320
can say then, the derivative of
u, we know the derivative

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.060
of u is 2x plus 3, right?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.980
Because the derivative
of 15 is 0.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.220
So now we can make
our substitutions.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.480
I'm just going to switch
the orders of these two

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.650
around, no different.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.770
So this is just u to
the fifth, right?

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.950
Because this is this.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.300
So this is just u to the fifth.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.640
And then this is du dx
times du dx, right?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.940
I just switched the orders.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.655
And then I multiply
that times dx.

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:32.730
And these cancel.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.120
And I know you're not
completely comfortable yet with

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.115
even this integration notation,
why is this dx sitting there in

00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:39.616
the first place, but when we do
the definite integrals it

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:42.110
will make more sense.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.730
But this is just equal to the
integral of u to the fifth du.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.220
And the integral of this,
well, this is easy.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.640
This is just equal to 1/6 u
to the sixth, right, plus c.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.590
And now we can
just unwind this.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.830
I'll do it up here to
make it extra messy.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.920
This is just equal to 1/6 times
u, which is this right here,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.570
right, we just set u to equal
this expression, 1/6 x

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.380
squared plus 3x plus 15.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.010
All of this to the
sixth power, plus c.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.060
Let's do one more.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.500
I think we have
time for one more.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.970
Image, clear image,
image, invert.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.460
OK.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.210
I will also switch colors, just
to keep things interesting.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:48.210
Let's take the integral
of e to the x times e

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.590
to the x to the fifth.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.040
I keep using that.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.250
Let's say to the
minus third power.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.820
dx.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.565
Well, once again, we have this
expression e to the x, and

00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:05.630
what's the derivative
of e to the x?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.550
Well, the derivative of e to
the x, as we learned, which

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.750
is one of these things that
amazes me, is e to the x.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.050
Actually, that's one definition
for e, is number which, when

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.810
it's raised to the x power,
it's the derivative of

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.600
the same expression.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.140
But anyway, I don't want
to confuse you too much.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.070
But we can say then that u is
equal to e to the x, and we

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.090
know that du dx is equal to e
to the x as well, which is,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.510
once again, mind blowing.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.150
So if we rewrite this top
integral, this is just equal

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.230
to, I won't switch this time.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.790
So this is du dx, right?

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:49.690
du dx times u to
the minus 3 dx.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.800
And I know what you're
thinking, Sal.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.310
Well, du dx is e to the x.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.420
u is also e to the x.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.390
Why didn't I substitute
it the other way around?

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.830
Why didn't I say this?

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:04.470
Why didn't I say that this one
is u, and why didn't I say this

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:14.750
one is du dx to the minus 3?

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.730
Well, as you can see, this
would have been useless, right?

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.590
Because then I can't multiply
it times a dx, and it

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.570
gets all confusing.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.830
And actually, I just realized,
I constructed a very silly

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.890
problem for you, because you
could simplify this before even

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.870
doing it with substitution.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.060
But we'll continue doing
it with substitution.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.260
But anyway, you see, if you did
it in this way, it becomes very

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.420
complicated, so we don't
want to do it like that.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:39.060
So this, as we see, simplifies
to the integral of u to

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.100
the minus 3 du, and that
that equals, let's see.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:50.510
You raise exponent 1 minus 1/2
u to the minus two, and that's

00:08:50.510 --> 00:09:00.320
the same thing as minus 1/2 e
to the x to the minus 2, or we

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:06.600
could view that as minus 1/2
e to the minus 2x, and of

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.230
course, plus c at the end.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.720
Now why was my problem
that I gave you silly?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.630
Well, I could have simplified
this before even doing

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.070
the substitution, right?

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.890
I could have said that that's
the same thing as the integral

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:22.950
of e to the x times e to the
minus three x dx, which is the

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:29.530
same thing as the integral
of e to the minus 2x dx.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.920
And actually, it's good that it
by substitution, because this

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.550
probably wouldn't have been
completely intuitive for you

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.670
to do just yet, as well.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.190
But anyway, that's
integration by substitution.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.340
I might do another presentation
where I do slightly harder

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.780
problems, using this
same technique.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.750
I'll see you soon.
