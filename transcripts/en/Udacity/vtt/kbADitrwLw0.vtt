00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We have our basic response status line,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and just like the request,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the status line is followed by a number of headers.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll give you a few examples--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
here are some headers that are commonly included

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with http responses.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now--just like the client request,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the headers that you see aren't always the same.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Some of them are required--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and when I say required I mean--usually there,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but, the web has evolved organically over time,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so many of the headers that are--you know--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
required are often not there,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or things will work without them.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But anyway--okay--so date is there all the time

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that's when the request happens.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You know--no surprise there.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Server--this is similar to the user agent header

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on the request.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is the--generally the name and version number

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of the server that's handling the response.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now personally, I try to never include this.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Or if I do include it, I make something up,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because otherwise you're just giving free information

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to a--you know--a would-be hacker who wants to know

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which vulnerabilities work against you.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Content type--very popular.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is the type of document that's being returned.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is so your browser knows how to display it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So--text html is a common one,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
obviously--you know, that's what an html page would be.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You could see image, png, or--you know--image gif--if it's an image,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that sort of thing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And content length is how long the document that follows is--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
content length is often included but it's not strictly required

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because the browser will know when the document's done receiving data

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because the connection may close.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And there's other ways of also--you know--

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
telling the browser that I'm done sending data.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But--it's not super relevant right this second.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We've discussed the basic requests and responses,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Let's play around in the terminal a little bit,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and--you know--practice with these a little bit.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Okay-so open up a terminal,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
if that is not straightforward on your machine,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we'll have some class notes on how to do that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You Windows users might have some challenges in front of you.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So we're in our terminal and we're going to use

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a program called Telnet to make some

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
internet requests to web servers, and watch the http go by,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
so we can see it in practice--okay.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So--let's make a request.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Okay--I'm making a request to Udacity.com, port 80--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this is the request your browser would be making

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
if you were loading Udacity.com in it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It would connect to Udacity.com, port 80.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Which, if you recall--80 is the default.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Okay--so I'll hit enter, we connect,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and now I'm going to send the request line

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that we talked about before,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and I'm going to send an http 1.0,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and I'll explain why in a second--

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and I'm going to include the host header,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Google wants this because--as we discussed before--

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
it's hosting a lot of different web servers on that machine.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now--let's scroll back up to the top of this,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
you can see the request we made--

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
get slash http 1.0, host: Udacity.com.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now--why did I do 1.0?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Because the default behavior in 1.1 is--

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is for the server to not close the connection--

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to allow the browser to make multiple requests for multiple things.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Which is an optimization,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but when you're testing by hand,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it means the connection stays open

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and then you have to close the connection on your machine

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
which is--you know--when you're using Telnet is sometimes

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
a little bit of a pain.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So--we see our request,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
1.0, host: Udacity.com.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And then you see the response from the server.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Here's the status line: http, 1.0, 200, okay.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So that means it worked.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And now you can see a bunch of headers.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Some of these headers we've seen and discussed before

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
here's date, here's the server--it's Google Front End--

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
here's the content type--text html,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that means we're receiving html, which is no big surprise,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and if we scroll down, following the status line

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in the headers, we see the actual response document.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And this is html--this is the type of stuff

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
we were working on before--this is complex,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
but you get the idea--lots of html.
