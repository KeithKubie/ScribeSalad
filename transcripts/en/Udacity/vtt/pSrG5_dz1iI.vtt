00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.298
4 squared equals 16.

00:00:02.298 --> 00:00:06.055
When you raise something to the second
power, that's called squaring

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:09.318
the number and it's just
multiplying that number by itself.

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:14.499
So 4 squared is equal to 4
times 4 which is equal to 16.
