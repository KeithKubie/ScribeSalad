bigger than we thought faster than we

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989
bigger than we thought faster than we
 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.759
bigger than we thought faster than we
thought and so the prize pot and then I

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769
thought and so the prize pot and then I
 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.149
thought and so the prize pot and then I
bought stock at that new price and the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159
bought stock at that new price and the
 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.609
bought stock at that new price and the
company then executed on that newly

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619
company then executed on that newly
 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.340
company then executed on that newly
foreseen growth trajectory and the stock

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350
foreseen growth trajectory and the stock
 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.340
foreseen growth trajectory and the stock
price didn't move because that new

price didn't move because that new
 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.440
price didn't move because that new
growth trajectory already was discounted

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450
growth trajectory already was discounted
 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.789
growth trajectory already was discounted
into the this higher prize and so it it

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799
into the this higher prize and so it it
 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.960
into the this higher prize and so it it
it helped me see that the only way a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970
it helped me see that the only way a
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.620
it helped me see that the only way a
company can have its share price

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
company can have its share price
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.080

growth here than we thought hey
 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.480
growth here than we thought hey
everybody come and look there's even

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490
everybody come and look there's even
 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.280

outperform the market is through upsides
upside surprises and then I realized

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390
upside surprises and then I realized
 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.240
upside surprises and then I realized
that just as the established companies

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
that just as the established companies
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.680
that just as the established companies
systematically underestimate how big

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690
systematically underestimate how big
 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.680
systematically underestimate how big
disruptive companies will become Wall

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690
disruptive companies will become Wall
 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.640
disruptive companies will become Wall
Street's methods of financial analysis

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650
Street's methods of financial analysis
 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.950
Street's methods of financial analysis
systematically undervalue disruptive

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960
systematically undervalue disruptive
 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.020
systematically undervalue disruptive
companies and how big they will become

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030
companies and how big they will become
 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.780
companies and how big they will become
and so it's disruptive companies that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790
and so it's disruptive companies that
 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.700
and so it's disruptive companies that
are the ones that keep surprising the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710
are the ones that keep surprising the
 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.669
are the ones that keep surprising the
market on the upside oh my gosh there's

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679
market on the upside oh my gosh there's
 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.469
market on the upside oh my gosh there's
even more growth here than we thought

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
even more growth here than we thought
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.740
even more growth here than we thought
and so my son and I just were not

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
and so my son and I just were not
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.259
and so my son and I just were not
wealthy people but we just decided that

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269
wealthy people but we just decided that
 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.589
wealthy people but we just decided that
we would invest our family's assets with

we would invest our family's assets with
 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.319
we would invest our family's assets with
