00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:04.160
 Let's see if we can figure out 3/4 minus 5/8 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.055
 Here we have a conception about 3/4 

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:11.980
 You can see this board 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.325
 As a whole unit, and we see that it has been divided 

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:17.440
 Into four equal parts 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.990
 Three of these sections are shaded 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.820
 So these three are shady 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.250
 This represents 3/4 of the whole unit 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 Which we see here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.030
 And then this board at the bottom you can see it 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.540
 As a whole other unit 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.195
 This is the whole other unit found here 

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.830
 You can see that this unit is divided into eight equal parts 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.125
 Five of these parts are shaded 

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.145
 Thus this represents 5/8 

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.685
 We want to take the fraction 3/4 which is the area shaded in green 

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:46.215
 And subtract from it 5/8 

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:47.190
 How can we do that? 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.385
 Even when looking at them 

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:49.960
 You may see the solution 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.850
 Each time we collect fractions or ask them 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.790
 We must think about whether these fractures are the same 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.925
 Will we deal with four, eight or 16 

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.215
 Or any other number? 

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.585
 Let us think of a common denominator between them 

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.685
 And the best common denominator 

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:06.595
 Will be the common multiplier of these two properties 

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.955
 The ideal joint multiplier for these two fractions is the smaller common multiplier 

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:11.830
 And one way I like to handle it 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.360
 Although there are many ways to do so 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.325
 Let's look at the larger premises 

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.250
 Let's look at eight, and then look for complications 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.795
 Eight, until we find one of them divided by four 

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.925
 The four are fully divided 

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:24.515
 But with the eight, we can say directly 

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.450
 The eight are divisible by four 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.720
 The eight are clearly divisible 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.180
 Thus the eight is the smallest common multiplier 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.455
 For the four and eight 

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:34.495
 Thus we can rewrite 

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.260
 Both of the fractions are in the form of a number of eight 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.115
 Thus we can rewrite 3/4 as a number on eight 

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:43.620
 And then we ask him the fraction 5/8 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.095
 If we want to write a 5/8 fraction in the form of a number of eight 

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:49.285
 We will put it as it is 5/8 

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.850
 Then we can find out the actual answer of the subtraction process 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.695
 How can we rewrite the fraction 3/4 as a number on eight 

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:57.155
 Well, there are many ways to think about doing this 

00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:58.060
 One of them 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.470
 I have number four in the denominator 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.090
 Now I will double the number of sections so that the multiple sections are equal 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.475
 I will hit the number two so I become 

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:07.850
 This number of shaded sections is twice that 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.045
 Thus 3/4 is considered as 6/8 

00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:14.525
 We can see this visually 

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.575
 If we want to have double the number of these equal sections 

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:18.720
 Both of these four sections are here 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.350
 I will convert it 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.240
 To double, each section is divided into two equal parts so we have eight sections 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.845
 Let's do it 

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.550
 Let me ... 

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.495
 Let me swear this 

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:32.430
 I swear this 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.720
 And this and that 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.925
 Now we went from four to eight 

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.925
 We have one, two, three, four, five, six 

00:02:41.925 --> 00:02:44.010
 Seven, eight equal sections 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.755
 Six of these sections are shaded 

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:49.425
 3/4 is considered as 6/8 

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:51.660
 Now we can do the subtraction 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.055
 We have 6/8 and we want to ask 5/8 

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:59.250
 So we have 6/8 and we want to ask them 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.025
 one two three four five 

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:04.985
 These five are equal to the five purple ones 

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.290
 Located here 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.665
 We will subtract one, two, three, four, five 

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.445
 If we want to deal with green only 

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:14.020
 We will begin with 6/8 and subtract from it 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.020
 One, two, three, four, five 

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:22.360
 You can see that this is equivalent to 5/8 at the bottom 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.830
 And now what is the rest? 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.795
 Well, how much is left with us 

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:30.190
 The one that stays with us is 1/8 present here 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.850
 So the rest is 1/8 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.350
 We can see it numerically here 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.185
 If we have six things and in this case 6/8 

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:38.895
 And we want to put five of these things 

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:40.225
 And in this case 5/8 

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:45.001
 The rest will have one thing and it is 1/8
