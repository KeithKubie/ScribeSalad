00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.501
Nothing can keep me down.

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:03.669
I've been attacked
by terrorists, asteroids,

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:07.573
film critics, music critics,
restaurant critics,

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:11.310
divorce lawyers,
male-pattern baldness,

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.479
and none of it --
none of it stopped me

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:17.583
because I am still
Bruce Fuckin' Willis.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.452
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.897
People ask me why
I did this roast.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.599
Was it because one of
the last guys who did it

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:34.934
became president?

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.702
Hell no.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.438
Why would I want to be president

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:42.075
when I can just keep being
Bruce Fuckin' Willis?

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.444
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.212
Huh?
Yeah?

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:50.283
I did this roast for one reason
and for one reason only --

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:54.320
to settle something
once and for all.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:58.091
Now, please,
listen very carefully.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:03.996
"Die Hard" is not
a Christmas movie!

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:07.366
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.636
It's a goddamn
Bruce Willis movie.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:14.373
So, yippee ki-yay
to all of you motherfuckers.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:15.842
Good night!

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.711
[ Cheers and applause ]
