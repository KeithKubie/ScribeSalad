00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.170
Ok, with the loss of the cones that

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.150
detect red light, and the resulting protanopia, or red

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.740
green color blindness that we talked about in our

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.030
comparison up here. We would probably expect to have

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.600
trouble at stoplights that have red yellow green

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.630
to signify them. Electrical wires where there's red, green,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.320
and yellow to have to distinguish. A red and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.750
green apple, a Braeburn versus a Granny Smith apple.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.590
But we shouldn't have trouble distinguishing a blue from a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.640
yellow paint. Now obviously in reality, there are context clues to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.500
help people with red green color blindness distinguish what they

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.204
need to. For example, when you look at the stoplight, you

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.440
don't have to be able to distinguish the colors off

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.532
that well because there's particular order to the colors. Or even

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:47.192
looking at the apples for example, there's differences in their size

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:50.817
and texture, they give you clues. The electrical wires might actually

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:54.500
be a genuinely difficult situation for someone to find themselves in.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.572
Or the case of paint colors or of different colored clothing.
