00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.410
we've generally worked on problems by

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420
we've generally worked on problems by
 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.589
we've generally worked on problems by
looking at how can we solve the problem

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:10.599
looking at how can we solve the problem
 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.100
looking at how can we solve the problem
but that's a very much of fix-it mindset

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110
but that's a very much of fix-it mindset
 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.260
but that's a very much of fix-it mindset
you know here's a problem and what can

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270
you know here's a problem and what can
 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.720
you know here's a problem and what can
we do to solve it and technology

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730
we do to solve it and technology
 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.840
we do to solve it and technology
advances in technology have enabled us

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850
advances in technology have enabled us
 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.570
advances in technology have enabled us
to do that and is that important of

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580
to do that and is that important of
 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.540
to do that and is that important of
course it is it's necessary but it's not

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550
course it is it's necessary but it's not
 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.560
course it is it's necessary but it's not
sufficient so how can we solve problems

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570
sufficient so how can we solve problems
 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.279
sufficient so how can we solve problems
in an enduring way in an equitable way

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289
in an enduring way in an equitable way
 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.489
in an enduring way in an equitable way
in a way where nobody really loses

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499
in a way where nobody really loses
 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:42.689
in a way where nobody really loses
because too often we look at an issue

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699
because too often we look at an issue
 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.500
because too often we look at an issue
from a scarcity mindset but frankly we

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
from a scarcity mindset but frankly we
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.380
from a scarcity mindset but frankly we
have an abundant planet and we have

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390
have an abundant planet and we have
 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.459
have an abundant planet and we have
people with so much creativity can we

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469
people with so much creativity can we
 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.639
people with so much creativity can we
engage that way differently so that's

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649
engage that way differently so that's
 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.389
engage that way differently so that's
what this journey is about awakening the

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399
what this journey is about awakening the
 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.910
what this journey is about awakening the
space within me and within everybody

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920
space within me and within everybody
 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.920
space within me and within everybody
else and it's about awakening and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930

solving problems through that space it's

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170
solving problems through that space it's
 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.040
solving problems through that space it's
not about fixing it and what's amazing

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050
not about fixing it and what's amazing
 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.790
not about fixing it and what's amazing
is that people have innate attributes

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800
is that people have innate attributes
 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.060
is that people have innate attributes
worldwide and neuroscience and recent

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070
worldwide and neuroscience and recent
 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.330
worldwide and neuroscience and recent
research shows that what we can see is

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340
research shows that what we can see is
 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.350
research shows that what we can see is
that human beings have a sense of self

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
that human beings have a sense of self
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.990
that human beings have a sense of self
their own self worth which we often you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000
their own self worth which we often you
 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.530
their own self worth which we often you
know talk about as dignity so they have

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540
know talk about as dignity so they have
 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.600

a sense of self worldwide it doesn't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610
a sense of self worldwide it doesn't
 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.520

this transcends all those divides the

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240
this transcends all those divides the
 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.350
this transcends all those divides the
social isms that we've created so

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360
social isms that we've created so
 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.960
social isms that we've created so
basically the sense of self-worth exists

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970
basically the sense of self-worth exists
 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.840
basically the sense of self-worth exists
and the sense of fairness exists

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850
and the sense of fairness exists

and the sense of fairness exists
worldwide and so very often people ask

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090
worldwide and so very often people ask
 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.990
worldwide and so very often people ask
me what is it that there's so much

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000
me what is it that there's so much
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.620
me what is it that there's so much
inequity in the world and you say that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630
inequity in the world and you say that
 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.120
inequity in the world and you say that
we have an innate sense

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130
we have an innate sense
 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.270
we have an innate sense
fairness in fact Oxfam did a study in

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280
fairness in fact Oxfam did a study in
 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.390
fairness in fact Oxfam did a study in
the u.s. and they found that 92% of

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
the u.s. and they found that 92% of
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.030
the u.s. and they found that 92% of
people actually believed that fairness

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
people actually believed that fairness
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.870
people actually believed that fairness
is important how great is that so then

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880
is important how great is that so then
 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.730
is important how great is that so then
people say how come there's so much

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740
people say how come there's so much
 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.270
people say how come there's so much
inequity I think a lot of the inequity

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280
inequity I think a lot of the inequity

need much of that is promoted through
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.590
need much of that is promoted through
creating demand for things we actually

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600
creating demand for things we actually
 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.650
