00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Voiceover] So we have a function f of x

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.162
it's written as the product of a bunch of

00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:05.961
first degree expressions.

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:08.376
We obviously could also
view this as a (mumbles),

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:09.723
specially if we expand this all out,

00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:11.766
we'll have a more traditional form.

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.403
But what's nice about this form,

00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:15.006
and this is where we try to get

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:16.387
when we're trying to find the zeros

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:17.908
or the root of a (mumbles),

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:21.333
is that is very easy
to pick out the zeros.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.572
The zeros here, these
are the x values that

00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:27.231
make our function equal to zero.

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:29.924
Well that's gonna be x equals to two,

00:00:29.924 --> 00:00:31.920
x is equal to negative four,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.825
that would make this expression zero.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.555
X is equal to negative five,

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:37.958
remember, if you make any
one of these equal to zero,

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.975
then the entire function is
going to be equal to zero.

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.263
Cause zero times anything is zero.

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:44.515
X equals one,

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:48.159
and x is equal to nine.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.879
Now, as we've talked
about in multiple videos,

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.017
these are also going to be,

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.350
these x values when you
input into the function

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.277
give you f of two equals zero,

00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.112
f of negative four is equal to zero.

00:00:57.112 --> 00:00:59.004
Then that means that, there're also a way

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:00.630
to find our x intercepts.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.988
What am I talking about?

00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:03.583
So, let me draw,

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.405
let me draw a big axis here.

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:08.238
See it goes lows x equals negative five

00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:09.761
as high as x equals 9.

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:13.754
So, let me draw something like this.

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:17.667
So, it's my y axis, this is my x axis.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:21.092
X's one, two, three,

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:23.716
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.678
eight, nine.

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:30.241
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:31.390
Alright.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.737
Now let's just plot these.

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:35.022
So when x is equal to two,

00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:36.823
f of two we already know it's zero.

00:01:36.823 --> 00:01:39.424
If you input two here, then
this expression's gonna be

00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:42.280
zero, zero, times a bunch
of stuff's gonna be zero.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.020
So f of two is equal to zero.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.319
So the point two comma zero

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.860
is going to be on the
graph of y equals f of x.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.691
So one, two, comma, zero.

00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:55.283
So that's that point right over there.

00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:58.639
So notice, x equals two is a zero

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.320
and makes our function equal to zero

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.714
if we input it into it.

00:02:02.714 --> 00:02:05.198
And it's also the point two, comma, zero.

00:02:05.198 --> 00:02:09.300
It's going to be the x coordinate

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.817
of this point right over here.

00:02:10.817 --> 00:02:12.314
It's going to define our x,

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:14.451
or one of our x intercepts.

00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:15.751
Let's do it with the other ones.

00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:18.862
X is equal to negative
four, I can do that with a

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:19.882
better color.

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.324
X is equal to negative four.

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:22.473
Negative one, negative
two, negative three,

00:02:22.473 --> 00:02:24.016
negative four.

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:27.257
Right over there, x is
equal to negative five.

00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:30.101
X is equal to negative five.

00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:36.399
X is equal to one, and do that in,

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.393
I will do that in pink.

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:40.578
X is equal to one.

00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:43.189
And x is equal to nine.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.093
And x is equal to nine, that
was right over there, right?

00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:47.776
One, two, three, four, five,

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:49.913
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:02:49.913 --> 00:02:51.619
Now I'm not gonna be able to exactly

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.581
draw the graph of this function.

00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:55.868
But what's neat is, I
can realize, well look,

00:02:55.868 --> 00:02:57.714
if these are the points
where I'm going to intersect

00:02:57.714 --> 00:02:58.574
the x axis.

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:00.048
And these are the only points

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:01.999
where I'm going to intersect the x axis.

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.460
The zeros, the real zeros define the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.351
all of the points that (mumbles)
to intersect the x axis,

00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:08.847
because, think about
it, there's a point that

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:10.729
intersected the x axis that wasn't a zero,

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.517
well, it would be a zero

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:15.034
cause the function would take
on the value of zero there.

00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:18.309
So between those points,
if the function will

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.934
stay positive or will stay negative.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.570
And we can test that a little bit.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.914
Let's think about what
the function is doing

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.352
between x equals negative four

00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:33.810
and x equals one, so, over
this interval right over here.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.760
Well let's just pick a value there,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.828
and then think about whether the function

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:39.603
is gonna be positive or
negative at that value.

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:43.597
And an easy value to
think about is maybe zero.

00:03:43.597 --> 00:03:45.037
And I just want to think about the sign,

00:03:45.037 --> 00:03:47.103
is the function going to
be positive or negative

00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:48.891
when x is equal to zero.

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:51.809
So f of zero, f of zero,

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.814
I'm just going to think about the sign.

00:03:53.814 --> 00:03:57.053
So the f of zero is
gonna be zero minus two,

00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:59.062
well that's going to be negative.

00:03:59.062 --> 00:04:01.767
Zero plus four, that's gonna be positive.

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:04.681
Zero plus five, that's gonna be positive.

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:08.137
Zero minus one, is gonna be negative.

00:04:08.137 --> 00:04:12.873
Zero minus nine is going to be negative.

00:04:12.873 --> 00:04:15.858
So we can see, at x equals zero,

00:04:15.858 --> 00:04:17.203
we're going to get a, let's see,

00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:21.289
this is going to be a
negative times a negative,

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.232
which would be a positive,

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:24.159
then we multiply by a negative again.

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.608
So this is going to be equal to,

00:04:26.608 --> 00:04:28.488
this is going to get us to a negative.

00:04:28.488 --> 00:04:31.102
So the function's gonna take
on a negative value here.

00:04:31.102 --> 00:04:32.983
And we know it's gonna
take a negative value

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:35.281
over this entire interval,

00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:37.081
over this entire interval.

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:39.728
Because if for some reason
it took on a positive value

00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:42.154
over that interval, it's
a continuous function.

00:04:42.154 --> 00:04:43.988
It would have to cross the x axis

00:04:43.988 --> 00:04:45.963
and that would define another zero.

00:04:45.963 --> 00:04:48.679
But we know there aren't any
zeros between these two points.

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:50.932
So the function, I don't
know what it looks like,

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:52.441
but it's going to stay positive

00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:55.285
between those two values.

00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:56.957
Now, as you go over to our next interval,

00:04:56.957 --> 00:04:59.290
it's probably going to change signs.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.414
And we can verify that if you look at f,

00:05:02.414 --> 00:05:07.414
if you look at, say, f of negative of 4.5.

00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:09.345
So we'll do the same drill.

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:14.140
F of negative 4.5, well
that's going to be,

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.589
that's going to be a see,

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:20.930
negative times a negative,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.534
times a positive.

00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:25.831
Negative 4.5 plus five is a positive.

00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:30.614
Times a negative, times a negative.

00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:32.284
Well we have an even number of negatives

00:05:32.284 --> 00:05:33.970
being multiplied together here.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.758
So this gonna give us a positive.

00:05:35.758 --> 00:05:38.625
So this is going to give
us a positive value.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:39.972
So we're going to have a positive value

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.481
between these two points.

00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:45.104
And then we're likely to flip
back to negative after that.

00:05:45.104 --> 00:05:47.971
So then the graph is likely to flip back

00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:51.733
flip back to negative, right over there.

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:55.077
You can test that, try
a really negative value.

00:05:55.077 --> 00:05:58.676
So f of negative 10.

00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:01.729
Well that's going to be a negative

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.093
times a negative, times a negative,

00:06:06.093 --> 00:06:09.554
let's see, times a
negative, times a negative,

00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:10.739
times a negative.

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:12.492
So you have five negatives
being multiplied together,

00:06:12.492 --> 00:06:14.407
you're going to have a negative.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.207
Hopefully you see where
all of this is going,

00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:18.273
so this is, we're likely
to switch signs here.

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:21.698
You can test 1.5 and see if
you get a positive value.

00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:23.451
Then we're likely to switch back here.

00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:24.531
And once again, the graph isn't gonna look

00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:25.669
exactly like this.

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.669
It might deep, it might
be fairly shallow here,

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:33.575
and then it might deep
down a lot right here.

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:36.083
I'm just making up the
parts on the ups and downs.

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:38.614
And then it probably
does another sign change

00:06:38.614 --> 00:06:40.529
right over there, and we can verify that.

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.852
If f of positive 10

00:06:43.995 --> 00:06:46.572
well that's gonna be a positive

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.569
times a positive,

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.502
times a positive, times a
positive, times a positive.

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:57.003
Positive times a positive,
so we're positive.

00:06:57.003 --> 00:06:59.360
After that, I don't know
exactly what it looks like.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.472
But the key realization here is

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:04.468
that the zeros are the only places

00:07:04.468 --> 00:07:05.908
we're gonna intercept the x axis.

00:07:05.908 --> 00:07:08.404
And between those zeros,
if you were positive,

00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:09.783
if you're positive on the
interval, you're gonna be

00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:11.014
positive on any point.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:12.279
If you're positive at one
point in that interval,

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.137
you're gonna be positive at
any point in that interval.

00:07:14.137 --> 00:07:16.250
And if you're negative at
any point of that interval,

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.237
then you're going to be negative

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:18.549
throughout the interval.

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:19.988
And of course, at the end of the interval,

00:07:19.988 --> 00:07:22.879
you're going to be at zero.

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.435
So, if someone were to say,

00:07:24.435 --> 00:07:26.223
what is the sign of f?

00:07:26.223 --> 00:07:28.101
If someone would say sing

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:34.741
of f on the interval on

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.834
say negative four is less
than x, is less than one.

00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:42.285
Well this interval goes from negative four

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:45.615
to one, so that's the interval
we actually started off with.

00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:47.010
That's that interval right over there,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.275
you'd say, oh well look,

00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:51.793
f is always negative on this interval.

00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:52.942
If you don't include the end points.

00:07:52.942 --> 00:07:54.405
And we're not including
the end points here.

00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:57.238
We don't have a less and/or
equal either point here.

00:07:57.238 --> 00:07:58.550
So here's always negative.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.781
If someone gave you a different interval,

00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:01.813
if they give you an interval that includes

00:08:01.813 --> 00:08:04.018
where zero is part of the interval.

00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:05.446
So someone said,

00:08:05.446 --> 00:08:07.908
if someone said the interval from

00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:12.842
I don't know, the
interval from one to nine,

00:08:12.842 --> 00:08:15.094
well that's gonna include a zero in it.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.557
So it's gonna be positive,

00:08:16.557 --> 00:08:19.053
it's gonna be sometimes
positive and sometimes negative

00:08:19.053 --> 00:08:19.994
on this interval.

00:08:19.994 --> 00:08:21.085
So the key is,

00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:24.208
between two roots, not
including the roots,

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.518
if you have an interval between two roots,

00:08:26.518 --> 00:08:28.025
then you're always going to be positive,

00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:30.312
or you're always going to be
negative over that interval.

00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:32.486
Whatever the sign is, at
any point, the interval's

00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:34.027
gonna be the sign throughout the interval,

00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:35.917
not including the end points.
