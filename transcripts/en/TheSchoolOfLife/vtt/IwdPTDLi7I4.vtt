00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
One of the big ongoing misconceptions we have is that sex might be something that happens in our bodies...

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.600
when it is, of course, overwhelmingly an intellectual business rooted in the mind.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.040
Perhaps nothing proves this so well as the business of sexting, a highly creative activity in which two people,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.920
who may be on opposite continents from one another, can nevertheless, through the sheer medium of words,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.000
bring each other off without so much as a single touch of the skin.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.020
Like any good writer, the sexter must create profound effects in another’s mind nearly through the manipulation of the alphabet.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.920
Though that the goal is also to provoke orgasm, arguably places a demand for visceral literary talent

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.480
almost as great as that required by a National Book Award or Pulitzer Prize.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.300
Eroticism emerges first and foremost from the pleasure – in which relief plays a big part –

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.500
at having our secret sexual selves, witnessed, endorsed and encouraged by a kindly other.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.460
The good sexter knows how to call forth the otherwise shamed, shy parts of their partner

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.460
and to lead them to lay aside the punishing propriety that society normally demands.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.380
So-called dirty words have an important role to play in successful texting,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.580
for their taboo nature functions as evidence of loyalty and trust.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.780
We can say polite things to more or less anyone;

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:32.580
but it’s only around someone rather special that we can at last spill out the plethora of extreme things that we’ve known since childhood we must never utter.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:41.100
They may sound like the opposite of tenderness, but the dirtiest words are in fact touching symbols of loyalty and emotional intimacy.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.460
They are evidence that we’ve at last found someone to whom we can reveal our true wayward selves, without guilt.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.900
In the heat of sexting, we no longer have to care about being those rather oppressive titles:

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.200
a good boy or a nice girl.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.300
While the city sleeps, swear words, insults, extreme longings,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.600
all travel down oblivious fiber optic cables.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.760
Orbiting satellites will eavesdrop on the details of fantasies of cunnilingus.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.120
What our phone companies will later in the month discretely refer to as merely ‘data’

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.660
bears the imprint of excited journeys, from loneliness to the deepest intimacy.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.720
It's no more fair to dismiss texting because many people have done it without artistry

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.600
than to dismiss all works of literature because there have been so many substandard books.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.380
Sexting awaits rediscovery as a supreme medium of literary talent.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.860
An honest and poignant comunication.
