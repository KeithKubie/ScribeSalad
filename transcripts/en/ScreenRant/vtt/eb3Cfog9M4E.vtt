00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.740
TV shows may be seen as small-scale siblings
to movies, but they require just as many cast

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.820
and crew to tell their own stories the best
way possible.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.680
That means writers, actors, camera operators
and crew members working in perfect unison.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.510
Unsurprisingly, things don’t always go as
planned – but the viewers get to enjoy the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.510
results all the same.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.609
Here are Screen Rant’s Biggest Mistakes
in Popular TV Shows.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:32.730
Lost

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.370
One look at modern television shows just how
much ABC's Lost changed the game, delivering

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.940
clues, hints, twists and massive conspiracies
from week to week.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.280
As a result, fans regularly re-watched the
early episodes to see just how much they'd

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280
missed.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.640
Online discussion exploded when viewers took
a closer look at the pilot episode, as the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.850
survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 took cover
from an exploding jet engine.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.750
Specifically, the swooping black object that
seemed to trigger the explosion.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.600
Was it the island's smoke monster?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.129
Another creature yet to be revealed, or the
mystery that would explain all others.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.060
The showrunner were finally forced to explain
that it was only a mistake: an error in the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.240
CG effect.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.060
Fans had to look elsewhere for answers.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.060
Firefly

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.270
It may have lived for less than a single season,
but that didn't stop Joss Whedon's Firefly

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880
from becoming a cult hit.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.590
In the years since it originally aired, fans
have had no choice but to watch their favorite

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.450
adventures on repeat, learning every detail
and building a series' worth of fiction out

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.780
of a handful of episodes.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.450
But we're willing to bet one mistake might
have slipped by.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.860
The pilot episode is capped off by a deadly
escape from a ship full of murderous Reavers,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.670
due mainly to the skills of the crew's pilot,
Wash.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.360
When the ship is home free, Wash relaxes - but
it's clear that he's only *pretending* to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.530
be gripping the steering wheel.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.580
He may steer the ship with his mind, but the
episode also shows he relies on crew members,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.330
not gas, to run the ship's mule.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.330
Supernatural

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.500
When dealing with demons, exorcisms and magic
hexes, some mistakes are bound to happen.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.890
Most of Supernatural’s errors are easy to
miss, but a few are easy to spot for those

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.890
paying close attention.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.720
When Sam and Dean Winchester are tracking
down a haunted painting in the first season,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.420
Dean gets his brother's attention with a different
name - not the character's, but actor Jared

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420
Padelecki's.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.390
A slip-up that small is one thing, but the
brothers cast serious doubt on their exorcism

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.450
skills when chasing a demon onto a commercial
airliner.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.910
Deciding holy water is too extreme to detect
a demon in flight, Sam has a better idea.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.750
Actually, it’s “Deus.”

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.620
Not only is “Christo” the word for Christ,
not God, it's Greek, not Latin.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.890
Thankfully, the demon apparently didn't know
the difference.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.360
The Big Bang Theory

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.420
When the cast of your show is described as
a group of know-it-all geniuses, writing the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.510
script becomes a minefield of inaccuracies
that could truly sell the characters short.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.060
It’s possible that Sheldon could misquote
the rules of feeding Mogwai after midnight

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.790
in the movie “Gremlins”.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.060
But hearing Amy explain that the Viennese
Danish was invented in Denmark makes it clear

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.060
that another fact-checker was needed on set.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.600
But even within the show’s history, the
writers have forgotten, or simply ignored

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600
prior storylines.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.040
As just one example, the hypochondriac Leonard
can’t drink wine, except for the times he

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040
does.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.930
And even more dramatically, Sheldon tells
Penny early on in the series that none of

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.940
his roommates know how to dance, later breaking
out his best moves that he apparently mastered

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.940
in his youth.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.640
The cast may claim to have flawless memories,
but it seems the writers can’t keep up.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.640
Breaking Bad

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.870
When series creator Vince Gilligan decided
to set his tale of a chemistry teacher turned

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.760
drug kingpin in the year 2007, he did it knowing
that some pop culture references would be

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760
off the table.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.300
For most of the series, the timeline was simple
enough to follow, with time in the show passing

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.610
much slower.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.191
But that led to one particular mistake in
the show’s fifth season, when a character

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:47.310
made a direct reference to the death of Osama
bin Laden.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.810
Unfortunately, the show was still set in 2010
at the latest – several months before bin

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.890
Laden’s death took place.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.360
The creator had to admit it was a mistake,
but in a show with so few, it can be forgiven.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.360
Buffy the Vampire Slayer

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.510
For every actor in a given shot, there are
dozens of crew members and camera men working

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.510
just off screen.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.830
It’s no surprise then that that some will
wander into frame from time to time.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.790
Viewers may be shocked to see just how many
crew members slip by unnoticed, but one cameraman

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.620
on the set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer stuck
out worse than almost any other.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.760
When the show’s fourth season saw Buffy’s
longtime nemesis Faith wake from a coma and

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.850
seek revenge at the Summers house, a fight
broke out, with the two Slayers quickly coming

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.850
to blows.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.790
The camera tracks them both as they go tumbling
down a staircase, before the opposite angle

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.440
shows the cameraman responsible for the previous
shot, impossible to miss on screen.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.510
Different editions of the show have been tweaked
to keep him out of frame, but with a cameo

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.650
this glamorous, we say he deserves a supporting
actor credit.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.650
Friends

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.230
You can’t stay on the air for ten seasons
without re-using a few plot lines or jokes.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.340
But usually, it isn’t the same characters
caught up in them.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.760
When Chandler and Monica wind up waiting for
a table at an upscale restaurant, she suggests

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.650
Chandler slip the host a bill slyly concealed
inside his palm.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:10.180
Chandler can’t pull it off, but suspects
it was no problem for Monica’s suave ex-boyfriend

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.889
Richard (played by Tom Selleck).

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.240
That’s exactly where she learned the trick
– but Chandler should know that.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.650
After all, it was Richard who taught both
Chandler and Joey to do the same five seasons

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.590
before.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.910
Chandler forgetting the steps is fine, but
the writers feeling such a tiny joke was worth

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.980
telling twice is the real mystery.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.340
Battlestar Galactica

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.350
Few sci-fi revivals can claim to be as successful
as Battlestar Galactica, with the second season

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.520
of the series ramping up the tension, stakes,
and drama substantially.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.430
Character deaths and betrayals were everywhere
– apparently, the crew thought viewers wouldn’t

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.340
notice some hilarious mistakes amid all the
chaos.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.870
When Helo and the Chief first let off steam
by throwing some punches, they did so with

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.870
an audience.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.420
Why the camera crew visible in the frame was
necessary for the shot is a mystery, but it

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.730
wasn’t even the most obvious mistake in
the season.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.500
When President Roslin was re-elected, her
campaign staff didn’t even notice the cameraman

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.889
capturing the moment for viewers to witness
all the way back on Earth.

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.010
