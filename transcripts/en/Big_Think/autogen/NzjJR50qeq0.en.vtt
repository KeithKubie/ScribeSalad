00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.950
 
I actually designed a hobbit board game

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
I actually designed a hobbit board game
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.310
I actually designed a hobbit board game
when I was probably eight years old in

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
when I was probably eight years old in
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.810
when I was probably eight years old in
my closet because I was slightly

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
my closet because I was slightly
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.600
my closet because I was slightly
embarrassed at the time and so I'd been

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
embarrassed at the time and so I'd been
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.270
embarrassed at the time and so I'd been
reading the hobbit and I think at the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280
reading the hobbit and I think at the
 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.800
reading the hobbit and I think at the
time I was less interested in that it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
time I was less interested in that it
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.300
time I was less interested in that it
was a game and I was more interested in

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
was a game and I was more interested in
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.980
was a game and I was more interested in
drawing the characters and sort of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
drawing the characters and sort of
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109
drawing the characters and sort of
imagining this incredible world that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
imagining this incredible world that
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.370
imagining this incredible world that
I've been reading about so that was my

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
I've been reading about so that was my
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.599
I've been reading about so that was my
first game that I designed way back when

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609
first game that I designed way back when
 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.829
first game that I designed way back when
the first sort of digital game I

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839
the first sort of digital game I
 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.030
the first sort of digital game I
designed was really back in 2003 and it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
designed was really back in 2003 and it
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.190
designed was really back in 2003 and it
was a game called a big urban game that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
was a game called a big urban game that
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.480
was a game called a big urban game that
was commissioned by the Design Institute

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490
was commissioned by the Design Institute
 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.580
was commissioned by the Design Institute
in Minneapolis and it was a game that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
in Minneapolis and it was a game that
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.980
in Minneapolis and it was a game that
used these giant inflatable game pieces

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990
used these giant inflatable game pieces
 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.680
used these giant inflatable game pieces
that people raced around the city over

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
that people raced around the city over
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.300
that people raced around the city over
the course of five days as a way to get

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310
the course of five days as a way to get
 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.060

Paul to think about the design of their
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.050
Paul to think about the design of their
city so that the digital component of

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060
city so that the digital component of
 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.550
city so that the digital component of
that game was a kind of website where

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560
that game was a kind of website where
 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.800
that game was a kind of website where
people called in and voted and so that

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810
people called in and voted and so that
 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.340
people called in and voted and so that
was really the first big game that I

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
was really the first big game that I
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.010
was really the first big game that I
designed

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020
 
 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.080
 
metropolis magazine which is a design

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090
metropolis magazine which is a design
 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.529
metropolis magazine which is a design
magazine was having a 25th anniversary

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539
magazine was having a 25th anniversary
 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.300
magazine was having a 25th anniversary
issue a couple years ago and they asked

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310
issue a couple years ago and they asked
 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.459
issue a couple years ago and they asked
myself and Franklin so I mentioned and

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469
myself and Franklin so I mentioned and
 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.929
myself and Franklin so I mentioned and
Nick for to know another game designer

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939
Nick for to know another game designer
 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.649
Nick for to know another game designer
in New York to develop a set of games

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659
in New York to develop a set of games
 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.709
in New York to develop a set of games
for the magazine and so we began to

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719
for the magazine and so we began to
 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.050
for the magazine and so we began to
think about well what what is an element

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060
think about well what what is an element
 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.350
think about well what what is an element
of games that if you modified it in a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360
of games that if you modified it in a
 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.300
of games that if you modified it in a
way it could have a dramatic effect on

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
way it could have a dramatic effect on
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.520
way it could have a dramatic effect on
how you would think about games and so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530
how you would think about games and so
 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.529
how you would think about games and so
we just picked the element of time we

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539
we just picked the element of time we
 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.050
we just picked the element of time we
thought well what if we moved away from

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060
thought well what if we moved away from
 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.809
thought well what if we moved away from
this notion and this was a this was in

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819
this notion and this was a this was in
 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.630
this notion and this was a this was in
you know mid 2000s when casual games

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640
you know mid 2000s when casual games
 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.510
you know mid 2000s when casual games
were really blossoming and so the whole

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520
were really blossoming and so the whole
 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.639
were really blossoming and so the whole
idea was people playing games and

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649
idea was people playing games and
 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.029
idea was people playing games and
snapped and snack like sizes so people

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039
snapped and snack like sizes so people
 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.260
snapped and snack like sizes so people
would have five minutes they could play

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270
would have five minutes they could play
 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.609
would have five minutes they could play
a game they would have a minute and so

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619
a game they would have a minute and so
 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.089
a game they would have a minute and so
game design became about shortening the

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099
game design became about shortening the
 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.100
game design became about shortening the
time it would take to play what happened

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110
time it would take to play what happened
 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.580
time it would take to play what happened
if we in long gated that notion of time

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
if we in long gated that notion of time
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.679
if we in long gated that notion of time
and it was a game that might take 25

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689
and it was a game that might take 25
 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.449
and it was a game that might take 25
years to play what would what would that

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459
years to play what would what would that
 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.380
years to play what would what would that
game look like what would that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
game look like what would that
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.750
game look like what would that
experience of play look like how would

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760
experience of play look like how would
 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.670
experience of play look like how would
it change your relationship to the game

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
it change your relationship to the game
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.629
it change your relationship to the game
and slow so the notion of slow games

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639
and slow so the notion of slow games
 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.599
and slow so the notion of slow games
evolved out of that idea so we had one

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609
evolved out of that idea so we had one
 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.370
evolved out of that idea so we had one
game that was called I think it's called

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380
game that was called I think it's called
 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.039
game that was called I think it's called
the last facts and so the whole game was

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049
the last facts and so the whole game was
 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.690
the last facts and so the whole game was
to be the last person in the world to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700
to be the last person in the world to
 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.250
to be the last person in the world to
send a fax we had a game that we

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
send a fax we had a game that we
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.330
send a fax we had a game that we
registered a product barcode in advance

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340
registered a product barcode in advance
 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.729
registered a product barcode in advance
of something ever being invented and the

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739
of something ever being invented and the
 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.900
of something ever being invented and the
person that invented the invention or

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910
person that invented the invention or
 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.640
person that invented the invention or
product that got to use that barcode

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650
product that got to use that barcode
 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.370
product that got to use that barcode
would win the game so there was no sense

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380
would win the game so there was no sense
 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.080
would win the game so there was no sense
of when that barcode might come up in

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
of when that barcode might come up in
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.349
of when that barcode might come up in
the queue of inventions there was a kind

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359
the queue of inventions there was a kind
 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.330
the queue of inventions there was a kind
of crossword puzzle game where there was

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
of crossword puzzle game where there was
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.110
of crossword puzzle game where there was
one clue a year that was given and that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
one clue a year that was given and that
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120
one clue a year that was given and that
it took 25 years to complete the game

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130
it took 25 years to complete the game
 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.159
it took 25 years to complete the game
and then there was a game that had a

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169
and then there was a game that had a
 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:05.099
and then there was a game that had a
drawing of I think it was a donkey that

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109
drawing of I think it was a donkey that
 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.170
drawing of I think it was a donkey that
had headphones on and had some kind of

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180
had headphones on and had some kind of
 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.479
had headphones on and had some kind of
crazy backpack and the idea was that you

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489
crazy backpack and the idea was that you
 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.309
crazy backpack and the idea was that you
would take a piece of paper with that

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319
would take a piece of paper with that
 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.960
would take a piece of paper with that
drawing on it and you would look at it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970
drawing on it and you would look at it
 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.300
drawing on it and you would look at it
and then he would put it away and once a

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310
and then he would put it away and once a
 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.069
and then he would put it away and once a
year once a year you would take out the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079
year once a year you would take out the
 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.439
year once a year you would take out the
folded piece of paper and you would win

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449
folded piece of paper and you would win
 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.840
folded piece of paper and you would win
the game if you had forgotten

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850
the game if you had forgotten
 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.270
the game if you had forgotten
what was on the piece of paper so we

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280
what was on the piece of paper so we
 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.920
what was on the piece of paper so we
were working with the idea of sort of

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
were working with the idea of sort of
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.240
were working with the idea of sort of
memory there that they're always these

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250
memory there that they're always these
 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.560
memory there that they're always these
artifacts that are kind of laying around

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
artifacts that are kind of laying around
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.230
artifacts that are kind of laying around
your house and could you cultivate a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240
your house and could you cultivate a
 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.960
your house and could you cultivate a
game that where the goal is to not

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970
game that where the goal is to not
 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.850
game that where the goal is to not
remember a game piece rather than

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860
remember a game piece rather than
 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.770
remember a game piece rather than
remembering what the what the kind of

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
remembering what the what the kind of
 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.480
remembering what the what the kind of
answer was

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490
 
 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.800
 
we are and there are very very few

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810
we are and there are very very few
 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.230
we are and there are very very few
people that are still playing them they

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240
people that are still playing them they
 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.320
