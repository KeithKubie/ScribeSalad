Speaker 1:          00:01          The Joe Rogan experience. Just as a reminder, I want to give props to American airlines for returning my luggage. Oh, after the whole weekend and they missed that fucking half ounce of weed in my boxing glove. So you're the delivery driver. You were dumb. Fuck that. They lost my movie tie bag. They did. I was going to Columbus to go to the short movie thigh and I brought in the uh, you know my little fucking shin pads and my gloves is some ad raps. He'd been doing that a lot lately. Huh? More than I love it. It's great. Right? I go twice a week. Well I've had, I'm 56, the targets that thing and I take the class where everybody else, I do everything else. I die and I go don't want boxing. Cause Tuesday and Wednesday, Tuesday and Thursdays boxing. Now when you do the class, did they have you spar?

Speaker 1:          00:46          I'm 56 cause I light no headgear. Tapping pop. Yeah, working in a combination shit like that. Saturday, Sundays I go in, there's an open mat. If I'm home, I go on in is a chick that's like an ice cop, an ice cop. Oh no. You know she's, she's a tough chick. Yeah. Yeah. She trains for Brett and the whole thing. If I go down and just let her beat me up to death. Let me ask you this. As someone who was born in another country, how do you think that they should handle the immigrations that are here? Because this is the big question. A lot of people know people that are, I mean probably a lot of people listening know someone who they love that's illegal. Whether they're illegal from Canada or they're illegal from Europe or they're illegal from Mexico, where the fuck, there's a lot of people that get over here and stay over here that aren't supposed to be.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Some of them turn out, turn out to be amazing people. So how do you decide, how do you decide who gets to say and to someone coming over here and trying to make their life better? A better thing, but just doing it illegally. Does that automatically discount them from staying here? That seems crazy. What if they're great. There's a lot of people come over here because they were super unfortunate and where they were born, they, they, they grew up in a shitty place and they wanted to make it better, but they didn't know how to do it. So they came over to America by hook or by crook. They figured out how to get here. They got here and now they're kicking ass. Why? Why would you want to get rid of them? As long as they're not criminals that hurting anybody. Why would you want to get rid of them?

Speaker 1:          02:13          Well, start is, let's do this. That's what's going on right now. Just points the finger at a certain realm of, Oh, you're pointing the finger South of the border. Yeah. It's Canadian. A lot of Canadian. Which, and I'm not saying nothing bad about anybody. This is the United States of America. People come here to fucking have a dream. Yeah. And whatever happens, bro, sometimes a dream goes caput. You know, when I went to New York, I spent three weeks in New York and I Ubered and I did a little thing in my mind, you know, I took 20 Ubers. In fact I became Uber platinum because I was doing, you know, all of these rides, not one white person picked me up, not one time. And guess what? I asked questions, I asked everybody questions and the most inspiring

Speaker 2:          03:00          person I met was one that I worked though. I rapped at six 30 in the morning. There was no way I was getting in the van to go home and I just called Uber. I was Ridgewood, Brooklyn and this Indian girl picked me up. Very cute, you know, six in the fucking morning, it's still kind of dark out, you know, five 30 whatever it was. And this little girl that weighed 90 pounds picked me up, got in the car, hello? We have charger in the back if you want to charge your car and there's little caramels in the front, you know. And I said, where are you from? And she told me India and I go, how long have you been here? A year and a half. Spoke perfect English. Wow. I go, why do you, why did you become a little bit drive? But she doesn't became Uber driver because I was a wasted something Indian restaurant and the guy abused me and he would only pay me eight bucks an hour and take half my tips. So me and my cousins got together. We put away money and we rent a car. We leased a car, my S she drives in the daytime and I drive with at night. Wow. And I drag on, why do you, aren't you scared to go? I at? And she's like, no. She's like, I love it because there's no traffic in it.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Mm. I go, what do you walk with? I just asked her creepy questions. Not sad. Yeah. And it was, I went, I gave her an extra tip like, let me see this. Can you be illegal and do that? Did they check your citizenship? I, I don't know what the status was with her. I didn't ask her. I didn't know if she made me any, but what do you think? Do you think that you could do that? Do you think? Like if you came from another car, you came from Guatemala illegally, you were came over here though and became an Uber driver. Could you do that? Me? No. Can anybody do that or did they check your citizenship? What do you think Jamie?

Speaker 3:          04:49          There's, yes, they can do that.

Speaker 1:          04:51          So someone definitely can come over here and start working for Uber or, or another or a similar, yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:56          I'm not saying that I'm doing that necessarily, like through the proper ways that you can, if you have a legal friend, you can use their license to be the, like the Uber thing and they don't know who's behind the car. So it happens all the time. When I'm ordering food,

Speaker 1:          05:07          you will, you definitely have to have a valid driver's license, right? Yeah. When you get a valid driver's license, if you're illegal.

Speaker 3:          05:13          Oh, that's the part. Like, so I'm saying so like, no, but that doesn't stop someone from getting behind a car if you don't have a license any day.

Speaker 1:          05:20          That's sort of where I'm going with someone to getting in trouble right now is on we on the shit list because we agreed in somebody else to give illegals licenses. That's why I was asking, there was a thought that popped a memory that popped into my head about some story like that, that they were going to give a illegal aliens the right to drive. I'm sort of saying like ed does happen but not above the board basically. Cause it's, yeah, but are you sure? Could you see if they're trying to give illegal aliens driver's licenses? Cause I remember a story like this too as well. People were super upset about it. It's a weird man. 13

Speaker 2:          05:58          States that allow it. There you go, baby. Where do you have to move? What are those States in DC?

Speaker 3:          06:06          Uh, California is the first one as of 2013 Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, everywhere. Their suite. Hawaii, Illinois,

Speaker 2:          06:14          Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico. Your interests.

Speaker 3:          06:17          Yeah, everywhere. There's weed.

Speaker 2:          06:19          Hawaii doesn't necessarily have Vermont. I think Hawaii is very close to that business standpoint. They work for cheaper and work harder than, you know. I mean, there's so many benefits to as a business owner and different, I mean, when was the last time you saw a white laborer? You see him, you go in the kitchen and at any restaurant it's all you know. I mean, and so now you, now you, you questioning what rights you have as an American. You come here, you got a job, you're working hard, you stay out of trouble, you stay out of trouble, you mind your business, you know, I mean, I grew up, you and I grew up in the East coast where you go to a Chinese restaurant and you'd see them, the husband and wife working and the kids would be doing homework at the back table.

Speaker 2:          07:09          And if you came in the daytime, it was a different couple, which is telling me that two couples got together, they buy a home and they opened a business together and they work together. That's what those immigrant groups do. And then from there they bring a cousin and they open the open. And next thing you know, they got three houses on the block and now he just had a fucking immigrant family move into your neighborhood. Not necessarily good or bad. You know what I'm saying? That that nice. We all had them in our neighborhoods. Sure. I remember 70 years ago, this is your grandparents, so you have to think about your grandparents. How would you want them to treat it? I'm sure your grandpa father got a job, lame Rick way before he got his immigration papers. I don't know how they did it right.

Speaker 2:          07:51          I think they got it pretty quick. You get through Ellis Island and they push boy shoot drew. I mean the legal situation, it was a different world back then. You could immigrate pretty easily. Like my grandparents weren't rocket scientists when they came over here. They were kids. They're there, their parents weren't geniuses. Do you know what's going on with farmers? Do you know what's going on in South America right now? Nicaragua, Honduras, all those places. Pure hell, pure hell. You know, I can't be mad at you for wanting to get the fuck out of there, but there's other places on earth right now. Well, this PO fucking hell going on. Yeah, there's places trying to come over to, let's point everybody out. Let's lock all the fucking borders. Don't make it seem like it's just Mexico. That's the fucking problem. You know, we're getting bombarded from everywhere. We'll get new people in here every day from everywhere. I ain't mad at it. They come in here to make better lives, but don't just keep pointing the fucking water that you know. Who else is coming through that Mexican border that nobody's about. Jamie,

Speaker 1:          08:56          when you get a minute, if you'd love to check it, just to verify me. You know how many Cubans and getting sent back to cube on a daily basis from New Mexico? Really getting back to go shot. But Cubans when they come to a why they're not coming through, they're closed, all that type of shit. What? So right now you can't come through Miami. It's easier to come. Go from Cuba to Mexico and just join the walk. Whoa. And walk up. But once that happens are in America, we give them asylum. Right? Right. The tag. But does that still going on? I think RO Bama removed it. Did he really? Yes. Trump made it so we can't go over there and then you go [inaudible] pack Mexican shelters hoping people are going through Mexico. That's crazy. I think I the lumber a couple of weeks ago, I think 900 Cubans are getting sent back weekly to get shot.

Speaker 1:          09:47          Does you think more people, more people or make it towards the border since Trump was like, build that wall, build that wall. Do you think more people are headed towards the border now because it's just like it's a popular thing to do. It's a part of our culture. A part of the conversation is the border wall, right? Like do you want a border wall or do you not want to build that wall and make it a fucking million feet high, bring it right to that top of the earth. Or are you one of those people that thinks anybody should be able to come over here and have a better life? You know, and this, those two ideas of fucking clashing left and right. Some people think that people should be able to try to do better, try to better themselves. They should have the opportunity.

Speaker 1:          10:24          And then some people think, fuck them, you were born somewhere else. You don't ever get a chance to come over here, go, go in through proper channels, which is almost impossible. Do something that's very valuable to us over here. See, that's the thing. Like if you're a person who has some extraordinary skill, you know, you could probably get American citizenship easier, you know, unusual. If you contributing to the physics department at Harvard or something like that and you're, you know, you were born in Germany or wherever, you probably get citizenship a little bit quicker than you're just a guy who like lives in Guatemalan, wants to come to America because he thinks he can advance his life. You think he can get better, whereas where he lives, there's no, you can't go anywhere. You're stuck. The poverty is extreme. The crimes extreme and he wants none of that.

Speaker 1:          11:09          He wants to do better. So he makes it over here. I'm like, listen, when you talk about immigration, you're going to get good and bad from every show. You know, Castro was 79 opened up this prisons in the Mario and you got 100,000 Cubans and I'm like a thousand fucking spoiled rotten savages from Cuban prisons where they were no clothes and this, they have to shit in a hole in the middle of the floor. This averages, they're animals. They got no problem taking your life from a piece of toilet paper. But the same one's true from other countries. We get the good and the bad from other country, you know, let's not beat around the Bush before Russians come here, they got a course, they go to a school and to take the 12 week course on how to come and get money right off the bat.

Speaker 1:          11:55          How did I go to social security? Check that out, Jamie. That's a very weird one. They get taught how to come here and scam the system. Whether you want to call a scan, I'm not putting nobody down. I have a tons of Russian friends. I love them. I'm not saying them bad, but I've heard that's a fact. I've heard them from them. I have a friend who's married and she told me one day that before they come here, they'd take a course to prep them on how to get money. As soon as they land, three days after they get them, they land. They get caching and Dola paperwork. What to say? They coach. That's hilarious. It's like a service that they offer. Yeah. Some type of class, the system works, but, but if you want to send the system, they'll tell you how to do it.

Speaker 1:          12:41          That's how many Armenians come over. Come over, get citizenship. Guess what they do? They get social security and they move back to our meeting and they get the check sent back to our media. They have a system on how to do that. They've got a thousand loopholes now, brother. And if you learn those loopholes, you could cave the fucking system. There's nothing wrong with having a group of people that all agree on certain rules, right. Which is what the United States should be. But the problem with having a group of people is you, you don't get to pick like who's in that group. So you just deciding instead of being admitted by your merit or how how good a neighbor you are or how nice of a person you are. Now you just, whether or not you were born on the dirt like that, were you born on this dirt or that dirt cause you're born on that dirt.

Speaker 1:          13:28          You can't stay. But if you're born on this dirt, even if you're a shit human being, you get to hang out, you get to ruin other people's lives while you're here. As long as you don't do enough that we need to put you in a cage. And then if we do, we keep you for a couple of years and let you out and you do more. I mean this is, we have no problem with that. I don't know what, uh, what the percentage is. What the fuck was I going? I dunno. I almost thought it was what you said is a good people versus bad people that come in to across the border. The thing is, every time there's a bad one that comes across the border, it's highlighted as an example of why we got to keep the border closed and they have a point. They all have a point.

Speaker 1:          14:05          Absolutely. When you see someone who is talking about illegal gang members, they're sneaking across the border and murdering people, it absolutely has happened. It's 100% of a real thing. This is not, not fiction questions. How much does it happen? And uh, how much better is it for those people's lives that make it across? Is there a way to screen better to make sure that the bad people don't come in and all of these questions are legitimate. You know, you don't want a bunch of fucking evil vicious people from another country in your neighborhood. That's how everybody feels. You don't want your children, your family to be in danger because someone's knock across the border and they have a long history of working for the cartel, murdering people. That's a real thing. That's a real possibility. So all the people that are vigilant, all the people that are scared, you know, they're probably smart to be scared. Look at fucking human history. People are capable of doing some awful

Speaker 2:          14:52          shit. No one's saying I'm not. I don't think there should be no, no wall at all. Nothing stopping people from coming across. You definitely don't want pieces of shit coming over here. That's how I find out. Did you ever notice that? Maybe we'll full. Yeah, we're probably, maybe we'll fall. Did you notice that when you go on, there's homeless people on Ventura fucking Boulevard on Lankershim Boulevard under bridges everywhere. Has that ever come to your mind that a way you go, there's cars everywhere and the between Uber and Lyft and cabs, now there's trafficking. Every major fucking city. There's lock or whatever. Did you give notice that? Maybe it's not that I hate Cubans or Mexicans or Puerto Ricans or blacks and Germans. Irish maybe that will fucking fall. Have you ever come to that conclusion? Yeah, we're just full right now. Yeah. We have to take five years off.

Speaker 2:          15:41          Like I would accept that. I would accept that. I would accept special circumstances, like why are you have family here? But at this point right now, we'll fucking fall. We'll fall. We don't have nowhere else to put anymore. We really don't look at eddies unless we pack them all to Iowa and send them all, you know, send them all into my, where's the highest population of Mexicans in the country? I would probably say Southern California. Wrong. Indiana. Chicago. Chicago. Yeah. Hi. They farm a ton of shit up in Chicago, Illinois. You know, where's the highest population of Puerto Ricans? The Bronx. You're wrong. Cleveland clinic. Because in the 50s they shipped, they all the dealers were with uh, taking Puerto Ricans and putting them to the Cleveland, Ohio area to work in the fucking Ford plants and all those plants. And after all those places sat down, all those people sitting there holding on to that Dick.

Speaker 2:          16:44          When you go to certain parts where Ohio, there's a suburb outside of Cleveland, 12 fucking Puerto Rican. Wow. You know, interesting. But it's, I don't think of it as we hate Russians or German and Chinese. I look at it from a different spread back through the times and maybe will flow, you know, it's for me to send my daughter to date cam cost rebills a week. I'm not complaining. It's a great day. Kids a science camp, they make potions. They learn about light bulbs and electricity. My point is I did the same thing for free when I was a kid. All I had to do was walk to my park. There's no funds left. There's nothing left for these kids. You know, I dunno when I walk into a Dodger game or an event, I go, I always think of the family of four in America today that both parents have to work.

Speaker 2:          17:34          Yeah. And everybody has to work. If you go by my office with a podcast in the middle, is that a 24 hour daycare? And many times I'll leave my office at midnight and I see parents picking up their kids, carrying them out over their shoulders into that car. You know, at the cost a lot to control the American family. There's not a lot of jobs. Why didn't you see everybody's driving Uber? If you take Uber. Uber's is interesting. I'm thinking of doing a documentary. I'm just going overs and talking to these people and ask them why they're Uber. Yesterday I had an engineer engineer lost his job. 58 years old, got to work. Asian fellow. Very nice. I've tipped him extra. He offered me to plug the phone. I mean, you know. Yeah. You have to look at that and go, wow, that's a lot of people in this country without work. There's a lot of fucking homeless people and we're running out of money to take care of what we got here.

Speaker 4:          18:37          [inaudible].
