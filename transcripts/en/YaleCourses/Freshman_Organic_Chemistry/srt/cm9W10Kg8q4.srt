1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,760
So as we ended last time,
we said despite Erin Shaw,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,210
which says you can't have
these Lewis structures might,

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:12,720
they're really be shared
pair bonds and lone pairs.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,210
And how do we know we
have to look or feel?

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,170
So the last time we tried feeling
with scanning probe microscopy,

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:23,910
AFM STM snob there are really great,
you can see atoms,

7
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:28,470
you can see molecules,
but you can't see bonds.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,910
Okay,
so what's the key word here?

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,960
Luxe, right? So maybe we'll
see it if we can't feel it.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,410
Now this is the entrance to this building,

11
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,050
the old delivery entrance
out on prospect street.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,950
And you know there's interesting stuff
all over the building. Up here on the top,

13
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,940
there's a fluted filter
paper and a funnel,

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,840
but hidden back in the
shadows is something that's
a little surprising to you

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,530
back there,
which is a microscope.

16
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:09,180
What science do you associate that
with biology and not chemistry,

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,510
right? What's it doing? Well, at
least it's back in the shadows,

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,100
but maybe the eyeball up there says
we can see the things we can't feel.

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,360
Okay, here's a, this is a picture.
Does anybody recognize this?

20
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,440
When it came from.
It's from Robert Hooks.

21
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:35,940
Great Book Micrographia from 1665.
It's a wonderful book.

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,070
It's a page.
The page is about this big.

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,530
And imagine the people who had fleas
seeing that for the first time.

24
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,850
It's exquisite. This, this a
drawing and he said in the book,

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,900
but nature is not to be limited
by our narrow comprehension.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Future improvements of glasses may yet
further enlighten our understanding and

27
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:02,991
ocular inspection may demonstrate that
which is yet we may think too extravagant

28
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,540
either to feign or to suppose.

29
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,250
So if he had a microscope
that could do that in 1665,

30
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,350
we must have a microscope.

31
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:18,000
Now that's powerful enough to see bonds.
Right?

32
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,250
And in fact,
we do,

33
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:25,251
in fact there's a brand new one that's
that they promise will come online next

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,270
Tuesday in a room about a
hundred yards over that way. Uh,

35
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,840
and but,
and that,

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,220
the trick it uses is the same one Hook
Newton used to measure the distance of

37
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:43,530
the air gap for Newton's rings or
that Hook explained by the pulses,

38
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,610
right? And it's interference
that comes from scattering.

39
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,890
So you've seen oil on water,
thin layers of oil on water,

40
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:56,400
and you see rainbows in them. Why? Okay,

41
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:01,270
so light comes in and scatters from
two surfaces that let's say our 200

42
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,060
nanometers apart.
Okay?

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,440
So the path difference between the one
that reflects from the top and the one

44
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,040
that reflects from the bottom,
the difference is 400 nanometers.

45
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,530
One goes 400 and the meters
further than the other.

46
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,290
Now suppose that happened
to be one wavelength, right?

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,000
Then if that purple light that came
in one going further than the other,

48
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,510
they would come out
exactly one wave apart.

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
So it would be as if it were a single way,

50
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:34,960
but they would reinforce one another and
you'd see the purple lights strongly.

51
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,260
Okay? But if the wavelength
difference where it half we're,

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,250
we're, we're half. If the path
difference, we're half the wavelength,

53
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,820
like for Red Light.
Oh,

54
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,920
what did we do here?
Elaine?

55
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,170
Better get it quick or something comes up.

56
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,620
You're a good sport.

57
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,490
Okay, thank you. Okay, so here we go.

58
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,400
If it's one wavelength path difference,

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,180
then it reinforces and we got a
nice strong way of coming out.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,040
But if it's half a wavelength difference,
like for the red light,

61
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,680
then they cancel. One is a maximum one,
the other's a minimum and there's zero.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,710
Okay,
so you get no scattering.

63
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,070
So that's why you get different colors
because the oil is different thicknesses

64
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:45,890
in different parts of the slick.
Okay,

65
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:48,670
so here's the new machine that's right
over here that's supposed to come out,

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,190
do machines. Actually there are
two of them. It was a package deal.

67
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,150
And that's Chris.
I in car veto,

68
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:58,550
who's the director of the
chemical instrumentation
center and the proud owner of

69
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,050
these two new machines.

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,540
So the one he's looking at there is
a user op is to be operated by users.

71
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:10,250
So it's just you sort of pushed buttons
and you get where the atoms are in the

72
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,770
molecule, right? At least that's the hope.

73
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
And it costs about $200,000 okay,

74
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:19,700
so there's a little thread
there that has a crystal on,

75
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,670
but you need a magnifying glass to see it.
You won't see it with your eyes.

76
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,520
It's a tiny, tiny crystal. Okay. So the,

77
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:28,940
here's the x Ray tube rays,
come down the pipe there,

78
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:33,620
hit the crystal and get scattered
and are detected by this CCD detector

79
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,410
dirt.
Okay?

80
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,120
And then from that information,
those scattered rays,

81
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,620
you get where the atoms
are in the molecule more
precisely as you'll see where

82
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:47,100
the electrons are in the
molecule or in the crystal.

83
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,540
The other machine that he is
especially proud of cost 350 k.

84
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,830
And why is it more expensive?
Because it collects more.

85
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,700
Instead of using that
little disk of a CCD,

86
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,000
it has a curved image plate,
right?

87
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,300
So when the x rays come down
here and hit the tiny crystal,

88
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,130
many more of them get collected by
the plate. So it's more efficient.

89
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,150
Okay?
So those will be coming soon.

90
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,410
And if all you have to do is press a
button and the structure comes out,

91
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,890
that seems fine. But that's not the
goal of this course. The press a button.

92
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,800
We want to understand
how such a thing works.

93
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,530
Seeing individual molecules,
atoms, maybe bonds,

94
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,470
there's a problem.
And the problem is wavelength.

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,090
Because you know,

96
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:44,091
if in principle you can't resolve
things that are closer together than the

97
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:46,340
wavelength of light.

98
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,110
And the wavelength of light we've been
talking about here is 400 800 nanometers.

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,470
Whereas how, what's the distance
of a carbon carbon bond?

100
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,870
Anybody remember one and a
half angst drummers, right?

101
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:03,950
So three orders of magnitude smaller
than the wavelength of light.

102
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,890
So this is a problem and
it's why as you'll see,

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,550
you use rays because they
have short wavelength.

104
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,550
Now to understand this, we'd have to
know what light is. So what is light?

105
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,880
You people have studied physics and so on.

106
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,230
So what's like Wilson? Who knows? Okay?

107
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,950
It's an electromagnetic wave.
Okay,

108
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,020
now I've seen deed. It is,

109
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,860
I've seen waves on the ocean,
right?

110
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,190
Does it mean that the electromagnetic
waves are like those waves?

111
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,720
In what way is an
electromagnetic wave a wave?

112
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,570
What's wavy about it?
Well,

113
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,210
you can make a graph that's
a wave that involves light.

114
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,650
So here what we're going to plot
is the force on a charge, right?

115
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,100
The charges is a particular position.

116
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,820
We'll have the charge over there
on the right. It's fixed there.

117
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,620
And we're gonna measure the force on it.
That'll make it accelerate up or down.

118
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,540
Okay. And it'll go. And if you have hopes,

119
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,420
this doesn't work quite the way it
does on mine, you please let me know.

120
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,720
And things like that happen anyhow. Oh
No, maybe it's going to work. Oh No,

121
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:34,550
I see what happened. Yeah. Okay. Uh, what
that first thing did was went up and down,

122
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,440
up and down. Up and down. Okay.

123
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,420
But if you plot a thin as a function
of time, it's a, it's a wave,

124
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,680
right?

125
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,680
The field at a particular point as a
function of time is a way it goes up then

126
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:53,230
down then up and down. Okay. Now,

127
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,140
so what we plot the field or the force
on a charge at one position as a function

128
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:58,830
of time.

129
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,730
But there's another way of making a
plot that also shows light as a wave,

130
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,060
which is the show the field at
different places at the same time.

131
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,820
Right? So we're going to change it. And
now the horizontal axis is the position,

132
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,260
but it's at a particular instant.
So as the thing goes along,

133
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:23,580
there are different forces
at different positions. Okay.

134
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,800
And that again,
that will be a wave.

135
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,520
So that's the sense in which
light is a wave light is.

136
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,080
And what is it that that we're plotting,
we're plotting the electric field.

137
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,690
So light is associated with an electric
field that goes up and down, right?

138
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,770
And you can plot it in time
or in space and get away.

139
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,860
So that's the sense in which it's a way,

140
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,230
it's also incidentally a magnetic field.

141
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:52,680
It's electromagnetic that Maxwell
dealt with, things like that.

142
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,010
And there's a magnetic field
perpendicular to the electric field,

143
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,060
but we don't care about it,

144
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,010
at least not until next semester when we
talk about a nuclear magnetic resonance,

145
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,190
because the electric field is
so much stronger in its effect,

146
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:11,191
dog molecules on now it's effect
is on charges on electrons,

147
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,420
on protons. Okay. Therefore on nuclei now,

148
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,480
accelerated electrons scatter light.

149
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,050
So here comes the light in.
We'll see if this works.

150
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,460
Okay.
So it makes the,

151
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,690
it makes the electron go up
and down as the light goes by.

152
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,130
But up and down,

153
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:39,990
moving of electron excelerator
electrons is what creates electric fee.

154
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,020
Put creates electric fields,
right? That's what an antenna is,

155
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,540
is electrons moving back and forth.

156
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,720
So when the original light comes
through and hits the electron,

157
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:51,330
make it vibrate up and down,
right?

158
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,440
That Electron vibrating emits radiation,

159
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,100
electromagnetic radiation in
all directions, all directions,

160
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,530
except this direction and stronger.

161
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,340
The more you're perpendicular to the
direction and slow going up and down.

162
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,900
But anyhow,
it scatters the light.

163
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,680
So most of the lights still
goes through the direct beam,

164
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,580
but a little bit of it gets scattered.
Much less would be scattered.

165
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:17,340
I've been a single electron
wouldn't scatter very much.

166
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,840
You need lots of electrons to scattered
a lot and they have to be cooperating.

167
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,300
Okay,
now you tell me,

168
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,870
why are we interested in
electron scattering light?

169
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,770
They're just as many protons in
a sample as there are electrons.

170
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,650
Why don't we worry about the
Proton scattering the light?

171
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,790
So what
the electrons are,

172
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:49,240
what moves you need the movie in charge
to generate the scattered light. The, the,

173
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,630
the, the, the lightest,

174
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,700
a positive charge things
are uh, I mean, uh,

175
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,700
abnormal particles are thousand
times heavier than electrons,

176
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,320
so they don't move very much.
It's the electrons that scatter the light.

177
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,920
So with x rays, you see
electrons, not nuclei,

178
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,370
okay, they're too heavy now then,

179
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:15,880
but then you need a lot of electrons to
scatter enough to see and they have to

180
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:20,380
cooperate, right? So here
we have ripples on a pond.

181
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:21,220
You've also seen,

182
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,220
you've all seen that kind of thing
with a little bit of rain falling.

183
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,410
And so suppose you had two spots that
are generating ripples to electrons,

184
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:30,190
let's say.

185
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,190
And they give off a circular waves here
in two dimensions and they interfere

186
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:40,190
with one another. But you can see a
pattern is emerging and when you're very,

187
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:44,400
very far away from these compared to
the distance between the electrons as

188
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,700
indeed you are in these samples were
talking about where you have an infinite

189
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,090
testable crystal and the detector played
is a substantial distance away, right?

190
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,540
The electrons are really close to
one another. Uh, so you're way, way,

191
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,890
way far away on the scale of the
distance between the electrodes. Okay?

192
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,160
And now you can see what pattern there
is for high points and low points for

193
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:07,780
waves.
Okay?

194
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,550
Cause you can see here that there's a
pattern like that that goes along the

195
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,800
Maxima.
Everybody see that?

196
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,940
And halfway in between those
days, those days, yellow lines,

197
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,040
there's no change at all.
Nothing's happening there,
right? And if you go out very,

198
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,730
very far away, you can see that
as some topically these approach,

199
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,560
these straight lines that
originate between the electrons
or on the crystal in a

200
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,400
real case.

201
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So what you have coming out of the
crystal are straight rays of light.

202
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,580
Ex-Ray light,
okay.

203
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,970
And the angles at which they come out
depend on where the electrons are.

204
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,350
The electrons are closer together or
further apart or displaced in this

205
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,720
direction. You'll get different
patterns of the ripples.

206
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,150
So somehow it must be possible or
there must be a connection between the

207
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,160
positions of the electrons and
where are these rays are coming out,

208
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,840
right?

209
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,840
And if you can go backwards to go from
where the rain has come out to where the

210
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:18,640
electrons were, then you've
solved the problem, right?

211
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,050
You're not creating an image the way
you would with a normal microscope.

212
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,010
You're trying to to
interpret the scattering.

213
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,600
So the angular intensity distribution at
great distance depends on the scatterer

214
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,640
distribution at the origin
that is in the crystal. Now,

215
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,330
if you have normal light and a
lens like Hooke's microscope,

216
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,110
then that you can use
these lenses to refocus it.

217
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,300
So the same information is coming out.

218
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:52,460
The sample there is emitting these rays,

219
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:58,030
but lens collects them and refocuses
them to make an enlarged image that you

220
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,340
then observe.
Right?

221
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,790
The problem is that you
can't do that with x-rays.

222
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,060
People are making efforts
now with nanofabrication
kind of things to make things

223
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:14,960
that will act like lenses for
X-ray's and they've made some steps,

224
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:19,040
but nothing like you would need to
actually observe electrons in the crystal.

225
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,470
Okay. Be sure to read. There's a
webpage if some of you read it so far,

226
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,100
that has to do with what I'm lecturing on
now, which will help you a lot I think.

227
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,960
So look for that.
So we're interested in seeing molecules,

228
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:37,430
atoms, bonds collectively
by x Ray crystallography.

229
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:38,264
That is,

230
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,900
we're not seeing the image
of individual electrons.

231
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,910
We're seeing the scattering that comes
from all the electrons acting together,

232
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,310
so we're not seeing them one at the time.

233
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,600
We're seeing something collective
about them so that for example,

234
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:01,560
a real sample or a sort of fake sample
of benzene which had a bunch of carp,

235
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:04,850
six carbon atoms in a ring might
look like this at any given time.

236
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
It's sort of regular,

237
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:10,640
but things are a little bit one way
or the other vibrating and so on.

238
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,133
Okay.

239
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Now you wouldn't see this in x-ray
because everything is cooperating in what

240
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:18,021
you're getting.

241
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:21,860
You'd see some sort of average of all
of them and it would be a little bit

242
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,350
smeared because of that.
Right?

243
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:28,580
You don't see an issue with scanning
probe microscopy with these sharp tips.

244
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,810
You actually can feel individual Adams,
and if one atom is someplace else,

245
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:36,290
you'll see it, you'll feel it
there. That's not true. An X ray,

246
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,400
you see an averaged structure
and it's averaged in two ways.

247
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,310
There's blurring from
motion and from defects.

248
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:45,650
There's one benzine
molecule missing there.

249
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,250
It's time average because it
took you time to collect these,

250
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,290
this information with synchrotrons
and really, really intense, uh, beams.

251
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,470
People are trying to get faster
and faster data collection,

252
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,750
but still what you see as time averaged
on the scale of how fast the atoms are

253
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:03,830
moving in your sample.

254
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,390
So it's time averaged what you
get and it's also space averaged,

255
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,870
right? It's as if you put them
all on top of one another.

256
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,040
That's what you would see.

257
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,380
But some are displaced a little
one way or the other and so on.

258
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:18,260
So it's a little fuzzy.
Okay.

259
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,920
And that this is an advantage
for scanning probe microscopy,

260
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:26,810
which operates in real space, actually
feels individual things. Okay.

261
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:31,790
So x rays were discovered in 1895 by
Redken using cruxes tube that we talked

262
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,470
about.
Okay.

263
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:38,471
He took a picture of his wife's hand
there for our rent goods hand in 1896 but

264
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:40,580
what do you see is,

265
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:45,530
is not a picture that you can blow up
like with a microscope because it's just a

266
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,040
shadow.
It's all this.

267
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,560
All the bones do is stop the x rays
that are going through so you don't get

268
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,080
something that's enlarged,
right?

269
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,580
You're not going to be able to use it
the way you use medical x-rays. Okay,

270
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,600
but in 1912 marksman Laowei
invented ex-ray diffraction,

271
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,200
right? Which is the scattering and
detect, not trying to focus things,

272
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,580
not using a shadow,

273
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,540
but looking at these rays that come
out and try to figure out from them

274
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,610
something about what the outcomes were.
And that's his diffraction picture.

275
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,870
That's what you'd see on that.

276
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,380
Remember there was that round CCD
plate that's on this new machine.

277
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,840
You might get a pattern that
looked sort of like that.

278
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,400
That was copper sulfate in 1912 but
the real breakthrough was by William

279
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,950
Lawrence Burns,
who was 22 years old.

280
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,530
He had just graduated
from Cambridge University.

281
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:45,531
When he determined the structure of a
crystal using Lowery's X-ray diffraction

282
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:50,220
pattern. So he figured out how to
go the other way to go from the,

283
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,380
from the x-rays scattered pattern to
what the Adams were that we're doing it

284
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,760
right.

285
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,760
And he did this in 1912 when he was 22
years old and he got the Nobel prize in

286
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:06,180
1915 he's still the youngest
Nobel laureate. Right?

287
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,880
His son gave me permission
to use this picture.

288
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,780
It was very nice guy lives in Cambridge.
Okay.

289
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,290
Then of course we've come
a long way from that.

290
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,970
I think you probably recognize
this picture, right? What is it?

291
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,350
It's the scattering from Da.
Is it a picture of DNA?

292
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,010
No,
it's not a double helix.

293
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,520
What it is is the way X-ray's come out
when they hit the double helix and you

294
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:39,390
have to figure backwards and that's what
Couric was able to do and we'll discuss

295
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,830
how he did that.
Okay.

296
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:45,600
So that's 1952 40 years
after brags discovery.

297
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,530
And then in just in 2000 not so long ago,

298
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,710
this has gone to the complete structure
of the ribosomes at 2.4 Ostrom's write a

299
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:58,890
resolution, which was done here at Yale
in this building and the next building.

300
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,320
Okay?
And that's what it looks like.

301
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:05,430
It has 25 nanometers across 250 on strums.

302
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,780
As long as whatever number that is,
lots of carbon carbon bonds.

303
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,340
And you see all those atoms there are
greater than 100,000 Adam's not counting

304
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:17,190
the hydrogens,
incidentally.

305
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,690
Why is it easier to see other
atoms then to see hydrogens?

306
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,440
Because that's where the electrons are.
Hydrogens come with only one electron.

307
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,840
Other items come with lots of electrons.

308
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,640
So it's hard to see hydrogens much
easier to see the other things. Okay,

309
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:39,510
now what can electron diffraction
show x ray to fraction show?

310
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,930
That's what we want to know.
Can it show molecules? Yeah.

311
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,680
Can it show Adams?
Apparently I just showed you a picture.

312
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,020
But what we really want to know is whether
it can show bonds and whether Lewis

313
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,970
was right.
So to understand this,

314
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,760
we have to know how diffraction works.
Oh,

315
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:00,670
you could just be like the people that
are going punch the button on that

316
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,700
machine, but that's not what I think
you wouldn't be satisfied with.

317
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,870
So I'll help you out.

318
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,200
Yeah,

319
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,830
so like all right, x rays or
waves, they just are very short.

320
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,760
So now I'm going to demonstrate
with a machine here,

321
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,010
which was designed for an
overhead projector, but I
believe it's gonna work here.

322
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,160
Okay,
so here are waves.

323
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,450
Okay.
Okay.

324
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,630
So here's a wave coming in,
okay?

325
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,640
And when it gets to this position, it
hits an electron here on an electron here.

326
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,710
Forget this one from now. Okay?
Everybody got me at a given time.

327
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,541
This,
the,

328
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:57,390
these two electrons are being pushed up
that they're going to be pushed down as

329
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:01,710
this wave passes by. Okay? Now as
those two get pushed up and down,

330
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,430
they give off waves in
almost all directions,

331
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,100
all directions for our purposes.
Okay?

332
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,240
So they give off waves in all
different directions. Right?
Now notice the one, the,

333
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,681
the,
the,

334
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:18,681
the part of that scattered x-ray that
goes straight forward in the same

335
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:19,910
direction,

336
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,840
the original light came in is bound
to be in phase with one another,

337
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,040
right? And we can test that
with this line here, right?

338
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,050
Because if they're going right,
straight ahead,

339
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,810
this one is a maximum when
this one is a maximum.

340
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,720
Everybody with me on
that and it'll keep that.

341
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:39,870
So you'll get scattering by
both of them cooperating,

342
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:43,200
coming out if it's straight ahead.
But how about if it's at an angle?

343
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,130
Okay, so I can push this up and change
the angle. How about at that angle?

344
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,470
How much light is going to be coming
out from the, from these two electrons?

345
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,760
None. They exactly
cancel each other, right?

346
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,760
But if I go to this angle now, they're
just as strong as they were originally,

347
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,250
right? And then it'll go weak, weak, weak,
weak or weakest, nothing. Then stronger,

348
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:12,960
stronger, stronger, stronger,
very strong, weak or weaker,
weaker, weaker, weaker, zero.

349
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,730
So there'll be a modular as you go out
at different angles here going either up

350
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,710
or down,
it'll be strong.

351
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:24,360
Then we then nothing then strong than
nothing strong than nothing. Right.

352
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,790
So now what will determine

353
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,170
what will determine how reg,

354
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,200
how frequently these angles recur
at which reinforcement occurs?

355
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,150
Is that clear? The question?
What determines the angles?

356
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,390
Yeah. Pardon me. Obviously the waypoints.

357
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,920
What if the way boys were
very, very, very short,

358
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,590
then you'd get lots of,

359
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,200
you wouldn't have to move very much
before the next one came in. Right?

360
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:57,850
If they were very good. What
else determines it? Besides
the wavelength? Yeah, John,

361
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,080
the distance. That's what we're
really interested in is using this.

362
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,520
No way in the wavelength of the
x-rays using this to measure distance.

363
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,410
Okay. Now let's forget the one on the
bottom here. Let's put this one in.

364
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,750
Okay. Now, okay, for reference,

365
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:19,130
let's look at the bottom of a second.

366
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,940
So the first reinforcement came here
between the top one and the bottom one.

367
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,810
Everybody with me? How about for
the top one in the middle one?

368
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,100
Where did the first one come?

369
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,970
You had to go to a higher angle there
to get reinforcement between the top in

370
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,970
the middle. Right? So the
closer things are together,

371
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,320
the fewer the angles are
everybody with me on that?

372
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,180
Notice that's a reciprocal relationship.

373
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,780
The closer things are in
what we call real space.

374
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,400
The distance between the electrons,

375
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,680
the further apart are the rays
that come out in angle, okay?

376
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,170
So it's backwards.
Closer together,

377
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,580
further apart in what's
called reciprocal space, okay?

378
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:12,581
Now suppose you had a whole row of
electrons that were evenly spaced.

379
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,940
Okay, so here's the first, the second, the
third. Now we'll take all three of them,

380
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,090
right?
And what you notice is that as that,

381
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,160
as we go out, it gets weaker,
weaker, weaker, weaker,
weaker, weaker, weaker, weaker.

382
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:30,650
We here.
Now when we get to the angle here,

383
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,260
where are the first and the third
were very strong. What do we see now?

384
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,620
The one in the middle
cancels the first one,

385
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,260
and if we're a very long row of them,

386
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,420
the fourth one would camp this here.
The second one cancels the first one,

387
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,490
the fourth would cancel the third, the
sixth would cancel the fifth and so on.

388
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,020
And you wouldn't get anything,
right?

389
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,530
But then you'd get it again
when you got to the second,

390
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,910
the one that would have been the
second row, the second angle,

391
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,730
if it was just one in three,
right.

392
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,010
We'll be strong because this one halfway
in between we'll, we'll reinforce, right?

393
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,690
So closer together or further apart.

394
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,480
And if you have a whole row
of equally spaced things,

395
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,670
they'll all be together according to
whatever the distance between successive

396
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:24,530
ones is. Yes. Shy what the

397
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,660
cause electrons to be
spaced. Exactly. Evenly

398
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,780
crystal x Ray crystallography. Right?

399
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,950
So that's why you use crystals.
Okay.

400
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:43,950
That's what we want to say
here. I think. So let me

401
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,690
turn that off for now.

402
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,593
There we go.

403
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,090
Now if I can handle this thing,

404
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,900
there we go.
That good.

405
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,960
Okay.
So that's the wave machine.

406
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,600
And if you want to do it in
the privacy of your room,

407
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:13,810
you can go to this website at stony brook
and download something that allows you

408
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:18,290
to run a Java applet that does
sort of this kind of thing.

409
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,040
Uh, this, if you blow it up in there,

410
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,250
the waves look sort of
funny there at the Adams.

411
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,110
And the reason is because you're
majoring the the phase perpendicular to

412
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,790
different directions of the wave.

413
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,050
That's just to help you
out if you'd try this and,

414
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:37,700
and have and are confused by that.
Okay.

415
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:42,230
Now there are, so suppose you have
just an arbitrary set of electrons

416
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,640
and the waves coming in and hitting them.

417
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,510
What directions will you
get reinforcement in? Well,

418
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:55,511
there are two directions that you're
guaranteed no matter what the spacing is.

419
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,620
Okay? And that's this. Here comes
the here, the light comes in

420
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,390
and goes out.
So the direct beam,

421
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,780
you have the same path because one of
them gets hit earlier but has a longer

422
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:15,290
path coming out and the
other one gets hit later.

423
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,060
But it has a shorter path coming out.

424
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,780
So they're guaranteed to be exactly in
phase if they're scattering straight

425
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:22,370
ahead.
Okay?

426
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,120
But only a little of the
light is getting scattered.

427
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,590
Most of it is the direct
beam. So you don't even notice
the difference from that.

428
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,350
So that's not very exciting.

429
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,810
But there's another angle at which your
sure that these two are going to be in

430
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:43,070
phase. And that's this angle. Now,

431
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:48,030
how do we get to that angle? Uh, I,

432
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,760
I've lost some of the, uh,
since you downloaded that,

433
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:55,900
there's some more stuff in here now,
but uh, so now I can't quite remember.

434
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,270
Let me just try. Okay, so this is,

435
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,350
this blue line here is called
the scattering vector and
that's how different the

436
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:08,260
Arrow coming out is from
the Arrow going in, right?

437
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,240
That's just the funny mathematical or
geometric thing that people have defined.

438
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,900
They call it the scattering
vector. Right? Now, this,

439
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,410
this length is exactly
the same as that link.

440
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,830
This link is exactly the same as that leg.

441
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,730
And when you turn it a given angle,
those two will,

442
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,450
the vector between those
will be perpendicular to
the direction they're going

443
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,510
and they'll be in phase again,
right?

444
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,670
And if you draw the line
that connects the two points,

445
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,840
right? Notice the scattering vector
is perpendicular to that line.

446
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,120
So you say that,
that,

447
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:52,270
that this incoming wave was
scattered perpendicular to the,

448
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,660
to this line.
That's how a mirror works.

449
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,260
The things that are in that,
that,

450
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,550
that angle is called the specular angle.

451
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,390
Cause speculum is the
Latin word for mirror,

452
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,670
right?

453
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,260
So, so, so you're,

454
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,800
you're bound to get reinforcement at the
specular angle and you know that from

455
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,090
having looked at mirrors,

456
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,783
okay?

457
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,330
Now suppose there were another
electron on that same line or plane,

458
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,460
okay? For the same reason,
it's guaranteed to be in phase.

459
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:35,550
So everything on that plane will scatter
in phase at that particular angle.

460
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,630
They'll all reinforce one another.

461
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,250
So all electrons on a plane perpendicular
to the scattering vector scatter in

462
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:48,500
phase at the specular angle.

463
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,080
Now suppose you have a whole bunch of
electrons and you have to figure out how

464
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:58,820
they're going to reinforce or cancel one
another. There's a trick you can use.

465
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:04,210
You see if you can discern a set
of planes that are evenly spaced,

466
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,010
that contain almost all or almost all
of the electrons you're interested in.

467
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,650
Okay?
Now if you look at this pattern,

468
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,690
you can see that there's a set of planes
equally spaced that passes through all

469
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:23,700
of them.
Can you perceive it

470
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,900
there?
Okay,

471
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,870
there are three electrons on the
first plane, four on the second,

472
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:32,430
two on the third,
one on the fourth.

473
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,573
Okay.

474
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,280
Now, why is that handy? Okay,

475
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:44,180
so there's the scattering vector
perpendicular to these planes and all the

476
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:48,680
electrons on any one plane.
We'll scatter in phase with one another.

477
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,080
Okay, so, so it's as if there were a
single electron three times bigger, right?

478
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:58,250
Or four or two or a one on those success
a planes because they're all going to

479
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:59,660
be in phase with one another.

480
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,040
So we could pretend they're all
at one point on any given plane.

481
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,180
Okay,

482
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,180
so now all we have to worry about is
the phase relationship from one plane to

483
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:10,710
the next.

484
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,880
Fixed at that.
Yeah.

485
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:19,090
If they were in phase from one plane
to the next as well as on the planes,

486
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,920
then everything will be in phase.

487
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,220
You'll get really bright reflection
coming out of that scattering angle.

488
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,913
Okay.

489
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,660
Now,
so let's think of,

490
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,680
so it's as if we had these collected
electrons all lying on the scatter in

491
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:38,880
vector and we want to know whether
they're in phase with one another. Okay?

492
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:42,440
So here's light that comes in and out
at a certain angle from the first one,

493
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,860
three electrons worth of scattering from
that. The ones that were on that plane.

494
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,770
Okay.
And four from the second plane.

495
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,980
Now are the three and the four
in phase with one another.

496
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,400
What condition would have to apply in
order for those to be in phase with one

497
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,960
another?
They have different path lengths,

498
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,370
but if the paths differ by an
integral number of wavelengths,

499
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,060
then they'll be in phase with
one another and reinforce, okay,

500
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,740
so there's the path difference in red.

501
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,170
If that happens to be
suppose the wavelength of the
light and the angle of the

502
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:27,340
scattering, which Oh, also
determines that path differences.

503
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,350
You can see suppose that the wavelength
and the angle are such that that happens

504
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:37,070
to be one wavelength. Okay, so
those are in phase with one another.

505
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,360
All seven will be scattering together.
Right.

506
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,250
How about the next one with two electrons?
How about its phase?

507
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,290
What was the condition we
talked about up here at the top?

508
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,560
Evenly spaced.
So what do you know about the next one?

509
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,320
It's going to be in phase two
two ways behind the first one,

510
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,820
right? It'll be two wavelengths behind
the first one. Exactly. At some angle.

511
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:16,460
Right? And the next one will
be three wavelengths behind.

512
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:20,210
So all these electrons are going to be
scattering in phase at that particular

513
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:24,560
angle. So you get a really strong
reflection coming out, right?

514
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,550
It'll be as if it were all the angle,

515
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:30,320
all the electrons working together.

516
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,090
So the net in phase scattering is 10
as if there were 10 electrons doing the

517
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:36,920
scattering.
That's great.

518
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:42,460
Right now suppose that the first
path difference instead pose,

519
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,690
you had a different wavelength
or a different angle.

520
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,720
So the first between
the three and the four,

521
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,620
suppose the difference in
path was half a wavelength.

522
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,240
Then how would it differ?

523
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,560
How about between the
first and the second?

524
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,730
We send the first and the second where
they exactly cancel and get zero.

525
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,190
But Ah, there are three in the
first and four in the second,

526
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,470
right.
So you got,

527
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,540
you got plus three but minus four.

528
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,590
How about the next one?
Speak up gang

529
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:25,390
plus two and the last one minus
one and what's the net scattering?

530
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,860
Zero.
Okay,

531
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,450
so you can see how this is a neat
trick to work. If you can see in the,

532
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,930
in the pattern a of planes which
will contain the electrons,

533
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,220
then you can figure out a particular
direction how strong the scattering would

534
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:45,054
be.

535
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,760
Now we're going to do an experiment
and it requires the room to be dark.

536
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,040
And so I'm going to start turning the
lights off and asked Philip to get into

537
00:35:56,041 --> 00:36:00,600
position to do stuff in
the dark here. Uh, okay.

538
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,310
And turn this one off.
Okay.

539
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,650
Now I'll show you first what we're
going to do. So pull out the, uh,

540
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,340
the little thing there.

541
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,190
And there's a laser that's focused
right here, but it's too bright,

542
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,250
right? Cause the other things
we're going to see are very dim,

543
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:23,880
which is why we have turned the lights
off. So I'm going to put this black tube,

544
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,160
there was a little hole in the end.
Hopefully I can get it physician.

545
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:31,200
So most of the laser will go inside
here and we won't see it very well.

546
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,500
Positions, right? It's a moving
target, so it's not so easy.

547
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,660
Okay.
Now,

548
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,850
so here's the view from the ceiling.

549
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:57,380
There's the screen and this laser is
coming from the back of the room and

550
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,330
hitting the screen right here.

551
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,693
Okay.

552
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,120
Now what Philip is going to do is
put things called defraction masks,

553
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:11,860
which are just slides 35 millimeter
slides and he's going to put them in the

554
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:14,650
path of the light.
And this is,

555
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,680
and that's the distance from
Phillip to here is 10.6 meters.

556
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,640
Okay. I measured it. Okay. And

557
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,170
so put,
put it on the first slide please.

558
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,330
And see this,

559
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,220
those are all deflections
at different angles.

560
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,120
And what's doing the scattering
is a slide that looks like this.

561
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,100
Okay. A bunch of jail window. Right.

562
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,540
Okay.
So it's what it's giving is a row of dots.

563
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,800
Now I'm going to ask Phillip to
do two things here. First, uh,

564
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,970
first rotate the slide around this axis.

565
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:02,020
So rotate it like this. What do you
think will happen? Right? You see, right,

566
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,880
it's perpendicular to the direction of
the row of spots is perpendicular to the

567
00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:11,680
direction of the lines. Okay? And now I'm
going to ask him to do something else.

568
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm going to ask them to
twist the slide like this,

569
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,950
which changes the effective
distance between the these.

570
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:22,480
And notice what happens is he
makes them closer twisting.

571
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:26,350
It makes them look closer together,
right? What happens to the spots?

572
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:32,560
Does that surprise you?
That's that reciprocal relationship.

573
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:36,850
When things get closer
together, the angles get, okay.

574
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,120
Now things are going to get a darker here.

575
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:43,150
So I'm going to do some things

576
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,610
and that out and also get the room light.

577
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,190
Uh, well no, I, I want to show
you something here first. Okay.

578
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,860
So I'm going to show
you what I'm going to,

579
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,130
what the masks are going to be and then
we'll show you the effect from the masks.

580
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,780
Okay. So the next, uh, so here's a
question for you to work for homework.

581
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,710
What is the spacing of the
lines on Phillips slide?

582
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,500
How far the bars in the jail window
apart on that slide in order to give a

583
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:20,340
spacing, uh, here, oh, I did the wrong

584
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,320
premature with that.
In order to get that 10.8 spacing,

585
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,350
pen 0.8 centimeter spacing here at a
distance of 10.6 meters with 63 nanometer

586
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,510
wavelength light.
Okay.

587
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,710
You can use that to find the distance
between the bars on his slide.

588
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,570
And I want you to do that
cause if you can do it,

589
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:45,010
then you understand how this works. Okay.
But the next one he's going to show,

590
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,140
not yet,
but he'll put it in,

591
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,550
is one that's a similar
spacing but of pairs of lines.

592
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,840
There's a pattern being
repeated pairs of lines. Okay.

593
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,730
And then he's going to go to a
whole bunch of hexagons of dots,

594
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,440
which we will call benzene,

595
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,000
but it's not exactly like benzine would
be a benzene gas because they're all

596
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:11,570
oriented exactly the same way.
Right? So it's oriented benzene.

597
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,940
That's the next one
we're going to look at.

598
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,570
And then we're going to look at this one,
which is also oriented benzene.

599
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,770
Can you see the difference in the pattern
between the one on the top and the one

600
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:25,090
on the bottom?
Those red lines are a hint

601
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,390
in the bottom there all pairs of
hexagons that are distributed randomly.

602
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:36,280
We're at the top of their
individual ones now.

603
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,840
Then he's going to show you this one.
How is that different?

604
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:46,930
It's core tenets of hexagons. And
finally he's going to show you this one,

605
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,000
which is a crystal of hexagons.
And in a crystal,

606
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:56,980
they will truly would be oriented.
Okay. And then we're going to the, the,

607
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:58,420
uh,
the PS,

608
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:03,421
the Raci stoss at the end of this sound
and light show is going to be that.

609
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,900
You know what that is?

610
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,420
It's a light bulb filament that he's
going to hold up in the path of this.

611
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,540
So a helix, okay, now,

612
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,670
now we're ready to do
the trick. So we'll, uh,

613
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,790
we'll do that and do this.

614
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,920
And if you had a laptop open, you'll
need to close it because we've got it.

615
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,200
It's not very bright.
So we have to make it as dark as possible.

616
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,520
And I have to find my way back
there and close my laptop.

617
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,710
Okay, you're ready to fill up. Okay,

618
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,770
so first it's got to
be pairs of jail bars.

619
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,980
So how does it look different
from what we saw before?

620
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,330
It's the same kind of dots,

621
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,430
but their intensity is modulated.
They're not just evenly just,

622
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,230
they're not just all the same or slowly
dying away as you move out to right or

623
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:04,490
left, they come in a pattern.
Okay. Now let's do the next one.

624
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,920
This is the one that's, that's
uh, that's benzene, right,

625
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:14,410
but randomly random collection of benzene.
So how would you describe that?

626
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,630
It looks like the snowflake. I got
gotta. Oh, my laptop has, come on,

627
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,400
go figure putting things to cover
the lights up here in a wallet.

628
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,390
Okay. Okay, so it's a snowflake.

629
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,320
Now we're going to look at
pairs of pairs of benzenes.

630
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,000
How is it different still the snowflake,

631
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,190
but their bars across it.
Everybody see that?

632
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,400
Can we stop the green blink back
there or puts up in across it?

633
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,620
That's good. Okay. Now we're
going to do quartets of benzenes.

634
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,550
How's that look?
How would you describe that?

635
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,900
It's now got bars going
in both directions, right?

636
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,290
Not just horizontal Lloyd, but also
vertical. They're actually vertical.

637
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:22,130
I'm not quite, okay. Now
the lattice of Benzenes

638
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,430
in that great.
So it takes the same,

639
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,820
it's the same underlying pattern,
the snowflake,

640
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,970
but it concentrates all the light.

641
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,040
That would have been spread out into very,
very fine points.

642
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,770
Remember when you,
when it was just payers,

643
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,510
we put bars across but it was the same
amount of light coming out so that it got

644
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:54,530
focused sort of. And when we have a
whole lot as he gets fabulously focused,

645
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,740
I can see things quite far out from the
middle here because I'm so close to the

646
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:02,810
screen, I'll hold my hand up
but you can't see my hand.

647
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,610
They go way out. So that's
what, that's what a crystal is.

648
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,820
The crystal picks the same underlying
pattern that comes from the molecule and

649
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:19,160
focuses it into intense points at many,

650
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:21,110
many angles and that,

651
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,170
so it's like looking at the
scattering from a single molecule,

652
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,200
but looking at it through a peg board.
Do you have, you know what a pegboard,

653
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,750
is it a tool shop?

654
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:38,751
You use the put put a pegboard up as a
piece of a mason EIT or something that

655
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:39,900
had holes in it.

656
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,620
It regularly and you could put little
hooks in it to hang your hammer in your

657
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:46,500
saw and whatnot.
So it's as if you have,

658
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,460
you're looking through such a
pegboard at that underlying pattern.

659
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,700
And now we're ready for the PS,
the resistance, which is the,

660
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,550
the light bulb filament,
which is hard to see.

661
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:01,560
This is why we really needed the lights
out we needed for the snowflake too,

662
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:05,550
because it was so, so what do you
see from a light bulb filament?

663
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,920
You see an x,
right?

664
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,230
People in the back seat,

665
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:17,370
the x and their dots
along the arms of the x.

666
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,420
Okay,
so that does it.

667
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:23,460
You can open your laptops
again now and we'll,

668
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,260
uh,
try to get some lights back on.

669
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:30,110
Sorry for straining your eyes.

670
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,100
This one up. Sorry. Here we go.

671
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,870
Okay. So there's, there is the scattering
from these things and we can, uh, now,

672
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:52,940
so let's try to, oops. Uh,
let's try to understand it.

673
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:58,340
So this was the slide with randomly
positioned but oriented benzenes.

674
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:03,730
It turns out that random positioning
generates the same diffraction as a single

675
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:07,490
pattern, but gives it more intensity.
If we just put one hexagon there,

676
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:11,090
you wouldn't have seen enough from it.
Okay?

677
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,660
So here's the pattern you
got from isolated benzenes,

678
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,260
which is that snowflake pattern,
right?

679
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:23,360
And when we, uh, when we
had a lattice made to those,

680
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,880
you saw the same underlying pattern,
but only at little,

681
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,850
only at regularly spaced spots that had
to do with how far apart the hexagons

682
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:36,680
were from one another, right? Uh, and uh,

683
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,580
and much more intense because all the
light that would be scattered all over the

684
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:45,080
screen here is focused in those
little dots. Okay? Now the,

685
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:49,970
and the thing that generated
this snowflake was benzene
or what we're calling

686
00:46:49,971 --> 00:46:52,370
benzene, the hexagon. Okay.

687
00:46:52,371 --> 00:46:56,600
Now can you see what we
need in order to understand,

688
00:46:56,601 --> 00:47:00,080
what do you look for in order to see what
directions we'll give you a scattering.

689
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,720
Ah, sorry, I was having
so much fun. We went over.

690
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,660
So we'll talk about this next time.
Thanks.
