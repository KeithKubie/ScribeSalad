me in particular is you also have an

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:02.020
me in particular is you also have an
 

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.050
me in particular is you also have an
elite in Pakistan based on trade and

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:04.060
elite in Pakistan based on trade and
 

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.850
elite in Pakistan based on trade and
industry but you have an elite in

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:05.860
industry but you have an elite in
 

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.130
industry but you have an elite in
Pakistan that is perhaps more dependent

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:08.140
Pakistan that is perhaps more dependent
 

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.800
Pakistan that is perhaps more dependent
on land then in Bangladesh and you also

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:10.810
on land then in Bangladesh and you also
 

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:12.600
on land then in Bangladesh and you also
have an elite in Pakistan that is maybe

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:12.610
have an elite in Pakistan that is maybe
 

01:20:12.610 --> 01:20:14.790
have an elite in Pakistan that is maybe
an older elite by but by that I mean

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800
an older elite by but by that I mean
 

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.620
an older elite by but by that I mean
multiple generations whereas in

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:16.630
multiple generations whereas in
 

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:17.820
multiple generations whereas in
Bangladesh it is sometimes

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:17.830
Bangladesh it is sometimes
 

01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:19.890
Bangladesh it is sometimes
second-generation but very often first

01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:19.900
second-generation but very often first
 

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.900
second-generation but very often first
generation and I just wondered if this

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:21.910
generation and I just wondered if this
 

01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:23.220
generation and I just wondered if this
is relevant at all for the quality of

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:23.230
is relevant at all for the quality of
 

01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:25.140

that's justified because the frontier is

you have completely new kinds of

01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:43.100
you have completely new kinds of
 

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:43.670
you have completely new kinds of
concerns

01:22:43.670 --> 01:22:43.680
concerns
 

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.740

if it's a crime is there a punishment

01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:45.750
if it's a crime is there a punishment
 

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:48.650
if it's a crime is there a punishment
for it right because the popular notion

01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:48.660
for it right because the popular notion
 

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.720
for it right because the popular notion
does not seem to have an idea of you

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:50.730
does not seem to have an idea of you
 

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:52.190
does not seem to have an idea of you
know the victim actually inflicting

know the victim actually inflicting
 

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.010
know the victim actually inflicting
punishment so so that's the kind of

01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.020
punishment so so that's the kind of
 

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.430
punishment so so that's the kind of
concern that that your presentation

01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440
concern that that your presentation
 

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.410

it's it's a question of the state being
 

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:20.000
it's it's a question of the state being
fundamentally the actor and what you

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:20.010
fundamentally the actor and what you
 

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:22.160
fundamentally the actor and what you
have described in terms of these areas

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:22.170

even today in Pakistan you seem to be

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:24.930
even today in Pakistan you seem to be
 

01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:27.140
even today in Pakistan you seem to be
suggesting that this is a concern of the

suggesting that this is a concern of the
 

01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:31.220
suggesting that this is a concern of the
state largely okay because even there

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:31.230
state largely okay because even there
 

01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:33.320
state largely okay because even there
you could presumably have the kinds of

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:33.330
you could presumably have the kinds of
 

01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:34.940
you could presumably have the kinds of
things that yes means talking about you

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:34.950
things that yes means talking about you
 

01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:36.860
things that yes means talking about you
could have killings and so on so forth

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:36.870
could have killings and so on so forth
 

01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:39.140
could have killings and so on so forth
