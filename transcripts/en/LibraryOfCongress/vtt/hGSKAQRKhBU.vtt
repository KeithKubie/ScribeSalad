00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Could I
have your attention please?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.720
We're going to start the second
half of our Literacy Conference.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.130
So I hope you all enjoyed your
lunch and I'm happy to report

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.530
that we are on schedule now.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.360
So thank you for your patience.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.820
Okay. Our next panel
is developing

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.040
and sustaining readers
across the lifespan.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.420
And our moderator for this
panel is Joshua Cramer

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.700
who is the Vice President
of the National Center

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.460
for Families Learning
which was also a Library

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.380
of Congress Literacy
Awards winner.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.840
Thank you, Joshua.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840
[ Clapping ]

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.700
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer: Hello,
good afternoon everybody.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.260
This is kind of a tough
gig right after lunch.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.870
[Laughter] And also you don't
know it till you get up here

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.280
but there aren't any clocks.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.120
So hopefully we can keep this
on schedule but thanks a lot,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.420
Guy, for -- [inaudible].

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.720
So I'll be looking down
occasionally but first,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.640
let's start by just giving
another round of applause

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.510
for this morning's panelists.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.430
[ Clapping ]

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.870
And as a fellow panel leader,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.350
I have to commend especially
the second panel who found a way

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.090
to add 45 additional minutes.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.690
So hopefully we won't have
to do that but we'll see.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.390
My name's Josh Cramer and I
have the opportunity to serve

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.000
as the Vice President
of the National Center

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.410
for Families Learning.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.540
And today we're going
to have a discussion

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.840
around how we could develop

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.280
and sustain readers
across a lifespan.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.200
And lucky for you, you
don't have to listen to me

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.720
for the entire 45 minutes.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.780
I have with me a very
talented panel of individuals

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.210
who have lived and worked in
this space for many, many years.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.830
And also I might add, all
have this common thing

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.260
of an entrepreneurial spirit
and I hope some of that comes

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.650
across in our discussion.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.940
Before we get into the real
meat of what it means to develop

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.090
and sustain readers
across a lifespan,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.160
I wanted to talk just
briefly about NCFL.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.470
It truly is an honor
to wake up each morning

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.430
and read our mission statement
that says that we are trying

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.730
to eradicate poverty

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.420
by leveraging family
based education solutions.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.540
And our President and founder,
Sharon Darling, 30 years ago,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.960
discovered through her work as
an adult literacy instructor

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.690
in Kentucky and in
specifically in Appalachian,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.650
Eastern Kentucky, that in order
to truly get at the root issues

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.020
of helping families
climb out of poverty,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.460
we had to build both
adult literacy skills

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.640
and child literacy skills, and
bring them together to learn.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.390
And luckily what she found out
through her own cardiac research

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.360
or what she knew was right in
her heart has been confirmed

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.480
through three decades of
research now that we can look to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.840
and performance that tells us

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.950
that family literacy is truly
a way to make great gains

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.700
for the families who
need it the most.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.410
This is what gets me
out of bed every morning

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.140
and it really is the
root of developing

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.750
and sustaining readers
across a lifespan.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.880
At NCFL, we know that
the genesis of reading

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.560
and literacy happens the moment
that a child hears her mother

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.370
or father or caregiver
say words to them.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.230
And hopefully that's
through reading.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.250
From there, we reinforce
those activities and we hope

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.590
that by creating

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.770
that intergenerational
reading experience,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.170
that we create lifelong learners
for all children and families.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.750
And here today, we've heard
many of the dire statistics

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.370
about low literacy,
illiteracy, and the things

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.470
that those horrible parts
of our society bring as far

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.760
as putting barriers in place
for families to be successful.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.490
And that's something we're
very concerned about at NCFL

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.000
but I didn't want to focus
more on the topic of reading

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.760
which is one way we
practice literacy, of course.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.530
And we all know that reading
builds background knowledge

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.500
and it helps us learn and we
can actually access society

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.780
through the process
of reading but some

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.730
of the other things I was
interested to find out --

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.530
some of you probably know this.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.280
But reading regularly
can reduce stress.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.800
It can keep your brain
sharp until later adulthood.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.000
There are even a few studies
that say it may protect

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.460
against dementia in older
adults by 3 to 7 years.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.350
Just reading throughout
a lifetime.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.640
You sleep better when
you read regularly.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.380
It increases empathy which
was mentioned before.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.460
And I think that's
something that's very serious

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.760
at this point in our society.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.790
We could definitely benefit
from some more empathy.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.310
It can ease depression.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.040
And my personal favorite
that I found

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.650
in my quick research was it can
actually cultivate your ability

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.800
to read minds.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.920
[Laughter] So just
imagine what a group

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.870
of literacy professionals
can do when we learn how

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.480
to read minds better and
get people to do what it is

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.760
that we want them to do.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.400
So with that, we're going to go
ahead and begin our discussion.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.270
And our first panelist
here directly to my left,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.160
you have their full bios in
your program is Mike McGuffee

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.750
who is the CEO of
Unite For Literacy.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.570
We have Louise Baigelman,
the Co-Founder

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.250
and Executive Director of Story
Shares, Christopher Lehman,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.290
Founding Director of the
Educator Collaborative,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.000
and Dustin Holland, Vice
President of Better World Books.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.230
So I think my microphone
works if I sit down here.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.510
When we talk about
reading and developing

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.470
and sustaining readers
across a lifespan,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.070
of course we're beginning in the
youngest years as I mentioned.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.250
And Mike, I would like to
just start with you talking

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.960
about your work and what
you think is most important

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.740
in the early years.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.540
&gt;&gt; Mike McGuffee: So we
have been doing this work --

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.420
I've been doing this
work forever.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.660
Maybe about three decades
and I've done a lot

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.670
of work in Indian country.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.140
And what I realized
in doing that work was

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.480
when I felt was the fundamental
problem was access to books

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.770
which then I developed
a formula just

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.820
like Stephen [phonetic] thinking
about what is the formula

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.210
for this and we look at this now

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.690
as a problem that's
-- it's three parts.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.470
It's -- it is access but
you also have to have access

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.150
to relevant books and
then that's not enough.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.110
You have to have engagement
around those books.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.350
So it's access, relevance,
and engagement

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.540
to me is the way I frame a
problem and think about it.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.230
And with access, our company
has developed a definition

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.920
for what we consider to be
the deserts or book scarcity.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.070
We've actually mapped
the United States

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.630
down the census track using NAP
[phonetic] data and census data.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:40.170
And we think that 75% of
the United States has homes

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.670
with less than 100 books.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.660
And that's a staggering number

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.380
and we're actually rebuilding
our map so that we can see --

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.200
so that you working in your
communities can interact

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.250
with that map.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.650
The next thing is relevance.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.580
And there's lots of ways
to think about relevance

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.370
but one is there's more than
200 languages that are spoken

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.000
in the United States,
indigenous and immigrant.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.860
And so we need to figure out
how to create greater relevance.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.690
So in our library, we
have an online library

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.020
for emergent readers essentially
and we write the books

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.240
in English but we
also narrate them.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.690
Right now, our narrations are
getting close to 40 languages.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.110
We're doing a project with
the [inaudible] River Indian

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.640
Community South of Phoenix
where they're writing books

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.360
that celebrate their
culture and language.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.810
Over a four year
period, we're trying

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.540
to write 100 little
emergent books with them.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.960
And then we're trying to
get 100 of those books

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.750
into the homes across
the community.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.910
So relevance is an
important piece.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.740
And then last is engagement.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.660
And it's one thing to get
books into kids' homes

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.360
but it's another
thing to inspire them

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.240
to become lifelong readers.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.770
And we find that is really
challenging for us to think

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.190
about the -- we talked --
this morning about a culture

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.820
of literacy, a culture
of reading.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.370
It's nurturing a
culture of reading

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.520
in the communities
where we work.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.840
So that engagement
piece is really --

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.550
has really been interesting
to us.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.610
We looked at NAP data and
found something amazing.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.930
The interesting thing
about NAP is

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.610
that they have been
surveying kids forever

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.210
with two questions
that we found useful.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.230
One they ask how many books
do you have in your home?

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.490
And two, they ask how often
do you choose to read for fun?

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.450
And when you take those two
questions and analyze them,

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.110
what we found was that
if you have 0 to 10 books

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.930
and you never read, about 7% of
that population is proficient

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.140
in reading in the eighth grade.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.970
When you have 100 books and you
have a daily habit of reading,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.480
about 70% of those kids are
proficient and the pattern

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.810
across that as you add books,
it improves but you have

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.920
to have books and reading.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.960
People say to me all the time,
it has to be more than books.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.230
And the answer is yes, it is
more than books because it has

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.700
to be that those kids read them.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.920
So when we look at the
kids that have 100 books

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.220
and they say never read.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.920
Their scores aren't that great
but when they have 100 books

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.290
and they read everyday
it matters.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.460
So we've looked at this and
kind of made our formula

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.060
about access, relevance,
and engagement.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.390
The last thing is for when we
think about sustaining readers

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.470
across a lifetime, I
think we have to look

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.500
at our educational system as
a complex adaptive system.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.760
We have to look at
this as a system

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.190
and Donnelle Meadows [phonetic]
who's a great system --

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.820
was a great systems thinker
said if you really want

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.790
to impact the system, you
got to look at the purpose.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.480
And not what the
stated purpose is,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.890
what's the behavior
of the system?

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.870
What I think is going on is that
we have to have a higher purpose

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.080
in our system than
grade level reading.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.580
We have to have a higher
purpose in our system

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.540
than kindergarten readiness.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.370
And actually the title

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.700
of our talk is probably
a much greater purpose.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.070
What would happen if our
educational system thought

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.400
about this and said how do we
sustain readers over a lifetime?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.220
What if we measured that?

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.540
What if we really thought about
how do you get kids excited

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.740
about reading and
keep them reading?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.470
So how do we think
about it is start early.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.300
And we think Frank Smith
once said it's this simple.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.750
Get a book in a kid's hands that
they want to read and can read

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.800
and when they finish
get another.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.420
So in some ways,
it's that simple.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:08.220
In the complex way, it's we've
got to look at our schools,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.210
our communities as systems,
and starting having more

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.970
of a systems perspective.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.270
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer: Thanks, Mike.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.600
And Louise, if I can I
would like to ask you

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.290
and probably Chris as well just
to move us along the lifespan

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.470
and talk a little bit about
the middle school grades,

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.040
the high school grades, what are
those things that we could do

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.360
to sustain and develop readers?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.660
&gt;&gt; Louise Baigelman: Yeah.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.830
So thank you so much
for having me here.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.560
It's an honor to be here.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.010
Again, I'm Louise Baigelman.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.440
I am the former literacy
specialist and English

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.200
as a Second Language teacher

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.140
and now I run an organization
called Story Shares.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.330
We're focused on teen readers.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.950
So the students that have
kind of gotten beyond the age

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.250
where we're typically focused

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.040
on reading instruction still
reading below grade level.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.560
Those who struggle
with reading, you know,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.590
in late elementary school,
middle school, high school,

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.560
and I'm actually going to touch
on a lot of the very same things

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.630
that Mike just talked about and
also that came up this morning

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:07.090
but as they apply to the teen
reader phase of the lifespan.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.570
So with engagement being
really the key piece to if --

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.310
you know, we all
know that in order

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.710
to become a stronger reader, you
have to read and that in order

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.240
to read meaningfully,
to actually read deeply,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.540
and make meaning from text,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.050
you have to be engaged
with the reading.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.730
And so the key factors that
play to that engagement are

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:34.140
as Mike said relevance
and also choice.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.280
And I know that came up a
lot this morning as well.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.480
So we need to be able to provide
teen readers who are struggling

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.380
with reading with books
that they can connect to.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.540
Books that are culturally
relevant for a diverse,

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.210
wide range of readers where
they can really see themselves

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.570
reflected in the books
that they're reading.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.050
And books that are relevant
to their age and interests.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.920
So books where they can
read about other characters

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.580
who are their own age, who are,
you know, dealing with things

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.150
that they're dealing with.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.090
And then choice which again
came up a lot this morning.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.170
That it's one of the biggest
factors in reading meaningfully

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.610
and that a huge number
of students report

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.530
that they cannot
find enough books

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.040
that they actually like to read.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.790
And so these, you know, two
pieces, relevance and choice,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.920
become actually, you know,
a unique challenge on a lot

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.340
of levels when you look at
the teen reader audience

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.710
that is struggling
because if you are 12 or 16

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.870
and you're reading at a
first or a third grade level,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.950
you're never going to be
excited by books written

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.230
for first or third graders.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.530
Books that are written

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.710
for elementary school
students are never going

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.010
to be interesting to you.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.080
Not only will they be boring
and kind of totally irrelevant

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.820
to the things you're working on
and thinking about in your life

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.040
but also embarrassing to
read in front of your peers.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.150
And so, you know,
how do we address

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.620
that piece of the problem?

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.770
How do we provide enough choices
that these students can find

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.960
that they can like to read
whether it's late elementary

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.100
school, middle school,
or high school or beyond.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.210
And, you know, we know that
it's a huge number of students

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.320
who fit into this category.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.330
It's tens of millions
in this country alone.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.760
So this problem just from a
personal standpoint is one

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.220
that I experienced as a teacher.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.060
I was a middle school teacher
in Lynn, Massachusetts.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.190
And most of my teaching
as English

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.320
as a Second Language
as I mentioned.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.380
Most of students were from the
Dominican Republic or Haiti

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.130
and they were, you
know, sassy and witty

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.530
and mature middle
school students but a lot

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.890
of them were reading at first
and second grade levels.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.910
And one of my biggest
challenges was, you know,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.210
access to choices for them.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.550
Even as the teacher who is
actively pursuing options

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.140
that I could offer them
that would engage them

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.460
in reading so that they'd read.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.760
So that they'd improve.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.920
I just couldn't find enough
books to offer a range

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.930
of choices that they
would want to read

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.230
and that they could read.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:07.590
And so, just to touch briefly
on Story Shares and what we do.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.980
We are focused on
finding kind of new ways

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.710
to generate more choices.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.690
More of these books
that are relevant

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.040
to older students
aged interests,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.800
culturally relevant for
diverse, you know, learners,

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.720
that are accessible and
approachable in both format

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:31.310
and also language at a range
of much lower reading levels.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.350
And so doing, giving
readers books that will kind

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.730
of hook them and give them
the positive associations

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.050
with reading that we all have
and kind of help to erase some

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.570
of those negative ones.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.210
And so what we do
is we actually tap

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.620
into the community of writers.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.510
We crowd source these
books by providing --

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.160
we do an annual writing
contest and we provide guidance

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.140
and incentives and an awareness
campaign to get writers

00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.280
and educators to contribute to
this new collection of books

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.580
to submit their own stories.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.070
And then we use those stories.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.510
We curate them and have them
become part of the collection.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:12.440
And again, what we -- you
know we all know to be true is

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.190
that when we can find that
experience with a book,

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.530
that spark of something that
starts with what we love,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.710
what we care about already,
what we connect with,

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:26.850
whether it's you know,
baseball or food or gossip.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.080
That we can start to really --

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.560
sometimes it literally just
takes the one book to realize

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.100
that this is not something --

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.050
you know it's not
that I'm not a reader.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.120
It's just that I hadn't -- as
come up, I haven't found books

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.460
that really speak to me.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.630
And so what we see
and what we know is

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.560
that once we can offer
these students choices

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.070
that are meaningful to
them that they can read,

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.410
that kind of destigmatize
their experience with reading,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.880
not only are they reading
more but also they're talking

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.060
about the books that
they're reading more.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.340
You know we love hearing from
teachers about, you know,

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.480
you read a new book and then
this is a student who's maybe

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.560
so reluctant and has
struggled so much with reading,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.030
after they have an experience
with the book that they love,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.330
they say could we
talk about this?

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.160
You know I want to tell
you about what I read.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.330
And also can I have
other books like this?

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.600
And not only do they
inspire students to read more

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.900
but also to actually to write.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.560
We know that sometimes
you can be so inspired

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.580
by something you've
read that you even want

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.880
to kind of write your own.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.520
Whether it's an adaptation
of that

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.100
or something inspired
by or a sequel.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.470
And so kind of focusing
on generating

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.200
and distributing more books
that are really relevant

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.090
to a wide range of students
while also being approachable

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.990
to really hook them and then set
them on path of being readers.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.290
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer:
Thanks, Louise.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.590
Chris?

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.890
&gt;&gt; Christopher Lehman: And
what Louise and I were talking

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.330
about this conversation,
one thing we also touched

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.820
on was just the shame
that can come

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.220
for you being an adolescent
reader who is carrying

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.740
around a book that's Judy Moody

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.090
or something that's not
appropriate for your age level.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.710
And that's both from the
community that you build

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.010
or don't have in your classroom

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.200
but that affects the
child as well too.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.250
So I come to this
conversation from K12 pedagogy.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.900
That's been my experience
nearly working on two decades

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.940
of working as a classroom
teacher

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.570
and then supporting
educators as well.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.050
I'm also honored to serve
on the board with NCFL.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:34.090
And so one conversation
that we often have at NCFL

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.350
with the education work group
that we support with them

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.010
and just in my work in general,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.530
at the secondary level is
just looking at this pattern

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.180
that continues to play out
where there's kind of two things

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.480
that happen at the same time.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.220
One is we see this slump in
test scores or in performance

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.680
when kids hit middle school
where students are growing,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.880
growing, growing across the
elementary years and then

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.100
when we hit secondary there's
like something happens.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.570
And so many districts have
questions around that.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.320
You equally like
with the NAP data,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.620
Common Sense Media organization
has also done some surveys,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.820
longitudinal surveys
around this as well.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.270
You see students at the
same time reporting out.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.610
You can almost correlate
them against each other

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.190
that as there's a slump
in secondary performance,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.420
there also are kids who
are reading less and less

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.450
as you move up through years.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.510
And so I say this with love
because I'm an educator myself

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.040
and I love the field
that we're in.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.530
One challenge for the
literacy community to look at

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.060
and address is that -- to really
be partners with and support

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.630
around is that any teacher
and the vast majority

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.940
of teachers are working
hardest with so little and with

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.040
so much negative attention from
the press and everywhere else.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.480
But every teacher is using to
their best of ability the tools

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.330
and knowledge that
they already have.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.520
And there's a tremendous gap
in both professional learning

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.400
for teachers of high quality

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.390
and in pre-service
teacher education programs

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.610
around literacy specifically
especially

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.060
at the secondary level.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.580
So what you have are
teachers who are often times

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.690
with their full heart
teaching in the way

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.700
that they remember being taught
when they were a kid whether

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.940
that worked for them and
their fellow peers or not.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.130
And often times, it doesn't.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.500
And so one challenge we have is

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.720
around choice is also moving
ahead the conversation

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.080
around practice at
the second level.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.500
We know from numerous
school sites and districts

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.110
that independent reading at this
level is booming and beautiful

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.670
and can grow an entire
communities.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.850
And really shift everything
from test scores to how students

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.040
and families feel about school.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.800
The challenge is there
are so many classrooms

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.830
and so many progress through
all those grade levels

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.300
that become based on
just single books.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.160
So Penny Kiddle who's
an educator and writes

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.790
for the Educator, she
often says, you know,

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.830
here we are especially at this
time right now where there's

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.740
such a boom of middle grade
and young adult literacy

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.360
where we are surrounded
by this endless library

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.660
of incredible books.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.960
Here we are at the
Library of Congress.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.120
This incredible library of
amazing books and too often

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.020
in our pedagogical practices, we
boil those down to four or five,

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.050
one perhaps that we all
have to read together.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.030
And whether that matches your
reading level or your relevance

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.150
or you care about it or not,
this is what we'll do together.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.780
So one place that we can really
work is to take the research

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.160
and energy that we all have
in this room and beyond,

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.420
and continue to tell the
story of these practices

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.840
with our older students
and with educators

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.210
at upper levels as well.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.220
And also to consider if
your program focuses more

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.370
specifically at younger grades,

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.590
so much of your practices
translate up.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.210
It really is the types
of texts that you use

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.610
but the practices are
inherently the same.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.080
That really is a place that
your organization can look.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.620
Can we support older students?

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.560
We absolutely can because
it's kind of the same work.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.380
Then equally that's
one area to focus.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.590
Another that feels important
because of where we are

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.340
and because we can see
Congress if we just look

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.220
out that window right
there is just to echo --

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.850
I really appreciated Dr. --

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:07.240
I mean I appreciate
everything Dr. [inaudible] does.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.210
It was just awesome
to be in the same room

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.140
but his earlier comments around
poverty, poverty, poverty.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.830
I think we also have to lay
that what goes above that,

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.370
the kind of larger capsule
over poverty, poverty,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.410
poverty is just the
systemic oppression, racism,

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.940
the way that our society allows
some people to reach poverty,

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.390
and some people not to.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.330
And some classrooms to be
funded and some not to.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.190
So one thing that our
organization works really hard

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.420
to do and just want to
suggest as something for all

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.590
of our organizations to
continue do or to consider

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:43.360
if we don't already, whether
you're non-profit or public,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.030
is when our families and
students are in jeopardy

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.660
or in need, we have
to find a message

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.500
and support around that as well.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.540
Because we can support a
reader who is deported.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.000
We can't support a reader
who's family is not allowed

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.120
into the country because
of their religion.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.020
We can't support a reader
who doesn't feel safe

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.810
in their classroom because
they have a food shortage.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:13.020
And one thing that we've
done in our organization,

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.320
the Educator Collaborative,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.840
and continue do is really
first working on our approach

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.070
and the way that we enter
communities but also to continue

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.360
to speak out when our students
and families need those too.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.600
So thinking about when is the
time to talk, it was probably

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.250
like 10 years ago but
when things come up,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.550
that's another form

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.680
of supporting our secondary
learners is making sure

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.300
that we're supporting their
safety and their livelihoods

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.960
and their family's
safety as well.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.010
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer: Thanks, Chris.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.890
Dustin, one of the themes
that we've heard today

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.690
and in other conversations
around reading

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.860
across a lifespan is the
importance of book availability.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.240
And I know this is something
that you care deeply about.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.860
So if you could speak just a
little bit to book availability

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.210
and how that impacts
reading across the lifespan.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.510
&gt;&gt; Dustin Holland: Yeah, sure.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.810
Thanks, Josh.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.050
And first, I'd like to
thank everybody in the room

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.940
for what you're doing to
promote lifelong learning

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.570
and especially creating
our future customer base.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.830
So we really appreciate it.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.700
But at Better World Books
we believe in the power

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.380
of knowledge and our purpose
is to share and distribute

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.920
that knowledge around the world.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:27.730
And my personal goal is to
collect over a billion books

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.230
and keep a billion
books out of landfills

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.270
and keep them in
the reuse cycle.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:37.960
So to date, we've kept over 300
million books out of landfills

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.640
in about six countries.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.730
We've sold over 75 million
books and shipped those books

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.580
to customers in over
200 countries.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.620
Along the way, we've been able
to donate 25 million books

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.690
to countries all over the world,

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.840
organizations all
over the world.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.720
Some of you in this room
have been recipients

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.340
of either book donations
or monetary donations.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.900
We just recently hit the
$27 million mark in terms

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.530
of money that's been donated
to literacy organizations

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.510
or libraries around the world.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.680
So we're really proud of what
we do at Better World Books.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:20.060
Our 500 employees are spread out
in four distribution centers.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.890
We work with approximately 4,000
libraries in North America.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.790
Globally we have 8,000 book
suppliers that send books to us.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.450
And we're taking those books
and either reselling them online

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.930
on one of the 30
different marketplaces

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.540
that we sell through.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.230
Anytime we sell a book
on BetterWorldBooks.com,

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:42.780
we're donating a book.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.510
So it's kind of like
Tom's Shoes.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.600
It's a book for book program.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.980
And if we can't donate the book,
we're going to keep the book

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.580
out of the landfill
and recycle it.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.870
So at any given point,
we've got 8 million books

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.170
for sale on our website.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.350
We're processing about
a million books a week

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.400
from those 8,000
supply partners.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.880
And we're doing everything
that we can

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.220
to increase the availability
of books globally

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.060
and we're just very
thankful to be here today.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.360
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer:
Well, thanks Dustin.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.470
And just to throw
another question your way.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.160
You know with all of
your diverse experiences

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.320
across the world, are there any
stories from the book giveaways

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.210
or anything that you would want
to share with the group today?

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.510
&gt;&gt; Dustin Holland: Sure.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.490
We have a lot of stories
as you can imagine.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.230
I've been with the
company about 15 years.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.530
Some of those stories

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.920
if I shared them I
would get in trouble.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.550
When I first started
with the company,

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.850
none of us were married.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.150
None of us had kids.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.570
And thankfully, a lot of us
are married now and have kids

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.960
and have calmed down
a little bit.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:52.030
But a lot of great stories
over the years but probably one

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:58.730
of my most recent favorites
is a book mobile that --

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.440
Better World Books is
a for-profit company

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.790
but we had a supporter
of the company

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:07.940
that donated a book mobile
to us about a year ago.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.530
So through this book
mobile, we've been able to go

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:17.040
out into the community and
we show up at a school,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.200
prescheduled visits, and kids
come out from the classroom.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.520
They board the book mobile.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.820
We call it Wordsworth
[phonetic].

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.290
Holds about 3500 books.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.160
And the kids get on the book
mobile and they can pick

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.990
as many books as they
want from the book mobile.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.930
So I think we've donated
a lot of books to a lot

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.050
of organizations
around the world

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.420
but actually doing it ourselves
with the book mobile has kind

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.750
of made it a little more
tangible to us as opposed

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.090
to us donating, you know,
hundreds of thousands of books

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.410
to an organization and
we're not on the ground

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.710
to help distribute those books.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:56.450
So to be able to see the kids
jump for joy and trade books

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.860
and sometimes they
fight over books,

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.470
it's really, really powerful.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.790
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer: Thank you.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:07.250
For the rest or panel, if you
could share what you think

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.400
or some of what you think
might be the biggest mistakes

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.610
that we could make along
the way as we try to develop

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.920
and sustain readers
across a lifetime

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.830
and I mean I could
start with you, Chris.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.610
Maybe we'll just
come back this way.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.910
&gt;&gt; Christopher Lehman: Sure.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:22.020
I mean I guess one -- I was
kind of touching on in terms

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.740
of pedagogy but it can really
be for anyone is trying

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.350
to over prescribe --
okay I'll [inaudible] --

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.910
I'll go for it this way.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.250
I think there's two extremes.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.500
One is to over prescribe
the sorts of reading

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.390
that we'd expect secondary
students to do instead

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.610
of allowing choice
but there's --

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.270
perhaps that is equally
dangerous

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:46.150
but also a consideration is
that as students are aging

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.250
and the amount of complexity
and texts that are around them,

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.900
we also have to pair
that independent reading

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.570
and lots more reading time

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.630
with really thoughtful
responsive instruction as well.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.510
So that our students are --

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.310
we're meeting them
where they are in terms

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.610
of their literacy development

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.410
but then we're adding
instruction on top of that.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:08.520
As I think was mentioned earlier
today, one thing that plays

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.200
out across the entire U.S.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.850
when it comes K12 education is
really a student's reading level

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.510
becomes the ceiling for
which they will perform

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.810
on standardized tests.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.910
And these aren't just
tests of literacy.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.900
These are tests in
social studies and science

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.200
and other content areas too

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.200
because every test is
ultimately a test of reading.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.500
Can you read the instructions?

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.800
Can you read through it?

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.040
So a student who is reading far
below grade level is not going

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.990
to pass most tests.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.290
They will perform far
below grade level.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.870
Students that are approaching
grade level as readers tend

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.750
to approach grade
levels as readers.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.930
You can give students --
you can do running records

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.230
or give them some sort

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.630
of reading assessment just
before a standardized assessment

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.260
and the two will line up.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.840
What becomes more of a challenge
is as students are then reading

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.870
at or above grade level, that
becomes kind of the opportunity

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.770
but it's then their ability to
think critically on top of that

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.390
that becomes equally important.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.420
So I think one challenge
is not --

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.620
one, finding the right
balance between those two.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.070
Like providing expert
instruction while not

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.370
over prescribing it.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.030
And then just to briefly say,

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:16.470
I think the other is not
providing enough opportunity

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.040
for educators and in a
larger community conversation

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.130
in literacy as well
to really collaborate

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.180
and communicate together.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.190
We know that increasingly
the amount of PD dollars,

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.680
professional development dollars
but just the amount of time

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.480
that educators have during the
day to collaborate and talk

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.630
about instruction in many
districts just increasingly

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.310
shrinks as money gets
put in other places.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.160
So creating that
time to communicate

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.920
and collaborate together which
when I think about the variety

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.520
of partnerships and
organizations here to also think

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.000
about ways that you
can invite educators

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.850
from a school that's local

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.320
to where ever your
organization operates

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.420
to be a part of that as well.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.120
Educators are in this
field because they care

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.520
so deeply about your kids.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.210
They will show up
at the laundromat.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.270
They will go wherever
you invite them to go

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.810
with almost no pay,
if no pay at all.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.200
They just need the
invitation and to really know

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.830
that that opportunity is
going to help their kids.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:20.050
Educators, we call our students
kids because they are our kids.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.690
We really feel that
way about them.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.280
So I think providing more
opportunities for collaboration

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.660
with your local schools
and educators within it.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.940
If we don't do that as the
problem, if we do it supports.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.240
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer: Thanks, Chris.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.540
Louise? Mike?

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.140
Things to add about
mistakes that we could make.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.440
&gt;&gt; Louise Baigelman: Sure.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.490
Yes. I think right alongside
kind of over prescribing

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.900
that one of the mistakes
that we can make

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.440
and that well intentioned
parents

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.380
and educators sometimes
mistakes is over judging

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.180
around what students
are reading.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.790
So when we talk about choice
which again we've talked

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.820
about a lot, it has to be
real, authentic choice.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.250
It can't be, you know, choice
but between these two books

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.960
or it has to be non-fiction.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.280
It really needs to be rigorous
at exactly your level or above.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.100
You know we -- or even
format or the type

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.400
of thing you're reading.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.700
Is that really something
you think,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.000
you know, that you should read?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.380
I think that we have a tendency
to push towards certain types

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.100
of books or certain
types of contents

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:28.050
and that's not a bad angle
but for students especially

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.120
in the teen, kind of middle
school, high school range

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.800
where judgment is a
very big part of life,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.100
having it be really
open around, you know,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.460
whether it's graphic novels
or comic books as we talked

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:44.720
about earlier or cookbooks if
you love food or blog posts

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.020
if that's something that --

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.790
we talk about as Story Shares
is any reading is good reading.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.270
And so audio books.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.510
You know reading is about
making meaning from text.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.810
So if you really struggle

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:59.440
with the text piece audio books
are a great place to start.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.710
Using that as a point
of entry as a hook

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.240
so that the student
can feel connected

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.450
to reading whatever the
format, whatever the topic.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.230
And then you can scaffold up
there and move towards kind

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.790
of the goal of whatever
higher level content is.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.190
I think that, kind of, we have
to avoid too much judgment

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.360
when really encouraging
students to engage with reading

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.600
and find a point of
connection with it.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.090
&gt;&gt; Mike McGuffee: I think
I'll build off of that.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.560
The -- I think the biggest
mistake that's going

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.660
on right now is we have a one
dimensional model of reading

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.700
in our educational system.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.760
And it's around proficiency.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.100
And I love the work of
Richard Ryan and Ed Deecy.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.040
They're two psychologists that
have self determination theory.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.490
And in their theory, they think

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:47.840
that what we're intrinsically
motivated to be is competent

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.240
at what we do, whatever it is,

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.390
autonomy is important,
and relatedness.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.090
So competence, autonomy,
and relatedness.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:02.810
If we had those three dimensions
in our literacy thinking

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.470
in schools, we would
value autonomy a lot more

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.680
and what they argue is that
when you have an over dominance

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.330
of one thing, you can
thwart the others.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:16.900
I think that's what's happening
because we have this, again,

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.810
if we don't have this
purpose that we want kids

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:22.410
to be avid readers
and lifelong readers,

00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:26.480
then we can start focusing
on grade level reading.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.750
Over dominance one dimension

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.360
of proficiency can cause
autonomy to be thwarted.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.200
It can also cause
relatedness to be thwarted.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.990
Lois said it earlier about
that reading is about identity.

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.620
It's about agency.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.720
Those are -- that's
autonomy and relatedness.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.820
And so I think we as educators,
we tend to talk to each other

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.880
and I think we need to branch
out and start looking at some

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.500
of these psychologists
and the systems thinkers

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.490
that can help us kind
of maybe reframe this.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.790
&gt;&gt; Christopher Lehman:
Can we also add to that?

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.230
So if third grade
guarantee is a mistake

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.640
that many states are
implementing the expectation

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.370
that by third grade, you
have to read a certain way

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.760
or you're held back or lots
of terrible things happen

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.100
to you along those same lines.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.400
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer: Absolutely.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.160
I have to admit there's
a little bit of bias

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.650
in this next question
coming from NCFL

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.510
but I think it's very
relevant for a lot

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.040
of folks who are listening in.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.500
What is your advice --

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.430
and I guess, Dustin,
we'll start with you.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.240
What's your advice for parents
and caregivers in their quest

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.880
to develop and sustain
readers across the lifetime?

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.180
&gt;&gt; Dustin Holland:
Go to the library.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.720
It's as easy as that.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.020
&gt;&gt; Joshua Cramer:
You guys hear that?

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.320
[Laughter] All right.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.630
All right.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.930
I have no other way to put this

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.950
but you have a big book
sitting underneath your seat.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.250
[Laughter] And since you're
talking about libraries,

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.170
I feel like you should tell us
a little bit about that book.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.470
&gt;&gt; Dustin Holland: Sure.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.660
And speaking of libraries
and literacy organizations,

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.190
I know another thing that
groups are always looking

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.650
for and that's money.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.510
So our grant program
is open right now.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.710
We're accepting applications
through May 31st.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.360
We've got $100,000 of grant
funding available right now

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.440
and our literacy
council will be going

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.980
through those applications right

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.770
after the period
closes May 31st.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.070
So please go

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.140
to cares.betterworldbooks.com
to check it out.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:26.140
In the meantime, I did speaking
of access, one of the things

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.440
that we're very proud

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.580
of is keeping books
in the reuse cycle.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.880
And --

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.090
